INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe proceedings relate to marginal or abandoned gas fields in Bangladesh which the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (the **Government**), the First Respondent, had decided to develop. In the course of this development Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (**Niko**), the Claimant, concluded on 23 August 1999 a Framework of Understanding with the Bangladesh Petroleum & Production Company, Limited (**BAPEX**), the Second Respondent.\n\n2.\n\nNiko conducted a Marginal Field Evaluation of three fields and, in a report of February 2000, concluded that two of them, the Chattak and the Feni fields, were sufficiently promising to continue with a work plan. Thereupon Niko and BAPEX, under the direction of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (the **Ministry**), negotiated a Joint Venture Agreement (**JVA**), which was concluded on 16 October 2003 with the approval the Government.\n\n3.\n\nThe development of the Feni field was successful and gas supplies from two wells in this field started in November 2004. BAPEX and Niko (the **Joint Venture Partners**) began to negotiate with the Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (**Petrobangla**), the Third Respondent, a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (**GPSA**). However, due to difficulties in reaching agreement on the price for the gas, the finalisation of the GPSA was much delayed. Eventually it was concluded on 27 December 2006 with the approval of the Government.\n\n4.\n\nThe Joint Venture Partners had delivered gas to Petrobangla already before the conclusion of the GPSA. They continued to do so thereafter. Petrobangla made some payments but Niko claims that much of the delivered gas remains unpaid. In the Request for Arbitration of 1 April 2010 Niko quantified the outstanding amount at US$35.71 million.1\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.6.\n\n5.\n\nDuring drilling in the Chattak field a blowout occurred on 7 January 2005 and another on 24 June 2005. The Government formed a committee to enquire about the causes of the blowouts and the damage caused. It concluded that Niko was responsible for the blowouts and estimated the damage caused by them. In May or June 2008 Petrobangla and the Government of Bangladesh commenced legal action in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, against Niko and others, seeking compensation on the order of Tk746.5 crore as damages for the two blowouts (the **Compensation Claim**). To the knowledge of the Tribunal, these proceedings are still pending.\n\n6.\n\nDuring the course of the negotiations for the GPSA the Claimant delivered on 23 May 2005 a car to the State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources; in June 2005 Niko Resources Ltd. (**Niko Canada**), the Claimant's parent company, invited the Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary. The delivery of the car became public knowledge in Bangladesh; the Minister resigned on 18 June 2005 and returned the car to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. Following an investigation in Canada, Niko Canada, on the basis of an agreed statement of facts, was convicted on 24 June 2011 and ordered to pay Canadian Dollars 9,499 million.\n\n7.\n\nThe present proceedings were started by two successive Requests for Arbitration, one filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or the **Centre**) on 1 April 2010 (the **First Request** or **RfA I**) and registered as ARB/10/11; the other filed with ICSID on 16 June 2010 (the **Second Request** or **RfA II**) and registered as ARB/10/18. The Claimant specified that the first of these requests concerned the Compensation Claim and the second the outstanding payments under the GPSA (the **Payment Claims**).2\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.10\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondents have objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID and this Tribunal on a number of grounds which shall be described and examined in further detail in this Decision.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal held preliminary procedural consultations on 14 February 2011 in Geneva, followed on the same day by a First Session during which the organisation of the proceedings in the two cases was discussed. It was agreed that the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner and that the two Tribunals may render their decisions in the two cases in a single instrument. In the present decision the two Tribunals therefore are referred to collectively as \"the Tribunal\".\n\n10.\n\nAt the First Session it was also decided that, in a first phase of the proceedings, the issue of jurisdiction would be considered and decided. The Parties produced written submissions and documentary evidence; witnesses were heard and oral argument was presented in a procedure described in further detail below.\n\n11.\n\nSome of the documentary evidence produced in the arbitration is in the Bengali language. In accordance with paragraph 10.1. of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session, the Party introducing such documents in the proceedings produced an English translation which accompanied the document. None of these translations were challenged during the course of the proceedings. The Tribunal therefore takes the produced English translation as correct and relies on it.\n\n12.\n\nDocuments issued by authorities in Bangladesh normally are dated according to the Bengali calendar, often with a corresponding date according to the Gregorian calendar. In the present Decision only the date according to the Gregorian calendar is given.\n\n**1.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe present dispute relates to two gas fields named Feni and Chattak (sometimes also spelled Chhatak) in Bangladesh. These two fields, together with the Kamta gas field, had been declared by the Government as \"Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields.\"\n\n22.\n\nBoth Chattak and Feni are vested in Bangladesh pursuant to Article 143 of Bangladesh's Constitution.\n\n23.\n\nThe Chattak field (located in Sylhet) was discovered in 1959 by Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (subsequently renamed Bangladesh Petroleum Ltd) and brought into production in 1960. It supplied local users and, from 1974, the Sylhet Pulp and Paper Mill. It was shut down in 1985 due to increased water production.7\n\nAdolph Statement [175], RfA I, Attachment A, citing '*Bangladesh Marginal Field Evaluation -Chattak, Feni and Kamta*' (February 2000) B-8, Annex B to the JVA.\n\n24.\n\nThe Feni field (located in Chittagong) was discovered by a predecessor of BAPEX in 1980. It was in production between 1988 and 1998.8\n\nIbid.\n\n25.\n\nBoth fields were at some point sold or transferred to BAPEX.9 Only the Feni field became productive again and delivered gas, which is the subject of the present arbitrations.\n\nImam Hossain, HT 2, 160-161.\n\n**3.

In addition to technical and commercial considerations the letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*Niko will support and follow the procedural requirement the Government of Bangladesh will require to privatise the marginal, non-producing fields. However, in order to ensure transparency, Niko proposes the following modality for finalising the proposed joint venture contract with BAPEX and putting the subject non-producing marginal fields on production:*\n\n*A.

The Procedure was submitted to the Prime Minister with a note from the Ministry, dated 6 June 2001.22 The Procedure formed the framework for the JVA, and when this agreement eventually was executed, was attached to the JVA as Annex C.23\n\nRfA II, Attachment I.\n\nThe Procedure is also described in Exhibit 18, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n35.\n\nThe Ministry directed the preparation of a joint venture agreement between BAPEX and Niko.

Referring to the Development Procedure, which at the time was \"awaiting the final approval of the Honourable Prime Minister\", it gave directions in the following terms:\n\n\"*2. In this situation in light of the draft procedure for development of Chatak, Kamta and Feni marginal and abandoned gas fields for urgent finalisation of the Joint Venture Agreement between Bapex and Niko Resource:*\n\n*(1) Write a letter to Niko Resource mentioning specific date for coming to Bangladesh and*\n\n*(2) After finalisation of the negotiation of Joint Venture Agreement between Bapex and Niko Resource, send the JVA to this ministry for approval of the government by 20/06/2001.*\"25\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 7, p. 510.\n\n37.\n\nPetrobangla passed on these directions to BAPEX on the following day, stating:\n\n*For urgent finalisation of the JVA between BAPEX and Niko Ltd in the light of the procedure mentioned in the draft procedure, it has been stated to (i) send invitation letter to Niko mentioning specific date and (2) upon completion of negotiation between BAPEX and Niko, the JVA to be sent to Ministry for approval of Government by 20.06.2001. You are requested to take urgent steps in this regard.*\"26\n\nExhibit 20, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n38.\n\nBy that time, a difference had arisen concerning the coordinates of the Chattak gas field. The difference was discussed at a meeting between BAPEX and Niko intended for finalising the JVA. The difference was not resolved at that meeting, but the Parties agreed that \"*other than the issues under discussion herein all other issues, terms and conditions in the Negotiated Draft JVA June 2000 have been agreed to between BAPEX and Niko subject to final approval from BAPEX management*\".27\n\nExhibit 21, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1; neither the 2000 draft nor any other draft of the JVA seems to have been produced.\n\n39.\n\nAn opinion of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs was sought. Once this opinion had been obtained, the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources wrote to Petrobangla and BAPEX, indicating the precise coordinates of the Chattak gas field and gave the following directions:\n\n\"*(b) In order to finalise the draft Joint Venture Agreement, Petrobangla should adhere to all the conditions mentioned in the Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields approved by the Ex-Prime Minister on 14-062001 and other relevant rules-regulations, and requested to send the draft Joint Venture Agreement to this division.*\"28\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 7, p. 513; the division concerned is that for Energy and Mineral Resources.\n\n40.\n\nThe JVA continued to be discussed at the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. After a meeting at the Ministry on 16 September 2002, Petrobangla received a letter from the Ministry dated 25 September 2002 which it passed on to BAPEX and requested it \"*to send the proposed JVA arising from the Minutes of the Meeting held at the Ministry held on 16.0.2002.*\"29 The Respondents have produced a series of other letters from the Ministry and from Petrobangla which show that Petrobangla turned to the Ministry for directions which it then passed on to BAPEX.30\n\nExhibit 26, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\nSee in particular Exhibits 27, 28, 29, 30, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n41.\n\nOn 18 March 2003 a proposal seems to have been submitted to the Prime Minister concerning the JVA. Referring to the approval of this proposal by the Prime Minister, the Minister wrote to Petrobangla on 11 October 2003 with copy to BAPEX stating the following:\n\n\"*2.

Some of these clauses are particularly relevant for the jurisdictional issues which the Tribunal has to address. They deserve to be quoted *in extenso*, emphasis being added:\n\n\"*WHEREAS*\n\n*1. All mineral resources including Petroleum within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh are vested in the Republic of Bangladesh, and*\n\n*2. **The Government has**, under the Bangladesh Petroleum Act 1974 (Act No LXIX of 1974) (as amended up to date) **the exclusive right and authority to explore, develop**, exploit, produce, process, refine and market **Petroleum Resources** within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh **and it has also the exclusive right to enter into Petroleum Agreements** with any persons for the purpose of any Petroleum Operations, and*\n\n*3. **Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights****and powers of the Government to explore, develop,** exploit, produce, process, refine, market petroleum in the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh and also to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any person/company for the purpose of any Petroleum Operation, and*\n\n*4. **OPERATOR [i.e. the Claimant]** made a request in 1998 to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Govt. of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to develop Marginal & Non Producing Gas Fields of Bangladesh.*\n\n[...]\n\n*12*. *BAPEX is vested with all rights free from all encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever to assign, develop, produce, process, refine and distribute 100% (One hundred percent) of all Petroleum resources from or with within the territory of the Marginal/Abandoned gas fields of Chattak & Feni* [\u2026]\n\n*14.* *BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from Petrobangla and the Government **the requisite approvals** to execute this JVA. The **responsibilities****and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government** in all relevant Articles, Annexes and Amendments under this JVA **has been assign** [sic] **to Bapex***.\"\n\n45.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the JVA reads as follows:\n\n\"*Article 18. Disputes and arbitration*\n\n*18.1 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle amicably through consultation any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this JVA or over an impasse in any decision of the JMC.*\n\n*18.2 If any dispute mentioned in Article 18.1 has not been settled through such consultation within ninety (90) days after the dispute arises, either Party may, by notice to the other Party, propose that the dispute be referred either for determination by a sole expert or to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*18.3 Following the giving of notice under Article 18.2 the Parties may, by mutual agreement, refer the dispute for determination by a sole expert to be appointed by agreement between the Parties.*\n\n*18.4 As an alternative to the procedure described in Article*\n\n*18.3 and if agreed upon by the Parties, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration by an agreed Sole Arbitrator.*\n\n*18.5 If the Parties fail to refer such dispute to a sole expert under Article 18.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 18.4, within sixty (60) days from giving of notice under Article 18.2, such dispute shall be referred to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") and the Parties hereby consent to arbitration under the Treaty establishing ICSID. If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over such dispute, the dispute shall be finally settled by International Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n*18.6 Arbitration pursuant to Article 18.4 shall be by an arbitration tribunal consisting of three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall designate a third arbitrator. If one of the Parties does not appoint its arbitrator within sixty (60) days after the first appointment or if two (2) arbitrators, once appointed, fail to appoint the third arbitrator, the relevant appointment shall be made in accordance with the rules of ICSID.*\n\n*18.7 The arbitrators shall be citizens of countries that have formal diplomatic relations with both Bangladesh and Canada and any home country of the entities comprising OPERATOR, and shall not have any economic interest in or economic relationship with the Parties.*\n\n*18.8 The Sole Arbitrator or the arbitration tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules of ICSID. However, if the above mentioned arbitration rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Article 18, including the provisions concerning appointment of arbitrators, the provisions of this Article 18 shall prevail.*\n\n*18.9 The English language shall be the language used in the arbitral proceedings.

However, the origin of the arbitration clause in the GSPA, which is practically identical to that in the JVA, was subject to extensive discussion at the hearing, leading the Tribunal to find that it had its origin in a draft prepared by Petrobangla.33\n\nSee below Section 3.4.\n\n47.\n\nIn the absence of any argument or evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration clause in the JVA also originated from Petrobangla. Given the chain of control recorded in the Preamble to the JVA and evidenced in the account of the negotiations, it also must be concluded that, together with other instructions from Petrobangla the wording of the arbitration clause was passed on from Petrobangla to BAPEX and thus formed the basis for the JVA negotiations with Niko.\n\n**3.2 The JVA and its arbitration clause**\n------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe JVA's \"Whereas\" clauses present important elements relating to the context in which it was concluded and the function in which BAPEX acted when it entered into this agreement. Some of these clauses are particularly relevant for the jurisdictional issues which the Tribunal has to address. They deserve to be quoted *in extenso*, emphasis being added:\n\n\"*WHEREAS*\n\n*1. All mineral resources including Petroleum within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh are vested in the Republic of Bangladesh, and*\n\n*2. **The Government has**, under the Bangladesh Petroleum Act 1974 (Act No LXIX of 1974) (as amended up to date) **the exclusive right and authority to explore, develop**, exploit, produce, process, refine and market **Petroleum Resources** within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh **and it has also the exclusive right to enter into Petroleum Agreements** with any persons for the purpose of any Petroleum Operations, and*\n\n*3. **Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights****and powers of the Government to explore, develop,** exploit, produce, process, refine, market petroleum in the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh and also to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any person/company for the purpose of any Petroleum Operation, and*\n\n*4. **OPERATOR [i.e. the Claimant]** made a request in 1998 to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Govt. of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to develop Marginal & Non Producing Gas Fields of Bangladesh.*\n\n[...]\n\n*12*. *BAPEX is vested with all rights free from all encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever to assign, develop, produce, process, refine and distribute 100% (One hundred percent) of all Petroleum resources from or with within the territory of the Marginal/Abandoned gas fields of Chattak & Feni* [\u2026]\n\n*14.* *BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from Petrobangla and the Government **the requisite approvals** to execute this JVA. The **responsibilities****and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government** in all relevant Articles, Annexes and Amendments under this JVA **has been assign** [sic] **to Bapex***.\"\n\n45.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the JVA reads as follows:\n\n\"*Article 18. Disputes and arbitration*\n\n*18.1 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle amicably through consultation any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this JVA or over an impasse in any decision of the JMC.*\n\n*18.2 If any dispute mentioned in Article 18.1 has not been settled through such consultation within ninety (90) days after the dispute arises, either Party may, by notice to the other Party, propose that the dispute be referred either for determination by a sole expert or to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*18.3 Following the giving of notice under Article 18.2 the Parties may, by mutual agreement, refer the dispute for determination by a sole expert to be appointed by agreement between the Parties.*\n\n*18.4 As an alternative to the procedure described in Article*\n\n*18.3 and if agreed upon by the Parties, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration by an agreed Sole Arbitrator.*\n\n*18.5 If the Parties fail to refer such dispute to a sole expert under Article 18.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 18.4, within sixty (60) days from giving of notice under Article 18.2, such dispute shall be referred to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") and the Parties hereby consent to arbitration under the Treaty establishing ICSID. If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over such dispute, the dispute shall be finally settled by International Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n*18.6 Arbitration pursuant to Article 18.4 shall be by an arbitration tribunal consisting of three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall designate a third arbitrator. If one of the Parties does not appoint its arbitrator within sixty (60) days after the first appointment or if two (2) arbitrators, once appointed, fail to appoint the third arbitrator, the relevant appointment shall be made in accordance with the rules of ICSID.*\n\n*18.7 The arbitrators shall be citizens of countries that have formal diplomatic relations with both Bangladesh and Canada and any home country of the entities comprising OPERATOR, and shall not have any economic interest in or economic relationship with the Parties.*\n\n*18.8 The Sole Arbitrator or the arbitration tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules of ICSID. However, if the above mentioned arbitration rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Article 18, including the provisions concerning appointment of arbitrators, the provisions of this Article 18 shall prevail.*\n\n*18.9 The English language shall be the language used in the arbitral proceedings.

However, the origin of the arbitration clause in the GSPA, which is practically identical to that in the JVA, was subject to extensive discussion at the hearing, leading the Tribunal to find that it had its origin in a draft prepared by Petrobangla.33\n\nSee below Section 3.4.\n\n47.\n\nIn the absence of any argument or evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration clause in the JVA also originated from Petrobangla. Given the chain of control recorded in the Preamble to the JVA and evidenced in the account of the negotiations, it also must be concluded that, together with other instructions from Petrobangla the wording of the arbitration clause was passed on from Petrobangla to BAPEX and thus formed the basis for the JVA negotiations with Niko.\n\n**3.3 The negotiations of the Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nUpon conclusion of the JVA, Niko commenced work on the development of the two fields. The first well in the Feni field which it sought to develop was Feni-3. It tested water instead of gas in 17 of a total of 19 zones.34 However, towards the end of the first semester 2004 gas production was considered imminent.\n\nExplanations contained in Niko's letter to the Ministry of 7 August 2004 (year erroneously shown as 2002), Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 475 and paragraph 3 at p. 476.\n\n49.\n\nNiko wrote to Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, with copy to the Ministry, having as reference \"Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) for the Feni Gas Field\". The letter explained that a skid-mounted gas plant was to arrive on 1 June and the Feni-3 would be put on production in July 2004. The letter continued:\n\n\"*We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the subject agreement so that Feni-3 can be on production as soon as the gas plant is commissioned.*\n\n*We understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the \"Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields\" as approved by the Honorable Prime Minister, the gas price of the Investor shall be negotiated between the Government, Petrobangla, and the Investor. Moreover, Article 24.3 of the Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the Buyer of the gas from the Feni Gas Field shall be Petrobangla or its designee.*\n\n*In view of the above, we request a meeting with the authorised representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and Bapex to initiate the process to execute the subject agreement so that Feni-3 well could be on production at the earliest.*\"35\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 494-495.\n\n50.\n\nOn 6 June 2004, Petrobangla requested Niko to submit a proposed GPSA for the Feni Gas Field.36 Niko responded on 14 June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that work on Feni-4 was advancing and that the gas plant was expected to be in place and commissioned in time for producing gas from these two wells by early August 2004. The letter was accompanied by a draft for the GPSA.37\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 492.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 492. The draft GPSA is not attached to this Exhibit.\n\n51.\n\nFurther to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July 2004,38 a committee was formed \"*to negotiate for finalisation of gas pricing of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO*\". The Committee, described here as the Gas Pricing Committee, was composed of a representative of the Ministry in the function of Convenor39 and representatives from Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko.40\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 482.\n\nMr Ehsan-ul Fattah, identified as \"Addl. Secretary, Petroleum & Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources, GOB, Dhaka\".\n\nFor a list of members and observers see Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 485.\n\n52.\n\nThe first two meetings of the Committee took place on 24 July and 4 August 2004 under the chairmanship of the Convenor. The minutes of the two meetings are drawn up on the letterhead of the Ministry.41 They record that Niko requested a price of US$2.75/MCF. At the end of the discussion \"*the Chair offered Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at US$1.75/MCF, since Niko signed the JVA considering this price*\". Niko stated that it would respond later.42\n\nMinutes produced at Claimant's Exhibit 6.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 482, 484.\n\n53.\n\nNiko answered the proposal by a letter to the Additional Secretary in the Ministry on 7 August 2004, insisting that the gas price which it demanded was reasonable and justified. It suggested consultations on the economics of the Feni development.\n\n54.\n\nGas delivery started on 2 November 2004, without agreement having been reached on the price and without a contract having been executed.\n\n55.\n\nOn 7 January 2005, the first blowout occurred, followed by another on 24 June 2005, as will be discussed in further detail below in Section 3.6.\n\n56.\n\nOn 14 February 2005 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that the \"*trial production period has ended. Our gas plants have been commissioned. We now find ourselves in an extremely difficult position with our management and board to justify and continue gas production from Feni without finalisation of the price of our share of the gas.*\" It required an immediate interim payment for the gas delivered from November 2004 to January 2005 at the rate of US$2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas price within the next ten days, failing which it would suspend gas production from the Feni field.43\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 471.\n\n57.\n\nPetrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it \"*would make a lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from November, 2004 to January, 2005*\" without prejudice to the rate to be agreed.44 On 10 March 2005 Petrobangla announced that it had \"*arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time being to you on a lump sum basis*.\"45 Niko confirmed its receipt as \"*lump sum partial payment for Niko's share of gas production for November, December and January*\".46\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 472.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 470.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 479.\n\n58.\n\nIn a letter of 10 March 2005, BAPEX referred to the letter which Niko had addressed to the Ministry on 9 March 2005 of which it had received copy. BAPEX relied on Article 16.1(c) of the JVA which identified as an event of default if \"[a]*ny of the party indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of Bangladesh*\" and required Niko to withdraw the notice of suspension of gas production \"*or else we would be constrained to take all necessary steps under the JVA to up hold the interests of the country*\".47\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 470.\n\n59.\n\nFurther meetings by the Gas Pricing Committee were held. After a meeting on 16 March 2005 Niko wrote to the Ministry, to the attention of the Minister himself, summarising its understanding of the differences. The letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the final result of the Committee's deliberations may be that we will not reach a consensus on the price. He further opined that it is possible that the Committee will have to conclude its deliberations with a report to the Ministry that a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko acknowledged that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this conclusion be arrived at as soon as possible so that other avenues for concluding the price agreement could be pursued. Mr Osman [the Chairman of Petrobangla] suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the Government of Bangladesh for a final decision.*\"48\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 480.\n\n60.\n\nDuring these negotiations Niko ordered the car which then was delivered on 23 May 2005 to the State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources and, in June 2005, Niko Canada invited the Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary, followed by the Minister's resignation on 18 June and the return of the car to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. These events will be considered in further detail in Section 9.2.\n\n61.\n\nThe Gas Pricing Committee continued its work and held its final meeting on 23 October 2005.49 It issued a report entitled \"Committee Report on Feni Gas Pricing\"; the report is not dated but the signatures of the members show the dates of 25 and 26 October 2005. At the beginning of this report the members of the Committee were identified in two columns, on the left the \"Officials from Government\" and on the right \"Officials from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd\". The Officials from the Government were the Additional Secretary of the Ministry in the position of the Convener, the Chairman and a Director of Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX. In the report these members were referred to collectively as \"members representing GOB\", as \"GOB Team\" or using similar expressions referring to them collectively. The report concluded as follows:\n\n\"***Committee's recommendation:***  \n*The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of pricing of gas to produce from Feni field. The matter, therefore, remained unresolved.*\n\n*The members representing Government side recommend that the Niko's share of gas from Feni filed under the terms of JVA may be purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price of US$1.75/MCF.*\"50\n\nCommittee Report, p. 4 at Claimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 460-463.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 460, 463.\n\n62.\n\nNiko made comments to the Convener which it requested to \"*be included as part of the Minutes*\" of the 23 October 2005 meeting, presumably the Committee report just quoted. These comments were to the effect that \"*if the Committee could not reach a consensus on the matter of gas pricing that the next stage should be to pursue an arbitrated settlement of the matter*\". It announced that it \"*will therefore suggest to the GOB this solution to move forward on the matter*\".51\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 432, 433.\n\n63.\n\nIn a letter to the Ministry dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred to Article 18.3 of the JVA and proposed that the gas price determination \"*be referred to a sole expert to arbitrate*.\"52\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 452, 453.\n\n64.\n\nThis proposal was not accepted and the matter remained unresolved.\n\n65.\n\nBy 24 November 2005 no agreement had been reached on the gas price and the GSPA, but Petrobangla had made interim payments to Niko in a total amount of US$4 million.53 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that as of 28 November 2005 it would suspend gas production from the Feni Field pending \"*mutual resolution*\" of the gas price, the agreement and execution of a GPSA and \"*settlement of arrears for gas sold to date from the Feni Field.*\"54 Petrobangla responded on the same day, requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend deliveries. It concluded: \"*If you are still determined to do so that will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall be constrained to act accordingly.*\"55\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 427; confirmed by Niko at Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 424.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 429.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 428.\n\n66.\n\nFollowing a letter from Niko dated 26 November 2005, postponing the start of suspension to 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote that it was restrained from making further payments by an order of 16 November 2005 of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of which it quoted the following passage:\n\n\"*Since the order retraining the respondents 1.9 from making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of any gas field or any other account passed by the High Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate Division that order shall continue.*\"56\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 420\n\n67.\n\nNevertheless Petrobangla insisted that deliveries should not be suspended. It stated that it expected the GPSA could be \"*completed within a month or two*\".57\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 421.\n\n68.\n\nOn 29 November 2005 a meeting between Niko representatives and Mr Mahmudur Rahman, Energy Advisor of the Ministry, took place at the Ministry. Niko wrote to him on the same day, thanking him for the meeting and requesting \"*full support of your Ministry and the Government of Bangladesh to assist us in having the ad-interim order of the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 stayed as they apply to stopping the government from making payments to NRBL*\".58\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 409.\n\n69.\n\nOn the same day, 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote to Niko:\n\n\"*Please be informed that the purchase price of gas of the Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF.*\n\n*We hereby invite you to negotiate the terms of the GPSA for the production of Feni Gas Field, finalise, agree and execute the same based on the above price*.\"59\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 419.\n\n70.\n\nNiko responded on 30 November 2005, stating its disagreement with that price and reiterated its proposal to settle the difference by reference to a sole expert. On an interim basis, it accepted payment on the basis of US$1.75/MCF. It requested a meeting \"*wherein discussions can proceed on the GPSA and agreement on appointment of the sole expert can be reached*\".60\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 415-416.\n\n71.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 Niko confirmed that it accepted payment of US$1.75/MCF on an interim basis until determination by the proposed expert. It sent the draft for an interim GPSA to BAPEX. Further drafts were sent by Niko to BAPEX on 14 and 20 December 2005.61\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 369, 370.\n\n72.\n\nOn 16 January 2006 Niko announced to BAPEX the temporary reduction and shut down of production from the Feni field.62 It also seems to have made such announcements to Bakhrabad Gas Systems Ltd (**BGSL**). BAPEX objected to this communication in a letter of 19 January 2006, stating *inter alia* :\n\n\"*In our opinion this sort of unilateral decision and message to BGSL is a violation of JVA article no 24.3 since Petrobangla is the only authority & agent of GOB [i.e. the Government of Bangladesh] that purchases, sells, monitors and controls the transmission and distribution systems of gas in the country.*...\"63\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 368.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 366.\n\n73.\n\nOn 18 January 2006 a meeting apparently took place between the \"Advisor, Energy & Mineral Division\" of the Ministry and Niko, followed on 19 January 2006 by a meeting between Niko and Petrobangla. As a follow-up to these meetings, Niko sent on 22 January 2006 to Petrobangla and BAPEX what it described as the \"final version\" of the Interim GPSA, already initialled by Niko.64\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 357-365.\n\n74.\n\nThis version was not executed. Instead, a meeting between Niko representatives and the Advisor, Energy & Mineral Resources Division, at the Ministry took place on 12 February 2006. The meeting was followed by a letter from Niko to the Advisor dated 13 February 2006 in which it stated that the Advisor's \"*confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the Prime Minister's Office to allow us to proceed with our work was concerning*.\".65\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 341.\n\n75.\n\nAt a meeting on 14 February 2006 Petrobangla requested Niko to increase production from the Feni field;66 the request was confirmed on 20 February 2006. On 26 February 2006, Niko announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime Minister, the Ministry and others, that as from 27 February 2006 it planned to shut down all gas production from the Feni field \"*until further notice*\".67\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 334.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 333.\n\n76.\n\nPetrobangla objected to the decision in a letter of 28 February 2006. It added:\n\n\"*We are carefully scrutinising the draft GPSA you have submitted and our response to the same shall be communicated to you in due course. If the shut down has any connection with finalisation of the GPSA, it appears to be unnecessary at this point of time when negotiations even have not started*.\"68\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 332.\n\n77.\n\nIn a letter to Petrobangla of 2 March 2006 Niko provided explanations for the shutdown, referring in particular to the absence of an approved Work Programme and Budget and of a GPSA.\n\n78.\n\nPetrobangla replied on 5 March 2006 requesting that gas production resume. The letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*(c) As you have rightly mentioned earlier the gas price under the JVA is a matter of common understanding of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and the investor. Failure to reach any unanimous price decision, cannot be arbitrated/determined by any sole expert under the GPSA of any kind, since GOB is not going to be party to that. The truth of the matter is price negotiation under the JVA is not to be done at the time of GPSA negotiation neither it could be agreed that the GPSA negotiation has been started at the time Price Committee was made because that had been started independently. We now have a draft GPSA submitted by you. We are ready and willing to start negotiation on that. Feel free to contact us.*\"69\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 319 and 320.\n\n79.\n\nMr Brian Adolf, at that time Country Manager for Niko,70 explained at the hearing that the draft to which reference is made in this letter was the start of a new series of drafts. It differed from that which Niko had submitted in 2004. Since Mr Adolf commenced his activity as Country Manager for Niko only in January 2005, he was not familiar with the 2004 draft.71\n\nC-MJ.1, Appendix A, expected evidence of Mr Adolf, paragraph 160.\n\nHT 2, pp. 189, 190.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to Mr Adolf, when the attempt to reach an interim GPSA had failed, Niko invited Petrobangla as follows: \"*why do you not provide us what is your standard GPSA and we will work forward from there*\".72 In response Petrobangla provided a text in Word format which Niko used as the basis for a draft by reference to which all further negotiations were conducted. Mr Adolf explained: \"*We started from scratch with the format that Petrobangla had provided*.\"73\n\nHT 2, p. 190.\n\nHT 2, pp. 191, 193.\n\n81.\n\nPetrobangla, BAPEX and Niko met on 7 March 2006. The following day, on 8 March 2006, Niko wrote to Petrobangla and to Mr Jamaluddin in his function as Managing Director of BAPEX and \"Member Secretary of the Committee for Finalisation of Gas Pricing for the JVA\" that it was \"*in the process of finalising the DRAFT GPSA at the earliest except the fixing of the price*\"; Niko proposed determination of the price by an expert, and added:\n\n\"*Furthermore, we value the relationship we have with the Government of Bangladesh and considering the national interest Niko Management after having detail discussion with the Hon'ble Advisor for the Energy & Mineral Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production from Feni Gas Filed* [sic] *as a gesture of our goodwill*.\"74\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 308.\n\n82.\n\nThe GPSA was approved by the Government, acting through the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. On 20 December 2006 it addressed a letter to the Chairman of Petrobangla in the following terms:\n\n\"*You are informed on the above subject and reference that the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of Bapex with NAICO* [sic] *sent through abovementioned memo under reference has been approved by the government.*\n\n*2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to request you to take necessary action in the due pursuance of the existing rules and regulations on the above mentioned subject*.\"75\n\nRfA II, Attachment B.\n\n83.\n\nOn the following day, 21 October 2006, Petrobangla wrote to Niko and BAPEX, informing them that the Government of Bangladesh had \"*approved the initialled (31.07.2006) Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of Marginal Gas Field Feni*\".76\n\nIbid.\n\n84.\n\nThe GPSA was executed on 27 December 2006. It fixed a price of US$1.75 per thousand cubic feet of gas for the period of the agreement.\n\n85.\n\nMost of the correspondence referred to in this account of the events leading to the execution of the GPSA was copied by Niko and by Petrobangla to the Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources and, occasionally, also to the Prime Minister's office.\n\n**3.3 The negotiations of the Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nUpon conclusion of the JVA, Niko commenced work on the development of the two fields. The first well in the Feni field which it sought to develop was Feni-3. It tested water instead of gas in 17 of a total of 19 zones.34 However, towards the end of the first semester 2004 gas production was considered imminent.\n\nExplanations contained in Niko's letter to the Ministry of 7 August 2004 (year erroneously shown as 2002), Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 475 and paragraph 3 at p. 476.\n\n49.\n\nNiko wrote to Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, with copy to the Ministry, having as reference \"Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) for the Feni Gas Field\". The letter explained that a skid-mounted gas plant was to arrive on 1 June and the Feni-3 would be put on production in July 2004. The letter continued:\n\n\"*We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the subject agreement so that Feni-3 can be on production as soon as the gas plant is commissioned.*\n\n*We understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the \"Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields\" as approved by the Honorable Prime Minister, the gas price of the Investor shall be negotiated between the Government, Petrobangla, and the Investor. Moreover, Article 24.3 of the Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the Buyer of the gas from the Feni Gas Field shall be Petrobangla or its designee.*\n\n*In view of the above, we request a meeting with the authorised representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and Bapex to initiate the process to execute the subject agreement so that Feni-3 well could be on production at the earliest.*\"35\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 494-495.\n\n50.\n\nOn 6 June 2004, Petrobangla requested Niko to submit a proposed GPSA for the Feni Gas Field.36 Niko responded on 14 June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that work on Feni-4 was advancing and that the gas plant was expected to be in place and commissioned in time for producing gas from these two wells by early August 2004. The letter was accompanied by a draft for the GPSA.37\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 492.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 492. The draft GPSA is not attached to this Exhibit.\n\n51.\n\nFurther to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July 2004,38 a committee was formed \"*to negotiate for finalisation of gas pricing of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO*\". The Committee, described here as the Gas Pricing Committee, was composed of a representative of the Ministry in the function of Convenor39 and representatives from Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko.40\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 482.\n\nMr Ehsan-ul Fattah, identified as \"Addl. Secretary, Petroleum & Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources, GOB, Dhaka\".\n\nFor a list of members and observers see Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 485.\n\n52.\n\nThe first two meetings of the Committee took place on 24 July and 4 August 2004 under the chairmanship of the Convenor. The minutes of the two meetings are drawn up on the letterhead of the Ministry.41 They record that Niko requested a price of US$2.75/MCF. At the end of the discussion \"*the Chair offered Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at US$1.75/MCF, since Niko signed the JVA considering this price*\". Niko stated that it would respond later.42\n\nMinutes produced at Claimant's Exhibit 6.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 482, 484.\n\n53.\n\nNiko answered the proposal by a letter to the Additional Secretary in the Ministry on 7 August 2004, insisting that the gas price which it demanded was reasonable and justified. It suggested consultations on the economics of the Feni development.\n\n54.\n\nGas delivery started on 2 November 2004, without agreement having been reached on the price and without a contract having been executed.\n\n55.\n\nOn 7 January 2005, the first blowout occurred, followed by another on 24 June 2005, as will be discussed in further detail below in Section 3.6.\n\n56.\n\nOn 14 February 2005 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that the \"*trial production period has ended. Our gas plants have been commissioned. We now find ourselves in an extremely difficult position with our management and board to justify and continue gas production from Feni without finalisation of the price of our share of the gas.*\" It required an immediate interim payment for the gas delivered from November 2004 to January 2005 at the rate of US$2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas price within the next ten days, failing which it would suspend gas production from the Feni field.43\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 471.\n\n57.\n\nPetrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it \"*would make a lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from November, 2004 to January, 2005*\" without prejudice to the rate to be agreed.44 On 10 March 2005 Petrobangla announced that it had \"*arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time being to you on a lump sum basis*.\"45 Niko confirmed its receipt as \"*lump sum partial payment for Niko's share of gas production for November, December and January*\".46\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 472.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 470.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 479.\n\n58.\n\nIn a letter of 10 March 2005, BAPEX referred to the letter which Niko had addressed to the Ministry on 9 March 2005 of which it had received copy. BAPEX relied on Article 16.1(c) of the JVA which identified as an event of default if \"[a]*ny of the party indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of Bangladesh*\" and required Niko to withdraw the notice of suspension of gas production \"*or else we would be constrained to take all necessary steps under the JVA to up hold the interests of the country*\".47\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 470.\n\n59.\n\nFurther meetings by the Gas Pricing Committee were held. After a meeting on 16 March 2005 Niko wrote to the Ministry, to the attention of the Minister himself, summarising its understanding of the differences. The letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the final result of the Committee's deliberations may be that we will not reach a consensus on the price. He further opined that it is possible that the Committee will have to conclude its deliberations with a report to the Ministry that a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko acknowledged that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this conclusion be arrived at as soon as possible so that other avenues for concluding the price agreement could be pursued. Mr Osman [the Chairman of Petrobangla] suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the Government of Bangladesh for a final decision.*\"48\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 480.\n\n60.\n\nDuring these negotiations Niko ordered the car which then was delivered on 23 May 2005 to the State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources and, in June 2005, Niko Canada invited the Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary, followed by the Minister's resignation on 18 June and the return of the car to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. These events will be considered in further detail in Section 9.2.\n\n61.\n\nThe Gas Pricing Committee continued its work and held its final meeting on 23 October 2005.49 It issued a report entitled \"Committee Report on Feni Gas Pricing\"; the report is not dated but the signatures of the members show the dates of 25 and 26 October 2005. At the beginning of this report the members of the Committee were identified in two columns, on the left the \"Officials from Government\" and on the right \"Officials from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd\". The Officials from the Government were the Additional Secretary of the Ministry in the position of the Convener, the Chairman and a Director of Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX. In the report these members were referred to collectively as \"members representing GOB\", as \"GOB Team\" or using similar expressions referring to them collectively. The report concluded as follows:\n\n\"***Committee's recommendation:***  \n*The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of pricing of gas to produce from Feni field. The matter, therefore, remained unresolved.*\n\n*The members representing Government side recommend that the Niko's share of gas from Feni filed under the terms of JVA may be purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price of US$1.75/MCF.*\"50\n\nCommittee Report, p. 4 at Claimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 460-463.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 460, 463.\n\n62.\n\nNiko made comments to the Convener which it requested to \"*be included as part of the Minutes*\" of the 23 October 2005 meeting, presumably the Committee report just quoted. These comments were to the effect that \"*if the Committee could not reach a consensus on the matter of gas pricing that the next stage should be to pursue an arbitrated settlement of the matter*\". It announced that it \"*will therefore suggest to the GOB this solution to move forward on the matter*\".51\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 432, 433.\n\n63.\n\nIn a letter to the Ministry dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred to Article 18.3 of the JVA and proposed that the gas price determination \"*be referred to a sole expert to arbitrate*.\"52\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 452, 453.\n\n64.\n\nThis proposal was not accepted and the matter remained unresolved.\n\n65.\n\nBy 24 November 2005 no agreement had been reached on the gas price and the GSPA, but Petrobangla had made interim payments to Niko in a total amount of US$4 million.53 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that as of 28 November 2005 it would suspend gas production from the Feni Field pending \"*mutual resolution*\" of the gas price, the agreement and execution of a GPSA and \"*settlement of arrears for gas sold to date from the Feni Field.*\"54 Petrobangla responded on the same day, requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend deliveries. It concluded: \"*If you are still determined to do so that will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall be constrained to act accordingly.*\"55\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 427; confirmed by Niko at Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 424.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 429.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 428.\n\n66.\n\nFollowing a letter from Niko dated 26 November 2005, postponing the start of suspension to 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote that it was restrained from making further payments by an order of 16 November 2005 of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of which it quoted the following passage:\n\n\"*Since the order retraining the respondents 1.9 from making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of any gas field or any other account passed by the High Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate Division that order shall continue.*\"56\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 420\n\n67.\n\nNevertheless Petrobangla insisted that deliveries should not be suspended. It stated that it expected the GPSA could be \"*completed within a month or two*\".57\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 421.\n\n68.\n\nOn 29 November 2005 a meeting between Niko representatives and Mr Mahmudur Rahman, Energy Advisor of the Ministry, took place at the Ministry. Niko wrote to him on the same day, thanking him for the meeting and requesting \"*full support of your Ministry and the Government of Bangladesh to assist us in having the ad-interim order of the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 stayed as they apply to stopping the government from making payments to NRBL*\".58\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 409.\n\n69.\n\nOn the same day, 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote to Niko:\n\n\"*Please be informed that the purchase price of gas of the Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF.*\n\n*We hereby invite you to negotiate the terms of the GPSA for the production of Feni Gas Field, finalise, agree and execute the same based on the above price*.\"59\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 419.\n\n70.\n\nNiko responded on 30 November 2005, stating its disagreement with that price and reiterated its proposal to settle the difference by reference to a sole expert. On an interim basis, it accepted payment on the basis of US$1.75/MCF. It requested a meeting \"*wherein discussions can proceed on the GPSA and agreement on appointment of the sole expert can be reached*\".60\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 415-416.\n\n71.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 Niko confirmed that it accepted payment of US$1.75/MCF on an interim basis until determination by the proposed expert. It sent the draft for an interim GPSA to BAPEX. Further drafts were sent by Niko to BAPEX on 14 and 20 December 2005.61\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 369, 370.\n\n72.\n\nOn 16 January 2006 Niko announced to BAPEX the temporary reduction and shut down of production from the Feni field.62 It also seems to have made such announcements to Bakhrabad Gas Systems Ltd (**BGSL**). BAPEX objected to this communication in a letter of 19 January 2006, stating *inter alia* :\n\n\"*In our opinion this sort of unilateral decision and message to BGSL is a violation of JVA article no 24.3 since Petrobangla is the only authority & agent of GOB [i.e. the Government of Bangladesh] that purchases, sells, monitors and controls the transmission and distribution systems of gas in the country.*...\"63\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 368.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 366.\n\n73.\n\nOn 18 January 2006 a meeting apparently took place between the \"Advisor, Energy & Mineral Division\" of the Ministry and Niko, followed on 19 January 2006 by a meeting between Niko and Petrobangla. As a follow-up to these meetings, Niko sent on 22 January 2006 to Petrobangla and BAPEX what it described as the \"final version\" of the Interim GPSA, already initialled by Niko.64\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 357-365.\n\n74.\n\nThis version was not executed. Instead, a meeting between Niko representatives and the Advisor, Energy & Mineral Resources Division, at the Ministry took place on 12 February 2006. The meeting was followed by a letter from Niko to the Advisor dated 13 February 2006 in which it stated that the Advisor's \"*confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the Prime Minister's Office to allow us to proceed with our work was concerning*.\".65\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 341.\n\n75.\n\nAt a meeting on 14 February 2006 Petrobangla requested Niko to increase production from the Feni field;66 the request was confirmed on 20 February 2006. On 26 February 2006, Niko announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime Minister, the Ministry and others, that as from 27 February 2006 it planned to shut down all gas production from the Feni field \"*until further notice*\".67\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 334.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 333.\n\n76.\n\nPetrobangla objected to the decision in a letter of 28 February 2006. It added:\n\n\"*We are carefully scrutinising the draft GPSA you have submitted and our response to the same shall be communicated to you in due course. If the shut down has any connection with finalisation of the GPSA, it appears to be unnecessary at this point of time when negotiations even have not started*.\"68\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 332.\n\n77.\n\nIn a letter to Petrobangla of 2 March 2006 Niko provided explanations for the shutdown, referring in particular to the absence of an approved Work Programme and Budget and of a GPSA.\n\n78.\n\nPetrobangla replied on 5 March 2006 requesting that gas production resume. The letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*(c) As you have rightly mentioned earlier the gas price under the JVA is a matter of common understanding of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and the investor. Failure to reach any unanimous price decision, cannot be arbitrated/determined by any sole expert under the GPSA of any kind, since GOB is not going to be party to that. The truth of the matter is price negotiation under the JVA is not to be done at the time of GPSA negotiation neither it could be agreed that the GPSA negotiation has been started at the time Price Committee was made because that had been started independently. We now have a draft GPSA submitted by you. We are ready and willing to start negotiation on that. Feel free to contact us.*\"69\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 319 and 320.\n\n79.\n\nMr Brian Adolf, at that time Country Manager for Niko,70 explained at the hearing that the draft to which reference is made in this letter was the start of a new series of drafts. It differed from that which Niko had submitted in 2004. Since Mr Adolf commenced his activity as Country Manager for Niko only in January 2005, he was not familiar with the 2004 draft.71\n\nC-MJ.1, Appendix A, expected evidence of Mr Adolf, paragraph 160.\n\nHT 2, pp. 189, 190.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to Mr Adolf, when the attempt to reach an interim GPSA had failed, Niko invited Petrobangla as follows: \"*why do you not provide us what is your standard GPSA and we will work forward from there*\".72 In response Petrobangla provided a text in Word format which Niko used as the basis for a draft by reference to which all further negotiations were conducted. Mr Adolf explained: \"*We started from scratch with the format that Petrobangla had provided*.\"73\n\nHT 2, p. 190.\n\nHT 2, pp. 191, 193.\n\n81.\n\nPetrobangla, BAPEX and Niko met on 7 March 2006. The following day, on 8 March 2006, Niko wrote to Petrobangla and to Mr Jamaluddin in his function as Managing Director of BAPEX and \"Member Secretary of the Committee for Finalisation of Gas Pricing for the JVA\" that it was \"*in the process of finalising the DRAFT GPSA at the earliest except the fixing of the price*\"; Niko proposed determination of the price by an expert, and added:\n\n\"*Furthermore, we value the relationship we have with the Government of Bangladesh and considering the national interest Niko Management after having detail discussion with the Hon'ble Advisor for the Energy & Mineral Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production from Feni Gas Filed* [sic] *as a gesture of our goodwill*.\"74\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 308.\n\n82.\n\nThe GPSA was approved by the Government, acting through the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. On 20 December 2006 it addressed a letter to the Chairman of Petrobangla in the following terms:\n\n\"*You are informed on the above subject and reference that the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of Bapex with NAICO* [sic] *sent through abovementioned memo under reference has been approved by the government.*\n\n*2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to request you to take necessary action in the due pursuance of the existing rules and regulations on the above mentioned subject*.\"75\n\nRfA II, Attachment B.\n\n83.\n\nOn the following day, 21 October 2006, Petrobangla wrote to Niko and BAPEX, informing them that the Government of Bangladesh had \"*approved the initialled (31.07.2006) Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of Marginal Gas Field Feni*\".76\n\nIbid.\n\n84.\n\nThe GPSA was executed on 27 December 2006. It fixed a price of US$1.75 per thousand cubic feet of gas for the period of the agreement.\n\n85.\n\nMost of the correspondence referred to in this account of the events leading to the execution of the GPSA was copied by Niko and by Petrobangla to the Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources and, occasionally, also to the Prime Minister's office.\n\n**3.4 The arbitration clause in the GPSA**\n------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe draft of the interim GPSA, sent by Niko to Petrobangla on 5 December 2005, contained a clause for expert determination of price disputes. With respect to any other dispute it provided for arbitration under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (**ICC**) with a seat in Singapore or elsewhere as mutually agreed by the Parties.77 In subsequent drafts this clause remained largely unchanged78 until, in March 2006, Niko abandoned the attempt to reach an interim agreement.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 390, 395.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 357, 362, 370, 375, 379-382.\n\n87.\n\nFrom then on, a different text formed the basis for the negotiations of the GPSA. The first draft of this text produced in these proceedings is the version which, according to the testimony of Mr Adolf, Niko prepared on the basis of an electronic text received from Petrobangla, as described above in paragraph 80.\n\n88.\n\nThe drafts which then were exchanged and discussed contained a clause which provides for ICSID arbitration in the same terms as the JVA, with a reference to ICC arbitration if \"ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over such dispute\". The complete and final text of the arbitration clause is contained in Article 13 of the GPSA and reads as follows:\n\n\"*13.5 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle amicably through consultation any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.*\n\n*13.2 If any dispute, mentioned in Article 13.1, has not been settled through such consultation within ninety (90) days after the dispute arises, either Party may, by notice to the other Party, propose that the dispute be referred either for determination by a sole expert or to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.*\n\n*13.3 Following the giving of notice under Article 13.2, the Parties may, by mutual Agreement, refer the dispute for determination by a sole expert to be appointed by Agreement between the Parties.*\n\n*13.4 As an alternative to the procedure described in Article*\n\n*13.3 and if agreed upon by the Parties, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration by an agreed sole arbitrator.*\n\n*13.5 If the Parties fail to refer such dispute to a sole expert under Article 13.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 13.4, within sixty (60) days of the giving of notice, such dispute shall be referred to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") and the Parties hereby consent to arbitration under the Treaty establishing ICSID. If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over such dispute, the dispute shall be finally settled by International Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n*13.8 Arbitration pursuant to Article 13.4 shall be by an arbitration tribunal consisting of three (3) arbitrators. The Parties shall each appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators so appointed shall designate a third arbitrator. If one of the Parties does not appoint its arbitrator within sixty (60) days after the first appointment or if two (2) arbitrators, once appointed, fail to appoint the third within sixty (60) days after the appointment of the second arbitrator, the relevant appointment shall be made in accordance with the rules of ICSID or the International Chamber of Commerce, as the case may be.*\n\n*13.7 The arbitrators shall be citizens of countries that have formal diplomatic relations with both Bangladesh and Canada and any home country of the entities comprising the Seller, and shall not have any economic interest in or economic relationship with the Parties.*\n\n*13.8 The Sole Arbitrator or the arbitration tribunal shall conduct the arbitration in accordance with the arbitration rules of ICSID. However, if the above-mentioned arbitration rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Article 13, including the provisions concerning appointment of arbitrators, the provisions of this Article 13 shall prevail.*\n\n*13.9 The English language shall be the language used in arbitral proceedings. All hearing materials, statements of claim or defense, award and the reasons supporting them shall be in English.*\n\n*13.10 The place of arbitration shall be Dhaka or elsewhere as mutually agreed by the Parties.*\n\n*13.11 Any arbitration award given pursuant to this Article 13 shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall be enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction on the same basis as obligations between private parties, and any reference in this Agreement to such an award shall include any determination by a sole expert.*\n\n*13.12 The right to arbitrate disputes under this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.*\"\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal discussed at length with Mr Adolf the origin of the draft containing this arbitration clause and the negotiations about the clause. According to his testimony, the clause was not subject to negotiations and remained as it had been in the draft of March 2006, originating from Petrobangla. At the end of the discussion the Chairman of the Tribunal drew the following conclusion:\n\n\"*From this evidence we must conclude that the clause, as it was in the final agreement, was put by Petrobangla.*\n\n*We put it to both parties, if there is evidence to counter this assumption which we must draw from the evidence before us, both parties are invited to produce this evidence so that if we are wrong in this conclusion that we can correct our conclusion*.\"79\n\nHT 2, p. 206.\n\n90.\n\nNo contrary evidence was produced thereafter. The Tribunal concludes that the clause providing for ICSID arbitration was as originally put forward by Petrobangla which, as shown above, acted in close consultation with and under instructions of the Government.\n\n**3.4 The arbitration clause in the GPSA**\n------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe draft of the interim GPSA, sent by Niko to Petrobangla on 5 December 2005, contained a clause for expert determination of price disputes.

It stated that it also sought to \"*recover payment of amounts due for gas delivered*\".\n\n109.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the **ICSID Institution Rules**), the Centre acknowledged receipt of the First Request on 13 April 2010, and transmitted a copy of it to the three Respondents.\n\n110.\n\nBy letter of 7 May 2010, the Centre requested clarifications from Niko concerning the First Request, to which the Claimant responded under cover of a letter of 18 May 2010 (**RfA I Clarification**). It named Professor Jan Paulsson as its appointee to the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n111.\n\nOn 27 May 2010 the Acting Secretary-General registered the Claimant's First Request, as supplemented on 18 May 2010, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (**ICSID Convention** or **Convention**) as ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n112.\n\nBy letter of 21 June 2010 addressed to the Acting Secretary-General, the Respondents raised certain objections to the Centre's jurisdiction and indicated a proposal regarding the constitution of the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 (**R-****Preliminary Objections**). In these objections the Respondents stated that the Claimant had \"*failed to show how Bangladesh and Petrobangla (or even BAPEX) have consented to ICSID arbitration in the matters referred to arbitration*\".\n\n113.\n\nThe Centre acknowledged receipt of the letter on 24 June 2010 and reminded the Parties that, as provided by Articles 41 and 42 of the ICSID Convention, the registration of a request for arbitration by the Centre is without prejudice to the powers and functions of the Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant made comments on the Respondents' letters of 21 and 24 June 2010 by letter of 30 June 2010.\n\n115.\n\nFollowing several rounds of communications regarding the method of constituting the Tribunal, the Respondents wrote on 26 August 2010 and invoked the formula concerning the method of constituting the Tribunal provided for in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was thus to be composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. The Respondents appointed Professor Campbell McLachlan as arbitrator and proposed Mr Gavan Griffith, a national of Australia, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n116.\n\nOn 27 August 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that it would seek from Professor McLachlan the acceptance of his appointment, and that it would also proceed to seek the acceptance of his appointment as arbitrator from Professor Jan Paulsson, who had been nominated as arbitrator by the Claimant before the method of constituting the Tribunal had been determined.\n\n117.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant objected to the appointment of Mr Griffith as President of the Tribunal.\n\n118.\n\nBy letter of 31 August 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that both Professors McLachlan and Paulsson had accepted their respective appointments as arbitrators.\n\n119.\n\nOn 17 September 2010 and further to its letter of 27 August 2010, the Claimant proposed Professor Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez, a national of Mexico, as presiding arbitrator. By letter of 19 October 2010, the Respondents objected to this proposal, and, on 23 October 2010, the Respondents proposed Professor Georges Abi-Saab, a national of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and, alternatively Dr S.K.B. Asante, a national of Ghana, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n120.\n\nBy letter of 16 November 2010 the Claimant objected to the Respondents' proposals of 23 October 2010, and requested that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint the President of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n121.\n\nOn 29 November 2010 the Centre invited the Parties to consider candidates for presiding arbitrator by way of ballot procedure. Each Party was to select one or more acceptable candidate(s) from a list of candidates proposed to the Parties by the Centre. In the event the Parties agreed on a mutually acceptable candidate, that individual would be selected as the President of the Tribunal; however, should the procedure not produce a mutually acceptable candidate, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council would make the appointment from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators pursuant to Article 38 of the Convention.\n\n122.\n\nBy letter of 13 December 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that they had agreed under the ballot procedure to appoint Mr Michael E. Schneider to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n123.\n\nOn 20 December 2010 pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **ICSID Arbitration****Rules**), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Mssrs. Schneider, McLachlan and Paulsson had all accepted their appointments, and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted and **the proceedings to have begun on 20 December 2010**.

ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18.\n\n132.\n\nOn 29 November 2010 the Centre invited the Parties to consider appointing the presiding arbitrator in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18 by way of ballot procedure, as in Case No. ARB/10/11.\n\n133.\n\nBy letter of 13 December 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that they had agreed under the ballot procedure to appoint Mr Michael E. Schneider to serve as President of the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18.\n\n134.\n\nOn 20 December 2010 the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Mssrs. Schneider, McLachlan and Paulsson had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18 was therefore deemed to have been constituted and the **proceedings to have begun on 20 December 2010**. The Secretary-General further informed the Parties that Ms Frauke Nitschke would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**4.2 Following the Constitution of the two Tribunals**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Parties and the Tribunal constituted in the two cases, on 14 February 2011 the President of the Tribunal held **joint preliminary procedural consultations** in ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18 pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 20 with the Parties in Geneva on 14 February 2011.\n\n136.\n\nPresent at the preliminary procedural consultations were: Mr Michael E Schneider, President of the Tribunal; Ms Frauke Nitschke, Secretary of the Tribunal; Mr Kenneth J Warren, QC, for the Claimant; and Mr Tawfique Nawaz and Mr Mohammad Imtiaz Farooq for the Respondents. In preparation for the procedural consultation, the Tribunal had adopted a proposed agenda and its Members had discussed the issues on these agenda. The Parties did not object to the absence of the two other arbitrators at the preliminary procedural consultations.\n\n137.\n\nSubsequently, on the same day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal held its **Joint First Session** with the Parties in Geneva, with the two co-arbitrators joining by way of video-conference. As previously agreed by the Parties, the preliminary procedural consultations and the First Session were held jointly for both ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18.\n\n138.\n\nThe consultations and the Joint First Session considered matters of procedure regarding the conduct and organization of the arbitration. The Claimant clarified the relief sought, stating in particular that, with respect to the Compensation Claim it sought a declaration of no liability for any of the blowout damage (**Compensation Declaration**).95 The Parties agreed that the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner, and that the Tribunal may issue one single instrument in relation to both cases, and may discuss the two cases jointly except where circumstances distinct to one case necessitate a separate treatment. The Parties also agreed that the applicable arbitration rules would be the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, that the place of proceedings would be London, United Kingdom and that the language of the arbitration would be English. They confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted in the two cases and that they had no objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.\n\nFor details see below Section 10.\n\n139.\n\nAt the Joint First Session the Tribunal and the Parties considered the procedural timetable. It was decided that, in a first (and possibly final) phase of the two arbitrations, the Respondents' objections to jurisdiction would be heard. After consultation with the Parties, the procedural timetable for the written and oral procedure on jurisdiction was issued in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n140.\n\nSummary Minutes of the consultations and the Joint First Session were prepared as well as sound recordings. These were subsequently distributed by the Centre to the Parties and the Members of the Tribunal.\n\n141.\n\nFurther to the discussion at the Joint First Session, the Tribunal gave directions in Procedural Order No. 1 with respect to *inter alia* a possible counter-claim. It directed that the Respondents, if they wished to oppose the Payment Claim on the grounds of a claim for the compensation of the damage from the well blowouts (Compensation Claim), they must raise this claim with their First Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n142.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 1 April 2011 the Claimant filed its First Memorial on Jurisdiction for the Payment Claim (**C-MJ**), which included a request for the Respondent to produce certain documents.\n\n143.\n\nOn 16 May 2011 the Respondents filed their First CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction on the Payment Claim (**R-CMJ.1**), which included observations on the Claimant's document production request of 1 April 2011 but no counter-claim.\n\n144.\n\nOn 30 June 2011 the Claimant filed its Second Memorial on Jurisdiction, described as the Claimant's Response to the Respondents' First Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction for the Payment Claim, and the Claimant's Memorial on Jurisdiction for the Compensation Claim (**C-MJ.2**) and reiterated its document production request originally filed with its First Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n145.\n\nOn 1 August 2011 the Respondents filed further observations on the Claimant's document production request of 1 April 2011.\n\n146.\n\nOn 16 August 2011 the Respondents filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents. The Claimant filed its observations on this request on 19 August 2011.\n\n147.\n\nOn 26 August 2011 the Tribunal decided on the admissibility of the Respondents' document production request and posed questions to the Parties regarding document production issues and certain allegations made by the Respondents concerning the Claimant.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondents responded to the Tribunal's questions by letter of 29 August 2011 and the Claimant by letters of 6 and 13 September 2011.\n\n149.\n\nOn 30 August 2011 the Respondents filed their Second Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, described as the Respondents' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction for the Payment Claim (**R-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim**).\n\n150.\n\nOn 13 September 2011 the Tribunal requested further clarifications from the Claimant regarding criminal investigations notified to the Claimant or to another person or company acting on the Claimant's instructions or on its behalf, to which the Claimant responded by letter of 22 September 2011.\n\n151.\n\nOn 15 September 2011 the President of the Tribunal held a **prehearing organisational meeting** by telephone conference with the Parties to discuss the conduct and organisation of the hearing on jurisdiction. Prior to this telephone conference the Tribunal had addressed to the Parties a List of Points for Discussion which served as the basis for the discussion with them.\n\n152.\n\nThe following persons participated in the organisational meeting: Mr Michael E. Schneider, President of the Tribunal; Ms Frauke Nitschke, Secretary of the Tribunal; Mr Kenneth J Warren, QC, and Mr Ajmalul Hossain, QC, for the Claimant; and Mr Tawfique Nawaz, Mr Mohammad Imtiaz Farooq, Mr Luis Gonzalez Garcia and Ms Alison Macdonald, for the Respondents. The Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the pre-hearing organisational meeting being conducted by the President alone.\n\n153.\n\nAt the pre-hearing organisational meeting the President discussed with the Parties in particular questions relating to the conduct of the hearing and witness testimony, the scope of the jurisdictional issues and outstanding issues concerning the document production requests. A procedure was agreed for further submissions with respect to these requests and the response to the questions of the Tribunal.\n\n154.\n\nSummary Minutes of the organisational meeting and the sound recordings were distributed to the Parties and the Members of the Tribunal on 19 September 2011.\n\n155.\n\nIn the course of the organisational meeting, the Respondents requested leave to file a Supplemental Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, responding in particular to the Claimant's presentation concerning the Compensation Declaration. On 19 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, granting the Respondents' request to file a further submission on jurisdiction, and allowing the Claimant to file observations on the Respondents' further submission prior to the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n156.\n\nOn 20 September 2011 the Claimant filed answers related to document production questions posed by the President during the pre-hearing telephone conference.\n\n157.\n\nOn 27 September 2011 the Respondents addressed certain questions relating to the replies which the Claimant had given in its submissions of 6 and 22 September 2011.\n\n158.\n\nOn 28 September 2011 the Respondents filed observations on the Claimant's letter of 20 September 2011 and, in a separate document, their Supplemental Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (**R-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration**), described as Respondents' Response to the Claimant's Presentation of its Position with respect to the Request for the Compensation Declaration.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant filed its observations thereon on 10 October 2011 in a submission entitled Reply to the Respondents' Response with respect to the Compensation Declaration (**C-MJ.3**).\n\n160.\n\nA **hearing on jurisdiction** was held on 13 and 14 October 2011 in London. In addition to the three Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following persons participated in the jurisdictional hearing:\n\nFor the Claimant:  \nMr Kenneth J Warren, QC, Mr James T Eamon, QC, and Ms Erin Runnalls of Gowlings, Calgary, and Mr Ajmalul Hossain, QC, of A. Hossain & Associates, Dhaka.\n\nFor the Respondents:  \nMr Tawfique Nawaz, Senior Advocate, and Mr Mohammad Imtiaz Farooq of Juris Counsel, Dhaka, and Mr Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda and Ms Alison Macdonald of Matrix Chambers, London.\n\n161.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, the Members of the Tribunal sought to clarify certain issues raised in the Parties' written submissions on jurisdiction. Mr Brian Adolph, Regional Manager, Middle East/Madagascar of Niko Canada and, from January 2005 to December 2007 Country Manager for Niko, and Mr Imam Hossain, Secretary, Petrobangla, testified as witnesses. Further to Procedural Order No. 1 the Parties had submitted descriptions of the facts on which these witnesses were expected to testify, the Claimant with C-MJ.1 and the Respondents with R-CMJ.1. The Parties were given an opportunity to question the witnesses, to develop their case orally, and to respond to the Tribunal's questions.\n\n162.\n\nFollowing the witness testimony, the Tribunal declared the record on jurisdiction closed and confirmed this in the Summary Minutes of the hearing.\n\n163.\n\nFollowing the Parties' closing submissions, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties wished to raise any points of complaint with regard to the conduct of the procedure, which the Tribunal could address and rectify if necessary. The Parties confirmed that they did not have any such points they wished to raise, and the hearing was declared closed.\n\n164.\n\nSummary Minutes of the hearing were prepared by the Tribunal and sent to the Parties on 23 November 2011.\n\n165.\n\nThe hearing was recorded and a transcript was prepared by Ms Georgina Ford and Mr Ian Roberts of Briault Reporting Services. A copy of the transcript was sent to the Parties and the Members of the Tribunal on 14 and 15 October 2011 and a corrected version on 23 November 2011. The audio recording of the hearing was distributed on 27 October 2011.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated at meetings in person in Paris and Geneva, by telephone conferences and by correspondence, reaching the present unanimous decision.\n\n**4.2 Following the Constitution of the two Tribunals**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Parties and the Tribunal constituted in the two cases, on 14 February 2011 the President of the Tribunal held **joint preliminary procedural consultations** in ICSID Case Nos.

The Respondents argue that this company \"*is not the real claimant in this arbitration*\".\n\n**5.1 The position of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the fact that both agreements are concluded by a company described Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd., and indicate that this company has its \"*Head Office at P.O. Box 261, Bay Street, Bridgetown, Barbados*\". The JVA also states that the company so identified is \"*a corporation organised under the laws of Barbados*\".\n\n169.\n\nIt is undisputed that the company so identified is registered in Barbados. The Claimant states that it also has its Head Office there and that it at a later date \"*designated a primary off ice in Cyprus*\".96\n\nC-MJ-2, paragraph 111.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. \"*is not the real claimant in this arbitration*\". According to the Respondents it \"*is clear that the registered office of the Claimant is one of convenience, and that the real investor in Bangladesh and, therefore the real Claimant was and continues to be Niko Resources Ltd., a Canadian company*\".97 The parent company of the Claimant is indeed Niko Resources Ltd., a company registered in Canada with a head office in Calgary, Canada.98\n\nR-CMJ-1, paragraph 83.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 15, p. 985.\n\n171.\n\nBarbados is a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention since 1 December 1983. Canada signed the ICSID Convention on 15 December 2006 but has not ratified it. At the commencement of the arbitration it was not a Contracting State, and is not one today. Cyprus is a Contracting State since 25 December 1966.\n\n172.\n\nIn support of their position, the Respondents rely primarily on the following facts or allegations: Niko Canada owns and is in full control of Niko Bangladesh; it carried out all the necessary technical studies; its executives negotiated and signed the JVA and the GSPA; Niko Bangladesh has no office, employees, assets or business in Barbados or Cyprus, and its managerial positions are held by Canadian nationals and employees of Niko Canada.99\n\nR-CMC.1, paragraph 85.\n\n173.\n\nThe argument of the Respondents, in substance, has two prongs which are related but different:\n\n\u2022 The first prong concerns the identity of the Claimant, the Respondents arguing that the corporate entity of the Barbados company is only a fa\u00e7ade (used for \"convenience\") or \"*just a shell*\",100 while the true investor is the Canadian company; this line of argument disregards the separate legal personality of the Barbados company and absorbs it by the parent company. The Respondents \"*request the Tribunal to lift the corporate veil of Niko Bangladesh*\".\n\n\u2022 The other prong seems to recognise the distinct legal personality of the Claimant but takes the position that, because of its control by a Canadian company, the nationality of the Claimant company was not that of Barbados. Thus the Respondents argue that the \"*parties to the GPSA and JVA knew and agreed that the real nationality of Niko was Canadian*\".101 They argue that \"*there must be real connection between the investor and the State of its nationality*\"102 and, quoting Schreuer, insist that the tribunal should *\"take a realistic look at the true controllers*...\".103\n\nHT 1, p. 108.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 88(a).\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 89.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 95, quoting Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed., 2009) (hereinafter **Schreuer**), at p. 563.\n\n**5.1 The position of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the fact that both agreements are concluded by a company described Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd., and indicate that this company has its \"*Head Office at P.O.

[...] It is clear from the evidence that Niko Bangladesh is fully controlled and dominated by Niko Canada.*\"104\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 55 (3).\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant \"*acknowledges that it engaged the services of the parent and other affiliated corporations from time to time to augment its internal capabilities*\".105 In reality, the contributions of Niko Canada and the Claimant's group most likely were provided not just \"*from time to time*\"; these contributions must have been substantial and regular. From the explanations provided by the Claimant at the hearing the Claimant's activity in Barbados consisted essentially of holding board meetings there.106\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 111.\n\nHT 1, pp. 118-120.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in principle it is for the investor to decide how it wishes to structure its investment and what corporate organisation it wishes to adopt for the investment, including the manner in which resources, activities and control are allocated between different corporate vehicles. The corporate structure of the investment is indeed part of the investor's prerogatives and responsibility. Depending on the structure adopted, the corporate vehicle used for the investment which becomes party to the investment contract may rely on the resources of the group to which it belongs to secure the investment, including funding, technology or other contributions.\n\n178.\n\nDistinct corporate identities serve a legitimate function in the cross-border mobilisation of investment. As long as the contracting parties are not mislead about the corporate structure and no laws and regulations are violated, there should be no objection to the choice made by the investor in this respect.\n\n179.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondents were well aware of the corporate structure used for the investment. In the two agreements, the Claimant is clearly identified as a company organised under the laws of Barbados, in terms that have been quoted above. The identification of a Barbados company as contracting partner, and not the Canadian parent, did not go unnoticed. The Respondents were fully aware of the corporate structure and the choice of a Barbados company for the agreements, as the following incident demonstrates:\n\n180.\n\nOn 22 July 2003, a few months before the execution of the JVA, a meeting of the Petrobangla Board of Directors was held at which a number of questions were addressed concerning the transaction with Niko. In the resolution of the Board of which the Respondents have produced extracts, a number of questions were addressed which the Ministry had raised. One of these questions concerned \"*explaining the registration in Barbados instead of Canada*\". The Board of Petrobangla provided detailed explanations on the corporate structure of the Niko group which show that the choice of a Barbadian subsidiary rather than the Canadian parent was a matter carefully considered by the Respondents and accepted by them.107\n\nMinutes of the 333th Board Meeting of Petrobangla in Respondents', Exhibit 32, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1, translation produced on 10 June 2011.\n\n181.\n\nSimilarly, the substantive and regular contributions from the parent company to Niko were known to the Respondents; indeed they relied on them. For instance, the Respondents point out that the initial report evaluating the fields was prepared by Niko Canada and that, at a number of subsequent occasions, the parent company intervened in its own name.108 Indeed, the Respondents do not contest that the full control of Niko Canada over the Claimant was known to them.\n\nR-CMC.1, paragraph 88.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the choice of the Barbadian company as the party engaged on the Niko side was made in full knowledge of the Respondents and after careful consideration. It sees no justification for the Respondents now to question this choice. For the purposes of the arbitration clause and jurisdiction the party to the JVA and the GSPA is the Barbadian company acting as the Claimant.\n\n183.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal has not overlooked that the use of a corporate vehicle without resources and activity may give rise to objections when the company chosen as the investor does not meet its obligations. In such a situation it may have to be examined whether the group of companies behind the investor may ultimately be shielded by the separate legal personality of a corporation which turns out to be \"*just a shell*\". This question need not be examined any further here since the Respondents have not raised any such claims against Niko in this arbitration, although an opportunity was given for them to do so.\n\n**5.2 The Claimant's identity**\n-------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondents do not question that under the law of Barbados and of Canada, the Claimant and Niko Canada have distinct legal personality and are separate corporate entities; however, they insist that this distinct legal personality does not correspond to economic reality.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the Respondents the \"*party which financed, negotiated, operated and was the decision-maker under the JVA and GPSA was Niko Canada. [...] It is clear from the evidence that Niko Bangladesh is fully controlled and dominated by Niko Canada.*\"104\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 55 (3).\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant \"*acknowledges that it engaged the services of the parent and other affiliated corporations from time to time to augment its internal capabilities*\".105 In reality, the contributions of Niko Canada and the Claimant's group most likely were provided not just \"*from time to time*\"; these contributions must have been substantial and regular. From the explanations provided by the Claimant at the hearing the Claimant's activity in Barbados consisted essentially of holding board meetings there.106\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 111.\n\nHT 1, pp. 118-120.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in principle it is for the investor to decide how it wishes to structure its investment and what corporate organisation it wishes to adopt for the investment, including the manner in which resources, activities and control are allocated between different corporate vehicles. The corporate structure of the investment is indeed part of the investor's prerogatives and responsibility. Depending on the structure adopted, the corporate vehicle used for the investment which becomes party to the investment contract may rely on the resources of the group to which it belongs to secure the investment, including funding, technology or other contributions.\n\n178.\n\nDistinct corporate identities serve a legitimate function in the cross-border mobilisation of investment.

They argue that it could also be that of Cyprus but that it should ultimately be Canadian.\n\n**5.3 The Claimant's nationality**\n----------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondents question that the true nationality of the Claimant is that of Barbados. They argue that it could also be that of Cyprus but that it should ultimately be Canadian.\n\n5.3.1 The link with Cyprus\n--------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondents argue that in 2006 the head office of Niko was moved to Cyprus and that, by the time the GPSA was signed, Niko \"*was already a Cyprus national*\".109\n\nHT 1, p. 121.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant relies on its incorporation in Barbados but accepts that \"*starting with about October 2006 there were directors meetings in Cyprus and eventually there was a place of business that was created in Cyprus*\".110 But the place of incorporation did not change and, in the Claimant's view, that was sufficient for continued Barbados nationality.111\n\nHT 2, p. 262.\n\nHT 2, p. 261.\n\n187.\n\nIt is uncontested that Niko was incorporated in Barbados. The Claimant has produced its Certificate of Incorporation, issued by the Deputy Registrar of Companies, showing as the date of incorporation 4 September 1 997.112 The Claimant also produced the Articles of Incorporation,113 the By-laws of the company,114 and minutes of meetings of directors and shareholders. The By-laws provide in their section 2.1:\n\n\"*The registered office of the Company shall be in Barbados at such address as the directors may fix from time to time by resolution*.\"115\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 10, p. 603.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 10, pp. 604 et seq.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 10, pp. 610 et seq.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 613.\n\n188.\n\nThe registered office is recorded as being in Barbados at Worthington Corporate Centre, Worthington Main Road, Christ Church, Barbados, with the mailing address at P.O. Box 261, Bridgetown, Barbados. Either the registered office or the mailing address is indicated on the Claimant's letterhead of documents produced by the Claimant; on some of the documents it is the mailing address which is shown. The agreements locate the \"head office\" of the Claimant at the mailing address.\n\n189.\n\nThe documents produced by the Claimant also include an International Business Company License, issued under the Barbados International Business Companies Act, confirming that it was authorised to \"*conduct international business with effect from September 4, 1997 in accordance with the provisions of the International Business Companies Act, Cap. 77*\", as well as renewals of this license until 31 December 2011.116\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 639-654.\n\n190.\n\nAmong the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors are those of 30 September 1999, which record a review of the Framework of Understanding with BAPEX and the decision to retain Stratum Development Ltd. (**Stratum**) \"*to assist in securing the opportunities in the Chattak, Feni and Kamta gas fields and to act on behalf of the Company, as its management company, in Bangladesh*\".117\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 688, 691.\n\n191.\n\nThe evidence shows that until 2006 Niko was not only incorporated in Barbados but also had its head office there. Some change occurred in 2006.\n\n192.\n\nOn 26 October 2006 a meeting of the Board of Directors is recorded, which decided \"*the Company's migration to Cyprus*\".118 However, the company continued to identify itself as a \"*private company registered in Barbados*\" adding \"*principal place of business in Cyprus under registration number AE-2221*\".119 Meetings of the Board of Directors continued to be held \"*pursuant to Section 82(1) of the Companies Act CAP. 308*\" of Barbados, as recorded in minutes of these meetings.120\n\nMinutes produced as Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 750.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 768 (document dated 2 July 2007) and Exhibit 6, p. 770 (document dated 29 October 2007)\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 774 (document dated 12 February 2008), Exhibit 6, pp. 775-776 (document dated 20 March 2008).\n\n193.\n\nThe status of the Claimant company is clarified by Certificates of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, Department of Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver, Nicosia. On 12 February 2007 the Registrar certified that Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Limited, \"*which was formed in Barbados, was recorded today as an Overseas Company after filing documents under the Companies Law, Cap. 113, Section 347*\". On 23 September 2008 the Registrar clarified the position of the Company in Cyprus:\n\n\"*It is hereby certified that, in accordance with the records kept by this Department, the above Overseas Company has established a Place of Business in the Republic of Cyprus at the following address:*,...\"121\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 599.\n\n194.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 10 November 2008, a change of directors of Niko took place; it was recorded on 22 December 2008 under the Companies Act of Barbados by the Barbados Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office under the Claimant's Barbados registration number.122\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 586.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Niko Resources (Barbados) Ltd. was validly incorporated under the laws of Barbados in 1997. In 2007, this company established a place of business in Cyprus and was registered there as \"Overseas Company\". Its status as corporation registered in Barbados was not affected by this registration in Cyprus.\n\n196.\n\nConsequently, the Claimant company was, at the time of consent to the two agreements in 2003 and 2006, a company incorporated and registered in Barbados. This status continued thereafter and there is no reason to conclude that it has changed since.\n\n5.3.1 The link with Cyprus\n--------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondents argue that in 2006 the head office of Niko was moved to Cyprus and that, by the time the GPSA was signed, Niko \"*was already a Cyprus national*\".109\n\nHT 1, p. 121.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant relies on its incorporation in Barbados but accepts that \"*starting with about October 2006 there were directors meetings in Cyprus and eventually there was a place of business that was created in Cyprus*\".110 But the place of incorporation did not change and, in the Claimant's view, that was sufficient for continued Barbados nationality.111\n\nHT 2, p. 262.\n\nHT 2, p. 261.\n\n187.\n\nIt is uncontested that Niko was incorporated in Barbados.

This status continued thereafter and there is no reason to conclude that it has changed since.\n\n5.3.2 The link with Canada\n--------------------------\n\n197.\n\nWhile recognising that incorporation is an accepted basis for determining the nationality of a corporation, the Respondent argues that \"*there is no basis to conclude that the test of incorporation is the only criterion for the determination of a juridical person's nationality under the Convention*\".123 According to the Respondents \"*international law permits the Tribunal to disregard the formal corporate structure of the Claimant in order to determine the real nationality of the investor*\".124\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 69.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 57.\n\n198.\n\nRelying on authorities dealing with treaty claims and diplomatic protection, the Respondents assert that a \"*real connection*\" is required \"*between a corporation and the home State*\", \"*some substantial and effective connection between the legal entity and the claimant state*\" and that there \"*is a tendency in international treaty practice towards a requirement of connection beyond the mere fact of incorporation*\".125 They make reference to the decisions of the ICJ in the *Nottebohm* and the *Barcelona Traction* cases,126 as well as a number of investment treaty cases; they argue that reliance of the Claimant on its Barbados nationality \"*amounts to an abuse of the ICSID system*\".127\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraphs 70-72; see also R-CMJ.1, paragraph 89.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 89 and fn. 98.\n\nR-CMCJ.1, paragraph 93 and HT 1, p. 113.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondents refer to statements by representatives of Niko Canada and to support from Canadian authorities to argue that the \"*real connection*\" existed with Canada and that \"*the parties to the JVA and the GPSA agreed to treat Niko Bangladesh as a Canadian company*\".128\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 78.\n\n200.\n\nArticle 25 of the Convention provides for jurisdiction over disputes between a Contracting State and a \"*national of another Contracting State*\", but it does not establish criteria for determining corporate nationality. There is wide consensus that incorporation and head office are the principal criteria to establish nationality.129\n\nFor an overview, see Schreuer at Article 25, paragraphs 694-717.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondents' argument, as presented above, amounts to saying (a) that incorporation alone is not sufficient but must reflect a \"*real connection*\" to the place of incorporation and (b) that the parties to the arbitration agreement may agree to treat a juridical person as a national of another State than that of incorporation and that in the present case they have done so.\n\n202.\n\nThe authorities to which the Respondents referred the Tribunal, to the (limited) extent to which they support their argument, concern claims brought in diplomatic protection or under an investment treaty where the consent of the State to arbitration or to jurisdiction of the ICJ was given in a general form. In the present case, the Respondents have consented to ICSID arbitration of disputes arising out of two specific agreements with a specific company.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondents have not presented any authorities to support their view that a requirement of a \"*real connection*\", assuming it were applicable in diplomatic protection or in treaty claims, should apply to contract claims as in the present case. In the Tribunal's view such an additional requirement cannot be read into the text of the Convention; nor can the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* for the Convention justify the assumption that this had been intended. It is sufficient for a claimant to show that it has the nationality of another Contracting State by reference to one of the generally accepted criteria, in particular incorporation or seat.130\n\nSee e.g. Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 707.\n\n204.\n\nWith respect to their argument on an agreement about nationality, the Respondents state that it \"*is well-settled that an agreement on nationality would clarify the claimant's nationality for the purpose of the ICSID Convention and, as noted by Schreuer, such agreement will carry 'much weight'*\".131 The Tribunal agrees but adds, as Schreuer did, that an agreement \"*cannot create a nationality that does not exist*\".132\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 79, relying on Schreuer, p. 281.\n\nSchreuer, at Article 25, paragraph 710.\n\n205.\n\nThe JVA identifies Niko as a \"*Company organised under the laws of Barbados\"; the Framework Understanding, also between BAPEX and Niko, added to the description \"organised and existing under the laws of Barbados, having its Canada address at* [\u2026] *Calgary*.\". BAPEX, with the approval of Petrobangla and Bangladesh, has agreed to ICSID arbitration with this company \"*existing under the laws of Barbados*\". In the eyes of the Tribunal, the Respondents thus have recognised the Barbados nationality of Niko. As pointed out above, this recognition was expressed consciously and after an examination of the implications of this choice.\n\n206.\n\nBy their consent in these circumstances, Respondents have accepted that their contracting partner was organised under the laws of Barbados and had its head office there. The use of ICSID arbitration by this company was fully accepted by the Respondents at the time of their consent to arbitration. There is no ground to assume that their consent was abused.\n\n207.\n\nThe references on which the Respondents rely in support of the asserted \"*real connection*\" to Canada and agreement to treat Niko as a Canadian company justify the conclusion that Niko and its contracts with the Respondents had a link with Canada. This is not surprising for a company forming part of a group based in Canada. But it does not transform a company organised under the laws of Barbados and having its registered office there into a Canadian company.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant qualifies as a national of Barbados, another Contracting State, in the sense of Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n5.3.2 The link with Canada\n--------------------------\n\n197.\n\nWhile recognising that incorporation is an accepted basis for determining the nationality of a corporation, the Respondent argues that \"*there is no basis to conclude that the test of incorporation is the only criterion for the determination of a juridical person's nationality under the Convention*\".123 According to the Respondents \"*international law permits the Tribunal to disregard the formal corporate structure of the Claimant in order to determine the real nationality of the investor*\".124\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 69.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 57.\n\n198.\n\nRelying on authorities dealing with treaty claims and diplomatic protection, the Respondents assert that a \"*real connection*\" is required \"*between a corporation and the home State*\", \"*some substantial and effective connection between the legal entity and the claimant state*\" and that there \"*is a tendency in international treaty practice towards a requirement of connection beyond the mere fact of incorporation*\".125 They make reference to the decisions of the ICJ in the *Nottebohm* and the *Barcelona Traction* cases,126 as well as a number of investment treaty cases; they argue that reliance of the Claimant on its Barbados nationality \"*amounts to an abuse of the ICSID system*\".127\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraphs 70-72; see also R-CMJ.1, paragraph 89.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 89 and fn. 98.\n\nR-CMCJ.1, paragraph 93 and HT 1, p. 113.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondents refer to statements by representatives of Niko Canada and to support from Canadian authorities to argue that the \"*real connection*\" existed with Canada and that \"*the parties to the JVA and the GPSA agreed to treat Niko Bangladesh as a Canadian company*\".128\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 78.\n\n200.\n\nArticle 25 of the Convention provides for jurisdiction over disputes between a Contracting State and a \"*national of another Contracting State*\", but it does not establish criteria for determining corporate nationality.

THE STATE OF BANGLADESH AS A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nOn the Bangladesh side the only contractually named parties are BAPEX and Petrobangla. The JVA expressly defines the term \"Party\": only BAPEX and the Operator, i.e. Claimant, are identified by this term.133 The GPSA is concluded between Petrobangla and the Joint Venture Partners, BAPEX and Niko. The State of Bangladesh does not appear as party of either of these agreements.\n\nArticle 1.45.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimant nevertheless argues that Bangladesh is a party to the GSPA \"*because the agreement was made by its agent or instrumentality, or the parties intended it that it be a party*.\"134 The Claimant adds that \"*Bapex and Petrobangla are mere instrumentalities or agents of the Government in respect of the subject contracts. Whether the matter is viewed as an agency relationship or as a lack of separate identity, the result is the same. In the result, the GPSA is Bangladesh's contract, accordingly Bangladesh is compellable to arbitrate as a party thereto*\".135 In this context the Claimant also relies on a theory of attribution, arguing that the acts of Petrobangla and BAPEX should be attributed to the Government of Bangladesh.136\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 25.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 81.\n\nC-.MJ.1, paragraph 107.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the critical question here is that of consent to arbitration under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and that this question of consent must be considered under public international law.137 As to the substance of the Claimant's claim to jurisdiction, the Respondents argue that the principles of attribution are not relevant to this issue, which must be determined exclusively by reference to the question of consent.

The Government is in charge of their exploitation and has organised and regulated it by legislation.\n\n214.\n\nThe JVA starts with a reminder of this role by pointing out in the Preamble:\n\n\"*1. All mineral resources including Petroleum within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh are vested in the Republic of Bangladesh, and*\n\n*2. The Government has, under the Bangladesh Petroleum Act 1974 (Act No LXIX of 1974) (as amended up to date) the exclusive right and authority to explore, develop, exploit, produce, process, refine and market Petroleum Resources within the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh and it has also the exclusive right to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any persons for the purpose of any Petroleum Operations*\".\n\n215.\n\nAs described in Section 3 above, the development of the present project commenced when the parent company of the Claimant addressed a preliminary proposal of 12 April 1997 to the Bangladesh Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources. Eventually, this preliminary proposal was followed by a presentation to the Minister which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble of the JVA:\n\n\"*OPERATOR [i.e. the Claimant] made a request in 1998 to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Gvt. of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to develop Marginal & Non Producing Gas Fields of Bangladesh*\".\n\n216.\n\nThis led to negotiations, and on 25 May 1999 the Minister gave instructions for the implementation of the proposal. These instructions included notice of the following decision taken by the Government:\n\n\"*A Joint Venture Agreement must be executed between Bapex and Niko before a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is signed with Niko. The Managing Director of Bapex can conduct discussions with Niko regarding this*.\"139\n\nRespondents' Exhibit 11, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n217.\n\nThe evidence shows that the negotiations for this JVA were conducted under the close supervision of the Government, primarily the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, which intervened at various stages normally through Petrobangla, and gave directions, as described in Section 3 of this Decision. In the course of these negotiations the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources prepared a Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields which was submitted to the Prime Minister.140 Eventually the draft JVA was approved by the Prime Minister and BAPEX, again through Petrobangla, was instructed to sign the JVA with Niko.141\n\nRespondents' Exhibit 14, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\nFor details and quotations of the relevant directions see above Section 3.1.\n\n218.\n\nSimilarly, the negotiations for the GPSA, including in particular those for the price of the gas, were conducted in close coordination with the Ministry.142\n\nSee above Section 3.3.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Government of Bangladesh played a central role in the elaboration of the project and the negotiations of the two contracts.\n\n**6.1 The role of the Government of Bangladesh**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nAs the Claimant points out, the project is of direct interest to the Government: it concerns resources vested in the Republic.

Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights and powers of the Government to explore, develop, exploit, produce, process, refine, market petroleum in the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of Bangladesh and also to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any person/company for the purpose of any Petroleum Operation*\".\n\n225.\n\n**BAPEX** is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Petrobangla incorporated under the Companies Act of 1994.148 Its powers, functions and objects are governed by its memorandum of association and articles of association.149\n\nHT 1, pp. 42-43.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraphs 9-11; Respondents' Exhibit 4.\n\n226.\n\nIn the JVA BAPEX is described as\n\n\"*a wholly owned Company under Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (hereinafter called 'PETROBANGLA'), a statutory corporation wholly owned and established by the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh (hereinafter called the Government)*\".\n\n227.\n\nThe preamble of the JVA also sets out the position of BAPEX:\n\n\"*12. BAPEX is vested with all rights free from all encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever to assign, develop, produce, process, refine and distribute 100% (One hundred percent) of all Petroleum resources from or within the territory of the Marginal/Abandoned gas fields of Chattak & Feni.*\n\n[...]\n\n*15.

The responsibilities and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government in all relevant Articles, Annexes and Amendments under this JVA has been assign* [sic] *to Bapex*.\"\n\n228.\n\nThese factors indicate that Petrobangla and BAPEX exercise functions which are vested in the Government and which the Government has delegated to them.

The consequence, in the Claimant's position, is, as mentioned above, that \"*the GPSA is Bangladesh's contract, accordingly Bangladesh is compellable to arbitrate as party thereto*\".150 According to the Claimant, the same conclusion applies with respect to the JVA.151\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 81.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 85.\n\n230.\n\nBoth Petrobangla and BAPEX are creations of the legal order of Bangladesh. Their identity and legal status must be considered first of all under the law of that State.\n\n231.\n\nIt follows from the legal provisions in the law of Bangladesh which created Petrobangla and which govern its activities that it has the essential attributes of legal personality. It is clearly a distinct legal entity under the law of Bangladesh. The same applies with respect to BAPEX, incorporated under the Companies Act of 1994.152\n\nSee also the explanations of the Respondents' counsel on distinct legal entities under Bangladesh law at HT 1, pp. 40 et seq.\n\n232.\n\nThe situation under the law of Bangladesh has been summarised by the Respondents' counsel:\n\n\"..*. so we see that the Government is born of the constitution, a statutory public authority such as Petrobangla is recognised by the constitution as distinct from the Government and then when we go to the other part, that is the Companies Act, to the statute under which there is authority given to Petrobangla to form a company, there is another regime created and that is the company law regime, the companies regime, where Petrobangla may have an interest in equity but Bapex would be governed entirely by the Companies act and not by the statute under which it was born.*\"153\n\nHT1, pp. 42-43.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant insists on the control exercised by the Government over Petrobangla. It is correct and undisputed that the Government of Bangladesh exercises a high degree of control over Petrobangla. This control clearly results from the text of the 1985 Ordinance and other evidence produced. The Government subscribed to the authorised capital, its Board is composed of high ranking officers of, or other persons appointed by, the Government, and the Government may give instructions on questions of policy; as shown above the Government has exercised these powers in the context of the contract with Niko.\n\n234.\n\nSimilarly, BAPEX, as wholly owned subsidiary of Petrobangla, is fully under the control of that corporation and thus, indirectly, by the Government. Here, too, the Government has exercised its control, normally through Petrobangla.\n\n235.\n\nHowever, control by one legal entity over another does not extinguish the separation in law. Control by the Government over these two entities does not deprive them of their separate legal personality. They remain legally distinct from the Government.\n\n**6.3 The separate legal identity of Petrobangla and BAPEX**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Petrobangla and BAPEX \"*are mere instrumentalities or agents of the Government in respect of the subject contracts*\" and that such situation can be viewed as *\"a lack of separate identity*\" of the two entities.

Control by the Government over these two entities does not deprive them of their separate legal personality. They remain legally distinct from the Government.\n\n**6.4 Petrobangla and BAPEX as agents for Bangladesh**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that \"*private law principles of agency could be applied to find that the Government is a party to the Agreement*\".154 It describes BAPEX and Petrobangla as \"*agents of the Government in respect of the subject contracts*\".155\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 118.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 81.\n\n237.\n\nAt the hearing the Claimant explained that with respect to the JVA the \"*party is Bapex in its capacity* [as] *the agent for the Government*\" and the same *mutatis mutandis* with respect to the GPSA.156\n\nHT 1, p. 38.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondents deny that there is any statutory or contractual agency role of either Petrobangla or BAPEX.157\n\nHT 1, p. 56.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that BAPEX and Petrobangla are separate legal entities under the law of Bangladesh. If they had acted as agents for the State of Bangladesh, the party to the agreements would be that State and not the agent. At some stage the Claimant accepted this conclusion: \"*We would acknowledge that if they are agents of the Government, then the result would be that the Government is the party and the agents are just the agents. They would not be liable as principals*.\"158\n\nHT 1, p. 28.\n\n240.\n\nThis is indeed the correct position: Petrobangla and BAPEX can either be party to the agreements as principals, acting in their own name, or else act as agents for the Government and then it is the Government as the principal which is the party.\n\n241.\n\nSince both BAPEX and Petrobangla have been clearly identified as \"party\" to the agreements and not as agents for the Government, the Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla and BAPEX did not act as agents for and on behalf of the Government when concluding the JVA and the GPSA.\n\n**6.4 Petrobangla and BAPEX as agents for Bangladesh**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that \"*private law principles of agency could be applied to find that the Government is a party to the Agreement*\".154 It describes BAPEX and Petrobangla as \"*agents of the Government in respect of the subject contracts*\".155\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 118.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 81.\n\n237.\n\nAt the hearing the Claimant explained that with respect to the JVA the \"*party is Bapex in its capacity* [as] *the agent for the Government*\" and the same *mutatis mutandis* with respect to the GPSA.156\n\nHT 1, p. 38.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondents deny that there is any statutory or contractual agency role of either Petrobangla or BAPEX.157\n\nHT 1, p. 56.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that BAPEX and Petrobangla are separate legal entities under the law of Bangladesh. If they had acted as agents for the State of Bangladesh, the party to the agreements would be that State and not the agent. At some stage the Claimant accepted this conclusion: \"*We would acknowledge that if they are agents of the Government, then the result would be that the Government is the party and the agents are just the agents. They would not be liable as principals*.\"158\n\nHT 1, p. 28.\n\n240.\n\nThis is indeed the correct position: Petrobangla and BAPEX can either be party to the agreements as principals, acting in their own name, or else act as agents for the Government and then it is the Government as the principal which is the party.\n\n241.\n\nSince both BAPEX and Petrobangla have been clearly identified as \"party\" to the agreements and not as agents for the Government, the Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla and BAPEX did not act as agents for and on behalf of the Government when concluding the JVA and the GPSA.\n\n**6.5 Attribution**\n-------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a theory of attribution with the objective of establishing jurisdiction with respect to the Government of Bangladesh. The Claimant writes:\n\n\"*Niko submits that the acts of Petrobangla and Bapex in making and breaching the GPSA should be attributed to the Government for the purposes of this arbitration..*.\"159\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 107.\n\n243.\n\nIn this context the Claimant referred to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission as \"*helpful in assessing the matter*\".160\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 117.\n\n244.\n\nSince it has been accepted that Petrobangla and BAPEX are agencies or instrumentalities of Bangladesh, their acts may well be attributed to the State of Bangladesh, creating international responsibility of that State. It is on this basis that, for instance the arbitral tribunal in the case *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh*161 considered that, at first sight at least, Petrobangla appeared to be part of the State under Bangladeshi law, despite its distinct legal personality.162\n\n*Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7 (Kaufmann-Kohler, Schreuer, Otton), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007, ICSID Review (2007).\n\nIbid., paragraphs 145-146.\n\n245.\n\nSuch attribution is relevant when it comes to determining the question of whether a State has violated its international obligations under general public international law or under a treaty. In that context, the question is relevant also for determining jurisdiction under a treaty by which the State accepts to arbitrate disputes concerning the violation of its treaty obligations; i.e., violations committed by itself or by conduct attributed to it.\n\n246.\n\nHowever, the issue to be considered here is not the responsibility of Bangladesh for acts by Petrobangla and BAPEX but the question whether Bangladesh has consented to arbitrate with the Claimant. This is a matter for which the arbitration agreement must be considered and the entities which are party to it.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that another ICSID tribunal, appointed not in a treaty but a contract dispute,163 applied rules on attribution in the context of its analysis on jurisdiction. That tribunal, relying on the conclusions of the *Saipem* tribunal and other considerations, concluded that Petrobangla was an organ of the State164 and that \"*Petrobangla's actions are attributable to Bangladesh*\"165 and found that it had jurisdiction with respect to a contract to which Petrobangla but not Bangladesh was a party. The question whether and under what circumstances attribution may be a sufficient basis for assuming jurisdiction in a contract dispute was not critical to the decision in the *Chevron* case, since the Government had concluded with the investor a contract containing an ICSID clause and the *Chevron* tribunal found that the contract which the investor had concluded with Petrobangla was related to the contract concluded by the Government.166\n\n*Chevron Bangladesh Block Twelve, Ltd. and Chevron Bangladesh Blocks Thirteen and Fourteen, Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/10, Award of 17 May 2010 (Buergenthal, Beechey and Nariman), ICSID Review (2011), pp.256-294.\n\nIbid., paragraph 148.\n\nIbid., paragraphs 148, 171.\n\nIbid., paragraph 134.\n\n248.\n\nIn the present case the Government has not signed any agreement with the investor and has not on its own behalf agreed to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal finds no basis on which an attribution of actions of BAPEX and Petrobangla to Bangladesh could justify the conclusion that the State of Bangladesh has agreed to arbitrate the present contract disputes with Niko.\n\n**6.5 Attribution**\n-------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a theory of attribution with the objective of establishing jurisdiction with respect to the Government of Bangladesh. The Claimant writes:\n\n\"*Niko submits that the acts of Petrobangla and Bapex in making and breaching the GPSA should be attributed to the Government for the purposes of this arbitration..*.\"159\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 107.\n\n243.\n\nIn this context the Claimant referred to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission as \"*helpful in assessing the matter*\".160\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 117.\n\n244.\n\nSince it has been accepted that Petrobangla and BAPEX are agencies or instrumentalities of Bangladesh, their acts may well be attributed to the State of Bangladesh, creating international responsibility of that State. It is on this basis that, for instance the arbitral tribunal in the case *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh*161 considered that, at first sight at least, Petrobangla appeared to be part of the State under Bangladeshi law, despite its distinct legal personality.162\n\n*Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7 (Kaufmann-Kohler, Schreuer, Otton), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures of 21 March 2007, ICSID Review (2007).\n\nIbid., paragraphs 145-146.\n\n245.\n\nSuch attribution is relevant when it comes to determining the question of whether a State has violated its international obligations under general public international law or under a treaty. In that context, the question is relevant also for determining jurisdiction under a treaty by which the State accepts to arbitrate disputes concerning the violation of its treaty obligations; i.e., violations committed by itself or by conduct attributed to it.\n\n246.\n\nHowever, the issue to be considered here is not the responsibility of Bangladesh for acts by Petrobangla and BAPEX but the question whether Bangladesh has consented to arbitrate with the Claimant. This is a matter for which the arbitration agreement must be considered and the entities which are party to it.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that another ICSID tribunal, appointed not in a treaty but a contract dispute,163 applied rules on attribution in the context of its analysis on jurisdiction. That tribunal, relying on the conclusions of the *Saipem* tribunal and other considerations, concluded that Petrobangla was an organ of the State164 and that \"*Petrobangla's actions are attributable to Bangladesh*\"165 and found that it had jurisdiction with respect to a contract to which Petrobangla but not Bangladesh was a party. The question whether and under what circumstances attribution may be a sufficient basis for assuming jurisdiction in a contract dispute was not critical to the decision in the *Chevron* case, since the Government had concluded with the investor a contract containing an ICSID clause and the *Chevron* tribunal found that the contract which the investor had concluded with Petrobangla was related to the contract concluded by the Government.166\n\n*Chevron Bangladesh Block Twelve, Ltd. and Chevron Bangladesh Blocks Thirteen and Fourteen, Ltd. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/10, Award of 17 May 2010 (Buergenthal, Beechey and Nariman), ICSID Review (2011), pp.256-294.\n\nIbid., paragraph 148.\n\nIbid., paragraphs 148, 171.\n\nIbid., paragraph 134.\n\n248.\n\nIn the present case the Government has not signed any agreement with the investor and has not on its own behalf agreed to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal finds no basis on which an attribution of actions of BAPEX and Petrobangla to Bangladesh could justify the conclusion that the State of Bangladesh has agreed to arbitrate the present contract disputes with Niko.\n\n**6.6 Consent**\n---------------\n\n249.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that, alternatively, \"*the circumstances demonstrate an objective intention by the parties that the Government would be bound to the Agreements*\".167 This argument seems to be based on \"legitimate expectations\" that the JVA obligations, \"*which only the Government and Petrobangla could give*\", would be met. The Claimant states:\n\n\"*These expectations override countervailing considerations such as that the Government was not explicitly named as a Party in the GPSA. The reality is that the JVA contains many obligations on the part of the Government, leading inexorably to the conclusion that it was in substance the Government's agreement. [...] the Government's control and approval of the Agreements also constitutes the Government's agreement to be bound by the Agreements and/or to arbitrate disputes connected with them*.\"168\n\nC-MJ.1, paragraph 136.\n\nIbid.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Government was closely involved in the negotiations of the agreements. The subject matter fell within the domain of its prerogatives, and it had control over the two entities. It also expressly approved the agreements.\n\n251.\n\nHowever, the Government chose to implement the project through agreements which it did not conclude itself. Instead, it delegated the necessary powers to Petrobangla and BAPEX. These entities, legally distinct from the Government, concluded the Agreements. Through this choice of the contracting parties the Government clearly showed its intent not to be party to the Agreements. The delegation has been expressed in a particularly clear fashion in the preamble to the JVA, as quoted above.\n\n252.\n\nParagraph 14 of the Preamble is of particular importance both for the question of jurisdiction and for the implementation of the JVA. It demonstrates that the parties to the JVA were aware that BAPEX was exercising functions vested in the Government of which some had been delegated to Petrobangla. BAPEX gave assurances that this was the case and the Government approved the Agreement, including these assurances.\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimant was fully aware of this situation when it concluded the agreements. Paragraph 14 of the Preamble makes it quite clear that the Agreement is concluded with BAPEX, as the assignee of the \"*responsibilities and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government*\", and not with the Government. This gives meaning to BAPEX's warranty that \"*it has acquired from Petrobangla and the Government the requisite approvals to execute this JVA*\".\n\n254.\n\nThe JVA, as it was concluded, entitles the Claimant to rely on the warranty of BAPEX, in particular with respect to the scope of the obligations assumed by it. But it also prevents the Claimant from disregarding the assignment of responsibilities and obligations to BAPEX and from arguing that the true party to the agreement is the Government and Petrobangla.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimant accepted this structure of the agreements, just as the Bangladeshi parties have accepted that the Canadian group concluded the agreements through a subsidiary registered in Barbados. The Tribunal has already held169 that, in the absence of any abuse of this corporate structure, the contracting parties are bound by their acceptance of the chosen contracting partners. This goes for the Respondents with respect to the Claimant's company in Barbados; it also goes for the choice of the contracting parties on the Bangladesh side.\n\nSee Section 4.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to show any intent of the Government of Bangladesh to be bound by the ICSID arbitration agreement; nor may any such intent be implied in the circumstances. Bangladesh has not consented to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal, therefore, does not have jurisdiction over the State of Bangladesh in the present case. The People's Republic of Bangladesh will no longer be a Respondent in these proceedings.\n\n**6.6 Consent**\n---------------\n\n249.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that, alternatively, \"*the circumstances demonstrate an objective intention by the parties that the Government would be bound to the Agreements*\".167 This argument seems to be based on \"legitimate expectations\" that the JVA obligations, \"*which only the Government and Petrobangla could give*\", would be met.

Bangladesh has not consented to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal, therefore, does not have jurisdiction over the State of Bangladesh in the present case. The People's Republic of Bangladesh will no longer be a Respondent in these proceedings.\n\n**7.

JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO BAPEX AND PETROBANGLA - THE ISSUE OF DESIGNATION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**7.1 The issue and the Parties' positions**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nPetrobangla is a named party to and has signed the GSPA; BAPEX is a named party and has signed both the GSPA and the JVA. The Respondents do not question that both have consented in writing to arbitrate with Niko under the respective agreements. Rather, the Respondents' principal objection to jurisdiction specific to BAPEX and Petrobangla concerns a particular requirement under Article 25 the ICSID Convention that relates to the capacity of BAPEX and Petrobangla to be party to an ICSID arbitration.\n\n258.\n\nOn the side of the host State, jurisdiction of ICSID is limited by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to Contracting States and to \"*any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State*\". However, the extension to subdivisions and agencies is qualified by the words \"*designated to the Centre by that State*\". Moreover, Article 25(3) requires that the Contracting State must approve the consent of such designated agencies or constituent subdivisions in each case, unless the Contracting State has notified the Centre that no such approval is necessary.\n\n259.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondents accept that the consent of BAPEX and of Petrobangla to ICSID arbitration was approved by Bangladesh, but argue that there was no designation. They argue that four conditions must be met for a designation to become effective: (i) there must be a written designation, (ii) it must emanate from the State and specifically the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (iii) there must be a clear intention to designate and (iv) the designation must be sent to the Centre.170 The Respondents nevertheless concede that the document containing the designation may be \"*physically sent by the state or by someone else*\".171 According to the Respondents these requirements were not met in the case at hand.\n\nHT 1, pp. 95-99.\n\nHT1, p. 99. The passage continued as follows: \"Then that could be the case where one of the two parties to the agreement, to the contract, to the investment contract could send it to the Centre but it must be a document from the State.\"\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimant on its side accepts that designation is required under Article 25(1), but submits that the Government's approval of the JVA and the GPSA \"*amount to the designation*\".172 According to the Claimant, this designation may then be communicated to the Centre by the filing of the request for arbitration, as this was done in the present case by the two RfAs.173\n\nHT 1, p. 90.\n\nHT 1, p. 91.\n\n261.\n\nThe status of Petrobangla and BAPEX under the law of Bangladesh has been discussed in the previous Section of this Decision. Both are legal entities distinct from the Government, but they are controlled by the Government and perform some functions within domains reserved for the Government. In the discussion about designation for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention their status as agencies of Bangladesh has not given rise to serious controversy and is not contested by the Respondents.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the circumstances under which the two agreements concluded by BAPEX and Petrobangla were negotiated and executed. It noted that both agreements were explicitly approved by the Government of Bangladesh in writing.174 No exception was made in the approval which thus extended to the arbitration clause. Since the Respondents have not questioned that Bangladesh approved the consent to arbitration by Petrobangla and BAPEX, the Tribunal has no difficulty in accepting that the requirement of approval by the State under Article 25(3) has indeed been complied with.\n\nSee above paragraphs 41, 42 and 82.\n\n263.\n\nThe requirement of Article 25 which remains controversial specifically in relation to Petrobangla and BAPEX is that of their designation as agencies of Bangladesh. The controversial issues are (i) what is meant in Article 25(1) by \"*designated to the Centre by that State*\" and (ii) whether in the present case the requirements have been met.\n\n**7.1 The issue and the Parties' positions**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nPetrobangla is a named party to and has signed the GSPA; BAPEX is a named party and has signed both the GSPA and the JVA.

This must be approached applying the canons of treaty interpretation found in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969,175 namely (to paraphrase): natural and ordinary meaning, object and purpose, context, and, where necessary to resolve an ambiguity, reference to the preparatory documents.\n\n1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\n**7.2 The requirement of designation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nWith respect to the first question, that concerning the meaning of Designation in Article 25(1), it is necessary to consider, as a matter of law, the proper construction to be placed on the requirement of \"designation\". This must be approached applying the canons of treaty interpretation found in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969,175 namely (to paraphrase): natural and ordinary meaning, object and purpose, context, and, where necessary to resolve an ambiguity, reference to the preparatory documents.\n\n1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\n7.2.1 The term \"designation\" as distinguished from \"notification\"\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the term \"designation\", as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, is: \"*the action of choosing someone to hold an office or post*\". Similarly, the Merriam Webster Dictionary proposes as definition: *\"to indicate and set apart for a specific purpose, office, or duty\".*\n\n266.\n\nThe ICSID Convention uses the term \"designation\" on a number of occasions to denote official actions undertaken by the Contracting States vis-\u00e0-vis the Centre in relation to the treaty rights and obligations of the States. Thus, Contracting States may *designate* a representative to the Administrative Council;176 they may *designate* persons to the ICSID Panels of Arbitrators and Conciliators under Articles 12 to 16; and they may also *designate* courts or authorities competent for the enforcement of arbitral awards under Article 54.\n\nAccording to Article 4 each governor and alternate governor of the Bank appointed by a Contracting State shall be ex officio its representative and alternate representative, in the absence of a contrary \"designation\".\n\n267.\n\nThus, the critical element, so far as concerns the ordinary meaning of the term and the use in the ICSID Convention, is the action of choice or selection. The act of designating requires both a subject and an object.\n\n268.\n\nWithin Article 25(1), the subject is the Contracting State. The object is its \"*constituent subdivision or agency*\"; since the two entities considered here are agencies, this term will be used for simplification when reference is made to the designation of constituent subdivisions and agencies under Article 25(1).\n\n269.\n\nThe purpose for which the agency is chosen or selected, as stated by Article 25(1), is to engage the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of a \"*legal dispute arising directly out of an investment... which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre*\"; or, more simply, to designate the agency as capable of becoming itself a party to an ICSID arbitration.\n\n270.\n\nThe use of the expression \"designate\" in Article 25(1) corresponds to that in Chapter I, Section 4, Articles 12 to 16. These articles repeatedly use the expression \"*designate to*\" in various forms, for instance \"*designate to each Panel*\" or \"*designated to a Panel*\" (Article 13(1) and (2)) or \"*designate to serve on the Panels*\" (Article (14(1)). In this context, it seems clear that, \"designate to\" means choosing a person for the function of serving on a Panel; it does not concern the communication of this choice. Indeed, when Article 13(1), for instance, provides that a \"*State may designate to each Panel four persons*...\", what is meant obviously is not that the State makes a communication to each Panel; it merely means that the designated persons have been chosen by that State to appear on the lists described as \"Panel\" and to serve in this function.\n\n271.\n\nIn Chapter I, Section 4 of the Convention, a different expression is used for the act of communicating the State's choice to ICSID. Article 16(3) provides:\n\n\"*All **designations** shall be **notified** to the Secretary-General and shall take effect from the date on which the notification is received*.\" (emphasis added)\n\n272.\n\nThus, a clear distinction is made in Chapter I, Section 4 of the Convention between \"designated\" and \"notified\". The first of these terms concerns the choice of the person for a specific function (Articles 12 to 16(2) deal with this choice); a different term is then used with respect to the communication of this choice in Article 16(3). The act of communicating the choice to the ICSID Secretary-General is not included in the term \"designation\" as used in this Section.\n\n273.\n\nThe same distinction can be found in Article 54(2) which provides:\n\n\"*Each Contracting State shall **notify** the Secretary-General of the **designation** of the competent court or other authority.*..\" (emphasis added)\n\n274.\n\nHere, too, two different terms are used and indicate a clear distinction between the designation of a court or authority, i.e. the choice for a certain function, and the communication of this choice to the Centre by way of a notification.\n\n275.\n\nThe terms \"notify\" and \"notification\" appear at a number of other places in the Convention, describing a formal act of communication. Indeed, the term appears at several occasions in Article 25. Thus, when a Contracting State intends to dispense with the requirement of having to approve the consent of a constituent subdivision or agency, it \"notifies the Centre\" that no such approval is required. Similarly, if a Contracting State wishes to make known that it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre a class or classes of disputes, it may \"notify\" this position to the Centre and the Secretary-General transmits such \"notification\" to all Contracting States (Article 25(4)).\n\n276.\n\nWith respect to agencies, Article 25(1) uses the term designation but does not mention notification. If the term designation is understood as being distinct from notification, the question arises whether notification or any other form of communication to the Centre is required, a question that shall be addressed later in this section.\n\n7.2.1 The term \"designation\" as distinguished from \"notification\"\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the term \"designation\", as defined in the Oxford English Dictionary, is: \"*the action of choosing someone to hold an office or post*\".

If the term designation is understood as being distinct from notification, the question arises whether notification or any other form of communication to the Centre is required, a question that shall be addressed later in this section.\n\n7.2.2 The purposes of designation under Article 25(1)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nWhen the concept of designation first arose during the preparation of the ICSID Convention, it was related to the idea of informing investors about the entities on the side of the State with which they could contract. The idea was first introduced by a proposal of the representative for the United Kingdom at the Legal Committee Proceedings, 25 November 1964. The proposal contained the following passage:\n\n\"... *each State party to the Convention could deposit a list indicating the bodies regarded by it as 'political subdivisions' for the purposes of this Convention*.\"177\n\nProposal of the representative for the UK at the Legal Committee Proceedings of 25 November 1964, quoted in *Cambodia Power Company v. Kingdom of Cambodia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/18 (Kaplan, Beechey and Landau), Decision on Jurisdiction of 22 March 2011 (hereinafter **Cambodia Power Decision**), p. 247; see also History of the ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, Volume II (hereinafter **History of the ICSID Convention**), pp. 667, 702; Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 247.\n\n278.\n\nSummarising the discussions that led to the inclusion of the designation requirement, Schreuer explains:\n\n\"*The primary purpose of the requirement to designate entities that might become parties in ICSID proceedings to the Centre is to give an investor an assurance that he or she is dealing with an authorized entity. In other words, investors are given advance notice of with whom they may deal*.\"178\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 248; in the same context Schreuer also mentions a possible \"*secondary purpose*\"; but immediately discards it as not very plausible: \"*A secondary purpose of designation may be a desire on the part of the State to preserve control over semi-autonomous entities in their dealings with foreign investors. But this purpose is more readily achieved by withholding approval of consent to jurisdiction under Art. 25(3)...\"*\n\n279.\n\nWhile information to potential investors may be a useful objective for publicising the identity of designated agencies, in the view of this Tribunal, this objective can hardly justify a requirement of designation as it is provided by Article 25(1). Assurance of \"*dealing with an authorised entity*\" and \"*advance notice*\" may well be obtained by other means and it is difficult to see what interest investors could have in the restriction on eligibility of an agency by the requirement of designation.\n\n280.\n\nThe text of Article 25(1) suggests that the principal purpose of designation in the context of that article is a different one: designation enables the agency to become party to \"*a legal dispute* [\u2026] *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre*\", i.e., to become party to an ICSID arbitration proceeding. In the list of \"*Designations by Contracting States Regarding Constituent Subdivisions and Agencies*\", published by ICSID (the **List of Designations**),179 it is stated that the subdivisions and agencies have been designated \"*as competent to become parties to disputes submitted to the Centre*\". In the Tribunal's understanding it is this \"competence\" (one may also use the term \"capacity\") which is created by the designation.\n\nICSID Official Document ICSID/8-C, part of ICSID Official Document ICSID/8, \"*Contracting States and Measures Taken by Them for the Purpose of the Convention*\", available on the ICSID website.\n\n281.\n\nThe Convention is concluded by States, acting as subjects of international law. It provides for arbitration of certain types of disputes between these Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States. Constituent subdivisions and agencies of these States normally are not subjects of international law and thus are not \"competent\" to conclude, on the side of the host State, arbitration agreements containing an ICSID dispute settlement clause and become party to an ICSID arbitration. It was therefore necessary for the Convention to provide expressly for the possibility that constituent subdivisions and agencies, as entities existing under domestic law, could acquire such competence or capacity to become party to ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n282.\n\nDesignation of an agency thus has as a very important consequence that the distinct legal personality of the agency under domestic law is recognised at the level of ICSID.\n\n283.\n\nBy creating in favour of an agency of domestic law a distinct capacity at the level of the Convention, designation has the advantage for the State of limiting its legal and financial exposure with respect to contracts concluded by the agency. The distinct legal personality of the agency thus is recognised in a similar manner (and with similar limitations) as the recognition of a distinct legal personality of a corporation on the investor's side.180\n\nThis does not exclude that the host State, as a Contracting Party to the Convention, may have a general obligation under Article 53 to ensure compliance with ICSID awards. In this sense, see Schreuer at Article 53, paragraph 15, citing Broches, \"*Awards Rendered Pursuant to the ICSID Convention: Binding Force, Finality, Recognition, Enforcement, Execution*\", 2 ICSID Review (1987) 287, 298.\n\n7.2.2 The purposes of designation under Article 25(1)\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nWhen the concept of designation first arose during the preparation of the ICSID Convention, it was related to the idea of informing investors about the entities on the side of the State with which they could contract.

In particular it does not specify whether designation must occur specifically for each arbitration agreement concluded by an agency on an *ad hoc* basis, or whether it can be made generally for certain categories of projects or for all agreements concluded by the agency in question.\n\n285.\n\nThe matter was addressed during the preparations of the Convention. The question was raised whether designations should be made for a particular purpose or in general. Mr Aron Broches responded that this should be left to the State concerned.181 This can be taken as an indication that the lack of determination in Article 25(1) is intentional. It is left to the State whether it wishes to designate an agency for a specific investment or generally.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, vol. II, p. 857.\n\n286.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the practice of States to the extent to which this practice is known. Some information about this practice is provided by the Secretariat of ICSID. On its List of Designations one finds both territorial subdivisions of the designating States and State corporations such as national petroleum corporations, utilities, mining corporations, etc.\n\n287.\n\nThe entities on the List of Designations all seem to have been designated in a general manner for an unlimited number of agreements. However, the List of Designations concludes by a Note indicating:\n\n\"Ad hoc *designation and notification made by Contracting States pursuant to Article 25(1) and 25(3) are excluded from this listing*.\"\n\n288.\n\nOne must conclude that there are cases in which States indeed choose to proceed not by general designation but in an *ad hoc* manner, designating an agency for a specific project or in an otherwise limited manner, such as a particular dispute or a particular contract.\n\n289.\n\nThe List of Designations does not indicate that any reservations were made against the practice of *ad hoc* designations mentioned in the list; nor is there any other indication that this practice has given rise to any objections or expression of doubt. Schreuer confirms - and supports by examples - that it is \"*open to states to make designations not only in general terms but also on the occasion of specific investment projects*\".182 He adds that \"*it is entirely possible for the designation to be made after consent is given or even after a dispute has arisen*\"; but it must occur before proceedings are instituted.183\n\nSchreuer, paragraph 255 at Article 25.\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 258. At Article 25, paragraphs 260-261, Schreuer qualifies this statement by referring to the *Klockner v. Cameroon* case where, under unusual circumstances after the commencement of the arbitration, Cameroon designated an entity which originally had been under the control of the investor but, during the course of the arbitration, became a constituent subdivision of Cameroon and was then designated as such.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that *ad hoc* designations, limited to a specific investment and the corresponding arbitration agreement, meet the requirements of Article 25(1).\n\n291.\n\nThis conclusion leads to another: By their very nature and as shown by the absence of their publication in the List of Designations, *ad hoc* designations are not given general publicity which, as mentioned above, is considered by some as one of the purposes of designation.184. Since *ad hoc* designations are accepted as a valid form of designation, one must conclude that the publicity objective may be useful, but is not a necessary feature of designation.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that *ad hoc* designations are not accessible to the public. The ICSID website reveals that *ad hoc* designations are accessible upon request to the ICSID Secretariat. See the ICSID website (www.worldbank.org/icsid). In the \"Members States\" section under the sub-navigation menu \"Search Membership\", there are hyperlinks for each State, and under these, the following statement is found under the tab entitled \"*Designations and Notifications \"For information of any ad hoc designation or notification made by this Contracting State pursuant to Article 25(1) and (3) of the Convention, please contact the Secretariat*.\".\n\n7.2.3 Types of designation - General and *ad hoc* designation\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nArticle 25(1) does not prescribe how a designation, i.e., a designating act, must be made.

As is the case with respect to the choice between general and *ad hoc* designation, the choice of the form is left to the State concerned.\n\n293.\n\nThis question of the form of the designation is distinct from that about who can make a designation. In this respect there is little doubt possible and apparently no controversy: the designation in the sense of the designating act has to be made by the relevant Contracting State.\n\n294.\n\nConcerning the form in which the designation is made, there seems to be little information available about the manner which States adopt for the act of designation. ICSID's List of Designations indicates the date of the designation but does not provide any indication about the form which it took.\n\n295.\n\nIt is not inconceivable that a State may designate an agency at the time of its creation, as part of the powers conferred upon it by the State. Thus, when an agency is granted the powers to conclude investment agreements, the designation to enter into ICSID arbitration agreements might be included in these powers. Schreuer refers to a law in Sri Lanka as an example of such designation by legislation. Schreuer also mentions the possibility of including a general designation of an agency in a bilateral investment treaty.185\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.\n\n296.\n\nOther forms of designation may be found. The choice may differ in cases of general and *ad hoc* designations. Such other forms may include informal methods, since Article 25(1), as just explained, does not prescribe any particular formality for the designating act.\n\n297.\n\nSome confirmation for the absence of strict requirements of form may be found in the Institution Rules 2(1)(b) and (c) which require that a request for arbitration shall\n\n\"*(b) state, if one of the parties is a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, that it has been designated to the Centre by that State pursuant to Article 25(1) of the Convention;*\n\n*(c) indicate the date of consent and the instrument in which it is recorded, including, if one party is a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, similar data on the approval of such consent by that State unless it had notified the Centre that no such approval is requested.*\"\n\n298.\n\nThis Tribunal is aware that this Rule concerns simply the requirements which must be met so that the Centre registers a request for arbitration. The Rule does not regulate the criteria which must be applied by an arbitral tribunal to which the case will be referred to establish its own jurisdiction. It is nevertheless significant to note the difference, at the stage of the commencement of the arbitration, in the treatment between *designation* and *consent*. With respect to consent by an agency, the request for arbitration must identify both the specific instrument in which consent is recorded and the instrument which records the State's approval. With respect to designation, the requirements are simpler: it is sufficient that the request for arbitration state that designation occurred; no specific instrument recording designation is required.\n\n299.\n\nThe absence of a prescribed form for designation must have a further consequence: since neither Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention nor the Institution Rules, nor any other text governing the requirement of designation prescribes a specific form for designation, implicit designation must be possible. Such implicit designation may be accepted when the intention to designate clearly appears under the circumstances and is not contradicted by other indications.\n\n300.\n\nSince, as mentioned above, designations are made by the Contracting States, it is the conduct of the State which is relevant and not that of the agency which is designated. As pointed out by Schreuer, \"*the entity concerned cannot designate itself*\".186\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.\n\n301.\n\nIn the view of the present Tribunal, a particularly strong case of implicit designation occurs when the State expressly and formally approves in writing that one of its agencies enters into an investment agreement containing an ICSID clause. Since designation has as its purpose and objective to confer on the agency the competence or capacity to become party to an ICSID arbitration, the approval by the State of an ICSID arbitration commitment by one of its agencies presupposes that this agency has the capacity to conclude such a commitment, which means that it must be capable to be a party to an ICSID arbitration.\n\n302.\n\nIf the State has not already conferred this capacity on the agency by an earlier (general) designation, the approval necessarily must include the intention to confer this capacity on the agency by an *ad hoc* designation. Assuming the contrary would mean that the State, when granting its approval of the agency's consent, intended to leave this approval without effect. It would require very strong evidence to establish that a State intended to act in such contradictory fashion. Even then, it is doubtful that such a contrary intention should be given effect in view of the overriding principle requiring good faith conduct.\n\n7.2.4 The form of designation and the question of implicit designation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nArticle 25(1) does not specifically prescribe any requirement of form which a State must observe when designating an agency in the sense understood here.

Since designation has as its purpose and objective to confer on the agency the competence or capacity to become party to an ICSID arbitration, the approval by the State of an ICSID arbitration commitment by one of its agencies presupposes that this agency has the capacity to conclude such a commitment, which means that it must be capable to be a party to an ICSID arbitration.\n\n302.\n\nIf the State has not already conferred this capacity on the agency by an earlier (general) designation, the approval necessarily must include the intention to confer this capacity on the agency by an *ad hoc* designation.

It would require very strong evidence to establish that a State intended to act in such contradictory fashion. Even then, it is doubtful that such a contrary intention should be given effect in view of the overriding principle requiring good faith conduct.\n\n7.2.5 Communicating the State's designation to the Centre\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nDesignations, as stated in the ICSID List of Designations, render agencies \"*competent to become parties to disputes submitted to the Centre*\". Such competence is exercised in the course of specific proceedings, when a request for arbitration is submitted to the Centre and the agency appears before an arbitral tribunal. In order to be effective, the competence must be known by the Centre before it is exercised. This competence therefore must be made known to the Centre.\n\n304.\n\nWhen the designation is notified by a Contracting State by way of an official communication to the Centre and entered on the List of Designations, the issue is not problematic. These designations demonstrably have been communicated to the Centre and entry on the List is a record that such communication occurred. However, entry on the List of Designations is not a requirement under Article 25(1). The question therefore is whether and under what circumstances an arbitral tribunal may find that a designation was validly brought to the Centre's attention in a form different from official communication.\n\n305.\n\nIt seems that in some cases \"general notoriety\" of the designation was considered as an admissible form of communication. Thus Schreuer wrote that designation \"*can take any form that gives it general notoriety and comes to the Centre's attention*\".187 That sentence suggests that the designation requirement of Article 25(1) would be met for instance by (1) an enactment of a Contracting State which confers on a national agency power to conclude investment agreements including ICSID arbitration clauses, provided that (2) the enactment has \"general notoriety\", for instance by publication in the official gazette of that State, and (3) that as part of investment legislation of a Contracting State this publication may be assumed to have come to the Centre's attention.\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.\n\n306.\n\nAn example of \"*public notoriety*\" was given in the case of *Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company v. Arab Republic of Egypt General Authority for Investment and Free Zones*.188 The tribunal held that the designation was contained in an investment law (Law No. 43). Its publication conferred \"*public notoriety*\" to the designation and thus brought the designation to the Centre's attention.189\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/89/1, Order Noting Discontinuance of 24 June 1993 (Seidl-Hohenveldern, Abdel A'al and Bucher).\n\nFor the concept of \"public notoriety\" in the *Cambodia Power* case, see below.\n\n307.\n\nGiven the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal need not decide whether \"*public notoriety*\" is an adequate or admissible form of \"*communication*\". What is relevant here is that the views expressed in this context require that the designation must come \"*to the Centre's attention*\".\n\n308.\n\nThe question has been examined in some detail by Chittharanjan Felix Amerasinghe, a well-known international lawyer who during his three decades of employment at the World Bank was involved in the early development of ICSID. In an article that appeared in 1979 he clearly distinguished between designation and communication and, when considering the words \"designated to the Centre\", explained that:\n\n\"*Normally, this would mean that there should be some kind of formal communication of the designation to the Centre*.\"190\n\nAmerasinghe, \"*The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*\", 19 Indian Journal of International Law 166, 188 (1979) (hereinafter **Amerasinghe**).\n\n309.\n\nAfter considering some situation which in his view did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1) he continued:\n\n\"*On the other hand, it is a moot question whether there must always be an official communication of the designation to the Centre. It is arguable that where there was a clear intention on the part of the Contracting State to file the designation with the Centre at the time the designation was made but the actual communication is not made by that State to the Centre, it is adequate if instead of there being a formal communication of the designation to the Centre by the State it is brought to the attention of the Centre in some way whether by the State concerned or by one of the parties to the consent agreement provided this is done before the initial intention is changed*.\"191\n\nAmerasinghe, p. 188.\n\n310.\n\nAs a foundation for his conclusion, Amerasinghe notably referred to the drafting history of the Convention. He remarked that early drafts had proposed the grant of *locus standi* to political subdivisions or agencies of a State *without a requirement of designation by that State*. Exploring why that had not been thought sufficient, he noted that delegates had perceived that a designation would be useful to avoid \"*disputes as to whether an entity was a 'political subdivision*'\" and that it was \"*difficult to see how a party that was not a Contracting State could be included in the jurisdiction of the Centre*\" by leaving it to the Centre, or to arbitrators, to decide the matter in the absence of a confirmation by the State. He also referred to the comment that States could \"*avoid the risk of consent by a political subdivision*\" by requiring designation.192\n\nAmerasinghe, p. 187.\n\n311.\n\nWhen concluding that \"formal communication\" could be replaced by some other way in which designation can be brought to the attention of the Centre, Amerasinghe assumes the predicate of \"*a clear intention on the part of the Contracting State to file the designation*\".193 It is a question of fact which shall be considered below whether, in the circumstances of the present case such a clear intention is found to have existed. When determining whether such an intention existed, the conduct of the State must be considered and interpreted in good faith. As explained above, such an intention cannot be denied by the State in a case when it proposes and approves the conclusion of an ICSID arbitration clause by its agencies. Such proposal and approval by the State can be understood only in the sense that the State ensures to the investor that, on its side, there are no obstacles to the effectiveness of the arbitration agreement.\n\nAmerasinghe, p. 188.\n\n312.\n\nThese explanations by Amerasinghe have been referred to by Schreuer who wrote:\n\n\"*The notification of an agreement with the investor containing the designation is enough. It has been argued that where there is a clear intention to designate, it does not matter how and through whom the communication reaches the Centre*.\"194\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.\n\n313.\n\nSchreuer does not seem to disagree with this position. In the quoted passage he seems to take the view that designation can take any form but must come \"*to the Centre's attention*\".195\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252; the reference to the position of Amerasinghe is immediately followed by a reference to the view of Broches who stated that designation could be dispensed with if it is proven that the entity is an agency or constituent subdivision of the State. When Schreuer adds that it \"*seems that this goes too far*\", he obviously means the opinion of Broches and not that of Amerasinghe.\n\n314.\n\nAmerasinghe's view has been confirmed by the arbitral tribunal in the *East Kalimantan* case. Relying on the quoted passage in Schreuer's book, the tribunal there found:\n\n\"*The form and channel of communication do not matter, provided that the intention to designate is clearly established.*\n\n[...]\n\n*Consequently, the designation requirement may in particular be deemed fulfilled when a document that emanates from the State is filed with the request for arbitration and shows that State's intent to name a specific entity as a constituent subdivision of agency for the purposes of Article 25(1)*.\"196\n\n*Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. PT Kaltim Prima Coal, Rio Tinto PLC and others*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/3 (Kaufmann-Kohler, Hwang, van den Berg), Award of 28 December 2009 (hereinafter **East Kalimantan Award**), paragraphs 192-193.\n\n315.\n\nThe opinion expressed by Amerasinghe and shared by the *East Kalimantan* tribunal also has implications for the second of the two aspects that must be considered here: *who* must communicate the designation to the Centre?\n\n316.\n\nThe relevant passage of Article 25(1) reads \"*designated to the Centre by that State*\". It is clear that the agency must be designated \"by the State\". It is also clear that the designation must get \"to the Centre\". However, given the distinction operated by the Convention between \"designated\" and \"notified\" and the manner in which the term \"notified\" is used in Article 25 and elsewhere in the Convention,197 it cannot be assumed that, in Article 25(1) the word \"designated\" includes the word \"notified\" while in Article 4 and in Article 54 designation and notification are two distinct acts.\n\nSee above Section 7.2.1.\n\n317.\n\nOne must conclude that the words \"*designated to the Centre*\" do not prescribe the method of implementation, i.e. the manner in which the designation is communicated to the Centre and in particular by whom this is done.\n\n318.\n\nIn other words, the intervention of the State is required for the designation but is not necessarily required for the communication to the Centre. Understood in this sense, the designation requirement in Article 25(1) is complied with if the agency in question is \"designated by the State and such designation is communicated to the Centre\". This conclusion is in line with the text of the provision and with the authors and cases which have been brought to the attention of the Tribunal198 and to which reference has been made above.\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, at paragraph 252, records the argument that \"*it does not matter how and through whom the communication reaches the Centre*\". This is in line with the conclusion reached by this Tribunal. However, Schreuer adds later in the same paragraph that \"[t]*here must be some communication by the host-State to the Centre*,\" which would seem to indicate that it must be through the host State that the communication must reach the Centre. If that were the view of the distinguished author, the Tribunal would not share it insofar as it requires that the communication must be made through the host State.\n\n319.\n\nIn case of *Cambodia Power Company* and *Kingdom of Cambodia and Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge* the tribunal reached a different conclusion. That tribunal first expressed the view that \"*designation cannot be dispensed with altogether*\" and that \"*there must be some form of communication*\".199 In so doing, it did not part company with the tribunal in *East Kalimantan*, or indeed with the present arbitrators.\n\nCambodia Power Decision, paragraphs 220-221.\n\n320.\n\nHowever, the *Cambodia Power* tribunal set a very high standard for this communication. It declared that \"a structured and standardised system of notification is obviously necessary\".200 Communication must be in the written form and must either be made through a direct and formal communication by the State to the Centre or achieve \"public notoriety\". The *Cambodia Power* tribunal then concluded that \"public notoriety of a designation cannot be achieved through the Claimant's communication to the Centre of a private investment contract annexed to the Request for Arbitration\".201\n\nIbid., paragraphs 227 and 232\n\nIbid., paragraph 269.\n\n321.\n\nWhen considering this case, one should bear in mind that the *Cambodia Power* tribunal was seized of this issue on materially different facts to the present case. At the time when the relevant contracts were concluded, the Kingdom of Cambodia was not a party to the ICSID Convention. The *Cambodia Power* tribunal therefore concluded that commitments concerning designation made prior to Cambodia's adhesion to the Convention did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1).\n\n322.\n\nThe *Cambodia Power* tribunal reached the conclusion that the communication of a designation must be made by the State on the ground that (i) Article 25(1) refers to designated \"*by that State*\", (ii) that \"*it is obviously essential that communications be the sole preserve of the State itself and not a function which investors can discharge*\" and (iii) that the designation serves a \"*gate-keeping*\" function that allows the Contracting State to control any given agency's dealings with foreign investors.202 In that sense, the *Cambodia* tribunal expanded the understanding of \"designation\" in Article 25(1) by declaring that \"*communication is inherent in the very notion of 'designation' used*\" in Article 25(1).203\n\nCambodia Power Decision, paragraphs 249, 250.\n\nCambodia Power Decision, paragraph 225.\n\n323.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, this Tribunal understands the meaning of Article 25(1) to be different. It considers that the *Cambodia Power* tribunal's analysis elides two concepts, each of which is a separate element of Article 25(1): the State's act of designation and the communication of that act to the Centre. This Tribunal considers the two steps separately: designation, for this Tribunal, as for the *Cambodia Power* tribunal, is \"*the sole preserve of the State itself*\"; but this Tribunal takes a more nuanced position with respect to the communication of designation to the Centre where in case of ad hoc designation other forms of communication are not necessarily excluded. The *Cambodia Power* tribunal itself, elsewhere in its decision, accepts that \"*formal notification to the Centre*\" is not necessarily \"*the only means by which a designation might be brought to the Centre's attention*\"; it also accepts \"*the use of other channels of communication*\" and mentions specifically that designation may be \"*given public notoriety by the Contracting State such as to come to the Centre's attention*\".204\n\nCambodia Power Decision, paragraphs 239, 240.\n\n324.\n\nThe present Tribunal has explained that it need not decide whether \"public notoriety\" is an adequate or admissible method of communication for the purpose of Article 25(1), ensuring that a designation in a particular case will effectively come to the Centre's attention.205 It simply notes that, even for the *Cambodia Power* tribunal \"other channels of communication\" are admissible which do not necessarily amount to a \"*structured and standardised system of notification*\". Moreover, this Tribunal does not agree that the requirement of designation has the \"*gate-keeping*\" function which the *Cambodia Power* tribunal attributes to it and which, in that tribunal's view, justifies a requirement that the communication must come from the State. As explained above, such gate-keeping is achieved straightforwardly by the approval of the agency's consent pursuant to Article 25(3).206\n\nAbove paragraph 307.\n\nAbove paragraph 278 and footnote 178.\n\n7.2.5 Communicating the State's designation to the Centre\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nDesignations, as stated in the ICSID List of Designations, render agencies \"*competent to become parties to disputes submitted to the Centre*\". Such competence is exercised in the course of specific proceedings, when a request for arbitration is submitted to the Centre and the agency appears before an arbitral tribunal. In order to be effective, the competence must be known by the Centre before it is exercised. This competence therefore must be made known to the Centre.\n\n304.\n\nWhen the designation is notified by a Contracting State by way of an official communication to the Centre and entered on the List of Designations, the issue is not problematic. These designations demonstrably have been communicated to the Centre and entry on the List is a record that such communication occurred. However, entry on the List of Designations is not a requirement under Article 25(1). The question therefore is whether and under what circumstances an arbitral tribunal may find that a designation was validly brought to the Centre's attention in a form different from official communication.\n\n305.\n\nIt seems that in some cases \"general notoriety\" of the designation was considered as an admissible form of communication. Thus Schreuer wrote that designation \"*can take any form that gives it general notoriety and comes to the Centre's attention*\".187 That sentence suggests that the designation requirement of Article 25(1) would be met for instance by (1) an enactment of a Contracting State which confers on a national agency power to conclude investment agreements including ICSID arbitration clauses, provided that (2) the enactment has \"general notoriety\", for instance by publication in the official gazette of that State, and (3) that as part of investment legislation of a Contracting State this publication may be assumed to have come to the Centre's attention.\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.\n\n306.\n\nAn example of \"*public notoriety*\" was given in the case of *Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company v. Arab Republic of Egypt General Authority for Investment and Free Zones*.188 The tribunal held that the designation was contained in an investment law (Law No. 43). Its publication conferred \"*public notoriety*\" to the designation and thus brought the designation to the Centre's attention.189\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/89/1, Order Noting Discontinuance of 24 June 1993 (Seidl-Hohenveldern, Abdel A'al and Bucher).\n\nFor the concept of \"public notoriety\" in the *Cambodia Power* case, see below.\n\n307.\n\nGiven the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal need not decide whether \"*public notoriety*\" is an adequate or admissible form of \"*communication*\". What is relevant here is that the views expressed in this context require that the designation must come \"*to the Centre's attention*\".\n\n308.\n\nThe question has been examined in some detail by Chittharanjan Felix Amerasinghe, a well-known international lawyer who during his three decades of employment at the World Bank was involved in the early development of ICSID. In an article that appeared in 1979 he clearly distinguished between designation and communication and, when considering the words \"designated to the Centre\", explained that:\n\n\"*Normally, this would mean that there should be some kind of formal communication of the designation to the Centre*.\"190\n\nAmerasinghe, \"*The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*\", 19 Indian Journal of International Law 166, 188 (1979) (hereinafter **Amerasinghe**).\n\n309.\n\nAfter considering some situation which in his view did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1) he continued:\n\n\"*On the other hand, it is a moot question whether there must always be an official communication of the designation to the Centre. It is arguable that where there was a clear intention on the part of the Contracting State to file the designation with the Centre at the time the designation was made but the actual communication is not made by that State to the Centre, it is adequate if instead of there being a formal communication of the designation to the Centre by the State it is brought to the attention of the Centre in some way whether by the State concerned or by one of the parties to the consent agreement provided this is done before the initial intention is changed*.\"191\n\nAmerasinghe, p. 188.\n\n310.\n\nAs a foundation for his conclusion, Amerasinghe notably referred to the drafting history of the Convention. He remarked that early drafts had proposed the grant of *locus standi* to political subdivisions or agencies of a State *without a requirement of designation by that State*. Exploring why that had not been thought sufficient, he noted that delegates had perceived that a designation would be useful to avoid \"*disputes as to whether an entity was a 'political subdivision*'\" and that it was \"*difficult to see how a party that was not a Contracting State could be included in the jurisdiction of the Centre*\" by leaving it to the Centre, or to arbitrators, to decide the matter in the absence of a confirmation by the State. He also referred to the comment that States could \"*avoid the risk of consent by a political subdivision*\" by requiring designation.192\n\nAmerasinghe, p. 187.\n\n311.\n\nWhen concluding that \"formal communication\" could be replaced by some other way in which designation can be brought to the attention of the Centre, Amerasinghe assumes the predicate of \"*a clear intention on the part of the Contracting State to file the designation*\".193 It is a question of fact which shall be considered below whether, in the circumstances of the present case such a clear intention is found to have existed.

Designation may be expressed by the State in a general form or specifically for a particular project or dispute.\n\n326.\n\nArticle 25(1) does not prescribe a particular form for the designating act. In particular in the context of *ad hoc* designations, these may be expressed implicitly, for example by the State's approval of the conclusion by the agency of an ICSID arbitration agreement.\n\n327.\n\nThe requirement in Article 25(1) of designation \"by the State\" does not necessarily apply to the manner in which designation is made known \"*to the Centre*\". Article 25(1) does not prescribe any form for this communication. Therefore, an arbitral tribunal may give effect to an existing *ad hoc* designation which may be made known to ICSID by an investor when filing a Request for Arbitration by a statement pertaining to a specific dispute, particular facts, and in accordance with Institution Rule 2.\n\n328.\n\nIn particular, if an *ad hoc* designation is expressed implicitly in the form of the State's approval of the ICSID arbitration agreement concluded by the agency, communication may take place by bringing this approval to the attention of the Centre with the Request for Arbitration in the form in which it was expressed.\n\n329.\n\nThis understanding of the designation requirement ensures that the principal objective, that of conferring limited international capacity on a particular agency, is met. It permits the State to use designation for purposes of public notification, if it so desires, but it does not require that this be done. The objective of protecting the State against poorly considered commitments by agencies is achieved above all by the requirement of approval according to Article 25(3).\n\n7.2.6 Conclusions concerning the requirement of \"designation\" under Article 25(1)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nDesignation, as required under Article 25(1), refers to an act by a Contracting State by which the State confers upon the agency the capacity to conclude a valid ICSID arbitration agreement and become a party to an ICSID arbitration.

On 20 December 2006 it addressed a letter to the Chairman of Petrobangla in the following terms:\n\n\"*You are informed on the above subject and reference that the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of Bapex with NAICO [sic] sent through abovementioned memo under reference has been approved by the government.*\n\n*2.

Based on the testimony at the hearing the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration clause was introduced by Petrobangla with the approval, if not at the instruction, of the Government.216\n\nSee paragraphs 89, 90 above.\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondents have explained that designation in Bangladesh must be made by the \"competent authority\" adding that, \"*in this case it would be the Ministry, in the case of Bangladesh, in accordance with the rules of business in Bangladesh. It would have to be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs*\".217 Later in the argument at the hearing, the Respondents referred to the extract of these Rules of Business produced in the arbitration. These rules allocate functions among different parts of the Government.218\n\nHT 1, p. 96.\n\nHT 1, p. 317, referring to RfA II, Exhibit H.\n\n338.\n\nThe extract of the Rules of Business that has been produced concerns the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. It shows that this ministry deals with \"*all policies and matters relating to Petroleum, Natural Gas and Mineral Resources*\"; the functions of the energy division specifically include \"*Liaison with international organisations and matters relating to treaties and agreements*\"; matters relating to Petrobangla are specifically mentioned. One must conclude that designation with respect to Article 25(1) is a function of this Ministry.\n\n339.\n\nThe State of Bangladesh established Petrobangla and BAPEX by legislation and executive decision as the agencies responsible for contracting with investors for the exploitation of gas fields in Bangladesh. With respect to the JVA this has been presented in particular detail in the Preamble of this agreement which contains the following passages:\n\n\"*Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights and powers of the Government [...] and also to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any person/company for the purpose of any Petroleum Operations*.\"219\n\nand\n\n\"*BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from Petrobangla and the Government the requisite approvals to execute this JVA*...\".220\n\nWhereas Clause 3.\n\nWhereas Clause 14.\n\n340.\n\nWhen considering above the interpretation of Article 25(1), the Tribunal concluded that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the approval by the State of the consent by one of its agencies to an ICSID arbitration clause necessarily implies that this agency has been granted capacity to conclude such an arbitration clause and to become a party to an ICSID arbitration, i.e. that it has been designated for that purpose.\n\n341.\n\nWhile it cannot exclude that Petrobangla and BAPEX might have been designated at some earlier time by a separate act or in the context of some other agreement, the Tribunal concludes that, in the circumstances of the present case, designation occurred at the latest when the Government approved the consent of the agencies to arbitration under the JVA and the GPSA. There is no indication that the Government of Bangladesh, during the negotiations or at any time prior to the conclusion of the agreements or prior to the commencement of these arbitrations, objected to the designation of these two agencies or to their consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n342.\n\nIn this respect, there is a fundamental difference between the present case and the facts in *East Kalimantan*, where the tribunal found that the evidence relied upon by the claimant was insufficient to demonstrate the State's intent to designate,221 and where the Government of Indonesia had clearly denied any authorisation to East Kalimantan and firmly stated that this provincial administration had \"*no capacity/qualification/authority and legal standing*\" to file a claim in ICSID.222\n\nEast Kalimantan Award, paragraphs 194-198.\n\nEast Kalimantan Award, paragraph 199.\n\n343.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of *Cable TV of Nevis v. St Kitts and Nevis*, the arbitral tribunal found that not only was there no designation but also no approval by the State.223\n\n*Cable Television of Nevis, Ltd. and Cable Television of Nevis Holdings, Ltd. v. Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis*, ICSID Case No. ARB/95/2 (Davis, Maynard, McKay), Award of 13 January 1997, paragraph 2.33.\n\n344.\n\nIn the present case, the agreements concluded by Petrobangla and BAPEX which contained the ICSID clause were expressly approved by the Government and the letters by which Niko was informed of the approval by the Government were submitted to the Centre with the Requests for Arbitration.\n\n345.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence before it and for the above reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that, by authorising BAPEX and Petrobangla to conclude the agreements containing the ICSID arbitration clauses, in terms previously proposed by the Bangladeshi agencies, the State of Bangladesh not only approved consent to ICSID arbitration by these two agencies in terms of Article 25(3) but also designated, implicitly but necessarily, BAPEX and Petrobangla as agencies in the sense of Article 25(1), if such designation had not occurred earlier. The designation was communicated to the Centre by the Claimant's Requests for Arbitration. The Respondents' objection relying on an alleged failure of Bangladesh to designate BAPEX and Petrobangla must therefore be dismissed.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that, if it had not concluded that the requirement of designation had been complied with in the present case, it would have had to consider whether the Respondents' objection based on the asserted absence of designation could have been reconciled with the overriding obligation of good faith conduct of the Parties. When a State chooses a mode of execution where the conclusion of the investment agreement is delegated to an agency and, upon proposal of the State, that agreement provides for ICSID arbitration, the investor may be entitled to expect that the State takes the steps prescribed by Article 25(1) to give effect to the agreement. For the State to rely on its failure to take these steps with the objective of preventing the effectiveness of the arbitration clause may be contrary to good faith.\n\n347.\n\nHowever, since the Tribunal concluded that Bangladesh did designate BAPEX and Petrobangla in a manner which complied with the requirement of Article 25(1), the Tribunal need not consider this question any further.\n\n348.\n\nOn the basis of these considerations the Tribunal finds that BAPEX and Petrobangla, the Second and Third Respondent, have validly consented to ICSID arbitration and are bound by the arbitration clauses in the agreements to which they are party.\n\n**7.3 Designation in the present case**\n---------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nIn RfA I, under the heading \"Designation of parties who are a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contacting State\", the Claimant stated that \"*Bangladesh has designated Petrobangla and BAPEX for purposes of the Article 25 of the Convention as a result of the making and execution of the Joint Venture Agreement made and entered into on October 16, 2003*\".207 In the course of the demonstration which follows this statement, the Claimant added:\n\n\"*(e) By directing and authorising Bapex to execute the JVA, containing consent to arbitrate under the Convention, Bangaldesh has designated Bapex and Petrobangla to the Centre pursuant to Article 25 of the Convention;*\"208\n\nRfA I, p. 3.\n\nRfA I, p. 3.\n\n331.\n\nThe same statement appears in RfA II.209\n\nRfA II, p. 3.\n\n332.\n\nThe directions on which the Claimant relies have been quoted above.210 With respect to the JVA, these directions were contained in the letter of 11 October 2003 which communicated to Petrobangla, with copy to BAPEX, the approval of the Prime Minister.211 This approval was communicated to Niko in the form of BAPEX letter of 13 October 2003 stating:\n\n\"*In accordance with the approval accorded by the Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to sign the \"JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM FROM THE MARGINAL/ABANDONED CHATTAC & FENI GAS FIELDS\" between Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) and Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd, you are requested to send your Authorised representative with due authorisation to sign the said contract on 16th October, 2003 at 12.00 Noon to the Register office of BAPEX, Dhaka, Bangladesh.*\"212\n\nSee Sections 3.1 and 3.3 above.\n\nRfA I, Clarification, Exhibit 7.\n\nRfA I, Clarification, Exhibit 8.\n\n333.\n\nThe GPSA was approved by the Government, acting through the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, Energy and Mineral Division, Development Section-3. On 20 December 2006 it addressed a letter to the Chairman of Petrobangla in the following terms:\n\n\"*You are informed on the above subject and reference that the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of Bapex with NAICO [sic] sent through abovementioned memo under reference has been approved by the government.*\n\n*2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to request you to take necessary action in the due pursuance of the existing rules and regulations on the above mentioned subject*.\"213\n\nRfA II, Attachment B.\n\n334.\n\nOn the following day, 21 December 2006, Petrobangla wrote to Niko and BAPEX and, referring to the letter of the Government just mentioned, informed them that the Government had approved the GPSA.214\n\nRfA II, Attachment B.\n\n335.\n\nBangladesh has not only approved the consent of the two agencies and indeed directed the execution of the agreements, but was also directly involved in the introduction of the arbitration clause in the Agreements: on the basis of the evidence produced with respect to the negotiations of the agreements, the Tribunal concluded that the arbitration clause was introduced by Petrobangla and BAPEX;215 given the close control of the Government over the negotiations of the agreements, the introduction of the ICSID arbitration clause was intended if not initiated by the State.\n\nSee paragraph 47 above.\n\n336.\n\nThe situation is even clearer in the case of the GPSA. Based on the testimony at the hearing the Tribunal concludes that the arbitration clause was introduced by Petrobangla with the approval, if not at the instruction, of the Government.216\n\nSee paragraphs 89, 90 above.\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondents have explained that designation in Bangladesh must be made by the \"competent authority\" adding that, \"*in this case it would be the Ministry, in the case of Bangladesh, in accordance with the rules of business in Bangladesh. It would have to be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs*\".217 Later in the argument at the hearing, the Respondents referred to the extract of these Rules of Business produced in the arbitration. These rules allocate functions among different parts of the Government.218\n\nHT 1, p. 96.\n\nHT 1, p. 317, referring to RfA II, Exhibit H.\n\n338.\n\nThe extract of the Rules of Business that has been produced concerns the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.

THE DISPUTE ARISING DIRECTLY OUT OF AN INVESTMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Convention restricts jurisdiction of the Centre to legal disputes \"*arising directly out of an investment*\". The Respondents deny that this requirement has been met.\n\n350.\n\nThe project to which this dispute relates concerns several marginal or abandoned gas fields which were to be evaluated and, if found promising, to be developed for production. The work required the commitment of financial and other resources for a long period of time at the risk of no recovery. The circumstances, and in particular the potential contribution to Bangladesh's energy supply as well as the engagement of the Government of Bangladesh, indicate that the project had significance for the development of the country.\n\n351.\n\n**With respect to the JVA**, the Claimant explained in RfA I that, by the time the Request was filed, its total \"*capital/investment pursuant to the JVA*\" was approximately US$147 million,224 an amount that has not been contested by the Respondents in this arbitration. The JVA made it quite clear that Niko had to provide the funding of the operation, the profits were to be shared between BAPEX and Niko, and the losses had to be assumed by Niko which bore the full risk of the operation. Articles 2.3, 2.4 and 2.6 of the JVA are particularly relevant in this respect:\n\n\"*2.3 BAPEX shall not be required to fund the Joint Venture operations.*\n\n*2.4 All capital/Investment including operating expenses shall be provided by [Niko] and BAPEX shall not have to make any investment. The revenue derived from petroleum produced and sold under this JVA shall be distributed on the basis of the Investment Multiple (IM) achieved as provided for in Articles 23.3 under JVA.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*2.6 If there is no Commercial Production in the JVA Area or if the production achieved from the JVA Area developed by* [Niko] *is insufficient to recover* [Niko's] *investment,* [Niko] *shall bear all its losses*.\"\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.22.\n\n352.\n\nIt is readily apparent that the project meets the criteria which normally are identified as constitutive of an investment, as they have been discussed by learned writers and arbitral tribunals.225 Since this Tribunal concludes that the criteria are met, it does not need to address the controversy whether these criteria must be treated as \"jurisdictional requirements\".226\n\nSchreuer at Article 25, paragraph 158, concludes from his study of legal writers and arbitral awards that four criteria are most frequently relied upon when determining whether an operation may be characterised as investment: \"a (substantial) contribution, a certain duration of the operation, risk and contribution to the host State's operation\". These criteria, often referred to as the \"*Salini* criteria\" have been applied recently also by an arbitral tribunal in a case to which Bangladesh was a party. In the *Chevron* case referred to above the tribunal referred to the \"*criteria identified by the* Salini *Tribunal*\" and on that basis determined whether the Claimants had made an investment in the sense of Article 25(1).\n\nSee e.g. *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v. Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10 (Schwebel and Tomka, Shahabuddeen dissenting), Annulment Decision of 16 April 2009, in particular paragraph 77.\n\n353.\n\nIndeed, the Respondents accept that Niko made an investment in Bangladesh. They stated:\n\n\"*With respect to the first alleged investment, Niko I Bangladesh no doubt had an investment in the hydrocarbon sector of Bangladesh. The Joint Venture with IAPEX may constitute a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention*.\"227\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 40.\n\n354.\n\nConsequently, Niko's activities pursuant to the JVA qualify as an investment. A dispute concerning Niko's rights and obligations under this agreement is therefore a \"*legal dispute arising directly out of an investment*\".\n\n355.\n\nThe difference between the Parties in this respect essentially concerns **the GSPA**. While accepting that the JVA relates to an investment, the Respondents contest that the GPSA \"*qualifies as an autonomous investment in Iangladesh*\". According to the Respondents:\n\n\"*The contract must be an investment contract. Each contract must qualify as an investment contract in order to fulfil the requirements of the phrase in Article 25.1 that says a claim arising directly out of an investment*.\"228\n\nHT 1, p. 128.\n\n356.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Joint Venture Partners as the Sellers contracted \"*to sell and deliver Gas to the Buyer*\". They argue that neither the sale of gas nor the potential expenditures that the Claimant may have incurred in carrying out the commercial transaction and for delivering the gas can be construed as an \"investment\".229\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraphs 43, 45.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant responds by arguing that \"*the GPSA was part of the investment*\"; it \"*was the mechanism by which the parties fulfilled their commitments and expectations under Art. 24 of the JVA to sell the production and recoup the investment*\".230\n\nC-MJ, paragraphs 95, 96.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first of all that, contrary to what the Respondents argue, the GPSA is not just a \"*sales contract*\".231 It is not limited to the simple sale of a defined quantity of gas against an agreed price. It is a long term agreement, in principle for a period of five years. It may be terminated earlier in case of depletion of the Feni field and it may be prolonged by mutual agreement.232 The Sellers guarantee to sell a minimum quantity and the Buyer guarantees to purchase an annual minimum quantity.233 Ultimately the quantities delivered and purchased depend on the \"*final deliverability of the Feni gas field*\".234\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 18.\n\nGPSA, Articles 2, 3.\n\nGPSA, Articles 5.1, 5.2.\n\nGPSA, Article 5.1.\n\n359.\n\nIn order to perform this long term delivery contract, the Sellers (and specifically Niko as one of the Joint Venture Partners) had to make substantial expenditures, at the risk of not fully recovering it in case of insufficient \"deliverability\" of the Feni field. Obviously, the gas delivered made a contribution to the economy of Bangladesh. Thus the GPSA, taken alone, may qualify as an investment agreement and disputes arising out of it meet the requirement of Article 25(1).\n\n360.\n\nThe question whether the transaction regulated by the GPSA, taken in isolation, would qualify as an investment as required by the Convention need not, however, be finally decided here since the Respondents' objection must be rejected on more general grounds:\n\n361.\n\nContrary to the Respondents' argument, Article 25(1) does not require that the dispute arise out of \"*an investment contract*\" but \"*out of an investment*\". An investment is an economic operation and contracts regulate the rights and obligations relating to this operation. Investments of any complexity often consist of a variety of different components. These components may be regulated in a single legal instrument or in separate contracts.\n\n362.\n\nIn the case of an operation like the one considered here, it may well be possible to settle the rights and obligations of the investor in relation to the natural resource in question in a single legal instrument. The investor's undertakings to develop and deliver products, and its remuneration therefore, all form part of the investment; disputes with respect to them must be deemed to arise \"*directly out of the investment*\".\n\n363.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal sees no justification for distinguishing, in the context of the characterisation as investment dispute, between those investments where the entire project is subject to a single instrument and those where different aspects of the project are regulated by separate contracts.\n\n364.\n\nIt is indeed now widely accepted that an investment must be seen as a coherent unit, even if it is implemented through a number of different projects. In the very first ICSID arbitration the concept of \"*the general unity of an investment*\" was already confirmed, integrating \"*a number of juridical acts of all sorts*\".235\n\n*Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Morocco*, ICSID Case. No. ARB 72/1 (Lagergren, Reuter, Schultsz), Decision of 12 May 1974, quoted from Lalive, \"*The First 'World Bank' Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco) - Some Legal Problems\",* 51 British Yearbook of International Law (1980), 123, 159.\n\n365.\n\nIn their argument concerning the unity of an investment the Parties referred to the decisions in the arbitration *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic.* In *CSOB,* the arbitrators gave a clear definition of the unity principle in their first decision:\n\n\"*An investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment*.\"236\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4 (Buergenthal, Bernardini and Bucher), Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999 (hereinafter **CSOB v. Slovak Republic**), paragraph 72, 14 ICSID Review (1999) 251, 275.\n\n366.\n\nAt the hearing in the present case the Respondents argued that in a subsequent decision the *CSOB* tribunal restricted this general principle, stating that \"*in order to incorporate disputes under other contracts, they must be the same parties in the dispute*\".237\n\nHT 1, p. 134.\n\n367.\n\nThe present Tribunal noted that, in its decision on further objections to jurisdiction of 1 December 2000, the *CSOB* tribunal referred to its earlier decision in which it held that \"*CSOB's claim and the related loan facility made available to SI qualify as investments*...\". In its subsequent decision, that tribunal qualified its earlier decision by adding:\n\n\"*This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal thereby automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each agreement concluded to implement the wider investment operation. Other requirements have to be met for such jurisdiction to be established*.\"238\n\nCSOB v. Slovak Republic, Decision on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction of 1 December 2000, paragraph 28, 15 ICSID Review (2000) 544, 554.\n\n368.\n\nThe *CSOB* tribunal went on to refer to the requirement of consent, refusing to extend the scope of the agreement to arbitrate to other contracts239 to which the Slovak Republic was not a party. The decisive difference, therefore, was the absence of consent to arbitration by the Slovak Republic.\n\nThe so called CSOB/SI Agreements (see paragraph 6).\n\n369.\n\nIn the present case, the investment project, consisting in the development of marginal and non-producing gas fields, was the subject of a number of different agreements and other legal instruments, some of which were named in the JVA and attached to it. The JVA provides for the development of the Chattak and Feni fields and then addresses, in its Article 24, \"Petroleum Sale and Transmission\" (the Agreement defined petroleum as including gaseous hydrocarbons):\n\n\"*OPERATOR [i.e. Niko] and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as Seller) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA. BUYER of JV's gas shall be Petrobangla or a designee of Petrobangla (hereinafter referred to as BUYER). BUYER & SELLER shall enter into a Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) under which the Buyer shall agree to purchase the Petroleum to which the Seller is entitled to under this JVA, subject to deliverability and testing and proof of such Petroleum. OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the Country if a market outlet is not given by Petrobanla within six months after a request is made.*\"\n\n370.\n\nThe GPSA, in turn, makes express reference in its Preamble to the JVA under which the Seller (i.e. the Joint Venture Partners) \"is authorised to produce and sell Natural Gas\". It then continues:\n\n\"*Under Article 24 of the JVA and upon the terms and conditions as set in this Agreement, the Seller has proposed to sell and deliver Natural Gas as produced from the Feni gas field and the Buyer has agreed to purchase and receive the same from the Seller for consumption in the domestic market*\".\n\n371.\n\nThese two provisions confirm and underline the commercial logic of the operation: the sale of the gas produced by the Joint Venture Partners is a necessary component of the investment.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the GPSA is a constituent part of the investment operation. Given the function assigned under the law of Bangladesh to Petrobangla, an agreement for the sale and purchase of gas produced from this investment was a necessary element of this operation. The GPSA forms part of the legal instruments through which Niko's investment in Bangladesh has been implemented. Disputes arising out of the GPSA, like those arising out of the JVA, are legal disputes \"*arising directly out of an investment*\" in the sense of Article 25(1).\n\n**8. THE DISPUTE ARISING DIRECTLY OUT OF AN INVESTMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Convention restricts jurisdiction of the Centre to legal disputes \"*arising directly out of an investment*\". The Respondents deny that this requirement has been met.\n\n350.\n\nThe project to which this dispute relates concerns several marginal or abandoned gas fields which were to be evaluated and, if found promising, to be developed for production.

The circumstances, and in particular the potential contribution to Bangladesh's energy supply as well as the engagement of the Government of Bangladesh, indicate that the project had significance for the development of the country.\n\n351.\n\n**With respect to the JVA**, the Claimant explained in RfA I that, by the time the Request was filed, its total \"*capital/investment pursuant to the JVA*\" was approximately US$147 million,224 an amount that has not been contested by the Respondents in this arbitration. The JVA made it quite clear that Niko had to provide the funding of the operation, the profits were to be shared between BAPEX and Niko, and the losses had to be assumed by Niko which bore the full risk of the operation.

These criteria, often referred to as the \"*Salini* criteria\" have been applied recently also by an arbitral tribunal in a case to which Bangladesh was a party. In the *Chevron* case referred to above the tribunal referred to the \"*criteria identified by the* Salini *Tribunal*\" and on that basis determined whether the Claimants had made an investment in the sense of Article 25(1).\n\nSee e.g. *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v. Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10 (Schwebel and Tomka, Shahabuddeen dissenting), Annulment Decision of 16 April 2009, in particular paragraph 77.\n\n353.\n\nIndeed, the Respondents accept that Niko made an investment in Bangladesh. They stated:\n\n\"*With respect to the first alleged investment, Niko I Bangladesh no doubt had an investment in the hydrocarbon sector of Bangladesh. The Joint Venture with IAPEX may constitute a qualifying investment under the ICSID Convention*.\"227\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 40.\n\n354.\n\nConsequently, Niko's activities pursuant to the JVA qualify as an investment. A dispute concerning Niko's rights and obligations under this agreement is therefore a \"*legal dispute arising directly out of an investment*\".\n\n355.\n\nThe difference between the Parties in this respect essentially concerns **the GSPA**. While accepting that the JVA relates to an investment, the Respondents contest that the GPSA \"*qualifies as an autonomous investment in Iangladesh*\". According to the Respondents:\n\n\"*The contract must be an investment contract. Each contract must qualify as an investment contract in order to fulfil the requirements of the phrase in Article 25.1 that says a claim arising directly out of an investment*.\"228\n\nHT 1, p. 128.\n\n356.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Joint Venture Partners as the Sellers contracted \"*to sell and deliver Gas to the Buyer*\". They argue that neither the sale of gas nor the potential expenditures that the Claimant may have incurred in carrying out the commercial transaction and for delivering the gas can be construed as an \"investment\".229\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraphs 43, 45.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant responds by arguing that \"*the GPSA was part of the investment*\"; it \"*was the mechanism by which the parties fulfilled their commitments and expectations under Art. 24 of the JVA to sell the production and recoup the investment*\".230\n\nC-MJ, paragraphs 95, 96.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first of all that, contrary to what the Respondents argue, the GPSA is not just a \"*sales contract*\".231 It is not limited to the simple sale of a defined quantity of gas against an agreed price. It is a long term agreement, in principle for a period of five years. It may be terminated earlier in case of depletion of the Feni field and it may be prolonged by mutual agreement.232 The Sellers guarantee to sell a minimum quantity and the Buyer guarantees to purchase an annual minimum quantity.233 Ultimately the quantities delivered and purchased depend on the \"*final deliverability of the Feni gas field*\".234\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 18.\n\nGPSA, Articles 2, 3.\n\nGPSA, Articles 5.1, 5.2.\n\nGPSA, Article 5.1.\n\n359.\n\nIn order to perform this long term delivery contract, the Sellers (and specifically Niko as one of the Joint Venture Partners) had to make substantial expenditures, at the risk of not fully recovering it in case of insufficient \"deliverability\" of the Feni field. Obviously, the gas delivered made a contribution to the economy of Bangladesh. Thus the GPSA, taken alone, may qualify as an investment agreement and disputes arising out of it meet the requirement of Article 25(1).\n\n360.\n\nThe question whether the transaction regulated by the GPSA, taken in isolation, would qualify as an investment as required by the Convention need not, however, be finally decided here since the Respondents' objection must be rejected on more general grounds:\n\n361.\n\nContrary to the Respondents' argument, Article 25(1) does not require that the dispute arise out of \"*an investment contract*\" but \"*out of an investment*\". An investment is an economic operation and contracts regulate the rights and obligations relating to this operation. Investments of any complexity often consist of a variety of different components. These components may be regulated in a single legal instrument or in separate contracts.\n\n362.\n\nIn the case of an operation like the one considered here, it may well be possible to settle the rights and obligations of the investor in relation to the natural resource in question in a single legal instrument. The investor's undertakings to develop and deliver products, and its remuneration therefore, all form part of the investment; disputes with respect to them must be deemed to arise \"*directly out of the investment*\".\n\n363.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal sees no justification for distinguishing, in the context of the characterisation as investment dispute, between those investments where the entire project is subject to a single instrument and those where different aspects of the project are regulated by separate contracts.\n\n364.\n\nIt is indeed now widely accepted that an investment must be seen as a coherent unit, even if it is implemented through a number of different projects. In the very first ICSID arbitration the concept of \"*the general unity of an investment*\" was already confirmed, integrating \"*a number of juridical acts of all sorts*\".235\n\n*Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Morocco*, ICSID Case. No. ARB 72/1 (Lagergren, Reuter, Schultsz), Decision of 12 May 1974, quoted from Lalive, \"*The First 'World Bank' Arbitration (Holiday Inns v. Morocco) - Some Legal Problems\",* 51 British Yearbook of International Law (1980), 123, 159.\n\n365.\n\nIn their argument concerning the unity of an investment the Parties referred to the decisions in the arbitration *Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic.* In *CSOB,* the arbitrators gave a clear definition of the unity principle in their first decision:\n\n\"*An investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation that qualifies as an investment*.\"236\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodn\u00ed banka A.S. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4 (Buergenthal, Bernardini and Bucher), Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999 (hereinafter **CSOB v. Slovak Republic**), paragraph 72, 14 ICSID Review (1999) 251, 275.\n\n366.\n\nAt the hearing in the present case the Respondents argued that in a subsequent decision the *CSOB* tribunal restricted this general principle, stating that \"*in order to incorporate disputes under other contracts, they must be the same parties in the dispute*\".237\n\nHT 1, p. 134.\n\n367.\n\nThe present Tribunal noted that, in its decision on further objections to jurisdiction of 1 December 2000, the *CSOB* tribunal referred to its earlier decision in which it held that \"*CSOB's claim and the related loan facility made available to SI qualify as investments*...\". In its subsequent decision, that tribunal qualified its earlier decision by adding:\n\n\"*This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal thereby automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each agreement concluded to implement the wider investment operation. Other requirements have to be met for such jurisdiction to be established*.\"238\n\nCSOB v. Slovak Republic, Decision on Respondent's Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction of 1 December 2000, paragraph 28, 15 ICSID Review (2000) 544, 554.\n\n368.\n\nThe *CSOB* tribunal went on to refer to the requirement of consent, refusing to extend the scope of the agreement to arbitrate to other contracts239 to which the Slovak Republic was not a party. The decisive difference, therefore, was the absence of consent to arbitration by the Slovak Republic.\n\nThe so called CSOB/SI Agreements (see paragraph 6).\n\n369.\n\nIn the present case, the investment project, consisting in the development of marginal and non-producing gas fields, was the subject of a number of different agreements and other legal instruments, some of which were named in the JVA and attached to it. The JVA provides for the development of the Chattak and Feni fields and then addresses, in its Article 24, \"Petroleum Sale and Transmission\" (the Agreement defined petroleum as including gaseous hydrocarbons):\n\n\"*OPERATOR [i.e. Niko] and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as Seller) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA. BUYER of JV's gas shall be Petrobangla or a designee of Petrobangla (hereinafter referred to as BUYER). BUYER & SELLER shall enter into a Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) under which the Buyer shall agree to purchase the Petroleum to which the Seller is entitled to under this JVA, subject to deliverability and testing and proof of such Petroleum. OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the Country if a market outlet is not given by Petrobanla within six months after a request is made.*\"\n\n370.\n\nThe GPSA, in turn, makes express reference in its Preamble to the JVA under which the Seller (i.e. the Joint Venture Partners) \"is authorised to produce and sell Natural Gas\". It then continues:\n\n\"*Under Article 24 of the JVA and upon the terms and conditions as set in this Agreement, the Seller has proposed to sell and deliver Natural Gas as produced from the Feni gas field and the Buyer has agreed to purchase and receive the same from the Seller for consumption in the domestic market*\".\n\n371.\n\nThese two provisions confirm and underline the commercial logic of the operation: the sale of the gas produced by the Joint Venture Partners is a necessary component of the investment.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the GPSA is a constituent part of the investment operation. Given the function assigned under the law of Bangladesh to Petrobangla, an agreement for the sale and purchase of gas produced from this investment was a necessary element of this operation. The GPSA forms part of the legal instruments through which Niko's investment in Bangladesh has been implemented. Disputes arising out of the GPSA, like those arising out of the JVA, are legal disputes \"*arising directly out of an investment*\" in the sense of Article 25(1).\n\n**9. ILLEGAL ACTS, GOOD FAITH AND CLEAN HANDS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Respondents argue that Niko has committed acts of corruption and that therefore it may not benefit from the agreements in general and from the ICSID arbitration clause in particular. The Claimant denies that, apart from the acts which formed the subject of the decision in Canada (the Canadian conviction),240 it has committed any illegal act.\n\nSee below Section 9.2.\n\n**9.

Thus when there is an allegation of fraudulent conduct by the foreign investor, tribunals should examine all the circumstances surrounding the lifespan of the investment, having direct relation to the investment claim.

The Crown is unable to prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the Minister*.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*In addition the Probation Order takes into consideration steps already taken by Niko Canada to reduce the likelihood of it committing a subsequent related offence.*\n\n*In addition the sentence takes into consideration the fact that the company has never been convicted of a similar offence nor has it been sanctioned by a regulatory body for a similar offence.*\n\n[\u2026] *The Probation Order also puts Niko Canada under the Court's supervision for the next three years to ensure audits are done to examine Niko Canada's compliance with the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act.\"251*\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 15, paragraphs 58, 62, 63 and 64.\n\n390.\n\nThe Claimant disclosed that the United States Department of Justice conducted an investigation related to the investigation in Canada. On August 2011 it informed Niko Canada that it \"determined that it will discontinue its inquiry into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by Niko Resources Ltd. (Niko)\". It explained that \"*prosecution is not necessary at this time in light of Niko's guilty plea in Canada*\". It pointed out that it \"*may decide to restart this enquiry at any time*\".252\n\nExhibit D to the Claimant's letter to the Tribunal of 6 September 2011.\n\n391.\n\nThe Claimant also disclosed: \"Although the criminal charges in Canada against Niko Resources Ltd appear to have been resolved with the guilty pleas on June 24, 2011, other regulatory investigations appear to remain outstanding. Further, two Canadian law firms widely known for class action law suits announced in late June 2011 that they were investigating Niko's disclosures, stock option practices and foreign business practices\".\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimant stated that it was not aware of any criminal investigations other than those in Canada and the United States just described and the investigation in Bangladesh to be discussed below.253 There is no indication that any other convictions or investigations against the Claimant or the Niko Group occurred in Canada or the United States in relation with the project in Bangladesh.\n\nLetter to ICSID of 22 September 2011, paragraph b; HT 2, pp. 43-50.\n\n**9.3 Other indications of possible acts of corruption and the Respondents' disclosure request**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondents made reference to a number of investigations and proceedings in Bangladesh and abroad as possible indications of acts of corruption by the Claimant and its group.\n\n**9.3 Other indications of possible acts of corruption and the Respondents' disclosure request**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondents made reference to a number of investigations and proceedings in Bangladesh and abroad as possible indications of acts of corruption by the Claimant and its group.\n\n9.3.1 Investigation by the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission (ACC)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe first of these proceedings concerned an investigation which the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission (**ACC**) initiated in 2007. The Respondents explained that the ACC filed at \"*Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 of 2007 against government officials under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1047 and the Penal Code 1860, and there continues to be a pending charge against one former Prime Minister*\".254\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 59.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal asked the Respondents about this investigation. The Respondents confirmed that the investigation was commenced and invited the Tribunal to order the Claimant to disclose any relevant documents.255\n\nRespondents' letter to ICSID of 29 August 2011, in response to the Tribunal's questions of 26 August 2011.\n\n396.\n\nThe Claimant responded that it had received requests for information from the ACC and that it was informed that the ACC was investigating whether public officials of the Government of Bangladesh accepted bribes in respect to investments in Bangladesh. The investigations also concerned Mr Qasim Sharif who was \"*at one time an officer of Claimant*\". The Claimant added that according to its information \"most, if not all, of the charges were stayed. The Claimant understands that no further proceedings have yet been taken on any charges that were not stayed, if in fact any charges remain outstanding.\"256\n\nClaimant's letter to ICSID of 22 September 2011, paragraph (a).\n\n397.\n\nThe Claimant declared that it \"*was not told that it was a target of the investigation*\".257\n\nClaimant's letter to ICSID of 22 September 2011, paragraph (a).\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal pursued this matter further at the hearing. Mr Adolf confirmed that ACC had approached Niko, requesting access to its files, and were provided such access. He added that he did not think that \"*there is any further action taking place*\".258 Mr Imam Hossain, named as witness by the Respondents, confirmed that his knowledge about the investigation was \"*the same as Mr Adolf*\", but added that \"*one investigation is going on by the ACC and they have seized some files from Petrobangla*\".259\n\nBrian Adolf, HT 2, pp. 209-210.\n\nImam Hossain, HT 2, p. 210.\n\n399.\n\nTowards the end of the hearing the Claimant's counsel made reference to documents emanating from the ACC and containing the charges investigated by the Commission. He delivered these documents to the Respondents' counsel who introduced them in the arbitration.260 The documents contained detailed discussions relating to the negotiations with Niko, the award of the JVA and alleged illegalities committed in this context. One of these documents, dated 5 May 2008, stated that a \"*memo was filed with recommendation to file charge sheet*\" against 11 persons, including a former Prime Minister, several Ministers and civil servants as well as Mr Qasim Sharif.261 The other, dated 7 May 2008, is entitled \"*Charge Sheet*\".262\n\nRecorded as Hearing Exhibits R-2 and R-3; HT 2, p. 229.\n\nHearing Exhibit R-3.\n\nHearing Exhibit R-2.\n\n400.\n\nThe Respondents' counsel stated that they had been unaware of the charge sheets prior to their delivery by the Claimant's counsel towards the end of the hearing; they could not provide any information about the status of these investigations.\n\n401.\n\nApart from the comments referred to above, no further evidence was provided about the investigations by the ACC.\n\n9.3.1 Investigation by the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission (ACC)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe first of these proceedings concerned an investigation which the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission (**ACC**) initiated in 2007.

Mr Harb had been retained by Niko as consultant assisting in \"*resolving the compensation claims and the Feni gas price issue*\".268\n\nClaimant's letter to ICSID of 22 September 2011, paragraph 2.\n\n411.\n\nAt the hearing Mr Adolf testified that Mr Harb visited Bangladesh in 2006 and that he \"*was performing his services for us in an ethical way that was approved by the Ethics Commissioner for the Government of Canada*\".269\n\nBrian Adolf, HT 2, pp. 211-212;\n\n412.\n\nDuring the course of his testimony Mr Adolf produced a press release of Mr Harb which contained the following passages:\n\n\"*I am aware of the investigation that has been undertaken by the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] into Niko Resources and I have cooperated fully with the RCMP.*\n\n*I disclosed to the Senate Ethics Officer in a timely manner the information regarding my work with Niko as I was required to declare confidentially under the Conflict of Interest Code for Senators.

In order to develop their argument in this respect, the Respondents request that the Claimant be ordered to produce the relevant documents. The Parties were given the opportunity to argue the issue. Their arguments may be summarised as follows:\n\n415.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial dated 16 May 2011, the Respondents referred to the Canadian investigation and, in a footnote to these explanations, made the following request:\n\n\"*Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondents request disclosure from the Claimant of all documents, records and information in its control relating to such allegations, investigations, charges, and proceedings*\".271\n\nR-CMJ.1, fn. 45.\n\n416.\n\nIn response, the Claimant objected to the request, stating that \"*it goes far beyond what is reasonable*\" and that it \"*complies with few, or none, of the usual conditions for document production*\".272 The Claimant added that, nevertheless it was \"*prepared to make voluntary disclosure of any criminal convictions relating to the alleged bribery allegations*\".273\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraphs 56, 60.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 74.\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimant explained that there was \"*one such conviction*\"; it provided explanations and disclosed documents with respect to the Canadian investigation and criminal conviction.274\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraphs 75 *et seq*.\n\n418.\n\nIn an application of 16 August 2011, the Respondents requested \"*access to the record of the criminal investigation carried out by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police*\".\n\n419.\n\nIn response to a number of questions addressed on 26 August 2011 by the Secretariat to the Parties on instruction of the Tribunal, the Respondents stated on 29 August 2011 that they believed that \"*the Claimant may have committed further acts of corruption in relation to its operation in Bangladesh*\" and referred to three corruption investigations: (i) the Canadian investigation, (ii) the ACC investigation against the Claimant and others and (iii) the proceedings against Stratum. They invited the Tribunal to order the Claimant \"*to disclose any relevant documents regarding all three investigations*\".\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimant responded on 6 September 2011, objecting to the wide range of the request and argued that the matters concerned were irrelevant, sensitive and subject to privilege. In a letter of 27 September 2011, the Respondents insisted on the disclosure requests concerning investigations in Canada, the United States and Bangladesh.\n\n421.\n\nThe Claimant has disclosed the conviction of Niko Canada and the Agreed Statement of Facts on which it was based and provided information about the investigation in the United States. The Claimant declared that it was not aware of any other investigations, apart from those in Bangladesh. The Tribunal sees no need for any further disclosure concerning these proceedings in Canada and the United States.\n\n422.\n\nWith respect to the proceedings in Bangladesh, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondents themselves were best placed to provide all relevant information. They have failed to do so. The Tribunal sees no justification for ordering the Claimant to produce information which, if it existed, was surely available to the Respondents.\n\n9.3.5 The Respondents' request for document production\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Respondents argue that there may have been other relevant acts of corruption.

While they must bear in mind these difficulties they must also be aware that findings of corruption are a serious matter which should not be reached lightly. As the tribunal put it in *Hamester v. Ghana*, a tribunal would \"*only decide on substantiated facts, and cannot base itself on inferences*\".275\n\nHamester Award, paragraph 134.\n\n425.\n\nIn the present case, the acts of corruption of which the Claimant was convicted were committed in Bangladesh. If there were any other such acts committed they must have concerned persons making decisions in Bangladesh. Therefore, the authorities of Bangladesh were best placed to investigate and collect proof of corruption relevant for the present case.\n\n426.\n\nThe ACC, the competent authority in Bangladesh, commenced its investigations in 2008 or even earlier. Judging from the evidence before the Tribunal, these investigations have not led to any trial, let alone conviction for acts of corruption that may be attributed to the Claimant and its group. Quite to the contrary, in the BELA proceedings the Supreme Court of Bangladesh concluded, as quoted above, that \"*the JVA was not obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means*\".\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal also had before it the considerations which determined the sentence imposed in the Canadian proceedings. These considerations include findings such as: \"*the company has never been convicted of a similar offence nor has it been sanctioned by a regulator body for a similar offence*\". In addition \"*the Probation Order* [took] *into consideration steps already taken by Niko Canada to reduce the likelihood of it committing a subsequent related offence*\"; it put Niko Canada \"*under the Court's supervision for the next three years to ensure audits are done to examine Niko Canada's compliance with the Corruption Foreign Public Officials Act*\".276\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 15, paragraphs 62-64.\n\n428.\n\nIn view of these circumstances, the Tribunal has no reason to conclude that, apart from the acts subject of the Canadian conviction, other acts of corruption were committed by the Claimant or its group.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, as concerns the effect of the acts of corruption, the Tribunal notes that the Canadian authorities were \"unable to prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the Minister\". No allegation to the contrary was made in this arbitration. Bearing in mind the quoted finding of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh concerning the absence of \"fraudulent means\" in the making of the JVA, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that corruption had any influence in the conclusion or the content of the JVA or the GSPA.\n\n9.3.6 Conclusion on the Claimant's acts of corruption\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined the evidence before it and concluded that the Claimant has committed the acts of corruption which were sanctioned in the Canadian conviction.\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that acts of corruption are often difficult to prove, and arbitral tribunals have only very limited means to reach their conclusions.

Bearing in mind the quoted finding of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh concerning the absence of \"fraudulent means\" in the making of the JVA, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that corruption had any influence in the conclusion or the content of the JVA or the GSPA.\n\n**9.4 Corruption and international public policy**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Respondents state that \"*Corruption is unlawful in domestic and international law*\", adding that \"*bribery is illegal under the law of Bangladesh*\" and that \"*corruption is condemned throughout the world*\".277 These statements are uncontested by the Claimant.

Normally, arbitral tribunals respect and give effect to contracts concluded by the parties which agreed on the arbitration clause from which they derive their powers. However, party autonomy is not without limits. In international transactions the most important of such limits is that of international public policy. A contract in conflict with international public policy cannot be given effect by arbitrators.\n\n435.\n\nThus, contracts which have as their object the corruption of civil servants have been denied effect by international arbitrators. One of the earliest and best known examples is the award by Judge Gunnar Lagergren in ICC Case 1110 of 1963.283 Judge Lagergren found that the agreement on which the claims before him were based \"*contemplated the bribing of Argentinian officials*\".

In this arbitration both Parties have made reference to it.\n\n442.\n\nThe discussion in the preceding section of this Decision has shown that the conclusion in the quoted sentence with respect to the first category of contract is a direct consequence of the application of international public policy to contracts of corruption. The conclusion with respect to the second category requires further consideration.\n\n443.\n\nThere is indeed a fundamental difference between the two types of situations. In contracts of corruption, the object of the contract is the corruption of a civil servant and this object is intended by both parties to the contract. In contracts obtained by corruption, one of the parties normally is aware of the corruption and intends to obtain the contract by these means. But this is not necessarily the case for the other side. As explained in the *World Duty Free* award, bribes normally are covert. In that case the bribe was received not by the Government or another public entity but by an individual, the then President of the country. As the *World Duty Free* tribunal held, the receipt of the bribe is \"*not legally imputed to Kenya itself. If it were otherwise, the payment would not be a bribe*\".293\n\nIbid., paragraph 169.\n\n444.\n\nIn the case of covert bribes the other side, innocent of the corruption, may have a justified interest in preserving the contract.\n\n445.\n\nIn public international law the rule for dealing with this type of situation is incorporated in Article 50 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The provision reads as follows:\n\n\"*Article 50**Corruption of a representative of a State*\n\n*If the expression of a State's consent to be bound by a treaty has been procured through the corruption of its representative directly or indirectly by another negotiating State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty*.\"\n\n446.\n\nIn other words, a treaty may be avoided by invalidating the consent of the victim of corruption. This principle may be taken as a general principle not only of public international law but as a general principle of law and as such applicable to contracts concluded by States. The United Nations Convention against Corruption294 provides guidance in Article 34:\n\n\"*With due regard to the rights of third parties acquired in good faith, each State Party shall take measures, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its domestic law, to address the consequences of corruption. In this context, State Parties may consider a relevant factor in legal proceedings to annul or rescind a contract, withdraw a concession or other similar instrument or take any other remedial action*.\"\n\n(2004) 43 I.L.M. 37.\n\n447.\n\nThe essential elements to be taken from this provision are first of all that rights of third parties acquired in good faith must be protected and second that the consequences of corruption may lead to the annulment or rescission of a contract, the withdrawal of such rights as a concession; but these consequences are not automatic. They must be considered as \"a relevant factor in legal proceedings\".\n\n448.\n\nThe position taken in domestic law of various countries is quite similar. English law, for instance, resembles that expressed in Article 50 of the Vienna Convention:\n\n\"... *a contract procured by bribery is voidable at the instance of the party whose agent was bribed*\".295\n\nLegal opinion of Lord Mustill quoted in World Duty Free Award, paragraph 117.\n\n449.\n\nThe situation has been considered by Lord Mustill in the opinion which he presented in the *World Duty Free* case. Describing the position of English law he wrote:\n\n\"*If, in the course of negotiating a contract between X and Y, an improper inducement is offered by B (acting on behalf of Y) to A (acting on behalf of X) which causes or contributes to the making of a contract; and if this fact is afterwards discovered, to what extent is X bound by the contract thus made?*\"\n\n*I answer this question, in terms of English law, as follows:*\n\n*(a) X is entitled at his option to rescind the contract; and in any event to regard it as no longer binding for the future;*\n\n*(b) X is not however compelled to take this course. He may choose to waive this right to rescind the contract; keep the contract alive and enforce it according to its terms.\"296*\n\nIbid., paragraph 164.\n\n450.\n\nLord Mustill continued by referring to \"*the considerable, and rather amorphous, body of case-law often informally grouped under the heading of illegality*\" and then referred to \"*a succinct statement of English law on the topic as it now stands*\" in the words of Justice Millett. He described him as \"one of the most authoritative Chancery Judges of recent times\" and quoted him with the following words:\n\n\"*It is well established that a principal who discovers that his agent in a transaction has obtained or arranged to obtain a bribe or secret commission from the other party to the transaction is entitled, in addition to other remedies which may be open to him, to elect to rescind the transaction ab initio or, if it is too late to rescind, to bring it to an end for the future.*\"297\n\nIbid., quoting the decision in *LogiRose v. Southend United Football Club* [1988] 1 W.L.R. 1256, at 1260.\n\n451.\n\nThis rule of English law expresses a fundamental principle of fairness: the innocent victim of an illegality must have the choice whether it accepts the otherwise legal transaction in the terms as concluded or wishes to avoid it. Obviously, the victim should not be sanctioned for the other party's illegality by being deprived of the bargain struck which it might find to its advantage.\n\n452.\n\nThe Respondents have not argued that under the law of Bangladesh contracts concluded under the influence of bribery are invalid. They have not addressed this aspect of the law. As shall be discussed, the Respondents do not rely on the avoidance of the Agreements.\n\n453.\n\nBefore considering this aspect of avoidance, the question of causation must be addressed briefly.\n\n454.\n\nThe case of bribery which has been established in the present case did not procure the contracts on which the claims in this arbitration are based. The JVA had been concluded long before the acts of corruption. The Minister who received the benefit of the vehicle and of the invitation to the United States was forced to resign quickly thereafter in June 2005. The GPSA was concluded only some 18 months later, in December 2006.\n\n455.\n\nThus, there is no link of causation between the established acts of corruption and the conclusion of the agreements, and it is not alleged that there is such a link. Instead, the Respondents argue that an attempt to obtain a contract by bribery is sufficient to deny recourse to ICSID arbitration to the party having made such an attempt.298\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 54: \"*The question in this case is whether ICSID jurisdiction should be denied to a claimant which attempts to procure an investment contract by bribery, or only to one which succeeds*.\"\n\n456.\n\nMore importantly, the Respondents have not sought to avoid the agreements nor did they state that the Agreements were void *ab initio*. In response to the Tribunal's questions prior to the hearing, they stated:\n\n\"*The Respondents do not intend to argue that the contract is void or voidable, by reason of corruption or otherwise. They would, of course, revisit this position if further disclosure made it appropriate to do so*.\"299\n\nThe Respondents' letter of 29 August 2011, in response to the Tribunal's questions, question 2.3, item 4.\n\n457.\n\nAt the hearing the Respondents confirmed this position. They explained that the issue arising from the objections they raise \"*is the clean hands issue. It is independent of the status of the contracts themselves*\".300\n\nHT 1, p. 165.\n\n458.\n\nThe position was again confirmed shortly thereafter:\n\n\"*We are not saying that anything is void or voidable, we are saying that in these circumstances it is a question of the integrity of the system as a whole in these circumstances*.\"301\n\nHT 1, p. 166.\n\n459.\n\nWhile the Respondents rely *inter alia* on the decision of the arbitration tribunal in the *World Duty Free* case, it deserves noting that the position just described is quite different from that taken by the Republic of Kenya in that case. Kenya avoided the contract in issue by a formal declaration and did so \"*unequivocally and timeously*\".302 Throughout the proceedings in the present case the Respondents made no such declaration; to the contrary, as the statement at the hearing quoted above shows, the Respondents did not intend to treat the agreements as avoided.\n\nWorld Duty Free Award, paragraph 183.\n\n460.\n\nTowards the end of the hearing new circumstances arose, which may have brought about a change in the Respondents' position, as they had reserved to do in their response to the Tribunal quoted above. These new circumstances arose when Claimant's counsel made reference to documents emanating from the ACC and containing the allegations made before this commission.303 As explained above, he delivered these documents to the Respondents' counsel who decided, after having examined the documents, to introduce the documents in the arbitration.304 The Respondents' counsel then argued:\n\n\"*MS MACDONALD: Yes, the key allegation is that the JVA was obtained by - well there are a number of allegations but for our purposes the relevant one is that the JVA was obtained by bribery on the part of, among others, Mr Qasim Sharif so we think this is quite fundamental and certainly, as far as we are concerned, fundamentally changes the complexion of the case and some of our arguments*.\"305\n\nHT 2, p. 222.\n\nHT 2, p. 226; the documents were produced as Hearing Documents R-2 and R-3; see HT 2, p. 229.\n\nHT 2, p. 226.\n\n461.\n\nIn their closing argument, the Respondents referred to the newly produced documents, stating that:\n\n\"... *it would not be responsible for us to let pass if we are confronted with documents suggesting that the JVA was obtained by bribery. Responsibly we need to ask for an opportunity to deal with that if that becomes necessary in due course*.\"306\n\nHT 2, p. 302.\n\n462.\n\nHowever, neither at that occasion nor at any time thereafter did the Respondents declare the JVA, the GSPA or the arbitration clauses contained in them as avoided. To the knowledge of this Tribunal, the Respondents continue to enjoy the benefit of these agreements.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondents do not rely on the proven nor on the alleged acts of corruption as grounds for avoiding the agreements and the arbitration clauses contained therein. Their defence is that, even though the agreements are still in force, the Claimant may not rely on their respective ICSID arbitration clauses.\n\n464.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is of the view that, in the absence of a clear declaration by the Respondents and given that there is no illegality in the content of the Agreements or in their performance, it may not treat the Agreements as avoided or invalid. It will now consider the Respondents' argument that the Claimant nevertheless should be deprived of relying on the agreement to arbitrate in ICSID proceedings disputes arising from the Agreements.\n\n**9.6 Contracts obtained by corruption**\n----------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe *World Duty Free* tribunal stated that\n\n\"... *claims based on contracts of corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal*.\"292\n\nWorld Duty Free Award, paragraph 157.\n\n441.\n\nThis passage has been quoted by other tribunals and learned writers.

Describing the position of English law he wrote:\n\n\"*If, in the course of negotiating a contract between X and Y, an improper inducement is offered by B (acting on behalf of Y) to A (acting on behalf of X) which causes or contributes to the making of a contract; and if this fact is afterwards discovered, to what extent is X bound by the contract thus made?*\"\n\n*I answer this question, in terms of English law, as follows:*\n\n*(a) X is entitled at his option to rescind the contract; and in any event to regard it as no longer binding for the future;*\n\n*(b) X is not however compelled to take this course. He may choose to waive this right to rescind the contract; keep the contract alive and enforce it according to its terms.\"296*\n\nIbid., paragraph 164.\n\n450.\n\nLord Mustill continued by referring to \"*the considerable, and rather amorphous, body of case-law often informally grouped under the heading of illegality*\" and then referred to \"*a succinct statement of English law on the topic as it now stands*\" in the words of Justice Millett. He described him as \"one of the most authoritative Chancery Judges of recent times\" and quoted him with the following words:\n\n\"*It is well established that a principal who discovers that his agent in a transaction has obtained or arranged to obtain a bribe or secret commission from the other party to the transaction is entitled, in addition to other remedies which may be open to him, to elect to rescind the transaction ab initio or, if it is too late to rescind, to bring it to an end for the future.*\"297\n\nIbid., quoting the decision in *LogiRose v. Southend United Football Club* [1988] 1 W.L.R. 1256, at 1260.\n\n451.\n\nThis rule of English law expresses a fundamental principle of fairness: the innocent victim of an illegality must have the choice whether it accepts the otherwise legal transaction in the terms as concluded or wishes to avoid it. Obviously, the victim should not be sanctioned for the other party's illegality by being deprived of the bargain struck which it might find to its advantage.\n\n452.\n\nThe Respondents have not argued that under the law of Bangladesh contracts concluded under the influence of bribery are invalid. They have not addressed this aspect of the law. As shall be discussed, the Respondents do not rely on the avoidance of the Agreements.\n\n453.\n\nBefore considering this aspect of avoidance, the question of causation must be addressed briefly.\n\n454.\n\nThe case of bribery which has been established in the present case did not procure the contracts on which the claims in this arbitration are based. The JVA had been concluded long before the acts of corruption. The Minister who received the benefit of the vehicle and of the invitation to the United States was forced to resign quickly thereafter in June 2005. The GPSA was concluded only some 18 months later, in December 2006.\n\n455.\n\nThus, there is no link of causation between the established acts of corruption and the conclusion of the agreements, and it is not alleged that there is such a link. Instead, the Respondents argue that an attempt to obtain a contract by bribery is sufficient to deny recourse to ICSID arbitration to the party having made such an attempt.298\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 54: \"*The question in this case is whether ICSID jurisdiction should be denied to a claimant which attempts to procure an investment contract by bribery, or only to one which succeeds*.\"\n\n456.\n\nMore importantly, the Respondents have not sought to avoid the agreements nor did they state that the Agreements were void *ab initio*. In response to the Tribunal's questions prior to the hearing, they stated:\n\n\"*The Respondents do not intend to argue that the contract is void or voidable, by reason of corruption or otherwise. They would, of course, revisit this position if further disclosure made it appropriate to do so*.\"299\n\nThe Respondents' letter of 29 August 2011, in response to the Tribunal's questions, question 2.3, item 4.\n\n457.\n\nAt the hearing the Respondents confirmed this position. They explained that the issue arising from the objections they raise \"*is the clean hands issue. It is independent of the status of the contracts themselves*\".300\n\nHT 1, p. 165.\n\n458.\n\nThe position was again confirmed shortly thereafter:\n\n\"*We are not saying that anything is void or voidable, we are saying that in these circumstances it is a question of the integrity of the system as a whole in these circumstances*.\"301\n\nHT 1, p. 166.\n\n459.\n\nWhile the Respondents rely *inter alia* on the decision of the arbitration tribunal in the *World Duty Free* case, it deserves noting that the position just described is quite different from that taken by the Republic of Kenya in that case. Kenya avoided the contract in issue by a formal declaration and did so \"*unequivocally and timeously*\".302 Throughout the proceedings in the present case the Respondents made no such declaration; to the contrary, as the statement at the hearing quoted above shows, the Respondents did not intend to treat the agreements as avoided.\n\nWorld Duty Free Award, paragraph 183.\n\n460.\n\nTowards the end of the hearing new circumstances arose, which may have brought about a change in the Respondents' position, as they had reserved to do in their response to the Tribunal quoted above. These new circumstances arose when Claimant's counsel made reference to documents emanating from the ACC and containing the allegations made before this commission.303 As explained above, he delivered these documents to the Respondents' counsel who decided, after having examined the documents, to introduce the documents in the arbitration.304 The Respondents' counsel then argued:\n\n\"*MS MACDONALD: Yes, the key allegation is that the JVA was obtained by - well there are a number of allegations but for our purposes the relevant one is that the JVA was obtained by bribery on the part of, among others, Mr Qasim Sharif so we think this is quite fundamental and certainly, as far as we are concerned, fundamentally changes the complexion of the case and some of our arguments*.\"305\n\nHT 2, p. 222.\n\nHT 2, p. 226; the documents were produced as Hearing Documents R-2 and R-3; see HT 2, p. 229.\n\nHT 2, p. 226.\n\n461.\n\nIn their closing argument, the Respondents referred to the newly produced documents, stating that:\n\n\"... *it would not be responsible for us to let pass if we are confronted with documents suggesting that the JVA was obtained by bribery. Responsibly we need to ask for an opportunity to deal with that if that becomes necessary in due course*.\"306\n\nHT 2, p. 302.\n\n462.\n\nHowever, neither at that occasion nor at any time thereafter did the Respondents declare the JVA, the GSPA or the arbitration clauses contained in them as avoided. To the knowledge of this Tribunal, the Respondents continue to enjoy the benefit of these agreements.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Respondents do not rely on the proven nor on the alleged acts of corruption as grounds for avoiding the agreements and the arbitration clauses contained therein. Their defence is that, even though the agreements are still in force, the Claimant may not rely on their respective ICSID arbitration clauses.\n\n464.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is of the view that, in the absence of a clear declaration by the Respondents and given that there is no illegality in the content of the Agreements or in their performance, it may not treat the Agreements as avoided or invalid. It will now consider the Respondents' argument that the Claimant nevertheless should be deprived of relying on the agreement to arbitrate in ICSID proceedings disputes arising from the Agreements.\n\n**9.7 Denial of jurisdiction despite an otherwise binding arbitration agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nSince the agreements and with them the arbitration clauses have not been avoided, they remain in force and binding. The Respondents nevertheless argue that, because of the act of bribery linked to the investment and for which Niko Canada has been convicted, ICSID jurisdiction should be denied to the Claimant. If this position were accepted, Petrobangla and BAPEX could invoke the arbitration clauses but Niko could not.\n\n466.\n\nIn support of their position the Respondents invoke several lines of argument: (i) the offer of ICSID arbitration applies only to investments made in good faith, (ii) accepting jurisdiction would jeopardise the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism and (iii) the doctrine of clean hands.\n\n**9.7 Denial of jurisdiction despite an otherwise binding arbitration agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nSince the agreements and with them the arbitration clauses have not been avoided, they remain in force and binding.

The offer is made to an unknown number of unidentified foreign investors. In the context of such treaties, the circumstances might justify the conclusion that the host State offers access to the dispute settlement regime provided by the treaty only subject to certain conditions.\n\n470.\n\nHowever, in the present case jurisdiction is not based on such a treaty but on two agreements. The arbitration clause in these agreements is not merely an offer subject to conditions which may or may not be accepted. Rather it contains a firm agreement binding both parties to submit their disputes to ICSID arbitration.\n\n471.\n\nThe question whether the investment was made in good faith or not and, if not, what consequences would have to be drawn from it, are matters which must be resolved in the agreed manner. In a contractual dispute as the present one, alleged or established lack of good faith in the investment does not justify the denial of jurisdiction but must be considered as part of the merits of the dispute.\n\n472.\n\nIn this context the Respondents also make reference to the *World Duty Free* award,309 issued in a contract case. The reasons developed in that award are of no assistance to the Respondents, precisely because in that case, as explained above, the Government of Kenya had avoided the agreement; the tribunal had accepted jurisdiction; and in the exercise of that mandate denied the claim on the merits.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraphs 38-39.\n\n9.7.1 Arbitration offer applicable only for good faith investment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe first line of arguments refers to a number of awards in ICSID arbitration proceedings.307 In one of these cases the Tribunal stated that:\n\n\"... *States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investment not made in good faith*.\"308\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraphs 54 *et seq.*\n\nPhoenix Action Award, paragraph 106.\n\n468.\n\nOther cases which the Respondents cite relate not specifically to the dispute settlement mechanism but more generally to substantive rights granted to the investor under the treaty; awards in some of these cases state that the protection of the treaty does not apply to investments not made in good faith or in violation of the law of the host State.\n\n469.\n\nThe quoted observation, as similar other references to which the Respondents refer, relates to treaties in which a State makes a commitment to another State, offering to nationals of that other State to abide by certain rules, including the settlement of investment disputes by ICSID or other forms of arbitration.

In the Tribunal's view, such integrity is promoted, and not violated, by the adjudication of disputes submitted to the Centre under a valid consent to arbitrate. Faced with a binding arbitration agreement and subject to the specific requirements under the ICSID Convention, considered elsewhere in this decision, the Tribunal must address the substance of the dispute. In so doing, the integrity of the system is protected by the resolution of the contentions made (including allegations of violation of public policy) rather than by avoiding them.\n\n475.\n\nIn the present case ICSID arbitration is invoked not in pursuit of a claim for corruption nor for claims under an otherwise illegal contract. The Claimant seeks performance of agreements which, despite the Respondents' knowledge about the sanctioned cases of bribery, have not been avoided and from which the Respondents continue to benefit. The Tribunal cannot see why hearing and resolving these claims under the given circumstances would affect the integrity of the ICSID system.\n\n9.7.2 Protecting the \"integrity of the system\"\n----------------------------------------------\n\n473.\n\nIn another line of argument, the Respondents submit that it \"*would violate the principles of international public policy to afford the Claimant access to ICSID*\".310 In this context the Respondents speak of the Tribunal's power \"*to protect the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism*\".311\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 54.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 54; R-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 53.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the importance of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism and its integrity.

Belgium*) (1937) PCIJ, Series A/B, No. 70, p. 73 *et seq*.\n\n*See e.g.* Moloo, \"*A Comment on the Clean Hands Doctrine in International Law*\", Transnational Dispute Management, vol. 8. Issue 1 (February 2011), p. 2; Dumberry and Dumas-Aubin, \"*The Doctrine of 'Clean Hands' and the Inadmissibility of Claims by Investors Breaching International Human Rights*\", Transnational Dispute Management, vol. 10, Issue 1 (January 2013), p. 2.\n\n477.\n\nThe principle of clean hands is known as part of equity in common law countries. The question whether the principle forms part of international law remains controversial and its precise content is ill defined. The situation has been analysed in great detail in a recent award in the case of *Guyana v. Suriname* by an Arbitral Tribunal Constituted Pursuant to Article 287, and in Accordance with Annex VII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). That UNCLOS Tribunal316 found:\n\n\"*No generally accepted definition of the clean hands doctrine has been elaborated in international law. Indeed, the Commentaries of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility acknowledge that the doctrine has been applied rarely and, when it has been invoked, its expression has come in many forms. The ICJ has on numerous occasions declined to consider the application of the doctrine, and has never relied on it to bar admissibility of a claim or recovery. However, some support for the doctrine can be found in dissenting opinions in certain ICJ cases, as well as in opinions in cases of the Permanent Court of International Justice ('PCIJ'). [...] These cases indicate that the use of the clean hands doctrine has been sparse, and its application in the instances in which it has been invoked has been inconsistent*.\"317\n\n*Guyana v. Suriname*, PCA, Award of 17 September 2007 (under UNCLOS Ch VII). The Tribunal was composed of Judge Dolliver M. Nelson, Professor Thomas Franck, Dr Kamal Hossain, Professor Ivan Shearer and Professor Hans Smit.\n\nIbid., paragraph 418 (references omitted).\n\n478.\n\nWhile the ILC Special Rapporteur Crawford concluded (quoting Rousseau318) that \"it is not possible to consider the 'clean hands' theory as an institution of general customary law\",319 others are of the view that, primarily because of its recognition in the domestic orders of many States, it must be qualified as a general principle of law.320\n\nRousseau, Droit international public, tome V: les rapports conflictuels, (1983), p. 170.\n\nCrawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, Yearbook of the International Law Commission, vol II (part 2) (1999), p. 83.\n\nDumberry and Dumas-Aubin, op. cit., p. 3, referring to Kreindler, \"Corruption in International Investment Arbitration: Jurisdiction and the Unclean Hands Doctrine\", Essays in honour of Ulf Franke, 2010, p. 317, and to the opinions of Judges Schwebel and Anzilotti in cases of the ICJ and the PCIJ, respectively.\n\n479.\n\nConcerning the substantive content of the principle in international law, it has been summarised by Fitzmaurice:\n\n\"'*He who comes to equity for relief must come with 'clean hands'. Thus a State which is guilty of illegal conduct may be deprived of the necessary locus standi in judicio for complaining of corresponding illegalities on the part of other States, especially if these were consequential on or were embarked upon in order to counter its own illegality - in short were provoked by it*.\"321\n\nFitzmaurice, \"The General Principles of International Law\", 92 Recueil des Cours (1957) 119 (citations omitted).\n\n480.\n\nAs shown by this quotation, the application of the principle requires some form of reciprocity, so much so that, in his Individual Opinion in the *Diversion of Water from the Meuse* case, Hudson assimilated it to the Roman law principle of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*.322 In that case, the claimant State sought to prevent the defendant State from making use of waters from the Meuse which it considered contrary to a treaty; but the claimant State itself was making use of the waters in a similar manner. Similarly, the case of unclean hands to which Judge Schwebel referred in his dissenting opinion in the *Military and Paramilitary Activities* case concerned acts of aggression which he saw on the side of the claimant State in relation to those of the defendant State.323\n\n(*Netherlands v. Belgium*) (1937) PCIJ, Series A/B, No. 70, Individual Opinion by Mr Hudson, p. 77.\n\n*Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua* (*Nicaragua v. United States of America*), Judgment of 27 June 1986, Dissenting Opinion of Judge Schwebel, ICJ Reports 1986, p.25.\n\n481.\n\nWhen considering the defendant State's admissibility argument based on clean hands, the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal, dealing with this doctrine \"*to the extent that such a doctrine may exist in international law*\", referred to three criteria which it had extracted from those cases in which reference to the doctrine had been made, in particular the developments in the opinion of Judge Hudson: (i) the breach must concern a continuing violation, (ii) the remedy sought must be \"*protection against continuance of that violation in the future*\", not damages for past violations and (iii) there must be a relationship of reciprocity between the obligations considered.324\n\n*Guyana v. Suriname*, Award of 17 September 2007, paragraphs 420-421.\n\n482.\n\nIn a wider sense, it has been argued that the clean hands doctrine, without express mention of the term, has found application in a number of other cases where claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or as inadmissible because they were obtained fraudulently or were not in accordance with the law of the host State.325\n\nFor details see Moloo, op.cit., p. 6 *et seq*. and Dumberry and Dumas-Aubin, op. cit., p. 3 *et seq*.\n\n483.\n\nApplying these considerations to the present case and the Respondents' objection based on the clean hands doctrine, it is obvious that this objection does not meet the criteria which Judge Hudson and the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal identified for the application of the doctrine in international law. Here the violation on which the Respondents rely is not continuing, but consisted in two acts that have been completed long ago; the remedy which the Claimant seeks does not concern protection against this past violation; and there is no relation of reciprocity between the relief which the Claimant now seeks in this arbitration and the acts in the past which the Respondents characterise as involving unclean hands.\n\n484.\n\nMore generally, when the events sanctioned by the Canadian judgment occurred, the JVA had already been concluded. The events were widely publicised in Bangladesh and, shortly after they had become public the Minister concerned resigned. Petrobangla and BAPEX, with the approval of the Bangladesh Government, nevertheless entered into the GPSA. If and to the extent the Claimant or its parent company had unclean hands, the Respondents disregarded this situation. They may not now rely on these events to deny jurisdiction under an arbitration agreement which they then accepted. The additional details of which the Respondents may have learned subsequently through the account in Canadian judgment do not aggravate the offence in any substantial manner compared to what was publicly known in Bangladesh when the GPSA was concluded.\n\n485.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal may not rely on the events subject of the Canadian judgment as grounds for refusing to examine the merits of a dispute which the parties to the agreements have accepted to submit to ICSID arbitration. The Respondents' objection based on acts of corruption must be dismissed.\n\n9.7.3 The \"clean hands\" doctrine\n--------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nFinally, the Respondents state that the Claimant \"*does not bring this claim with clean hands*\".312 In a footnote of its First Counter-Memorial it had explained that the *\"'clean hands' principle is well recognised in common law*\" and referred to a decision of the High Court of Australia.313 The Respondents also quote from the Individual Opinion which Judge Manley Hudson delivered in the case before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) and concerning the *Diversion of Water from the Meuse*.314 That opinion relies on a legal principle described by various expressions including the maxim \"*He who seeks equity must do equity*\"; it is often referred to as a particularly important manifestation of the \"clean hands\" principle.315\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 53.\n\nR-CMJ.1, fn. 44.\n\n(*Netherlands v.

Suriname*, Award of 17 September 2007, paragraphs 420-421.\n\n482.\n\nIn a wider sense, it has been argued that the clean hands doctrine, without express mention of the term, has found application in a number of other cases where claims were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or as inadmissible because they were obtained fraudulently or were not in accordance with the law of the host State.325\n\nFor details see Moloo, op.cit., p. 6 *et seq*. and Dumberry and Dumas-Aubin, op. cit., p. 3 *et seq*.\n\n483.\n\nApplying these considerations to the present case and the Respondents' objection based on the clean hands doctrine, it is obvious that this objection does not meet the criteria which Judge Hudson and the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal identified for the application of the doctrine in international law. Here the violation on which the Respondents rely is not continuing, but consisted in two acts that have been completed long ago; the remedy which the Claimant seeks does not concern protection against this past violation; and there is no relation of reciprocity between the relief which the Claimant now seeks in this arbitration and the acts in the past which the Respondents characterise as involving unclean hands.\n\n484.\n\nMore generally, when the events sanctioned by the Canadian judgment occurred, the JVA had already been concluded. The events were widely publicised in Bangladesh and, shortly after they had become public the Minister concerned resigned. Petrobangla and BAPEX, with the approval of the Bangladesh Government, nevertheless entered into the GPSA. If and to the extent the Claimant or its parent company had unclean hands, the Respondents disregarded this situation. They may not now rely on these events to deny jurisdiction under an arbitration agreement which they then accepted. The additional details of which the Respondents may have learned subsequently through the account in Canadian judgment do not aggravate the offence in any substantial manner compared to what was publicly known in Bangladesh when the GPSA was concluded.\n\n485.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal may not rely on the events subject of the Canadian judgment as grounds for refusing to examine the merits of a dispute which the parties to the agreements have accepted to submit to ICSID arbitration. The Respondents' objection based on acts of corruption must be dismissed.\n\n**10.

JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS UNDER THE JVA (THE COMPENSATION DECLARATION AND THE COOPERATION CLAIM)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**10.1 The position of the Parties**\n------------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nThe claims brought under the JVA concern primarily what the Claimant calls the \"*Compensation Claims*\" pending in a court of Bangladesh. The Claimant describes these claims as relating to the proceedings commenced in June 2008 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, No 224 of 2008 (the Money Suit) in which Petrobangla and Bangladesh claim from Niko and others \"*damages alleged to arise from the blowouts of 2 wells in the Chattak field which were being drilled under the JVA*\".326\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.8.\n\n487.\n\nIn the Notices of Arbitration with respect to the Compensation Claims which the Claimant served on the three Respondents on 8 January 2010, the Claimant sought that the following disputes be arbitrated:\n\n\"*(a) All claims held jointly or severally by any of Bapex, Petrobangla and Bangladesh to damages or losses alleged to arise from the blowouts of two wells which were then being drilled under the JVA in the gas fields in Bangladesh known as the Chattak gas field, including those arising from the matters alleged in either the Legal Notice dated May 27, 2008 issued on behalf of Petrobangla to Niko and/or in the pleadings filed on behalf of Petrobangla in the suit filed June, 2008 by Petrobangla and the Government of Bangladesh against Niko and others in the court of District Judge, Dhaka Bangladesh, no. 224 of 2008;*\n\n*(b) Whether Niko is liable for any of the Compensation Claims in whole or in part, and if it is liable, determination of the amount of liability;*\"327\n\nRfA I, Attachment C I.\n\n488.\n\nIn RfA I the Claimant referred to this notice and repeated the description of the dispute which it sought to arbitrate.328\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.65.\n\n489.\n\nThe Preliminary Procedural Consultation clarified that the Claimant sought essentially a declaration of non-liability which then was described in this arbitration as the \"Compensation Declaration\". The relief requested by the Claimant was defined as consisting essentially in:\n\n\"... *a declaration, that [the Claimant] has no liability for any damage that may have arisen from the two well blowouts which occurred on the Chattak wells and that it owes no compensation for such damage*\".329\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, opening paragraph 2.\n\n490.\n\nIn addition to the Compensation Declaration, the Claimant seeks under the JVA a declaration concerning the obligation to cooperate, which according to the Claimant, BAPEX owes under the JVA, now referred to as the **Cooperation Claim**. The Claimant expressed this Cooperation Claim in the form of the following question:\n\n\"... *whether Bapex is obliged under the JVA to cooperate and agree with Niko to (i) commence arbitration proceedings with Petrobangla under the [GPSA] and (ii) terminate the GPSA and shut in all production from the Feni gas field until such time as Petrobangla pays all amounts invoiced for gas delivered to Petrobangla under the GPSA and a new GPSA is made*.\"330\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.65 (c).\n\n491.\n\nThe Respondents raise, in addition to the jurisdictional objections concerning the two cases in general, the following further objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal specifically with respect to the request for the Compensation Declaration:\n\n(i) The dispute relating to the well blowouts falls outside the scope of the JVA.\n\n(ii) Petrobangla is not a party to the JVA.\n\n(iii) Bangladesh is under no obligation under the JVA to force BAPEX to cooperate with the Claimant in pursuing claims under the GPSA.\n\n(iv) Deciding on claims concerning the well blowout claims \"*would involve determining the legal interests of third parties (Petrobangla, Bangladesh and/or potential private parties affected by the blowout) who are not before the Tribunal*\".331\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 4.\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimant responds that \"*Niko merely seeks to settle through arbitration the claims arising from the blow outs that have been advanced against it by parties to the JVA (that is, Bangladesh and Petrobangla, the only plaintiffs in the Money Suit)*\".332\n\nC-MJ.3, paragraph 32.\n\n493.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider separately each of the specific objections and the Claimant's defence against them.\n\n**10.1 The position of the Parties**\n------------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nThe claims brought under the JVA concern primarily what the Claimant calls the \"*Compensation Claims*\" pending in a court of Bangladesh. The Claimant describes these claims as relating to the proceedings commenced in June 2008 in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, No 224 of 2008 (the Money Suit) in which Petrobangla and Bangladesh claim from Niko and others \"*damages alleged to arise from the blowouts of 2 wells in the Chattak field which were being drilled under the JVA*\".326\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.8.\n\n487.\n\nIn the Notices of Arbitration with respect to the Compensation Claims which the Claimant served on the three Respondents on 8 January 2010, the Claimant sought that the following disputes be arbitrated:\n\n\"*(a) All claims held jointly or severally by any of Bapex, Petrobangla and Bangladesh to damages or losses alleged to arise from the blowouts of two wells which were then being drilled under the JVA in the gas fields in Bangladesh known as the Chattak gas field, including those arising from the matters alleged in either the Legal Notice dated May 27, 2008 issued on behalf of Petrobangla to Niko and/or in the pleadings filed on behalf of Petrobangla in the suit filed June, 2008 by Petrobangla and the Government of Bangladesh against Niko and others in the court of District Judge, Dhaka Bangladesh, no. 224 of 2008;*\n\n*(b) Whether Niko is liable for any of the Compensation Claims in whole or in part, and if it is liable, determination of the amount of liability;*\"327\n\nRfA I, Attachment C I.\n\n488.\n\nIn RfA I the Claimant referred to this notice and repeated the description of the dispute which it sought to arbitrate.328\n\nRfA I, paragraph 6.65.\n\n489.\n\nThe Preliminary Procedural Consultation clarified that the Claimant sought essentially a declaration of non-liability which then was described in this arbitration as the \"Compensation Declaration\".

They argue that the arbitration clause applies only \"*if the rights invoked derived from a contractual commitment owed by one party to the other under the JVA*\".333 They explain that the liability of Niko, in particular with respect to the claims made in the Money Suit, arises essentially not out of the JVA but from \"*tort and statute law*\", \"*criminal or statutory liability*\"334 and concerns \"*loss and damage caused by negligence, lack of skill and proper supervision*\";335 as well as \"*environmental damage, loss of gas and negligence relating to the two blowouts*\".336 In the Respondents' position, claims on such bases are not of a contractual nature and are outside the subject matter jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 17.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 16.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 13.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 14.\n\n495.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the same words in the arbitration clause in the JVA which covers \"*any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement*...\". It argues that the arbitration clause must be construed broadly and that the \"*JVA extensively addresses the Operator's standard of care and duties*\" and other matters concerning the conduct of Petroleum Operations.337\n\nC-MJ.3, paragraphs 7 *et seq*., 16.\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the JVA regulates important matters which relate to Niko's obligations as Operator. In particular, Article 26 concerns the \"Rights and Obligations of Operator\", Article 27 \"Health, Safety & Environment (HSE)\"; other aspects are regulated in Articles 6 (Business of Operator) and 20 (Indemnities) and in the annexes to the JVA, including the Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields.\n\n497.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine whether Niko has any liability for the two blowouts under the JVA and to make the requested declaration if it deemed it to be well founded.\n\n498.\n\nHowever, the declaration which the Claimant seeks is broader. By referring to \"*any liability*\" the Claimant seems to extend the declaration beyond the liability under the JVA to other grounds for liability, such as those mentioned by the Respondents.\n\n499.\n\nWhile the basis for arbitral jurisdiction is contractual, the subject matter jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals need not be limited to contractual claims. Other grounds of liability may be included, depending on the scope of the arbitration agreement and limits on arbitrability.\n\n500.\n\nArbitrability normally is governed by the law applicable to the arbitration or the arbitration clause. In ICSID arbitration the relevant law is the ICSID Convention and public international law. The principal restriction on arbitrability in ICSID arbitration has been discussed already: only disputes \"*arising directly out of an investment*\" are arbitrable under the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal found that this requirement has been met for both agreements. No other objection to arbitrability has been raised.\n\n501.\n\nConcerning the scope of the arbitration clause in the JVA, the definition of the scope refers to the origin of the dispute: \"*arising in connection with the performance or interpretation*...\". It does not contain any limit as to the legal basis on which claims are made. What is required is that the dispute be in connection with the performance of the JVA.\n\n502.\n\nThe performance of the JVA, as has just been mentioned, touches on a variety of substantive matters which are regulated not in the agreement itself but by laws, regulations and practices concerning Petroleum Operations. This appears from a number of provisions in the JVA and is set out in a general provision in Article 26.2.4 which prescribes that Niko as the Operator shall:\n\n\"*conduct all Petroleum Operations in a diligent, conscientious and workmanlike manner, in accordance with the applicable law, this JVA and generally accepted standards of international Petroleum industry designed to achieve efficient and safe development and production of Petroleum and to maximize the ultimate economic recovery of Petroleum from the JVA Area*.\"\n\n503.\n\nOne may argue that compliance with these laws and standards has a contractual basis in the JVA. To this extent, a dispute concerning compliance with these laws and standards may be considered of a contractual nature in a wider sense. However, the laws to which reference is made in Article 26.2.4 and other applicable laws and regulations apply not just because they are included in the Operator's obligations under the JVA; but they have a direct application. This application also may have to be considered as connected to the performance of the JVA.\n\n504.\n\nWhen the Respondents argue the contrary and assert that the arbitration clause is limited to contractual disputes they do not use the term contractual disputes in the wider sense just mentioned. Rather they state that the rights invoked must derive \"*from a contractual commitment\" and not from \"different normative sources*\".338 However, they do not explain on what basis they seek to justify their position. In particular they do not give any reason why claims \"*in connection with the performance*\" of the JVA must by necessity be contractual claims in the narrow sense in which the Respondents use the term.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 27.\n\n505.\n\nIn view of this wide scope of Niko's obligations under the JVA and the difference in the origin of these obligations, extending beyond specific prescriptions in the agreement itself, the Tribunal understands disputes \"*in connection with the performance*\" of the JVA in a wider sense, which may include sources of liability other than the agreement itself. The question what these sources are and which obligations, contractual or other, fall to be considered concerns the substance of the dispute and is not determined at this stage of the arbitration.\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it may well be possible that it can make findings concerning liability on grounds other than the JVA. A more precise determination depends on an analysis of the claim made. This will be undertaken when the Tribunal considers the merits of the dispute.\n\n**10.2 Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n494.\n\nThe Respondents refer to the passage in the arbitration clause which describes the type of dispute to which it applies: \"*any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this JVA*...\".

Claims based on the JVA therefore cannot be brought against these two Respondents.340\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, pp. 10-12.\n\n509.\n\nPetrobangla and Bangladesh are not named as party to the JVA and have not signed this agreement. The Tribunal has explained above the reasons why it does not accept jurisdiction over Bangladesh. The remaining question is whether it has jurisdiction over Petrobangla in respect of claims under the JVA.\n\n510.\n\nThe arguments of the Claimant in support of its position that Petrobangla is a party to the JVA and that jurisdiction with respect to JVA claims should extend to it are largely similar if not identical to those concerning jurisdiction over Bangladesh.\n\n511.\n\nThe Claimant argues that *\"BAPEX acted on behalf of both the other Respondents in making the JVA. All the other Respondents are parties to the agreement*\". It adds that \"*the Respondents, each of whom had a role in the making of the JVA by approving it, did not appear to give any weight to their supposed separate identities when approving the JVA commitments to the foreign investor about tax concession, priority on Petrobangla's delivery system, and the price and sales specifications of the gas. The necessary and proper implication from the facts is that the parties necessary to give effect to these promises, which include Petrobangla, intended to be bound to the JVA*\".341\n\nC-MJ.3, p. 11.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that, in the circumstances of this case, the distinct legal personality of BAPEX and Petrobangla and their status of agencies of the Government, designated as such to ICSID, must be respected. The JVA itself clearly distinguishes between the three entities, specifying that BAPEX is a \"*wholly owned Company*\" of Petrobangla which in turn is \"wholly owned and established\" by the Government. The Preamble states that \"*BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from Petrobangla and the Government the requisite approvals to execute this JVA*\".\n\n513.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondents \"*have not adequately explained the source of Bapex's rights to grant Niko rights to conduct broadly defined Petroleum Operations over the gas fields owned by Bangladesh, and purportedly subject to various authority of Petrobangla*\".342 It adds that the Respondents did not adequately explain how BAPEX could grant such rights to Niko. It concludes that \"*the common sense explanation is that Bapex acted on behalf of both the other Respondents in making the JVA*\".\n\nC-MJ.3, paragraph 23.\n\n514.\n\nThe question whether BAPEX did indeed have the rights on which some of the provisions of the JVA depend is not a matter of jurisdiction. If the matter became controversial (which at present does not seem to be the case), it would have to be addressed in the next phase of this arbitration.\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it has not seen any argument to justify treating Petrobangla with respect to the JVA any different than it treated Bangladesh with respect to both agreements. Petrobangla is not party to the JVA and therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Petrobangla with respect to claims based on the JVA.\n\n**10.3 Jurisdiction** ***ratione personae***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nThe Claimant argues that not only BAPEX but also Petrobangla and Bangladesh are party to the JVA and that, for this reason, the Tribunal has jurisdiction with respect to JVA claims also against Petrobangla and Bangladesh.339\n\nC-MJ.3, pp. 9-11.\n\n508.\n\nThe Respondents contest that Petrobangla and Bangladesh are party to this agreement.

Petrobangla is not party to the JVA and therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Petrobangla with respect to claims based on the JVA.\n\n**10.4 Impact on legal interests of third parties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe Respondents refer to the Compensation Claim brought by Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy against the Claimant in a court in Bangladesh. They argue that \"*a finding in the Claimant's favour concerning responsibility over the blowouts would inevitably impact on the rights of Petrobangla, the Ministry of Energy and the citizens of Bangladesh, over all of whom this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the JVA*\".343 They add that the \"*relief sought by the Claimant will undoubtedly affect the legal rights of Petrobangla, Bangladesh, and private third parties and is, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal*.\"344\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 28.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 32.\n\n517.\n\nThe Claimant contest this argument with respect to Petrobangla and Bangladesh since, in its view, these two Respondents are not \"*third parties*\" to the JVA. The Claimant also denies that any \"*private third parties*\" are affected.\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Petrobangla and Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, are claiming in a court of Bangladesh damages from Niko arising from the blowouts.345 It may well be that, although, as a result of the Tribunal's findings in section 10.3 above, there is no identity of parties between these disputes, this is nevertheless an overlap in subject-matter between these claims. Whether and to what extent any findings in one tribunal are relevant to the proceedings in the other is a matter that may have to be considered at the merits stage.\n\nThe claims have been presented in the Money Suit, produced as RfA I, Attachment F.\n\n519.\n\nThe Respondents nevertheless go further and argue that such an impact would be contrary to the principle in international law according to which \"*an international tribunal should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction over a dispute between the parties before it if the subject matter of the decision would determine the legal interests of non-parties to the dispute*\".346\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 29.\n\n520.\n\nThe Respondents find support for this principle in the Judgment of the International Court of Justice in the *Monetary Gold*347 case and a PCA Award.348 Yet the principle applied in the *Monetary Gold* case, in the words of the ICJ, did not relate to the determination of \"*legal interests of non-parties*\", but was a case where the Court would have had to \"adjudicate upon the international responsibility\" of a State which had not consented to such adjudication.\n\n*Monetary Gold removed from Rome in 1943* (*Italy v. France, United Kingdom and United States*), ICJ Reports 1954.\n\n*Lance Paul Larsen v. The Hawaian Kingdom*, PCA, Award of 5 February 2001.\n\n521.\n\nIn the present case the Tribunal is not called upon to adjudicate upon the responsibility of Petrobangla and Bangladesh. Its task is rather to determine the rights and duties of Niko and BAPEX in connection with the performance of the JVA. However, in the course of such a determination, it may have to consider issues in matters which Petrobangla and Bangladesh have assigned to BAPEX.\n\n522.\n\nAs the Claimant points out, the Bangladesh and Petrobangla have assigned to BAPEX rights and obligations which otherwise are theirs. This can be seen in the terms of some provisions of the JVA which was concluded with the express approval of the Government of Bangladesh. The assignment has been recorded in very clear terms in paragraph 14 of the JVA Preamble. There BAPEX warrants that it has the necessary approvals and then continues:\n\n\"*The responsibilities and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government in all relevant Articles, Annexes and Amendments under this JVA has been assign [sic] to BAPEX*.\"\n\n523.\n\nGiven this assignment, the Tribunal, when addressing the merits of the claim for a Compensation Declaration, may well have to deal with responsibilities and obligations which otherwise are those of the Government and Petrobangla and which have been assigned to BAPEX in the context of the JVA. Whether such decisions have to be made, again, is a matter of the merits. Even if such decisions do have to be made, that would not make this a case in which the Tribunal assumes jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the responsibility of third parties. Rather, its task would be to determine responsibilities and obligations assigned to BAPEX, a party to the JVA and as such subject to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n524.\n\nAs far as the people of Bangladesh or private third parties are concerned the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction, and therefore has no intention to adjudicate any claims they may have.\n\n**10.4 Impact on legal interests of third parties**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe Respondents refer to the Compensation Claim brought by Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy against the Claimant in a court in Bangladesh.

The Claimant bases this claim on the JVA.\n\n526.\n\nThe Respondents deny that the Government has an obligation \"*to force Bapex to cooperate*\".349 The question whether the Government has such an obligation is not relevant here since the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate with respect to it.\n\nR-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration, paragraph 25.\n\n527.\n\nThe Respondents also deny that BAPEX has a duty to cooperate in collecting amounts due under the JVA or in terminating the JVA in the event of non-payment. They argue that the Claimant has not provided a sufficient basis for such a claim. But they do not deny that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine it.\n\n528.\n\nThe question whether BAPEX, a party to the JVA, owes a duty under the JVA to cooperate in the sense described, to Niko, another party to the JVA, clearly concerns a dispute \"*arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this JVA*\".

JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIM UNDER THE GPSA (THE PAYMENT CLAIM)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**11. JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIM UNDER THE GPSA (THE PAYMENT CLAIM)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**11.1 The Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nIn ARB/10/18, the Claimant seeks \"*to resolve all claims to payment under the GPSA and to recover payment of amounts due for gas delivered*\".350 It argues that under the GPSA Petrobangla owes to Niko and BAPEX US$27.16 million and US$8.55 million, respectively.351 It presents two versions of the claim: in one version Niko seeks to \"*recover the amounts owing to Niko*\" and the other version, pursued alternatively, the Claimant seeks \"*payment for both Niko and Bapex*\".352 The Claimant adds that \"[b]*ecause Bapex refused to cooperate in the arbitration, Niko joined Bapex as a Respondent to this arbitration*\".353\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.10.\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.20.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 29.\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.26.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondents object that the Claimant's payment claim \"*by itself or on behalf of BAPEX should be rejected and this Tribunal should not assume jurisdiction over it*\".354 They argue that the Claimant cannot act alone as \"*the sole voice and representative of the partnership (Niko-BAPEX)*\". Relying on the award in the *Impregilo* arbitration, the Respondents argue that \"*one member of a partnership or joint venture, may not claim for the entire loss suffered by the corporate entity or group*\". The Respondents further argue that an award for payment under the GPSA would also benefit BAPEX, and that by making such an award, the \"*Tribunal would effectively be giving investment protection to a national of Bangladesh*\".355\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 101.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraphs 97-100.\n\n531.\n\nThe Claimant responds that \"*Niko's request to arbitrate included determination of the net amount owed to Niko, or alternatively, the Seller under the GPSA*\". BAPEX would not necessarily be \"co-beneficiary\" of a monetary award, since Niko's and BAPEX' shares would be calculated and paid separately under the GPSA. It added: \"*While Bapex might incidentally benefit from such an award, the determinative factor favouring jurisdiction is that the remedy was sought by and will be awarded to the foreign investor*.\"356\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraphs 40, 41 and 44.\n\n532.\n\nThe issues to be considered here concern (i) the question whether Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate with the two Joint Venture Partners or with the Joint Venture as such and (ii) if it is the Joint Venture Partners, whether they have to act jointly rather than each partner being able to act individually.\n\n**11.1 The Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nIn ARB/10/18, the Claimant seeks \"*to resolve all claims to payment under the GPSA and to recover payment of amounts due for gas delivered*\".350 It argues that under the GPSA Petrobangla owes to Niko and BAPEX US$27.16 million and US$8.55 million, respectively.351 It presents two versions of the claim: in one version Niko seeks to \"*recover the amounts owing to Niko*\" and the other version, pursued alternatively, the Claimant seeks \"*payment for both Niko and Bapex*\".352 The Claimant adds that \"[b]*ecause Bapex refused to cooperate in the arbitration, Niko joined Bapex as a Respondent to this arbitration*\".353\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.10.\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.20.\n\nC-MJ.2, paragraph 29.\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.26.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondents object that the Claimant's payment claim \"*by itself or on behalf of BAPEX should be rejected and this Tribunal should not assume jurisdiction over it*\".354 They argue that the Claimant cannot act alone as \"*the sole voice and representative of the partnership (Niko-BAPEX)*\".

The Claimant pursues claims for determining the amounts owed under the GPSA and claims \"*to recover payment of amounts due for gas delivered*\".357 Such claims clearly are connected to the performance of the GPSA. Subject matter jurisdiction for the claims cannot be at issue and has not been questioned by the Respondents.\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.10.\n\n535.\n\nAs explained above, the requirements specific to the ICSID Convention have been met. The remaining question is with whom Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate.\n\n536.\n\nThe title page of the GPSA identifies as the parties Petrobangla, as the \"Buyer\", and the \"Joint Venture Partners Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (BAPEX) and Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd.\", as the 'Seller'\". It deserves to be noted that here it is not the Joint Venture as such which is identified as the Seller but the \"Joint Venture Partners\". This expression is repeated on the opening page on which the parties are presented in greater detail. There the presentation of the Seller commences again by the expression \"Joint Venture Partners\", Niko and BAPEX, and concludes by stating \"BAPEX-NIKO jointly hereinafter referred to as the 'Seller', of THE OTHER PART\".\n\n537.\n\nOn the signature page, BAPEX and Niko signed each for itself with no reference to a joint venture or even the Seller.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that in the GPSA the expression \"Seller\" does not identify a distinct entity, but is used to refer collectively to two of the parties to the Agreement.\n\n539.\n\nThis conclusion is not affected by the definition of the \"Seller\" in Article 1.13. This definition refers to the \"BAPEX-NIKO Joint Venture\"; but continues by stating \"*as described in the Preamble of this Agreement*\". In other words, the Seller is understood as the two \"Joint Venture Partners\" identified in the preamble, BAPEX and Niko.\n\n540.\n\nThe Respondents state that the \"*Seller has no legal personality under Bangladesh law and is not a juridical person under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention*\".358 The Tribunal agrees. However, the observation does not contradict the conclusion reached by the Tribunal; to the contrary, it confirms that the arbitration clause applies to the two Partners individually and not to an entity distinct from them.\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 98.\n\n541.\n\nSince the GPSA and with it the arbitration clause apply to the two Partners individually, the Tribunal accepts that Petrobangla has agreed to arbitrate with Niko GPSA disputes as defined in Article 13 of that agreement.\n\n542.\n\nThe remaining question is whether the Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to cases in which Niko acts jointly with BAPEX.\n\n**11.2 Has Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate with Niko?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal need not decide whether the claim should be rejected in one or both of its versions but whether it has jurisdiction to make a decision on granting or rejecting the claim.\n\n534.\n\nFor this decision on jurisdiction the Tribunal must take as the starting point the fact that, in Article 13 of the GPSA, Petrobangla agreed to ICSID arbitration of \"*any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement*\".

They refer to the decision on jurisdiction of 22 April 2005 by an ICSID tribunal359 in the case of *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*.360 In particular, they rely on a principle stated in that decision in the following terms:\n\n\"*Indeed, there is an established principle of international law that a shareholder of a company, or one member of a partnership or joint venture, may not claim for the entire loss suffered by the corporate entity or group*.\"361\n\nComposed of Judge Guillaume, B. Cremades and Landau.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3 (Guillaume, Cremades and Landau), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, produced as Claimant's Exhibits, Authorities, vol. C, No. 3.\n\nIbid., paragraph 154.\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered this statement in the context of the case in which it was made. In that case *Impregilo* had acted as the Leader of a Joint Venture formed under Swiss law (GBC) and, in this function as the Leader, concluded two contracts with a Pakistani authority. It brought the action against Pakistan under the BIT between Pakistan and Italy, stating that it was acting on its own behalf and on behalf of the Joint Venture and the other joint venture members, which were nationals of Germany and of Pakistan.362\n\nA fifth member of the Joint Venture, a French company had withdrawn from the Joint Venture before the arbitration commenced.\n\n545.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal in the *Impregilo* case concluded that it had \"*no jurisdiction in respect of claims on behalf of, or losses incurred by, either GBC itself, or any of Impregilo's joint venture partners*\". It found that its conclusion was \"*in line with a number of decisions of ICSID tribunals, as well as other international courts and arbitral tribunals*\". It continued by the passage just quoted.\n\n546.\n\nThe question whether a joint venture partner is entitled to claim for the entire loss suffered by the joint venture is essentially a matter concerning the substance of the dispute. It does, however, have implications with respect to subject matter jurisdiction. The Tribunal is of the view that the question whether the claim to payment for the gas is a claim to which the Joint Venture Partners are entitled individually or jointly should be considered in the proceedings on the merits. It does, however, believe that it should not proceed with the merits on that claim if it is apparent from the case made in this phase of the proceedings that a claim by Niko alone cannot succeed.\n\n547.\n\nWhen considering the quoted passage from the *Impregilo* award, it must be borne in mind that the tribunal there considered claims under the Pakistan/Italy BIT. The tribunal found that treaty did not extend to claims by nationals other than those of Italy: under that treaty Pakistan had not accepted to arbitrate claims by German or Swiss entities, nor any claims of Pakistani entities.\n\n548.\n\nIn the present case the arbitration is based not on a treaty but on a contract subject to the law of Bangladesh. The jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention are governed by public international law, which does not, however, necessarily apply to the question of entitlement to contractual claims and to their pursuit in an arbitration. The Tribunal therefore must turn to the GPSA, as the contract which governs the relations between the Buyer and the Seller, and the JVA, which regulates the relations between the Joint Venture Partners referred to as the Seller.\n\n**11.3 Is Niko precluded as a matter of principle to claim for both Joint Venture Partners?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nThe Respondents object to the claim made by Niko \"*on behalf of itself and BAPEX as the Seller*\".

They do not provide expressly that one of the Joint Venture Partners may act for both Partners, nor do they contain a provision that requires joint action or joint liability.\n\n550.\n\nThe JVA identifies Niko as the \"Operator\" and states in its preamble that \"*BAPEX and OPERATOR mutually agree to enter into this JVA with respect to the JVA Area and form a joint venture on the basis of and to implement this JVA for petroleum operations*\". Article 2 of the JVA is entitled \"JVA Scope\" and defines the object of the Joint Venture:\n\n\"*This is a Joint Venture Agreement, the object of which is the Development and Production of Petroleum from the Marginal/Abandoned gas fields Chattak and Feni as specified in Article 3 at OPERATOR's sole risk and expense. All actions taken and operations conducted shall be in consideration to the requirement and applicability of such operation for a Marginal/Abandoned field*.\"\n\n551.\n\nThe JVA does not provide that the Joint Venture has separate personality, nor does it contain any provision indicating that an entity distinct from that of the Parties is being formed. Nor does it contain any provision on the manner in which the joint venture must act or be represented.\n\n552.\n\nThe JVA does, however, provide in Article 6.1 for a Joint Management Committee (JMC) composed of six members, three from each party. Article 6.1 provides that JMC has to take its decisions unanimously and contains a procedure for \"*the event of not reaching a unanimous decision*\". It also defines the matters with respect to which the parties shall meet and \"*take appropriate decisions*\". In addition to the matters listed there, the JVA also contains a large number of other provisions which allocate tasks and responsibilities to one or the other of the parties. Some obligations are assigned to BAPEX, in particular that of assistance and cooperation with respect to matters in Bangladesh and \"*relevant Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies*\". The bulk of the obligations, however, are assigned to Niko as the Operator.\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal sees in these provisions a confirmation of the conclusion which it reached when examining the GPSA and the meaning of the term \"Seller\" in that agreement: the Joint Venture is not an entity separate from the contracting parties with distinct legal personality; rather it is a contract for the cooperation of the two parties.\n\n554.\n\nWith respect for this cooperation, the JVA does, however, provide for some joint activities. In particular, Article 6.2.2 provides:\n\n\"*A Joint Bank Account is to be opened in Bangladesh and operated jointly by the representatives of the Operator & BAPEX for receiving sales proceeds and making distribution to the Parties according to their respective Share as per Article 23.3 of the JVA*.\"\n\n555.\n\nArticle 24.3 of the JVA provides for the sale of the gas produced as the result of the action of the Joint Venture Partners and in particular of the Operator. Article 24.3 does so at two levels. The first level follows from the principle according to which \"*OPERATOR and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as SELLER) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA*\". This principle is adopted as a joint decision. The Buyer for the gas at this stage is identified as Petrobangla or a designee. If Petrobangla does not provide a \"market outlet\" within six months, Article 24.3 provides that \"*OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the Country*...\". In other words, the decision on the principle is taken jointly; subsequent action may be taken individually by the Operator.\n\n556.\n\nSimilarly, the agreement that the gas produced must be sold in Bangladesh is adopted as a joint decision. However, there is no provision that regulates the action concerning the implementation of this decision of principle, except that the search for other market outlets is left to Niko as the Operator.\n\n557.\n\nApart from the subject matters which require decisions by the JMC, the JVA allocates a wide range of tasks and obligations to Niko as the Operator. Some of these are set out in Article 25, entitled \"Rights and Obligations of Operator\". Further tasks and obligations are set out in other parts of the JVA. For instance the Operator prepares the Work Programme (Article 6.2), procures equipment, material and services (Article 6.2.1.2), prepares the tax returns (Article 11.5), maintains the books and accounts concerning the operations under the JV (Article 12.1 and 14.1).\n\n558.\n\nArticle 26.1.4 is a general clause. It provides that \"*for the efficient conduct of Petroleum Operation\" the Operator shall have the right*...:\n\n\"*To undertake all Petroleum Operations pertaining to the JVA and the Petroleum produced there from*\".\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Article 1.47\n\n\"*'Petroleum Operations' means all operations of Development and Production and all other operations pertaining to Petroleum as provided for in this JVA*.\"\n\n560.\n\nIn view of this definition of Petroleum Operations, and in particular the reference to \"other operations pertaining to Petroleum as provided for in this JVA\", measures relating to the sale of the gas produced and to the collection of invoices for such sales may well be included in these powers.\n\n561.\n\nIt seems to result from the evidence produced that, in practice, invoices for the gas were issued by Niko. BAPEX objected to these invoices. However, the objection seemed to have related to the fact that, at least initially, Niko invoiced for its share only, not for the full amount of the payments due to the Seller. In its letter of 11 December 2005, BAPEX wrote to Niko complaining that:\n\n*\"\u2026 you have been sending Invoices to Petrobangla for payment of 80% share of NIKO to Niko's Bank Account which is in clear violation of Clause No. 6.2.2 of Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) executed between BAPEX and NIKO*...\"363\n\nThe letter concludes:\n\n\"*In view of the foregoing, we would again like to bring to your notice that in order to keep everything in conformity with JVA we stand firm to our earlier views and would appreciate that from now onward NIKO will submit invoice to Petrobangla as per article 6.2.2 of the JVA for Gas sales from Feni Gas Field and also refrain itself from submitting invoice to Petrobangla for its share only*.\"\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 377.\n\n562.\n\nOne must conclude from this passage that, at that time, BAPEX was of the view that Niko was entitled to issue invoices for the payment for the gas but had to do so for the full amount due to both Joint Venture Partners.\n\n563.\n\nA similar conclusion seems to flow from some of the correspondence in the file of documents produced in the arbitration. It appears from these documents that the correspondence with Petrobangla was sent by Niko \"*on behalf of the Bapex/Niko Joint Venture*\"364 or \"*on behalf of our partner Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Co. Ltd. (Bapex) and as the Operator of the Bapex/Niko Joint Venture*...\".365 This latter formula was even used in the \"Notice of Default\" which Niko addressed to Petrobangla on 30 September 2007.366 On 25 October 2009 Niko, \"*as the operator of the Feni Gas Field and on behalf of the JV partners requests Petrobangla to temporarily suspend the Feni GSPA till litigation and other issues relating to outstanding and future payments are resolved*\".367\n\nLetter of 21 May 2007 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 222).\n\nSee e.g. Letter of 22 May 2007 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 217), 10 January 2008 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 211)\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 213-214.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 203-204.\n\n564.\n\nAll of these communications were copied to BAPEX. There appears to have been no protest by Petrobangla or by BAPEX against Niko acting on behalf of the Joint Venture Partners. In turn, letters expressly referencing the Feni GPSA were addressed by Petrobangla not to the Joint Venture or to the Joint Venture Partners but to Niko alone, with a copy to BAPEX.368\n\nSee e.g. Letters of 1 and 15 November 2009 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 201 and 199).\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it may well be that both BAPEX, as the other Joint Venture Partner, and Petrobangla, as the Buyer under the GPSA, accepted that Niko could act on behalf of the Joint Venture or of both Joint Venture Partners.\n\n566.\n\nHowever, this conclusion seems to be contradicted by other evidence. In particular, the Tribunal notes that at the JMC meeting of 25 March 2008, Niko proposed a resolution recorded in the Minutes in the following terms:\n\n\"*That arbitration under the GPSA immediately be commenced for recovery of outstanding amounts and amounts invoiced in future under the GPSA, and that Niko and Bapex take all reasonable steps to move the arbitration to conclusion as quickly as possible*.\"369\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 12, p. 964, 970.\n\n567.\n\nThe Minutes record the position of BAPEX as follows:\n\n\"*At this point of time Bapex opines that no material gain will result from this arbitration. Bapex feels that there could be a solution in the near future that is more beneficial for all*.\"370\n\nIbid.\n\n568.\n\nNo agreement seems to have been reached between the Joint Venture Partners on commencing this action. The Claimant explained in RfA II that, \"[b]*ecause Bapex refused to cooperate in the arbitration, Niko joined Bapex as a Respondent to this arbitration*\".371\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.26.\n\n569.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal need not decide whether the JVA and the GPSA, in the understanding of the Parties, as reflected in the quoted correspondence, allowed Niko to act for both Joint Venture Partners and pursue the claim it alleges to have against Petrobangla or whether, as reflected in the proposed JMC resolution, consent of BAPEX is required. The Tribunal simply notes that, in view of the agreements concluded and the conduct of the Parties in respect of them, it cannot be excluded that Niko, acting alone as Claimant, may pursue claims for payment under the GPSA.\n\n570.\n\nIn the proceedings on the merits the Tribunal will have to decide whether Niko is entitled to claim payment under the GPSA and, if so, whether it may claim payment of the full amount due to the Seller or only of its own share.\n\n571.\n\nAt that occasion the Tribunal may also have to decide whether, in order to make such claims, Niko needs the consent of BAPEX and, if that consent were required but not given, whether Niko would be entitled to request from this Tribunal a decision by which BAPEX is ordered to give its consent or which replaces such consent. It may then have to decide on the effect of the joinder of BAPEX to the proceedings against Petrobangla.\n\n572.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has considered the Respondents' objection concerning the possible effects for BAPEX in case Niko's claim for payment under the GPSA would be awarded. If the Tribunal were to decide that Petrobangla must make payments under the GPSA to the Seller, such a decision would also favour BAPEX. The Respondents argue that, by such a decision, \"*the Tribunal would effectively be giving investment protection to a national of Bangladesh*\". According to the Respondents, such an award \"*would be contrary to the purpose of the ICSID Convention and requirements of Article 25*\".372\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 100; R-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 168.\n\n573.\n\nThe Convention and its Article 25 provide for arbitration between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. For the reasons explained, these requirements are met. Neither Article 25 of the Convention nor the \"purpose of the Convention\" excludes that an award in favour of a foreign national also benefits nationals of the defendant Contracting State. The Tribunal sees no grounds on which the Convention should make such an exclusion and the Respondents do not indicate any. The objection must be rejected.\n\n574.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on claims made by Niko against Petrobangla. It reserves its decision about the question whether such claims, if they exist, must be made for the Joint Venture Partners jointly or for Niko alone; it also reserves the decision concerning the position of BAPEX in the proceedings concerning the GPSA.\n\n**11.4 The position under the agreements**\n------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nNeither the JVA nor the GPSA deal expressly with the question of how the Joint Venture Partners must act with respect to the rights of \"the Seller\". They do not provide expressly that one of the Joint Venture Partners may act for both Partners, nor do they contain a provision that requires joint action or joint liability.\n\n550.\n\nThe JVA identifies Niko as the \"Operator\" and states in its preamble that \"*BAPEX and OPERATOR mutually agree to enter into this JVA with respect to the JVA Area and form a joint venture on the basis of and to implement this JVA for petroleum operations*\". Article 2 of the JVA is entitled \"JVA Scope\" and defines the object of the Joint Venture:\n\n\"*This is a Joint Venture Agreement, the object of which is the Development and Production of Petroleum from the Marginal/Abandoned gas fields Chattak and Feni as specified in Article 3 at OPERATOR's sole risk and expense. All actions taken and operations conducted shall be in consideration to the requirement and applicability of such operation for a Marginal/Abandoned field*.\"\n\n551.\n\nThe JVA does not provide that the Joint Venture has separate personality, nor does it contain any provision indicating that an entity distinct from that of the Parties is being formed. Nor does it contain any provision on the manner in which the joint venture must act or be represented.\n\n552.\n\nThe JVA does, however, provide in Article 6.1 for a Joint Management Committee (JMC) composed of six members, three from each party. Article 6.1 provides that JMC has to take its decisions unanimously and contains a procedure for \"*the event of not reaching a unanimous decision*\". It also defines the matters with respect to which the parties shall meet and \"*take appropriate decisions*\". In addition to the matters listed there, the JVA also contains a large number of other provisions which allocate tasks and responsibilities to one or the other of the parties. Some obligations are assigned to BAPEX, in particular that of assistance and cooperation with respect to matters in Bangladesh and \"*relevant Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies*\". The bulk of the obligations, however, are assigned to Niko as the Operator.\n\n553.\n\nThe Tribunal sees in these provisions a confirmation of the conclusion which it reached when examining the GPSA and the meaning of the term \"Seller\" in that agreement: the Joint Venture is not an entity separate from the contracting parties with distinct legal personality; rather it is a contract for the cooperation of the two parties.\n\n554.\n\nWith respect for this cooperation, the JVA does, however, provide for some joint activities. In particular, Article 6.2.2 provides:\n\n\"*A Joint Bank Account is to be opened in Bangladesh and operated jointly by the representatives of the Operator & BAPEX for receiving sales proceeds and making distribution to the Parties according to their respective Share as per Article 23.3 of the JVA*.\"\n\n555.\n\nArticle 24.3 of the JVA provides for the sale of the gas produced as the result of the action of the Joint Venture Partners and in particular of the Operator. Article 24.3 does so at two levels. The first level follows from the principle according to which \"*OPERATOR and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as SELLER) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA*\". This principle is adopted as a joint decision. The Buyer for the gas at this stage is identified as Petrobangla or a designee. If Petrobangla does not provide a \"market outlet\" within six months, Article 24.3 provides that \"*OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the Country*...\". In other words, the decision on the principle is taken jointly; subsequent action may be taken individually by the Operator.\n\n556.\n\nSimilarly, the agreement that the gas produced must be sold in Bangladesh is adopted as a joint decision. However, there is no provision that regulates the action concerning the implementation of this decision of principle, except that the search for other market outlets is left to Niko as the Operator.\n\n557.\n\nApart from the subject matters which require decisions by the JMC, the JVA allocates a wide range of tasks and obligations to Niko as the Operator. Some of these are set out in Article 25, entitled \"Rights and Obligations of Operator\". Further tasks and obligations are set out in other parts of the JVA. For instance the Operator prepares the Work Programme (Article 6.2), procures equipment, material and services (Article 6.2.1.2), prepares the tax returns (Article 11.5), maintains the books and accounts concerning the operations under the JV (Article 12.1 and 14.1).\n\n558.\n\nArticle 26.1.4 is a general clause. It provides that \"*for the efficient conduct of Petroleum Operation\" the Operator shall have the right*...:\n\n\"*To undertake all Petroleum Operations pertaining to the JVA and the Petroleum produced there from*\".\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Article 1.47\n\n\"*'Petroleum Operations' means all operations of Development and Production and all other operations pertaining to Petroleum as provided for in this JVA*.\"\n\n560.\n\nIn view of this definition of Petroleum Operations, and in particular the reference to \"other operations pertaining to Petroleum as provided for in this JVA\", measures relating to the sale of the gas produced and to the collection of invoices for such sales may well be included in these powers.\n\n561.\n\nIt seems to result from the evidence produced that, in practice, invoices for the gas were issued by Niko. BAPEX objected to these invoices. However, the objection seemed to have related to the fact that, at least initially, Niko invoiced for its share only, not for the full amount of the payments due to the Seller. In its letter of 11 December 2005, BAPEX wrote to Niko complaining that:\n\n*\"\u2026 you have been sending Invoices to Petrobangla for payment of 80% share of NIKO to Niko's Bank Account which is in clear violation of Clause No. 6.2.2 of Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) executed between BAPEX and NIKO*...\"363\n\nThe letter concludes:\n\n\"*In view of the foregoing, we would again like to bring to your notice that in order to keep everything in conformity with JVA we stand firm to our earlier views and would appreciate that from now onward NIKO will submit invoice to Petrobangla as per article 6.2.2 of the JVA for Gas sales from Feni Gas Field and also refrain itself from submitting invoice to Petrobangla for its share only*.\"\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 377.\n\n562.\n\nOne must conclude from this passage that, at that time, BAPEX was of the view that Niko was entitled to issue invoices for the payment for the gas but had to do so for the full amount due to both Joint Venture Partners.\n\n563.\n\nA similar conclusion seems to flow from some of the correspondence in the file of documents produced in the arbitration. It appears from these documents that the correspondence with Petrobangla was sent by Niko \"*on behalf of the Bapex/Niko Joint Venture*\"364 or \"*on behalf of our partner Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Co. Ltd. (Bapex) and as the Operator of the Bapex/Niko Joint Venture*...\".365 This latter formula was even used in the \"Notice of Default\" which Niko addressed to Petrobangla on 30 September 2007.366 On 25 October 2009 Niko, \"*as the operator of the Feni Gas Field and on behalf of the JV partners requests Petrobangla to temporarily suspend the Feni GSPA till litigation and other issues relating to outstanding and future payments are resolved*\".367\n\nLetter of 21 May 2007 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 222).\n\nSee e.g. Letter of 22 May 2007 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 217), 10 January 2008 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 211)\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 213-214.\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 6, p. 203-204.\n\n564.\n\nAll of these communications were copied to BAPEX. There appears to have been no protest by Petrobangla or by BAPEX against Niko acting on behalf of the Joint Venture Partners. In turn, letters expressly referencing the Feni GPSA were addressed by Petrobangla not to the Joint Venture or to the Joint Venture Partners but to Niko alone, with a copy to BAPEX.368\n\nSee e.g. Letters of 1 and 15 November 2009 (Claimant's Exhibit 6, pp. 201 and 199).\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it may well be that both BAPEX, as the other Joint Venture Partner, and Petrobangla, as the Buyer under the GPSA, accepted that Niko could act on behalf of the Joint Venture or of both Joint Venture Partners.\n\n566.\n\nHowever, this conclusion seems to be contradicted by other evidence. In particular, the Tribunal notes that at the JMC meeting of 25 March 2008, Niko proposed a resolution recorded in the Minutes in the following terms:\n\n\"*That arbitration under the GPSA immediately be commenced for recovery of outstanding amounts and amounts invoiced in future under the GPSA, and that Niko and Bapex take all reasonable steps to move the arbitration to conclusion as quickly as possible*.\"369\n\nClaimant's Exhibit 12, p. 964, 970.\n\n567.\n\nThe Minutes record the position of BAPEX as follows:\n\n\"*At this point of time Bapex opines that no material gain will result from this arbitration. Bapex feels that there could be a solution in the near future that is more beneficial for all*.\"370\n\nIbid.\n\n568.\n\nNo agreement seems to have been reached between the Joint Venture Partners on commencing this action. The Claimant explained in RfA II that, \"[b]*ecause Bapex refused to cooperate in the arbitration, Niko joined Bapex as a Respondent to this arbitration*\".371\n\nRfA II, paragraph 6.26.\n\n569.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal need not decide whether the JVA and the GPSA, in the understanding of the Parties, as reflected in the quoted correspondence, allowed Niko to act for both Joint Venture Partners and pursue the claim it alleges to have against Petrobangla or whether, as reflected in the proposed JMC resolution, consent of BAPEX is required. The Tribunal simply notes that, in view of the agreements concluded and the conduct of the Parties in respect of them, it cannot be excluded that Niko, acting alone as Claimant, may pursue claims for payment under the GPSA.\n\n570.\n\nIn the proceedings on the merits the Tribunal will have to decide whether Niko is entitled to claim payment under the GPSA and, if so, whether it may claim payment of the full amount due to the Seller or only of its own share.\n\n571.\n\nAt that occasion the Tribunal may also have to decide whether, in order to make such claims, Niko needs the consent of BAPEX and, if that consent were required but not given, whether Niko would be entitled to request from this Tribunal a decision by which BAPEX is ordered to give its consent or which replaces such consent. It may then have to decide on the effect of the joinder of BAPEX to the proceedings against Petrobangla.\n\n572.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has considered the Respondents' objection concerning the possible effects for BAPEX in case Niko's claim for payment under the GPSA would be awarded. If the Tribunal were to decide that Petrobangla must make payments under the GPSA to the Seller, such a decision would also favour BAPEX. The Respondents argue that, by such a decision, \"*the Tribunal would effectively be giving investment protection to a national of Bangladesh*\". According to the Respondents, such an award \"*would be contrary to the purpose of the ICSID Convention and requirements of Article 25*\".372\n\nR-CMJ.1, paragraph 100; R-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim, paragraph 168.\n\n573.\n\nThe Convention and its Article 25 provide for arbitration between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. For the reasons explained, these requirements are met. Neither Article 25 of the Convention nor the \"purpose of the Convention\" excludes that an award in favour of a foreign national also benefits nationals of the defendant Contracting State. The Tribunal sees no grounds on which the Convention should make such an exclusion and the Respondents do not indicate any. The objection must be rejected.\n\n574.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on claims made by Niko against Petrobangla. It reserves its decision about the question whether such claims, if they exist, must be made for the Joint Venture Partners jointly or for Niko alone; it also reserves the decision concerning the position of BAPEX in the proceedings concerning the GPSA.\n\n**12. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n575.\n\nBased on the evidence before it and in view of the considerations set out above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides that\n\n(1) It has jurisdiction under the JVA and between the Claimant and BAPEX to decide: (a) the Claimant's request for a Compensation Declaration and (b) the Claimant's Cooperation Claim;\n\n(2) It has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claim against Petrobangla for payment under the GPSA and reserves the questions related to the necessary role (or otherwise) of BAPEX in relation thereto;\n\n(3) It has no jurisdiction over Bangladesh, which therefore will no longer be a Respondent in this arbitration;\n\n(4) The Tribunal will give by separate order directions for the continuation of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4);\n\n(5) The decision on costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings is reserved.\n\n**12. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n575.\n\nBased on the evidence before it and in view of the considerations set out above, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously decides that\n\n(1) It has jurisdiction under the JVA and between the Claimant and BAPEX to decide: (a) the Claimant's request for a Compensation Declaration and (b) the Claimant's Cooperation Claim;\n\n(2) It has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant's claim against Petrobangla for payment under the GPSA and reserves the questions related to the necessary role (or otherwise) of BAPEX in relation thereto;\n\n(3) It has no jurisdiction over Bangladesh, which therefore will no longer be a Respondent in this arbitration;\n\n(4) The Tribunal will give by separate order directions for the continuation of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4);\n\n(5) The decision on costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings is reserved."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Preservation of Status Quo Until the Hearing on Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2014-03-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5 (Preservation of Status Quo Until the Hearing on Provisional Measures)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunals have considered the parties' submissions on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures dated 31 January 2014, 17 February 2014, and 28 February 2014, as well as their respective correspondence dated 19 and 21 February 2014 in response to the specific issue of the preservation of the status quo until the April hearing before the Tribunals.\n\n2.\n\nIn its 19 February 2014 letter, the Claimant indicated that \"Petrobangla should, well before 13 March 2014, request the Second Court of the Joint District Judge in Dhaka to adjourn the hearing on the Attachment Application until the Tribunals issue their decision on Niko's request for provisional Measures\". According to the Claimant, such measure would ensure that the status quo be maintained and that the situation is not aggravated. The Claimant further indicated that it would be agreeable to filing an application for adjournment of the 13 March 2014 hearing jointly with Petrobangla.\n\n3.\n\nPetrobangla confirmed that, with respect to its Attachment Application, a hearing is scheduled before the Dhaka judge on 13 March 2014. It argued that the Claimant will be given an opportunity to present its case before the Dhaka Judge and that the attachment proceedings are expected to last several months after the hearing in March 2014. Petrobangla did not comment on the Claimant's invitation that Petrobangla, alone or jointly with the Claimant, request the Dhaka Judge to adjourn the hearing until after the April 2014 hearing in the present arbitrations.\n\n4.\n\nIn its 19 February 2014 correspondence, Petrobangla asserted that the Claimant \"engaged in conduct that exacerbates the dispute\", alleging that (i) the Claimant intends to sell its assets in Bangladesh which may prevent Petrobangla from recovering any potential damages; and that (ii) the Claimant has filed a petition to suspend the Money Suit litigation (the Claimant's \"Money Suit petition\"). In its Rejoinder on Provisional Measures of 28 February 2014, Petrobangla stated that \"if the Tribunal orders Niko's proposed provisional measures and adopts the legal theory advanced by Niko in order to grant the measures sought, it would only be fair, proportionate and reasonable to order Niko to withdraw its petition for stay of the Money Suit litigation\". The Tribunals understand this statement by Petrobangla as a request for provisional measures (\"Petrobangla's Request for Provisional Measures\"); Petrobangla is invited to clarify the matter if this understanding is not correct. Petrobangla did not express concern about any imminent change in the status quo caused by the Claimant's application in the Money Suit.\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, and in response to the Respondents' 19 February 2014 communication, the Claimant informed the Tribunals that it \"is not currently attempting to sell or in any way to \u2018dissipate' its assets in Bangladesh, and provided a written undertaking not to sell any asset in Bangladesh prior to the hearing on provisional measures without the permission of the Respondents and/or the Government. The Claimant further stated that its application for a suspension filed in the Money Suit proceedings was unrelated to the subject matter of the 13 March 2014 hearing, and could not be perceived as aggravating the status quo in relation to the circumstances that have given rise to the Claimant's request for provisional measures.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunals have carefully considered the measures proposed by the parties in their respective recent communications. They are of the view that, until they have decided the respective requests of both parties for provisional measures, the status quo must be preserved. The Tribunals intend to decide the requests for provisional measures as soon as possible after the April 2014 hearing. It is therefore not expected that the preservation of the status quo is required beyond 31 May 2014.\n\n7.\n\nConcerning the hearing before the Dhaka Judge scheduled for 13 March 2014, the Tribunals have taken note of Petrobangla's explanations according to which it is not certain and indeed unlikely that the Attachment Application will be decided during the 13 March 2014 hearing or immediately thereafter. However, if the Claimant has to appear at that hearing and present its defence, the Claimant would be required to appear and prepare argument in proceedings against which it has applied for provisional measures. Preserving the status quo therefore requires that this be avoided and the 13 March 2014 hearing be adjourned.\n\n8.\n\nThe parties have not provided any explanations about the manner in which such adjournment is to be brought about under the rules applicable to the proceedings before the Dhaka Judge. The Tribunals assume that such adjournment can be brought about by Petrobangla, the party that has made the Attachment Application. It is therefore Petrobangla that must request the adjournment. If the consent of the Claimant or a joint application are required, Petrobangla must inform the Claimant of the required action so that it can act accordingly.\n\n9.\n\nConcerning Petrobangla's Request which, as stated above, the Tribunals understand to be a request for provisional measures, the Tribunals will hear oral argument in this regard at the April 2014 hearing. The Claimant may submit written comments on this request as set forth in para.12.b. below. Until the Tribunals have decided Petrobangla's Request, the Claimant must preserve the status quo relating to Petrobangla's Request.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunals have taken note of the Claimant's assurances concerning any removal of its assets from Bangladesh; for the sake of good order, they wish to confirm this position in the present Procedural Order.\n\n11.\n\nConcerning the Claimant's suspension application in the Money Suit, which is the subject of Petrobangla's Request, the parties have not indicated that there is a risk that in the near future that the status quo would be affected by any action prior to the Tribunals' decision on Petrobangla's Request for Provisional Measures. There is therefore, at present, no need to recommend specific measures to preserve the status quo.\n\n12.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunals now make the following recommendations in the interest of preserving the status quo until they will have decided the parties' respective requests for provisional measures:\n\na. Petrobangla shall request the Second Court of the Joint District Judge in Dhaka to adjourn the hearing on the Attachment Application, currently scheduled for 13 March 2014, until a date after 31 May 2014. To the extent necessary, the Claimant shall support this request if and when invited by Petrobangla to do so.\n\nb. The Claimant may submit by 24 March 2014 comments on Petrobangla's Request for Provisional Measures. Oral argument on this request will be heard together with the Claimant's request at the April 2014 hearing and the parties will be given an opportunity of orally presenting their respective positions at that occasion.\n\nc. The Tribunals have taken note of the Claimant's undertaking regarding its assets located in Bangladesh as expressed in the Claimant's 21 February 2014 submission. The Claimant is invited to report on the status of any plans for divesting its assets in Bangladesh at the provisional measures hearing in April 2014. The Tribunals recommend that no action be taken by the Claimant causing the removal of such assets before the Tribunals have decided on Petrobangla's Request."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Payment

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present case relates to marginal or abandoned gas fields in Bangladesh that the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (the **Government**) had decided to develop. Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (**Niko**), the Claimant, proposed to carry out this development. Niko evaluated three such fields and concluded that two of them, the Chattak and the Feni fields, were sufficiently promising to continue with a work plan.\n\n2.\n\nWith the approval of the Government, Niko concluded on 16 October 2003 a Joint Venture Agreement (the **JVA**) with the Bangladesh Petroleum & Production Company, Limited (**BAPEX**), the Second Respondent.\n\n3.\n\nThe development of the Feni field was successful and gas supplies from two wells in this field started in November 2004. BAPEX and Niko (the **Joint Venture Partners**) began to negotiate a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (**GPSA**) with the Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (**Petrobangla**), the Third Respondent. However, due to difficulties in reaching an agreement on the price for the gas, the finalisation of the GPSA was much delayed. Eventually it was concluded on 27 December 2006, again with the approval of the Government.\n\n4.\n\nThe Joint Venture Partners had already delivered gas to Petrobangla before the conclusion of the GPSA. They continued to do so thereafter. Petrobangla made some payments but much of the gas delivered remains unpaid.\n\n5.\n\nDuring drilling in the Chattak field, a blowout occurred on 7 January 2005 and another on 24 June 2005. The Government formed a committee to enquire about the causes of the blowouts and the damage caused. It concluded that Niko was responsible for the blowouts and estimated the damage caused by them.\n\n6.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers\u2019 Association (BELA) and others introduced a petition in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, against the Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and others, seeking *inter alia* a declaration that the JVA was invalid and an injunction restraining payments to Niko in respect to the Feni gas field (the **BELA proceedings**). The court issued the injunction against Petrobangla. On 5 May 2010, the court denied the requested declaration but maintained the injunction.\n\n7.\n\nIn May or June 2008, Petrobangla and the Government of Bangladesh commenced legal action in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, against Niko and others, seeking compensation on the order of Tk746.5 crore as damages for the two blowouts (the **Money Suit**). These proceedings are still pending.\n\n8.\n\nThe present proceedings were started by two successive Requests for Arbitration against the two Respondents and the Government, one filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or the **Centre**) on 1 April 2010 (the **First Request** or **RfA I**) and registered as ARB/10/11; the other filed with ICSID on 16 June 2010 (the **Second Request** or **RfA II**) and registered as ARB/10/18. In these requests Niko sought an award for payment of the outstanding invoices for the gas delivered (the **Payment Claim**) and a declaration that it was not liable for damages in relation to the blowouts (the **Compensation Declaration**).\n\n9.\n\nAt the First Session of the two arbitrations on 14 February 2011 in Geneva, it was agreed that the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner and that the two Tribunals may render their decisions in the two cases in a single instrument. In the present decision the two Tribunals therefore are referred to collectively as \"the Tribunal\".\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondents objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID. In a first phase of the arbitration, the Tribunal decided this jurisdictional objection in a decision of 19 August 2013 (**the Decision on Jurisdiction**). It held that it had jurisdiction with respect to the claims against BAPEX and Petrobangla but not with respect to the Government, which was dismissed from the arbitration. The Tribunal refers to this decision for a detailed account of the initial phase of this arbitration and the facts related to it.\n\n11.\n\nThe proceedings thereafter were divided in two tracks, running partly in parallel, one dealing with the Payment Claim, the other with the Compensation Declaration. The Tribunal first addressed the Payment Claim, which is the sole subject of the present decision.\n\n12.\n\nIn this phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal received written submissions on 27 September, 28 November 2013, 30 January and 27 March 2014, held an evidentiary hearing in London from 28 to 30 April 2014 and received post-hearing submissions on the question of interest on 22 May, 6 June and 17 June 2014. It now renders its Decision on the Payment Claim.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard requests for provisional measures and decided them in Procedural Order No. 6 of 1 May 2014.\n\n**2. THE PARTIES AND THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**2.1 The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant in both cases is Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe present dispute relates to two gas fields named Feni and Chattak (sometimes also spelled Chhatak) in Bangladesh. These two fields, together with the Kamta gas field, had been declared by the Government as \"Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe mineral resources in the Chattak and Feni gas fields are vested in the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh pursuant to Article 143 of Bangladesh\u2019s Constitution, as confirmed in the Preamble of the JVA.\n\n24.\n\nThe Chattak field (located in Sylhet) was discovered in 1959 by Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (subsequently renamed Bangladesh Petroleum Ltd) and brought into production in 1960. It supplied local users and, from 1974, the Sylhet Pulp and Paper Mill. It was shut down in 1985 due to increased water production.5\n\n\u2019Bangladesh Marginal Field Evaluation - Chattak, Feni and Kamta\u2019 (February 2000), p. B-8 (Annex B to the JV produced as Attachment A to RfA I and RfA II)\n\n25.\n\nThe Feni field (located in Chittagong) was discovered by a predecessor of BAPEX in 1980. It was in production between 1988 and 1998.6\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n26.\n\nBoth fields were at some point sold or transferred to BAPEX.7 Only the Feni field became productive again and delivered gas, which is the subject of the present arbitrations.\n\nImam Hossain, HT Day 2, pp.160-161.\n\n**3.1 The negotiations for the GPSA and initial gas deliveries**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe agreements out of which the present arbitration arose were the result of negotiations that lasted over several years conducted by the Claimant and Niko Resources Ltd, its parent company, on the one hand, and Bangladesh, Petrobangla and BAPEX, on the other hand. These negotiations started with a letter and preliminary proposal that Niko Resources Ltd addressed on 12 April 1997 to the Bangladesh Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources regarding the development of some marginal and non-productive gas fields in Bangladesh;8 eventually they led to the conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA.\n\nThe original correspondence is listed in the letter of Niko Resources Ltd to BAPEX dated 1 February 1999, produced in the first phase of this arbitration as Exhibit 9, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n28.\n\nThese negotiations were described in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction. The summary here is limited to the facts that are relevant specifically to the Payment Claim and its context.\n\n29.\n\nFollowing the directions of the Government and Petrobangla, the JVA between BAPEX and the Claimant was executed on 16 October 2003. Annex C thereto, the Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields (the **Procedure**) which the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (**the Ministry**) was developed in 2001 and formed the framework for the JVA.9\n\nThe Procedure is also described in Exhibit 18, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.\n\n30.\n\nThe JVA\u2019s \"object\" or \"scope\" was the development and production of Petroleum from the Chattak and Feni fields, including gaseous hydrocarbons, at Niko\u2019s sole risk and expense. It defines the investment and operation activity of Niko, identified as the Operator, and manner in which BAPEX and Niko cooperate in the context of the project.\n\n31.\n\nWith respect to the sale of the Petroleum produced by the Operator, Article 24.3 of the JVA provides:\n\n\"OPERATOR and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as SELLER) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA. BUYER of JV gas shall be Petrobangla or a designee of Petrobangla (hereinafter referred to as BUYER). BUYER & SELLER shall enter into a Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) under which the Buyer shall agree to purchase the Petroleum to which the Seller is entitled to under this JVA, subject to deliverability and testing and proof of such Petroleum. OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the Country if a market outlet is not given by Petrobangla within six months after a request is made.\"\n\n32.\n\nThe JVA also refers in Article 24.4 to the procedure for determining the price of the gas:\n\n\"The well head price of natural gas and associated products to be produced by the Seller and delivered to the Buyer shall be determined through negotiations as per Article 7 of the \u2018Procedure for the Development of Marginal /Abandoned Gas Fields\u2019. The Well Head Gas would meet the specifications (quality, pressure etc.) of the sales gas determined by Petrobangla.\"\n\n33.\n\nArticle 6.2.2 of the JVA provides that a \"Joint Bank Account is to be opened in Bangladesh and operated jointly by the representatives of the Operator & BAPEX for receiving sales proceeds and making distribution to the Parties\". The share split between the Parties is regulated in Article 23 of the JVA.\n\n34.\n\nUpon conclusion of the JVA, Niko commenced work on the development of the two fields. The first well it sought to develop in the Feni field was Feni-3, which tested water instead of gas in 17 of a total of 19 zones.10 Nevertheless, towards the end of the first semester of 2004, gas production was considered imminent.\n\nExplanations contained in Niko\u2019s letter to the Ministry of 7 August 2004 (year erroneously shown as 2002), produced in the first phase of this arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 475 and paragraph 3 at p. 476.\n\n35.\n\nNiko then sought to negotiate a GPSA with Petrobangla. These negotiations lasted for almost two years. The GPSA was eventually executed on 27 December 2006. The main point of disagreement during the negotiations was price. Still, Niko commenced delivery of gas on 2 November 2004 in the absence of a finalised GPSA. At several occasions during the negotiations, Niko reduced or suspended deliveries. This met with immediate objections from Petrobangla which insisted that Niko resume deliveries and even increase them.\n\n36.\n\nThe events during this period have been described in some detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction.11 In its Memorial on the Payment Claim, the Claimant refers to and concurs with this account of the facts.12 The present Decision reiterates elements of this factual account that are of specific present relevance.\n\nParagraphs 48-85 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nC-PC.1, paragraphs 6 and 18.\n\n37.\n\nThe negotiations commenced with the letter that Niko wrote to Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, explaining that a skid-mounted gas plant was to arrive on 1 June and the Feni-3 would go into production in July 2004. The letter continued:\n\n\"We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the subject agreement so that Feni-3 can be on production as soon as the gas plant is commissioned.\n\nWe understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the \"Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields\" as approved by the Honorable Prime Minister, the gas price of the Investor shall be negotiated between the Government, Petrobangla, and the Investor. Moreover, Article 24.3 of the Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the Buyer of the gas from the Feni Gas Field shall be Petrobangla or its designee.\n\nIn view of the above, we request a meeting with the authorised representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and Bapex to initiate the process to execute the subject agreement so that Feni-3 well could be on production at the earliest.\"13\n\nProduced in the first phase of this arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp. 494-495.\n\n38.\n\nOn 6 June 2004, Petrobangla requested that Niko submit a proposed GPSA for the Feni Gas Field.14 Niko responded on 14 June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that work on Feni-4 was advancing, and that the gas plant was expected to be in place and commissioned in time to produce gas from those two wells by early August 2004. The letter was accompanied by a draft for the GPSA.15\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in the first phase of the arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 492.\n\nProduced in the first phase of the arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 492. The draft GPSA is not attached to this Exhibit.\n\n39.\n\nFurther to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July 2004,16 a committee was formed \"to negotiate for finalisation of gas pricing of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO\". The Committee, described here as the **Gas Pricing Committee**, was composed of a representative of the Ministry in the function of Convenor17 and representatives from Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko.18\n\nThis letter has not been produced but is referenced in the letter produced in the first phase of the arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 482.\n\nMr Ehsan-ul Fattah, identified as \"Addl. Secretary, Petroleum & Mineral Resources Division, Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral Resources, GOB, Dhaka\".\n\nFor a list of members and observers see Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 485 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n40.\n\nThe first two meetings of the Committee took place on 24 July and 4 August 2004 under the chairmanship of the Convenor. Minutes of both were drawn up on the letterhead of the Ministry.19 They record that Niko requested a price of USD 2.75/MCF. At the end of the discussion \"the Chair offered Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at USD1.75/MCF, since Niko signed the JVA considering this price\". Niko stated that it would respond later.20\n\nMinutes produced in the first phase of the arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp. 482, 484, produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n41.\n\nNiko answered the proposal by a letter to the Additional Secretary in the Ministry on 7 August 2004, insisting that the gas price that it sought was reasonable and justified. It suggested consultations on the economics of the Feni development.\n\n42.\n\nOn 1 November 2004, Petrobangla wrote to Niko, thanking it \"for successful development of Feni gas\" and declaring:\n\n\"Petrobangla undertakes to buy gas from Bapex-Niko Joint Venture Feni marginal gas field.\n\nPrice of gas will be paid as per agreed and signed GPSA when finalised.\"21\n\nExhibit C-3; also produced as Exhibit R-1.\n\n43.\n\nGas delivery started on the following day, 2 November 2004, without an agreement having been reached on the price and without a contract having been executed.\n\n44.\n\nOn 7 January 2005, a first blowout occurred in the Chattack field, followed by another on 24 June 2005. These blowouts gave rise to proceedings before the courts of Bangladesh. The events will be discussed below in Section 3.2; they did not affect the production from the Feni fields.\n\n45.\n\nOn 14 February 2005 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that the\n\n\"trial production period has ended. Our gas plants have been commissioned. We now find ourselves in an extremely difficult position with our management and board to justify and continue gas production from Feni without finalisation of the price of our share of the gas.\"22\n\nThe letter went on to ask for an immediate interim payment for the gas delivered from November 2004 to January 2005 at the price of USD 2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas price within the next ten days, failing which Niko would suspend gas production from the Feni field.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 471 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n46.\n\nPetrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it \"*would make a lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from November, 2004 to January, 2005*\" without prejudice to the rate to be agreed.23 On 10 March 2005 Petrobangla announced that it had \"*arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time being to you on a lump sum basis*...\"24 Niko confirmed receipt as \"*lump sum partial payment for Niko\u2019s share of gas production for November, December and January*\".25\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 472 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 470 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 479 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nIn a letter of 10 March 2005, BAPEX referred to the letter that Niko had addressed to the Ministry on 9 March 2005 of which it had received copy. BAPEX relied on Article 16.1(c) of the JVA which identified as an event of default if \"[*a*]*ny of the party indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of Bangladesh\"* and required Niko to withdraw the notice of suspension of gas production *\"or else we would be constrained to take all necessary steps under the JVA to up hold the interests of the country*\".26\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 470 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n48.\n\nFurther meetings of the Gas Pricing Committee were held. After a meeting on 16 March 2005, Niko wrote to the Ministry, to the attention of the Minister himself, summarising its understanding of the differences. The letter contained the following passage:\n\n\"*It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the final result of the Committee\u2019s deliberations may be that we will not reach a consensus on the price. He further opined that it is possible that the Committee will have to conclude its deliberations with a report to the Ministry that a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko acknowledged that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this conclusion be arrived at as soon as possible so that other avenues for concluding the price agreement could be pursued. Mr Osman* [the Chairman of Petrobangla] *suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the Government of Bangladesh for a final decision.*\"27\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 480 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nDuring these negotiations Niko ordered the motor vehicle which was delivered on 23 May 2005 to the State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources. In June 2005, Niko Canada invited the Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary. This was followed by the Minister\u2019s resignation on 18 June and the return of the vehicle to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. These events were discussed at length in the Decision on Jurisdiction;28 no further explanations of substance or evidence have been produced in the present phase of the arbitration.\n\nSection 9 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe Gas Pricing Committee continued its work and held its final meeting on 23 October 2005.29 It issued a report entitled \"Committee Report on Feni Gas Pricing\"; the report is not dated but the signatures of the members show the dates of 25 and 26 October 2005. The members of the Committee were identified in the report consisting of, on the one hand, \"Officials from Government\", including Additional Secretary of the Ministry in the position of the Convener, the Chairman and a Director of Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX and, on the other hand, \"Officials from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd\". The report concluded as follows:\n\n\"**Committee\u2019s recommendation:**  \n The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of pricing of gas to produce from Feni field. The matter, therefore, remained unresolved.\n\nThe members representing Government side recommend that the Niko\u2019s share of gas from Feni filed under the terms of JVA may be purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price of US$1.75/MCF.\"30\n\nCommittee Report, p. 4 at Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 460-463 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp 460, 463 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n51.\n\nThe report included comments by Niko to the effect that it \"*will therefore suggest to the GOB this solution* [i.e. \"to pursue an arbitrated settlement\"] *to move forward on the matter*\".31 In a letter to the Ministry dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred to Article 18.3 of the JVA and proposed that the gas price determination \"*be referred to a sole expert to arbitrate*...\".32\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp. 432, 433 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp. 452, 453 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n52.\n\nThis proposal was not accepted and the matter remained unresolved.\n\n53.\n\nBy 24 November 2005 no agreement had been reached on the gas price and the GSPA, but Petrobangla had made interim payments to Niko of a total amount of USD 4 million.33 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that as of 28 November 2005 it would suspend gas production from the Feni Field pending \"*mutual resolution*\" of the gas price, the agreement and execution of a GPSA, and \"*settlement of arrears for gas sold to date from the Feni Field.*\"34 Petrobangla responded on the same day, requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend deliveries. It concluded: \"*If you are still determined to do so that will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall be constrained to act accordingly*.\"35\n\nExhibit C- 313; confirmed by Niko at Exhibit C-32.\n\nExhibit C-30.\n\nExhibit C-31.\n\n54.\n\nFollowing a letter from Niko dated 26 November 2005, postponing the start of suspension to 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote on 28 November 2005 requiring Niko to continue delivering under the terms of the agreement, stating its position as follows:\n\n\"*May it be reiterated that Niko cannot unilaterally decide to suspend gas production from Feni field at its sole choice under the JVA without first terminating the same. The obligation of Niko to deliver gas continuously has arisen on November 01, 2004 when Petrobangla (vide its letter no 121.16.14/648, dated November 01, 2004) issued the confirmation sought by Niko, or at least when Niko reconfirmed the same vide its letter Niko/President/04-12/036, dated December 11, 2004. As such it is not true that Petrobangla has not confirmed the agreement as asked for. May it be also noted that payment of US$ 4 million is obviously a part payment which also establish that Petrobangla has not only confirmed but also made interim payment.\"*36\n\nExhibit C-4.\n\n55.\n\nPetrobangla added that it was restrained from making further payments by an order of 16 November 2005 of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of which it quoted the following passage:\n\n\"*Since the order restraining the respondents 1.9 from making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of any gas field or any other account passed by the High Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate Division that order shall continue*.\"37\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n56.\n\nPetrobangla concluded from this order: *\u00abAs such we cannot make any payment anymore until the said Order of the Court is vacated.*\" Nevertheless Petrobangla insisted that deliveries should not be suspended;\n\n\"*We would like to state that we are equally serious to conclude a GPSA which in our opinion could reasonably expected to be completed within a month or two, until such time there should not be any suspension of production. Accordingly we request you not to take any measures which might cause us to react otherwise.\"*38\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n57.\n\nOn 29 November 2005 a meeting between Niko representatives and Mr Mahmudur Rahman, Energy Advisor of the Ministry, took place at the Ministry. Niko wrote to him on the same day, thanking him for the meeting and reiterating that Niko\n\n*\"... requires the full support of your Ministry and the Government of Bangladesh to assist us in having the ad-interim order of the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 stayed as they apply to stopping the government from making payments to NRBL. Suspension of the ad-interim order to prohibit payments from the Government of Bangladesh is crucial to allowing us to resume drilling operations and continue production of gas from the Feni Gas Field.*\n\n*We will be making an application to the Supreme Court Division in the next few days to request that the ad-interim order stopping payments to NRBL be stayed. The support and attendance at the Supreme Court, together with Niko\u2019s counsel, by the most senior government legal officials would be most beneficial in this regard*.\"39\n\nExhibit C-33.\n\n58.\n\nOn the same day, 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote to Niko:\n\n\"*Please be informed that the purchase price of gas of the Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF.*\n\n*We hereby invite you to negotiate the terms of the GPSA for the production of Feni Gas Field, finalise, agree and execute the same based on the above price*.\"40\n\nExhibit R-5.\n\n59.\n\nNiko responded on 30 November 2005, stated its disagreement with that price and reiterated its proposal to settle the difference by reference to a sole expert. In the interim it accepted payment on the basis of USD1.75/MCF \"*for volumes delivered to date, and in the future, as partial settlement for the gas sales pending final resolution and settlement of the gas price in a GPSA*\".41\n\nExhibit C-34.\n\n60.\n\nOn 5 December 2005, Niko confirmed that it accepted payment of USD 1.75/MCF on an interim basis until determination by the proposed expert.\n\n61.\n\nOn the same day, Niko sent the draft for an interim GPSA to BAPEX,42 which responded on 11 December 2005 with some suggested changes.43 Niko replied on 14 December, sending revised version of the draft GPSA and stating that it had incorporated the requested changes.44 BAPEX suggested further changes on 19 December,45 which Niko incorporated in a further revision of the draft GPSA returned to BAPEX on 20 December 2005.46\n\nExhibit C-36.\n\nExhibit C-37.\n\nExhibit C-39.\n\nExhibit C-40.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 369 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n62.\n\nOn 16 January 2006, Niko announced to BAPEX the temporary reduction and shut down of production from the Feni field.47 It also seems to have made such announcements to Bakhrabad Gas Systems Ltd (**BGSL**). BAPEX objected to this communication in a letter of 19 January 2006, stating *inter alia* :\n\n\"*In our opinion this sort of unilateral decision and message to BGSL is a violation of JVA article no 24.3 since Petrobangla is the only authority & agent of GOB [i.e. the Government of Bangladesh] that purchases, sells, monitors and controls the transmission and distribution systems of gas in the country.*...\".48\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 368 produced in the first phase of the arbitration\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 366 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n63.\n\nOn 18 January 2006, a meeting apparently took place between the \"Advisor, Energy & Mineral Division\" of the Ministry and Niko, followed on 19 January 2006 by a meeting between Niko and Petrobangla. As a follow-up to these meetings, on 22 January 2006, Niko sent to Petrobangla and BAPEX what it described as the \"final version\" of the Interim GPSA, already initialled by Niko.49\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, pp. 357-365 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.\n\n64.\n\nThis version was not executed. Instead, a meeting between Niko representatives and the Advisor, Energy & Mineral Resources Division, at the Ministry took place on 12 February 2006. The meeting was followed by a letter from Niko to the Advisor dated 13 February 2006 in which it stated that the Advisor\u2019s \"*confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office to allow us to proceed with our work was concerning*...\". Among the matters of concern Niko listed the finalisation of the Interim GPSA and the appointment by the Government of legal counsel to represent it in the BELA proceedings.50\n\nExhibit C-42.\n\n65.\n\nAt a meeting on 14 February 2006 Petrobangla requested Niko to increase production from the Feni field. This request was confirmed in a letter from Petrobangla to Niko of 20 February 2006, which referred to the request at that meeting as well as to \"*repeated requests*\" to the same effect.51 On 26 February 2006, Niko announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime Minister, the Ministry and others, that as of 27 February 2006 it planned to shut down all gas production from the Feni field \"*until further notice*\"; no reasons were given for this decision.52\n\nExhibit C-43.\n\nExhibit C-44.\n\n66.\n\nPetrobangla objected to the decision in a letter of 28 February 2006 and requested Niko \"*to immediately restore gas production to an increased quantity*\". It added:\n\n\"*We are carefully scrutinising the draft GPSA you have submitted and our response to the same shall be communicated to you in due course. If the shut down has any connection with finalisation of the GPSA, it appears to be unnecessary at this point of time when negotiations even have not started*.\"53\n\nExhibit C-45.\n\n67.\n\nIn a letter to Petrobangla of 2 March 2006 Niko provided explanations for the shutdown, referring in particular to the absence of an approved Work Programme and Budget and of a GPSA.\n\n68.\n\nPetrobangla replied on 5 March 2006, stating that \"*the gas price under the JVA is a matter of common understanding of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and the investor*\". That issue could not be subject to arbitration or determination by a sole arbitrator \"*since GOB is not going to be a party to that*\". Referring to the draft GPSA that Niko had submitted, Petrobangla declared that it was \"*ready and willing to start negotiation on that. Feel free to contact us.*\"54 The letter concluded with a request \"*to restore gas production with a promised 10 MMCF increased daily production within 24 hours of receipt of this letter or else we shall be constrained to take any measure legally possible*\".55\n\nExhibit C-47.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n69.\n\nPetrobangla, BAPEX and Niko then met on 7 March 2006. The following day, on 8 March 2006, Niko wrote to Petrobangla and to Mr Jamaluddin in his function as Managing Director of BAPEX and \"Member Secretary of the Committee for Finalisation of Gas Pricing for the JVA\", requesting that a meeting of the Committee be urgently convened and added:\n\n\"*Furthermore, we value the relationship we have with the Government of Bangladesh and considering the national interest Niko Management after having detail discussion with the Hon\u2019ble Advisor for the Energy & Mineral Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production from Feni Gas Filed [sic] as a gesture of our goodwill*...\"56\n\nProduced in the first phase of the arbitration as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 6, p. 308.\n\n70.\n\nGas deliveries did indeed resume; but the negotiations for the GPSA were completed only on 27 December 2006 when the GPSA was executed. No evidence has been produced as to whether the status of the injunction against payments to Niko was addressed in these negotiations. In particular there is no indication that Petrobangla informed Niko that, after the conclusion of the GPSA and until the injunction had been lifted, it would not make payments that it committed to make in the GPSA.\n\n**3.2 The blowouts and their consequences**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAs mentioned above, on 7 January 2005 a first blowout occurred in the Well No. 2 of the Chattak field. The circumstances and consequences of this blowout are still controversial. However, it appears that gas escaped from the well, ignited forming a high flame and caused damage to the surroundings.\n\n72.\n\nNiko conducted relief well operations in the course of which a second blowout occurred on 24 June 2005 in the Chattak gas field at the Relief Well Chattak 2A.\n\n73.\n\nNiko, the Government of Bangladesh, and Petrobangla investigated the causes and consequences of the two blowouts. These investigations and their findings will be considered in the course of the proceedings concerning the Compensation Declaration. Brief reference to them must be made here, since the blowouts and their consequences in terms of liability and the damage caused form part of the background for the court proceedings in Bangladesh and the injunction on which the Petrobangla relies as justification for not paying Niko\u2019s invoices for gas delivered.\n\n74.\n\nStarting on 9 January 2005, the Government of Bangladesh formed a number of enquiry committees to determine the causes of the fire and assess various categories of losses.57 The first committee report was submitted on 10 February 2005;58 it held Niko responsible for the first blowout. Subsequent reports in Bangladesh concluded that Niko was responsible for both blowouts and assessed the quantity and value of the gas lost,59 the damage to the local population, environmental damage and other losses.60\n\nFor a summary see the Judgment of the BELA proceedings, Exhibit C-21, pp. 14-16 and C-CD.2, pp. 47-56.\n\nExhibit R-8.\n\nReport of 4 June 2005, Exhibit R-7.\n\nInformation on the committees and their reports is provided in the Annex to B-CD.1 and in C-CD.2, pp. 47-56.\n\n75.\n\nNiko participated in some of these investigations and committees but not in others. It made its own investigations, including the engagement of a well-control consultant, who produced the Safety-Boss report on 24 January 2005.61 It concluded that the blowout was \"*in relative terms not a serious event*\" and that Niko dealt with it \"*immediately, responsibly, effectively and without regard to costs dealing with this emergency event thereby minimising its impact to all parties*\".62\n\nThe investigations are described in C-CD.2, pp. 33 et seq.\n\nC-CD.2, paragraph 108\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimant states that it performed remedial work and \"*made substantial ex gratia payments to local families, businesses, religious centres, schools and other organisations as part of its commitment to fully remediating the potential consequences of the blowouts*\".63 The Claimant quantifies at USD 290\u2019687 the direct compensation that it paid to members of the local community affected by the blowouts, in addition to payments through the local Deputy Commissioner following the conclusions of the local loss committee.64\n\nC-CD.2, paragraph 154.\n\nC-CD.2, paragraph 156.\n\n77.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers\u2019 Association (BELA) and others issued a petition in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, against the Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and others, seeking *inter alia* a determination that the JVA was invalid, that the payments made in respect of Feni gas purchases by Petrobangla were without lawful authority and an injunction restraining payments to Niko in respect to the Feni gas field or on any other account (the **BELA Proceedings**). These proceedings are discussed below in Section 7.2.\n\n78.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings, the injunctions on which Petrobangla relied when suspending payments under the GPSA and in defence against the Payment Claim were issued.\n\n79.\n\nOn 27 May 2008, Petrobangla served legal notice on Niko, claiming Tk746.50 crore as damages for the blowouts.65\n\nExhibit E to RfA I; also produced in the proceedings concerning the Compensation Declaration.\n\n80.\n\nNiko responded on 9 June 2008, denying liability for any damages arising from the blowouts at Chattak and that Petrobangla suffered the alleged damage. It added that the claims brought by Petrobangla had to be resolved by arbitration and that it was willing to resolve the issues between the Parties through arbitration conducted through ICSID, as agreed between the Parties.66\n\nExhibit E to RfA I.\n\n81.\n\nOn 15 June 2008, the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and Petrobangla, further to the notice of 27 May 2008 served by Petrobangla, commenced proceedings in the Court of the District Judge in Dhaka against Niko, two of its executives, GSM, and its drilling manager. They claimed damages in the amount specified in the Notice (these proceedings are referred to as the **Money Suit**).67\n\nExhibit C-92.\n\n82.\n\nThe proceedings in the Money Suit are still pending in the 2nd Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka, with the reference \"Money Suit No. 224/2008\". The merits of the claim have not been heard;68 but during the time preceding the hearing in the present proceedings on the Payment Claim, applications for stay of the proceedings were made. The matter is further discussed below in Section 4.2.2and 4.2.3.\n\nAt the May 2014 hearing the Parties produced a schedule of the procedural steps in the Money Suit as C-98 (revised).\n\n**3.3 The Payment Claims under the GPSA**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nAfter the GPSA had been executed, Niko invoiced Petrobangla on 10 January 2007 for the gas produced from the inception of gas production in November 2004 to December 2006. These and subsequent invoices were not paid. Details are described below in Section 7.1.\n\n84.\n\nAfter several reminders, on 30 September 2007 Niko sent a Notice of Default to Petrobangla, claiming payment of the outstanding amounts.69\n\nExhibit C-15.\n\n85.\n\nAt Joint Management Committee meeting No. 8 on 25 March 2008, Niko and BAPEX reviewed the payments outstanding from Petrobangla. Niko requested that arbitration be commenced immediately against Petrobangla under the GPSA; BAPEX did not agree.70\n\nSee letter of Niko to BAPEX, dated 17 April 2008, Exhibit C-24.\n\n86.\n\nOn 8 January 2010, Niko served Notice of Arbitration on Petrobangla under the GPSA.71 By a separate Notice of the same date, Niko joined BAPEX to the arbitration commenced against Petrobangla.72 This was followed by the two Requests for Arbitration on 1 April and 16 June 2010, the latter of which concerned the outstanding payments under the GPSA.\n\nRfA II, Attachment P.\n\nRfA II, Attachment Q.\n\n**4. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-----------------------------\n\n**4.1 From Registration to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nA detailed account of the procedural history in the present two arbitrations until the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction was set forth in that decision, issued on 19 August 2013. It will suffice here to recall only the main elements of that record.\n\n88.\n\nNiko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (Niko or the Claimant) filed a Request for Arbitration dated 1 April 2010 against the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, and BAPEX (the First Request or **RfA I**). Pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (**ICSID Convention or Convention**), the Acting Secretary-General registered that request on 27 May 2010 and assigned to it ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimant filed a further Request for ICSID Convention Arbitration, dated 16 June 2010, against the same three Respondents, i.e., the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, and BAPEX (the Second Request or **RfA II**). The Acting Secretary-General registered that request on 28 July 2010 and assigned to it ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunals in both arbitrations, collectively referred to as \"the Tribunal\", were constituted on 20 December 2010 in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. At the request of the Parties, the composition of the Tribunal was identical, consisting of Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of Sweden, France and Bahrain, appointed by the Claimant, Professor Campbell McLachlan, a national of New Zealand, appointed by the Respondents, and Mr Michael E. Schneider, a national of Germany, appointed as President of each Tribunal pursuant to the Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n91.\n\nThe First Session in these two arbitrations was held on 14 February 2011. During this Joint First Session the Parties agreed *inter alia* that the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner, that the Tribunal may issue one single instrument in relation to both cases, and that it may deal with the two cases jointly except where circumstances distinct to one case necessitate a separate treatment. It is in light of this agreement that in the two arbitrations and in the present decision, the two Tribunals, as pointed out above, will be referred to in the singular. The Parties also agreed that the applicable arbitration rules would be the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, that the place of proceedings would be London, United Kingdom, and that the language of the arbitration would be English. They confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted in the two cases and that they had no objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.\n\n92.\n\nAt the Joint First Session, the Tribunal and the Parties also considered the procedural timetable. It was decided that the Respondents\u2019 objections to jurisdiction would be dealt with as a preliminary matter. The Parties subsequently filed several rounds of written submissions on jurisdiction and a hearing on jurisdiction was held on 13 and 14 October 2011 in London.\n\n93.\n\nOn 19 August 2013, The Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, deciding *inter alia* that the Tribunal:\n\n(1) has jurisdiction under the JVA and between the Claimant and BAPEX to decide:\n\n(a) the Claimant\u2019s request for a Compensation Declaration and\n\n(b) the Claimant\u2019s Cooperation Claim;\n\n(2) has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant\u2019s claim against Petrobangla for payment under the GPSA;\n\n(3) reserves the questions related to the necessary role (or otherwise) of BAPEX in relation thereto;\n\n(4) will give by separate order directions for the continuation of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).\n\n**4.2 Subsequent to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nFurther to its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal provided the Parties on 27 August 2013 with preliminary proposals for the organization of the proceedings on the merits and invited their comments regarding (i) the Payment Claim and the related Cooperation Claim (collectively referred to as the \"**Payment Claim**\"), and (ii) the requested Compensation Declaration.\n\n95.\n\nOn 5 September 2013, the Claimant provided comments on the Tribunal\u2019s request of 27 August 2013 and proposed a tentative procedural timetable for the further written and oral procedure on the merits related to both the Payment Claim and the Compensation Declaration.\n\n96.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, the Respondents provided comments on the Tribunal\u2019s request of 27 August 2013, disagreeing with the Claimant\u2019s proposals.\n\n97.\n\nOn 19 September 2013, the Tribunal set out the deadlines for the Claimant\u2019s first written submissions and invited the Parties to consult and agree on the deadlines for the remainder of the written procedure.\n\n98.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s 19 September 2013 directions, the Claimant filed on 27 September 2013 its Memorial concerning the Payment Claim (**C-PC.1**), together with exhibits, legal authorities, and a witness statement of Mr Amit Goyal, as well as its Memorial concerning the Compensation Declaration (**C-CD.1**).\n\n99.\n\nHaving received on 24 and 25 September 2013 the Parties\u2019 views regarding the organization of the further procedure, the Tribunal issued, on 15 November 2013, **Procedural Order No. 3** concerning the procedural calendar for the remainder of the proceedings on the merits in relation to the Payment Claim and the Compensation Declaration.\n\n100.\n\nThe proceedings on the **Compensation Declaration** follow a separate track in which, until now, the Claimant has filed, in addition to C-CD.1, on 29 May 2014 its Reply (**C-CD.2**) and BAPEX on 30 January 2014 its Counter-Memorial (**B-CD.1**). The Rejoinder of BAPEX is due on 25 September 2014, followed by a hearing in London from 10 to 14 November 2014, with 15 November held in reserve.73 Since they will follow a separate track, the proceedings concerning the Compensation Declaration will not be addressed further in the present decision.\n\nThese dates were fixed at the hearing in the Payment Claim on 30 April 2014; see Summary Minutes of that hearing, dated 9 May 2014, paragraph 7.4.\n\n*4.2.1 Proceedings on the Payment Claim*\n----------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3 provided for additional written submissions on the Payment Claim and a hearing in London. Following consultations with the Parties and considering the dates for the written submissions and the availability of the Parties and the members of the Tribunal, the time for the hearing on the Payment Claim was fixed for the week starting from 28 April 2014.\n\n102.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 3, Bapex and Petrobangla each filed on 28 November 2013 a CounterMemorial concerning the Payment Claim (**B-PC.1** and **P-PC.1**); Petrobangla\u2019s Counter Memorial was accompanied by exhibits and legal authorities as well as a witness statement of Mr Imam Hossain.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Reply concerning the Payment Claim on 30 January 2014 (**C-PC.2**), together with exhibits, legal authorities and a second witness statement of Mr Goyal.\n\n104.\n\nFurther to proposals made by the Claimant on 13 December 2013 and comments by the Respondents of 19 December 2013, the Tribunal issued, on 31 January 2014, **Procedural Order****No. 4**, modifying and completing the directions with respect to the means of communication in these proceedings which it had given at the First Joint Session on 14 February 2011.\n\n105.\n\nOn 27 March 2014, Petrobangla filed its Rejoinder concerning the Payment Claim (**P-PC.2**), together with exhibits, legal authorities and a second witness statement of Mr Hossain.\n\n*4.2.2 Requests for Provisional Measures related, to the Payment Claim*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nOn 23 December 2013, the **Claimant** filed a **request for provisional measures**, requesting the Tribunal to order Petrobangla to withdraw an attachment application filed on 17 November 2013 in the Money Suit No. 224/200874 before the 2nd court of the Joint District Judge, Dhaka. Through this attachment application Petrobangla had sought to attach approximately USD 27 million, as invoiced by Niko to Petrobangla under the GPSA.\n\nSee above Section 3.2.\n\n107.\n\nOn 2 January 2014, the Tribunal invited comments from Petrobangla on the Claimant\u2019s request of 23 December 2013. Petrobangla filed its observations on 31 January 2014.\n\n108.\n\nOn 6 January 2014, the Respondents requested that, following their written reply, an oral hearing be held concerning the request for Provisional Measures, \"given the importance which both the Claimant and Petrobangla attach\" to these measures. The Claimant informed the Tribunal that it saw no need for such a hearing.\n\n109.\n\nFollowing the receipt of Petrobangla\u2019s Response to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, the Tribunal decided on 16 February 2014 that an oral hearing on the Claimant\u2019s request be held in conjunction with the hearing on the Payment Claim, which had been scheduled to commence on 28 April 2014. The Tribunal also fixed deadlines for a further round of written submissions on the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures.\n\n110.\n\nIn its letter dated 16 February 2014, the Tribunal moreover noted that a hearing in relation to the attachment application had been scheduled to take place in Dhaka on 13 March 2014, i.e., before the provisional measures hearing in these arbitrations. The Tribunal hence perceived the need to ensure that in the meantime the situation relating to the Claimant\u2019s provisional measures request would not be aggravated, nor that compliance with a possible recommendation by the Tribunal be rendered more difficult. The Tribunal invited the Parties to state what measures they considered necessary to ensure such result.\n\n111.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set forth in the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated 16 February 2014, the Claimant filed on 17 February 2014 a reply to Petrobangla\u2019s observations on provisional measures made on 31 January 2014.\n\n112.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, Petrobangla filed a Rejoinder on Provisional Measures. In this rejoinder **Petrobangla** introduced a **conditional request for provisional measures**, stating: \"*if the Tribunal orders Niko\u2019s proposed provisional measures and adopts the legal theory advanced by Niko in order to grant the measures sought, it would only be fair, proportionate and reasonable to order Niko to withdraw its petition for stay of the Money Suit litigation*\". On 24 March 2014, the Claimant filed observations on Petrobangla\u2019s request for provisional measures.\n\n113.\n\nHaving received the Parties views regarding the preservation of the *status quo* on provisional measures, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 5** on 6 March 2014. In this procedural order, the Tribunal instructed Petrobangla to request the 2nd Court of the Joint District Judge in Dhaka to adjourn the hearing on the Attachment Application until a date after 31 May 2014. The Tribunal further ordered the Claimant to support this request if and when invited by Petrobangla to do so.\n\n114.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Niko had requested on 13 March 2014 an adjournment of the hearing on the Attachment Application and that the Court granted Niko\u2019s application and issued the order on the same day postponing the hearing in the Money Suit until 12 June 2014.\n\n*4.2.3 Hearing on the Paument Claimaint and Provisional Measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nIn accordance with the directions set out by the Tribunal, a hearing on the Payment Claimant and on Provisional Measures was held from 28 to 30 April 2014 in London.\n\n116.\n\nPrior to the hearing, the Tribunal had written to the Parties on 15 April 2014, setting out some preliminary considerations concerning the substance of the dispute that may impact the scope and organisation of the hearing. With respect to the Payment Claim, it identified factual questions and legal considerations which it considered possibly relevant for its decision; it identified information which it invited the Parties to provide, in particular with respect to pending court proceedings relating to the requested provisional measures, and addressed other matters relating to the organisation of the hearing and pre-hearing consultations.\n\n117.\n\nAfter some further correspondence, the Tribunal proposed on 24 April 2014 a tentative agenda and gave further directions for the organisation of the hearing.\n\n118.\n\nThe hearing was attended by the three Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary and the following persons:\n\nFor the Claimant:\n\nMr Barton Legum, Ms Anne-Sophie Duf\u00eatre, Ms Brittany Gordon, and Mr Matthew Smith of Dentons, Paris; Messrs Rokanuddin Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman Khan of Rokanuddin Mahmud & Associates, Dhaka; and Mr Amit Goyal, Mr Tim Henry, and Mr Brian J.

Imam Hossain of Petrobangla, Dhaka.\n\n119.\n\nIn the course of the hearing on the **Payment Claim**, the Tribunal sought to clarify certain issues identified in the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated 14 April 2014 and other issues arising from the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions concerning the Payment Claim. Mr Amit Goyal, Controller of Niko Resources Ltd., and Mr Md. Imam Hossain, Secretary of Petrobangla testified as witnesses and responded to the Tribunal\u2019s questions. The Parties were given an opportunity to examine the witnesses, to develop their case orally and to respond to questions from the Tribunal.\n\n120.\n\nWith regard to the further procedure on the Payment Claim, it was agreed that Petrobangla would file by no later than 22 May 2014 a written submission on the applicable interest in relation to the Payment Claim and that the Claimant would file by no later 6 June 2014 its observations on Petrobangla\u2019s submission.\n\n121.\n\nSubject to these submissions concerning the applicable interest rates, the **proceedings on the Payment Claim were closed** and the Tribunal announced that it would now render its decision on this claim.\n\n122.\n\nIn the course of the hearing on **Provisional Measures**, the Parties were given an opportunity to present their case-in-chief, offer rebuttal statements, and to respond to questions from the Tribunal.\n\n123.\n\nOn 30 April 2014, the last day of the hearing, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached an understanding with regard to their respective requests for provisional measures, which the Parties also provided to the Tribunal in written form. The Parties\u2019 understanding was embodied in the Tribunal\u2019s **Procedural Order No. 6**, issued on 1 May 2014.\n\n124.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, the Parties submitted additional Legal authorities and documentary evidence, including an agreed translation of the docket in the Money Suit.75 All of these are listed in the Summary Minutes of the hearing.\n\nExhibit C-98 (revised); See HT Day 5, p. 551.\n\n125.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether there were any outstanding points or issues to be addressed. Since this was not the case, the Tribunal declared the hearing closed. **Summary Minutes** of the hearing were prepared by the Tribunal and sent to the Parties on 9 May 2014.\n\n126.\n\nThe hearing was recorded and a transcript was prepared by Ms Georgina Ford and Mr Ian Roberts of Briault Reporting Services. A copy of the transcript was sent to the Parties and the Members of the Tribunal on each hearing day. The audio recording of the hearing was distributed to the Parties at the hearing and was sent to the Members of the Tribunal on 6 May 2014. The Parties were given an opportunity to correct the transcript. A revised version of the transcript with the Parties agreed corrections was distributed on 18 June 2014.\n\n127.\n\nFurther to the programme agreed at the end of the hearing, Petrobangla filed its Submissions on Interest in the Payment Claim on 22 May 2014 (**P-PC Interest.1**); the Claimant responded by its Observations on Respondent\u2019s Submission on Applicable Interest in the Payment Claim (**C-PC Interest.1**); in view of new information and evidence contained in the latter submission, Petrobangla was given an opportunity for comments, and on 17 June 2014 submitted Observations on Submissions on Interest in the Payment Claim (**P-PC Interest.2**).\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated in person and by correspondence and reached the present decision unanimously.\n\n**5.

Petrobangla is not in breach of GPSA and no interest is to be paid until the date of the decision of this Tribunal (\"**Decision**\").\n\n2. Petrobangla cannot be required to violate its constitutional and legal obligations under Bangladesh law.\n\n3. Petrobangla\u2019s non-performance under the GPSA is a legitimate excuse under Article 14 of the GPSA and or Bangladesh law.\n\n4. The Decision or any proceedings thereof do not constitute an *amicable settlement* as envisaged in the Order of High Court Division dated 17.11.2009 (\"**High Court Division Order**\").\n\n5. About the dues owed to Niko from Petrobangla, the following actions need to be taken:\n\n(a) The dues as admitted by the Parties to be put into 2 (two) separate accounts to be opened in a bank in Bangladesh acceptable to both Petrobangla and Niko (\"**Designated Bank**\"). The account will be opened in the name of Petrobangla, but will be opened for the sole purpose of holding the said amount. There will be one USD account and one BDT account for holding the respective USD and BDT part of the dues (jointly referred to as \"**Accounts**\").\n\n(b) The funds in the Accounts will be held by Petrobangla until disbursed in accordance with the Decision.\n\n(c) The funds in the Accounts will be disbursed to Niko only when the conditions set out in the High Court Division Order are satisfied.\n\n(d) The Accounts will be interest bearing at prevailing interest rates as provided by the Designated Bank.\n\n6. Petrobangla\u2019s [sic] is entitled to costs in connection with the Payment Claim.\"\n\n136.\n\nIn its Counter Memorial of 28 November 2013, **BAPEX** stated its position in the following terms:\n\n\"(1) Insofar as Niko\u2019s claim is based on a contractual breach of an alleged direct liability of Petrobangla under the GPSA as a \u2018buyer\u2019 concerning the amounts \u2018owed\u2019 to it under the invoices in this arbitration, that claim does not require BAPEX\u2019s approval or co-operation. It is further submitted that Niko cannot bring a claim against Petrobangla for the entire sum alleged owed to Niko-BAPEX as Joint Venture partners.\n\n(2) BAPEX submits that there is no basis for adding BAPEX as a third party in this arbitration.\"\n\n137.\n\n\"For avoidance of doubt\", BAPEX added in these submissions that it \"is not a respondent in this case\". It made no further submissions in the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim.\n\n**5.3 The issues to be decided**\n--------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have set out in detail the relief requested in this phase of the arbitration and that the relief so requested varied considerably as the proceedings evolved. It concludes that the changes in these requests were considered and intentional. Therefore, the Tribunal considers the Parties\u2019 respective cases by reference to the latest version of the relief requested and treats earlier versions of this relief, to the extent that they have not been incorporated in this latest version, as abandoned, at least with respect to the Payment Claim which it now has to decide.\n\n139.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal has identified the following issues:\n\n(a) The role of BAPEX with respect to the Payment Claim;\n\n(b) The amounts due from Petrobangla;\n\n(c) The *force majeure* defence in respect to the GPSA or any earlier agreement;\n\n(d) The obligations of Petrobangla in the absence of a valid *force majeure* defence;\n\n(e) Interest;\n\n(f) Costs of the arbitration.\n\n**6. THE ROLE OF BAPEX**\n------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe GPSA provides that payments shall be made to the \"Seller\". This term is defined on the title page of the GPSA as \"the Joint Venture Partners\", that is to say Niko and BAPEX. The expression \"Joint Venture Partners\" is also used in the Preamble, together with the expression \"BAPEX-NIKO jointly\". In Article 1.13 the Seller is defined as \"the BAPEX-NIKO Joint Venture as described in the Preamble of this Agreement\".\n\n141.\n\nIn their submissions concerning the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Parties took conflicting positions concerning the question of whether Niko could act alone for the \"Seller\" or for its share in the amounts due for the gas delivered.\n\n142.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal examined in detail whether it had jurisdiction with respect to claims under the GPSA, in particular those made by the Claimant against Petrobangla. It concluded that it had jurisdiction to decide on claims made by Niko against Petrobangla arising under the GPSA.79\n\nParagraphs 529-574 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n143.\n\nIt reserved its decision about the question of whether such claims, if they exist, must be made for the Joint Venture Partners jointly or whether they may be made for Niko alone; it also reserved the decision concerning the position of BAPEX in the proceedings concerning the GPSA.80\n\nParagraph 574 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n144.\n\nIn the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim, the Claimant concluded that Niko was entitled to act alone in bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices which, according to the JVA, was owed to Niko; it seeks payment only for that portion.\n\n145.\n\nAlthough named as Respondent in this part of the proceedings, BAPEX declared that it was \"not a respondent in this case\". The only objection which BAPEX raised against Niko\u2019s Payment Claim consisted in stating that \"Niko cannot bring a claim against Petrobangla for the entire sum alleged owed to Niko-BAPEX as Joint Venture partners\".81 Since Niko does not claim the entire sum, this objection is moot.\n\nB-PC.1, paragraph 2(1).\n\n146.\n\nThe question remains whether the consent of BAPEX, as one of the Joint Venture partners, is required for Niko to claim from Petrobangla payment of a portion of the sums due to the Seller under the GPSA. Neither the JVA nor the GPSA gives a clear answer. In the JVA, the JV is defined as the \"Joint Venture between Niko and BAPEX\" and there is no clear indication of a distinct legal personality of the JV; nor has there been, as far as the Tribunal has been informed, an incorporation of the JV. In the GSPA there are references to the \"Joint Venture Partners\" Niko and BAPEX as \"the Seller\" and to \"the BAPEX-NIKO Joint Venture\" also as \"Seller\". Article 11.1.4 makes reference to the \"joint bank account [\u2026] in accordance with Article 6.2.2 of the JVA\" but then distinguishes between the \"sales proceeds due to BAPEX according to the JVA and five percent (5%) of sales proceeds of NIKO\u2019s share...\".\n\n147.\n\nThe documentary record of the arbitration contains some indications to the effect that the JV may be considered as a distinct \"legal\" or \"business entity\".82 Yet there are also numerous indications to the contrary: in particular the negotiations and correspondence concerning the conclusion of the GPSA were primarily conducted between Niko and Petrobangla. The payment on account which Petrobangla made in the form of two payments of 2 million US Dollars each was made to Niko directly. The invoices for the gas delivered were sent by Niko; they identified separately the amounts due to Niko and to BAPEX. This practice was followed from the first set of invoice sent on 10 January 200783 to the last invoice sent on 2 May 2010;84 there is no record of a complaint by either Petrobangla or BAPEX against this practice. The dispute about the payment of the Invoices and Petrobangla\u2019s defence based on the Injunction concerns specifically Niko as a separate entity and not the Joint Venture.\n\nThese expressions are used in BAPEX\u2019s letter of 19 December 2005, Exhibit C-40.\n\nExhibit C-5.\n\nExhibit C-7.\n\n148.\n\nThese are strong indications that, in the dispute with Petrobangla concerning the payment of the Invoices for the gas delivered, Niko may act alone, provided it seeks payment only for its share according to the allocation under the JVA.\n\n149.\n\nIn any event, in this arbitration BAPEX has raised no objection to Niko\u2019s claiming its share of invoices from Petrobangla. In its Memorial, the Claimant had expressly stated that BAPEX had a duty to cooperate and was deemed to consent. BAPEX did not object in its Counter Memorial. If and to the extent to which BAPEX\u2019s consent to a claim by Niko for its portion of the sales price were required, BAPEX must be deemed to have given that consent.\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Niko may pursue its claim for that portion of the \"Seller\u2019s\" invoices which concerns the portion of the sales price due to Niko under the JVA.\n\n**7. THE PAYMENT CLAIM**\n------------------------\n\n151.\n\nNiko seeks an order against Petrobangla for payment of USD 25\u2019312\u2019747 and BDT 139\u2019988\u2019337, plus simple interest at the rate of 5% per annum.\n\n152.\n\nPetrobangla does not contest that it owes the amount claimed but raises as defence that, on grounds of *force majeure*, it was and continues to be excused for not making the payment. As long as non-payment is excused on this ground, so it argues, Petrobangla does not owe interest on the principal. Petrobangla accepts, however, that the amount owed be placed into an interest earning escrow account.\n\n153.\n\nIn its Counter Memorial, Petrobangla argued that \"the gas supply contract between the parties has been frustrated by the Court\u2019s Order in the BELA proceedings, and is therefore terminated\".85 In its Reply Niko denied that there was merit in that position and added: \"even if Petrobangla was to succeed in establishing a frustration defence, it would still be liable to pay Niko for the gas it received, on the basis of the doctrines of frustration and unjust enrichment\".86 Petrobangla did not pursue this argument in its Rejoinder and, in its final version of the relief sought, no longer asserted that the \"gas supply contract\" had been terminated. The Tribunal concludes that this claim has been abandoned by Petrobangla.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 78(2), and paragraphs 62-67.\n\nC-PC.2, paragraph 135.\n\n154.\n\nPetrobangla sought in its Counter Memorial a declaration that the \"GPSA was procured by corruption and is therefore void\".87 The Claimant objected to this request, relying on the Tribunal\u2019s findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction.88 In that decision the Tribunal had examined the allegations of corruption. It referred in particular to the conclusion of the High Court Division in the BELA case \"that the JVA was not obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means\"; it also found that there was no evidence that the GPSA had been procured by corruption. No new argument or evidence has been produced since then. Petrobangla did not pursue the matter further and omitted the claim in the final version of the relief sought. The Tribunal concludes that the request concerning the avoidance of the GPSA on grounds of corruption has been withdrawn.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 78(3).\n\nC-PC.2, paragraphs 27-30.\n\n**7.1 The amounts due (the principal)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe amounts owed for the gas delivered are undisputed: they consist of the amounts due for gas delivered from November 2004 to December 2006 and specified in the 26 invoices sent on 10 January 2007, plus those amounts invoiced monthly for the gas delivered from January 2007 to the end of April 2010.89\n\nExhibits C-5 to C-7.\n\n156.\n\nIn its Memorial of 27 September 2013, the Claimant quantified the amounts owed to Niko at USD 25\u2019313\u2019920 and BDT 139\u2019993\u2019479.90 In its Counter-Memorial of 28 November 2013 Petrobangla, relying on the Witness Statement of Mr Hossain, quantified \"the total amount owed for gas supplied by Niko\" at USD 25\u2019312\u2019747 and BDT 139\u2019988\u2019337.91\n\nC-PC.1, paragraph 78.b.i.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 55. At that paragraph Petrobangla states that the amount indicated is \u00ab with respect to the 26 invoices that followed the lump sum payment \u00bb. This is obviously incorrect since both Parties agree that an amount of some USD 25 million is due not just for the 26 invoices but for the total deliveries until April 2010. Indeed, Mr Hossain, on whose Witness Statement Petrobangla relies, states that the amount of some USD 25 million is for the 66 invoices that \"have been raised with respect to gas supplied from feni field\" Hossain WS I, paragraph 17.\n\n157.\n\nIn its Reply of 30 January 2014, the Claimant noted that the difference between the Parties concerning the amounts owed was small. It declared that the difference resulted from slightly different approaches to calculating the amounts and that the \"differences between the parties are sufficiently minor that it is not worthwhile to debate them.\" It adopted the amounts that Petrobangla had stated as owing to Niko.92\n\nC-PC.1, paragraph 144.\n\n158.\n\nOn this basis the Tribunal takes **USD 25\u2019312\u2019747** and **BDT 139\u2019988\u2019337** as the undisputed amounts which, after deduction of payments made already, are owed by Petrobangla to Niko for its share of the price for the gas delivered during the period from November 2004 to April 2010.\n\n159.\n\nThe GPSA provides in Article 11.1.3 that amounts invoiced \"shall be paid to Seller not later than forty five (45) days from the date of receiving the invoice by the Buyer\". Article 11.1.4 GPSA adds that all payments \"shall be made in the joint bank account at a scheduled bank of Bangladesh The Tribunal concludes that, unless and until the joint bank account had been established, Petrobangla could not have made any payment. Therefore, no amount was due before this time.\n\n160.\n\nThe Joint Bank Account was opened on 14 May 2007.93 On the same day, Niko wrote to Petrobangla, requesting immediate payment of the amounts that had been invoiced by that time.94\n\nC-PC.1, paragraph 37. Petrobangla accepts that the joint bank account was opened in \u00ab May 2007 \u00bb, P-PC.2, paragraph 17(4), p. 8; at the hearing 14 May 2007 was accepted by Petrobangla as the date when the joint account had been opened (HT Day 3, p. 118).\n\nExhibit C-11.\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that all invoiced amounts were **due and payable 45 days** after the receipt of the invoice by Petrobangla but not before **14 May 2007**.\n\n**7.2 The Injunction in its successive versions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe excuse on which Petrobangla relies for not paying the undisputed amount is the injunction issued by the BELA Court on 12 September 2005, subsequently upheld in appeal proceedings, confirmed and transformed.\n\n163.\n\nThe injunction in its original form was issued on 12 September 2005. On that day the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) had made the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 against 10 respondents, including Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Energy Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (Respondent 1), Petrobangla (Respondent 4), BAPEX (Respondent 5) and Niko (Respondent 10).95 The petition sought a declaration that the Niko/BAPEX Joint Venture Agreement was concluded without lawful authority and had no legal effect, that it should be \"treated as a nullity having been procured through flawed process and resorting to fraudulent means and forged documents\" and \"should be treated as illegal; [having come] to an end as a result of material breach of the statutory and legal obligations\". In the petition BELA also requested that Bangladesh and BAPEX be\n\n\"... directed to take immediate effective measures to realize full compensation for destruction of the valuable natural gas resources and the damage to live [sic] and property and environment by the blow outs resulting from the respondent No. 10\u2019s failure to discharge its legal obligations...\"\n\nPending the hearing of the case, the petitioners applied for a number of injunctions and orders.\n\nExhibit R-10.\n\n164.\n\nOn the same day, 12 September 2005, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division (Special Original Jurisdiction), proceeding *ex parte*, gave directions for further proceedings on the petition and made *inter alia* the following order:\n\n\"Pending disposal of the Rule, Respondents no. 1 to 9 are restrained from making any payment of [to?] no. 10 in respect of Feni Gas Field or any other account up to 22.10.05.\"96\n\nExhibit C-26; also produced as Exhibit R-11.\n\n165.\n\nIn addition, the order contained directions to Bangladesh, Petrobangla and BAPEX (Respondents 1, 4 and 5), *inter alia*\n\n\"... to submit a report within 45 days if receipt of this order specifying the measures that have been taken against respondent no. 10 to recover compensation for the successive blow outs, [\u2026] and freeze all bank accounts of respondent No. 10 maintained in Bangladesh.\"\n\n166.\n\nThe following day, on 13 September 2005, Niko filed \"Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 712 of 2005\" in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, Appellate Division (Civil Appellate Jurisdiction). It stated that it had learnt about the interim orders of the High Court Division from the daily newspapers and requested a stay of these interim orders. It explained in particular that the freezing of its bank accounts would lead to a stoppage of the day-to-day operations both for the gas supply from the Feni Field and the relief operations from the Chattak Field. Restraining payments to Niko would \"add to the adverse effect on the finance and cash flow required for the continuous operations\" of Niko \"jeopardising and stopping gas production and supply\".97\n\nExhibit C-96, p. 12.\n\n167.\n\nOn 14 September 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court removed the freezing order concerning the bank accounts, but left the injunction against payments to Niko intact. It made the following order:\n\n\"Let the application for stay be placed before the Court on 23rd October 2005. The interim order so far it relates to freezing of all the Bank accounts of the Respondent No. 10 maintained in Bangladesh is stayed till that date. The Respondent No. 10 is restrained from making any foreign remittance from the Bank Account.\"98\n\nExhibit C-27.\n\n168.\n\nThe High Court Division considered the matter again on 19 October 2005. It noted that the order freezing Niko\u2019s bank accounts had been stayed by the Appellate Division and concluded that \"there is no scope to extend the previous stay order\". Concerning payments to Niko, the court found that no decision had been made by the Appellate Division and concluded:\n\n\"Since the order retraining the respondents 1-9 from making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of any gas field or any other account passed by the High Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate Division that order shall continue.\"99\n\nExhibit C-28. In Petrobangla\u2019s letter of 28 November 2005 (Exhibit R-13) the same passage is quoted as part of an order of the High Court Division of 16 November 2005; but no order of that date has been produced. Since the order of 19 October 2005 is uncontested, it does not seem to make any difference for the issues that have to be decided here whether, in addition, there was a further order on 16 November 2005. The Tribunal therefore leaves the uncertainty about the possible order of 16 November 2005 unresolved.\n\n169.\n\nNiko filed on 23 October 2005 Civil Petition No. 1395 of 2005 (arising out of C.M.P. No. 712) for leave to appeal against the interim orders of 12 September 2005, essentially on the grounds exposed in the petition of 13 September 2005.100\n\nExhibit C-96.\n\n170.\n\nThe Appellate Division addressed the petition on the same day, 23 October 2005, and left the situation unchanged. It made the following order:\n\n\"The order of stay granted earlier is extended till 11th December, 2005 on which date the leave petition will come up for hearing before the Court.\"101\n\nExhibit C-29.\n\n171.\n\nOn 12 December 2005 the Appellate Division extended its order for further six weeks;102 on 24 January 2006 it was extended for further two months,103 on 28 March 2006 for further three months104 and on 26 June 2006 for further six months.105 On 12 December 2006, the Appellate Division decided that \"the earlier order of stay is still in force and hence tantamount to continue\".106\n\nExhibit C-38.\n\nExhibit C-41.\n\nExhibit C-50.\n\nExhibit C-57.\n\nExhibit C-61.\n\n172.\n\nThe Appellate Division considered the Petition No. 1395 of 2005 for a last time at a hearing on 3 October 2007. In its order of that day, the Appellate Division referred to the High Court\u2019s order of 12 September 2005 and the order which the Appellate Division had made in response to Niko\u2019s \"leave petition\", i.e. the stay of the freezing of Niko\u2019s bank accounts in Bangladesh and the restraining order against making any foreign remittances from the Bank Account. It concluded:\n\n\"The aforesaid order passed earlier by this Division is extended till hearing of the aforesaid Writ Petition.\"107\n\nExhibit R-12.\n\n173.\n\nThereafter the High Court Division held several hearings in the BELA proceedings which spanned a period of several months, starting in February 2009.108 The Court rendered its judgment on 16 and 17 November 2009,109 finding that the \"JVA was not obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means\".110\n\nHT Day 3, pp. 27-29 and Exhibit C-21, p. 2.\n\nThe judgment indicates, at p. 2, 16 and 17 November 2009 as the dates of the judgment; the signatures at p. 42 show the dates of 2 and 3 May 2010, the Claimant gave 5 May 2010 as the date when the final decision was made (C-PC.1, paragraph 43). At the hearing it was clarified that the judgment was delivered on 16 and 17 November 2009 (HT Day 3, pp. 27, 29, 138; but as explained at the hearing by Mr Nawaz, the certified copy was issued only on 2 May 2010 (HT Day 3, p. 139).\n\nExhibit C-21, p. 40.\n\n174.\n\nConcerning the claim for compensation and the injunction against payments to Niko, the High Court Division made the following order:\n\n\"... Niko is directed to pay the compensation money as per the decision to be taken in the money suit now pending in the Court of the Joint District or as per the mutual agreement among the parties. The respondents are restrained by an order of injunction form making any payment to respondent No 10. This order of injunction shall remain in force till disposal of the money suit or till amicable settlement amongst the parties, whichever is earlier.\"111\n\nExhibit C-21, p. 42.\n\n175.\n\nIn this form the injunction has remained in force and no information has been provided to the Tribunal that this version of the injunction has been modified or terminated.\n\n176.\n\nThe Money Suit by which Bangladesh and Petrobangla claim damages relating to the blow outs was filed in the Court of the District Judge, Dhaka on 15 June 2008.112 As explained above, these proceedings are still pending. The requests for provisional measures in this arbitration, as they were described above, relate to these proceedings in the Money Suit.\n\nExhibit C-92.\n\n**7.3** ***Force Majeure*** **defence prior to the conclusion of the GPSA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nPetrobangla\u2019s principal line of defence relies on an agreement for the sale of gas concluded in November 2004. It argues that, in relation to this agreement, the injunction by the BELA Court, issued on 12 September 2005 was unforeseen and justifies its *force majeure* defence. The Claimant denies that there is such an agreement of November 2004 and argues that its claims for payment are based on the GPSA of 27 December 2006; which was concluded in full knowledge of the injunction.\n\n178.\n\nThe argument of **Petrobangla** relies on \"an oral agreement for the sale of gas between Niko/BAPEX and Petrobangla in early November 2004\";113 it specifies that this contractual relationship between Niko and Petrobangla began on 4 November 2004.114 Elsewhere in its submissions, Petrobangla states that it was already \"[i]n or around August 2004\" that \"Petrobangla and Niko agreed to enter into a commercial relationship to sell and purchase gas without a signed GPSA\".115\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 5(1).\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 7; also P-PC.2, paragraph 14(1).\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 16.\n\n179.\n\nWhen on 12 September 2005 the BELA Court issued its injunction against payments to Niko, according to Petrobangla, this was \"an unforeseen legal impediment beyond the control of Petrobangla. Since the Order is a Constitutional and legal impediment to Petrobangla\u2019s performance under the sales contract with Niko and BAPEX, Petrobangla\u2019s right to invoke *force majeure* is a complete defence to Niko\u2019s payment claim\".116\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 8.\n\n180.\n\nIn support of this argument, Petrobangla relies on the law of Bangladesh, in particular Article 56 of the Bangladesh Contract Act 1872, as well as the doctrine of *force majeure* under common law and general principles of law.117 Petrobangla insists that the \"relevant contract is the oral agreement between the parties, not the GPSA\";118 for this reason, Petrobangla argues that *force majeure* provision of Article 14 of the GPSA, \"has no application to that oral agreement\".119\n\nP-PC.1, pages 16-22.\n\nP-PC.2, title of chapter III, 1, at p. 13.\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 30.\n\n181.\n\nThe **Claimant** does not contest that, prior to the conclusion of the GPSA on 27 December 2006, the Parties were in discussion about an interim arrangement for the period until the GPSA was concluded. For the Claimant, the interim arrangement was the subject of correspondence that did not lead to an agreement.\n\n182.\n\nExamining the evidence produced with respect to the arrangement during the interim period, the Claimant concluded\n\n\"there was no agreement on volume. There was no agreement on price until late 2005 when Niko agreed to Petrobangla\u2019s proposal of USD 1.75 per MCF. There was no agreement on any other term of the interim arrangement with one exception: all parties agreed that the price during the interim period would be adjusted after the GPSA was concluded on the basis of the price fixed in the GPSA.\"120\n\nHT Day 3, p. 43.\n\n183.\n\n**The Tribunal** considered that immediately before delivery started in November 2004, Niko had addressed the following offer to Petrobangla:\n\n\"... we will be pleased to put gas on production from the Feni Gas Field with immediate effect, that is November 1, 2004, pending execution of the Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GPSA).\n\nTo facilitate the above we request a confirmation from Petrobangla that Petrobangla shall purchase and pay Niko for Niko\u2019s share of the gas at USD 2.35/MCF or the finalized price in the GPSA, whichever is lower, for the gas delivered during the interim period prior to signing the GPSA.\"121\n\nThe letter has not been produced, but it is mentioned in Petrobangla\u2019s reply letter dated 1 November 2004 (Exhibit C-3). The quoted passage, on which the Claimant relied during the hearing (HT Day 3, p. 41), is taken from the letter of Petrobangla\u2019s letter of 24 November 2005 (Exhibit C-31) which quotes the letter *in extenso*.\n\n184.\n\nPetrobangla responded on the following day, 1 November 2004, thanking Niko for the \"successful development of the Feni gas field\", and stated:\n\n\"Petrobangla undertakes to buy gas from Bapex-Niko Joint Venture\u2019s Feni marginal gas field.\n\nPrice of gas will be paid as per agreed and signed GPSA when finalised.\"122\n\nExhibit C-3 and R-1.\n\n185.\n\nAlthough this response, as the Claimant pointed out, is not a clear acceptance of the offer of 31 October 2004, Niko delivered gas and, even prior to the conclusion of the GPSA, required payment on an interim basis, for instance in a letter of 14 February 2005.123 Indeed, as Petrobangla pointed out, it made two payments of USD 2 million each124 and now attributes these payments to the contractual relationship on which it relies.125\n\nAt C-PC.1, paragraph 28, the Claimant relies on factual observations in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, specifically paragraph 56 and the documentary evidence quoted there.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 7.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraph 7.\n\n186.\n\nIn these circumstances it may well be that some form of contractual arrangement existed prior to the conclusion of the GPSA, even though the manner in which it came about and its terms were not clearly defined and the persons who concluded it have not been identified by Petrobangla.126 However, the question of whether an agreement prior to the GPSA was indeed concluded and in what terms need not be resolved for the following reasons.\n\nThe Claimant pointed out at the Hearing that there was no evidence for an oral agreement but correspondence about the deliveries prior to the conclusion of the GPSA; see HT Day 3, p. 40 *et seq*.\n\n187.\n\nAs the Claimant rightly points out,127 the Parties expressly referred in the GPSA to the correspondence that had been exchanged prior to the conclusion of that agreement and addressed the question of the effect that had to be given to it. They provided in Article 16 the following:\n\n\"All the discussions and meetings held and correspondence exchanged between the Buyer and Seller in respect of the Agreement and any discussions arrived at therein in the past and before the coming into force of the Agreement are hereby superseded by the Agreement and no reference of such discussions or meeting [sic] or past correspondence will be entertained by either the Seller or the Buyer for interpreting the Agreement or otherwise.\"\n\nC-PC.1, paragraphs 56-59.\n\n188.\n\nAny agreement that may have been concluded between the Parties by the exchange of correspondence, at meetings or otherwise, thus has been superseded by the conclusion of the GPSA. In this GPSA the Parties agreed on the delivery of gas to Petrobangla and the payments that Petrobangla had to make for the gas so delivered. The payments that the Claimant seeks in this arbitration are based on this GPSA. The Claimant made it quite clear that its payment claim is based on the GPSA and not on any prior agreement: the \"Payment Claim is based on the GPSA, which contains a provision on *force majeure*.\"128\n\nC-PC.1, paragraph 55.\n\n189.\n\nIt is therefore irrelevant for the claim which the Tribunal must decide whether, under a now superseded informal contractual arrangement, Niko had an obligation to deliver gas and Petrobangla had an obligation to pay; and the Tribunal need not examine the question of whether, when the injunction was issued on 12 September 2005, Petrobangla was excused for not meeting any such payment obligations which may have existed at that time (prior to their being superseded by the GSPA). All these questions are moot since there is no claim before the Tribunal that seeks performance of the superseded agreement, damages for failure of its performance, or interest for delay in payments that may have been required under it.\n\n190.\n\nThe claim which the tribunal must determine concerns payment under the GPSA of 27 December 2006 by reference to the obligations acknowledged and created under that Agreement and under the law applicable to obligations under it. Defences which Petrobangla may have had against obligations under an earlier tacit or oral agreement are not relevant for this decision.\n\n**7.4** ***Force Majeure*** **defence against payment obligations under the GPSA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nPetrobangla takes the position that a *force majeure* defence similar to that on which it relies under the prior tacit or oral agreement can be invoked in defence against its payment obligations under the GPSA. The Claimant denies that such defence is available to Petrobangla and argues that Petrobangla is in default.\n\n*7.4.1 The Parties\u2019 positions*\n------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nWhile stating, in its principal line of argument, that the \"relevant contract is the oral agreement between the parties, not the GPSA\",129 Petrobangla nevertheless also relies on the *force majeure* defence as excuse for not paying the invoices under the GPSA. As explained above, Petrobangla relies on \"the doctrine of *force majeure* under international general principles of law\",130 on \"a *force majeure* excuse under common law\" and specifically on Section 56 of the Bangladesh Contract Act 1872.131\n\nP-PC.2, title of chapter III, 1, at p. 13.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraphs 57-61.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraphs 62-67.\n\n193.\n\nIn the context of the defence against the payment obligations under the GPSA, Petrobangla also argues that, when it concluded the GPSA, it considered the injunction as a \"short term obstacle which would end at the conclusion of the BELA proceedings\" and that it did not and could not expect that the Injunction continued after the BELA case was dismissed.132 Petrobangla also argues that it did what could reasonably be expected of it to \"*resolve the legal issues as early as possible*\".133\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 44.\n\nP-PC.1, paragraphs 49-52 and P-PC.2, in particular paragraphs17(8)-21, paragraphs 46-55.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant points out that all the sources on which Petrobangla relies make a *force majeure* or similar defence available only with respect to events which occur subsequently to the creation of the obligation and were not foreseeable at the time when the obligation was created. The Claimant also denies that Petrobangla made reasonable efforts to remove the injunction.134\n\nC-PC.2, paragraphs 108-114 and 115-121.\n\n*7.4.2 The requirement that the force maijeure event be unforeseen.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided for the reasons just explained that, with respect to claims based on the GPSA, as they are made in this arbitration by Niko, the \"relevant agreement\" is the GPSA and not some earlier oral or tacit agreement. It is therefore, by reference to this agreement and the time when it was concluded, that Petrobangla\u2019s *force majeure* defence must be considered.\n\n196.\n\nSection 56 of the Bangladesh Contract Act, 1872 on which Petrobangla relies for its *force majeure* defence, provides as follows:\n\n\"A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promissor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.\"135 (Emphasis added.)\n\nLegal Authority 14 to P-PC.1\n\n197.\n\nAn event relieves the \"promissor\" of his obligation only if it occurred after the obligation has been contracted. This is, indeed, a general feature of *force majeure* and similar defences, which normally apply only if the event is unforeseen and unavoidable.\n\n198.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties have regulated the matter in Article 14 of the GPSA, which provides that a failure to perform or a delay in performing shall not be considered a default if performance is \"prevented, hindered or delayed\" by certain events which are further defined in Article 14.1.\n\n199.\n\nThe list of events specifically identified as *force majeure* events, in Article 14.1, include \"actions of government or governments\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view this includes injunctions by the judiciary, as that by the BELA Court. In any event, Article 14.1.1 generally refers to acts which are \"beyond the control of such Party\", i.e. the party affected by the event.\n\n200.\n\nHowever, one of the conditions for considering an impediment as a case of *force majeure* is that it \"could not be foreseen\". The specific clause regulating between the Parties the circumstances under which the defence of *force majeure* is available confirms the general principle, that events prior to the conclusion of the contract, known to the parties and thus \"foreseeable\", do not qualify as *force majeure* and are no excuse for non-performance.\n\n201.\n\nThis is undisputed and expressly accepted by Petrobangla. Events which occurred prior to the creation of the obligation do not provide a *force majeure* defence. Petrobangla stated it in the following terms:\n\n\"Petrobangla accepts that, in principle, neither the doctrines of frustration (encapsulated in s.56 of the Contract Act) nor force majeure apply to events which pre-date the contract.\"136\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 32.\n\n202.\n\nWhen the GPSA was concluded, the injunction had been in place for over 15 months. There can therefore not be a question whether the Parties could foresee a future injunction preventing payment to Niko; the Parties were fully aware of this impediment.\n\n203.\n\nIndeed, Petrobangla had expressly relied on the injunction prior to the conclusion of the GPSA. During the negotiations for the GPSA, after deliveries of Gas had commenced, Petrobangla invoked the injunction of the BELA Court in defence against Niko\u2019s request for payment. In particular, in a letter of 28 November 2005 Petrobangla referred to this order in response to Niko\u2019s announcement of a suspension of gas deliveries:\n\n\"Mr. Justice Md. Abdul Matin & Mr. Justice Md. Rezaul Haque of the Divisional Bench of the Honorable High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh vide their order dated November 16, 2005 in the Writ Petition no. 6911 of 2005 have been pleased to direct as follows:\n\n[follows the Order of 19 October 2005 as quoted above.]\n\nAs such we cannot make payment any more until the said Order of the Court is vacated.\"137\n\nExhibit R-13.\n\n204.\n\nThus, Petrobangla was fully aware of the injunction, long before it concluded the GPSA. It may not rely on it as an unforeseen event. Indeed, Petrobangla expressly admits that the *force majeure* event on which it relies was known to it at the time when the GPSA was concluded:\n\n\"There is no dispute that Petrobangla was fully aware of the judicial supervention (i.e. the interim injunction) at the time of signing of the GPSA.\"138\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 44.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the injunction of the BELA Court is not a *force majeure* event on which Petrobangla may rely as a defence against the claim for the payment of the invoices.\n\n*7.4.3 The risk of a long duration of the injunction*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nPetrobangla argues that, when it concluded the GPSA it expected that the injunction would not remain in place for long, but would be removed shortly thereafter. Petrobangla states that, at the time the GPSA was signed:\n\n\"... Petrobangla considered that the BELA injunction was simply a short-term measure which would end at the conclusion of the BELA case. Petrobangla believed that if the Court dismissed the BELA claim - as Petrobangla was arguing that it should - the Court would automatically discharge the injunction. Petrobangla expected such a decision by the BELA Court shortly after the signing of the GPSA.\"139\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 9.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulties in accepting these explanations since, by the time the GPSA was concluded, the injunction had been in place for more than 15 months and there were no apparent signs that the BELA Court or the Appellate Division would remove it in the near future. Nor were there apparent signs that the BELA Court, by disposing of the principal action, would also put an end to the injunction.\n\n208.\n\nThere is no indication that the Parties agreed to suspend Petrobangla\u2019s payment obligation until the BELA action had been completed and the injunction removed. Quite to the contrary, Petrobangla made an unconditional and unqualified commitment to pay for the gas.\n\n209.\n\nIn Article 11.1.3 GPSA, Petrobangla commits to pay for the gas delivered \"not later than forty five (45) days from the date of receiving the invoice\". In addition, Article 2.1 GPSA makes express provision for the payment of the gas delivered prior to the effective date of this agreement:\n\n\"This Agreement shall be fully effective from the date of its signing. However, it is acknowledged and agreed that the delivery of Gas from 2 November, 2004 shall be paid, after making appropriate adjustments for the payments already made, within reasonable time following execution of this Agreement...\"\n\n210.\n\nPetrobangla accepts that this provision is a clear commitment to make payment. When discussing the 28 November 2005 letter quoted above, Petrobangla\u2019s counsel explained what, in his view, the meaning of this passage in the letter was: \"I cannot pay because of this, because of the order, but I will want to pay and I will pay.\" Asked where in the letter it said \"we will pay\", he responded:\n\n\"MR GONZALEZ: In the GPSA. There is Article 2.1 in the GPSA which says \u2018I will pay\u2019.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: By saying, \u2018We want to conclude the GPSA\u2019, you make the commitment to pay? Is that what you are saying?\n\nMR GONZALEZ: It is clear in the language of the GPSA. It is Article 2.1 and Niko has made extensive submissions to the obligation to pay.\"140\n\nHT Day 3, p. 96.\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal fully agrees. In Article 2.1 GPSA Petrobangla clearly states \"I will pay\", just as Article 11.1.3 contains a clear payment commitment. Both these commitments for payment are without any condition. Petrobangla confirmed that neither the GPSA nor any side agreement or declaration conditions the payment obligation upon the lifting of the injunction:\n\n\"THE PRESIDENT **:** Is there any reference in the agreement or outside the agreement or the GPSA or outside the\n\nGPSA that would open a defence for not paying by reference or as a result of the injunction?\n\nMR GONZALEZ **:** I believe there is not one, not a reference in the GPSA.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT **:** And outside?\n\nMR GONZALEZ **:** Not that I am aware of.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You showed us the letter of November -\n\nMR GONZALEZ: Apart from the letter of 28 November 2005 which explicitly says, \"I cannot pay until it is lifted, until the order is lifted\", that is -- apart from that I believe there is no other document reflecting the legal obstacle that Petrobangla was facing.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Despite this recognition that you cannot pay in November 2005, Petrobangla concluded an agreement with an obligation to pay without reservation.\n\nMR GONZALEZ: Apart from the letter of 28 November, no, there is not a reservation on the GPSA, an explicit --\"141\n\nHT Day 3, p. 117.\n\n212.\n\nIn the absence of any such qualification or reservation, Petrobangla assumed the risk of any delay in the lifting of the injunction.\n\n213.\n\nIn these circumstances the fact that, contrary to Petrobangla\u2019s asserted expectation, the injunction was not lifted shortly after the conclusion of the GPSA and is still in place, does not relieve Petrobangla of its payment commitment. In particular, Petrobangla cannot rely on such delay as a *force majeure* defence; such a defence applies to events unforeseen at the time when the obligation is contracted. It does not apply to events which are known but which last longer than expected. Petrobangla has not provided any authority under the law of Bangladesh or any other law to the effect that the disappointment of hopes or expectations for the early removal of an impediment constitutes an event of *force majeure*.\n\n214.\n\nIn conclusion on this point, Petrobangla made a firm commitment to pay for the deliveries in the past (as per Article 2.1) and all future deliveries within 45 days from the receipt of the invoice. It did so in full knowledge of the injunction and assumed the risk of delay in its removal. The Tribunal does not accept that this injunction may serve as justification or excuse, relieving Petrobangla from the consequences of its failure to meet it contractual obligation to pay for the gas delivered by Niko.\n\n*7.4.4 The obligation to take \"reasonaible action to overcome\" the impediment*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nIf it were accepted, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion, that Petrobangla was entitled to rely on the injunction as an event of *force majeure*, the Tribunal would have to examine whether Petrobangla complied with the obligations under Article 14.1.3 which provides:\n\n\"When any such event or combination of events has occurred, such Party shall take all reasonable actions to overcome any cause that prevents, hinders or delays performance of its obligations and to minimize the consequences and shall, insofar as is practicable, continue to perform its obligations hereunder.\"\n\n216.\n\nAs the Claimant pointed out, similar obligations exist in relation to *force majeure* and related defences under common law and other legal principles.142\n\nSee in particular C-PC.2, pp. 31-33.\n\n217.\n\nPetrobangla argues that it made \"reasonable efforts\" to remove the injunction. It accepts that, to the extent Article 14 of the GPSA were applicable, it would have been required under Article 14.1.3 to make such efforts. The Claimant strongly contests that Petrobangla complied with this obligation.\n\n218.\n\nPetrobangla identifies the following steps as actions to overcome the injunction:\n\n(a) It filed an \"Affidavit-in-Opposition in the High Court Division in the BELA case, arguing that it should dismiss the proceedings\";143\n\n(b) It \"[c]onsidered whether there were any available lawful means to overcome the injunction\", in particular by obtaining legal advice from the Attorney General of Bangladesh and from counsel at Admiralty Chamber; and assured Niko that it was \"actively considering ways to resolve the legal issues as early as possible\";\n\n(c) It took \"significant steps to support Niko\u2019s attempts to lift the injunction\"; the attempts mentioned include considering \"different ways of making payment\" and inviting others to \"take necessary action\".144\n\nPetrobangla relies in this respect on Exhibit R19, an affidavit of 18 March 2009 in opposition against the BELA Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005.\n\nP-PC.2, pp. 9- 11, P-PC.1, pp 11-15. The matter was also discussed extensively at the hearing, *e.g.* HT Day 3, pp. 122 *et seq*.\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimant contests that any of these steps can be considered as serious measures to overcome the injunction and its effects. Concerning the Affidavit-in-Opposition, the Claimant points out that in the affidavit \"Petrobangla merely laid out its defence to the merits of the claims [...] Nothing in this affidavit-inopposition shows that Petrobangla sought a \u2018discharge of the Rule and vacating the order of injunction\u2019\". The Claimant adds that \"at the hearing in the BELA suit, counsel for Petrobangla did not argue that the injunction against payment should be modified or lifted.\"145\n\nC-PC.2, paragraph 77 and Goyal WS II, paragraph 80.\n\n220.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant lists a number of steps that Petrobangla could have taken to press for the review and revision of the 2005 injunction and the November 2009 judgement and order. When the Claimant filed on 21 August 2008 an application to modify the Interim Order, it invited Petrobangla to join or support the application. While BAPEX filed a separate application, Petrobangla did not - nor did it otherwise intervene in support of the application.146\n\nGoyal WS II, paragraphs 77 and 78.\n\n221.\n\nAt the hearing, Petrobangla provided explanations about the availability of some of these possible procedural remedies and the reasons why it did not pursue them. However, none of them were taken by Petrobangla. On several occasions at the hearing the question was put to Petrobangla:\n\n\"... why did Petrobangla not make an application to the BELA Court and say, \u2018Put an end to the injunction\u2019.\"147\n\nHT Day 3, p. 122.\n\n222.\n\nPetrobangla responded that Niko and BAPEX were the beneficiaries of the payments to be made by Petrobangla and they applied for a removal of the injunction; but no application was made by Petrobangla.148\n\nHT Day 3, pp. 122-125.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal pointed out that it was the performance of Petrobangla\u2019s obligation that was affected by the injunction and that one would expect that it would be above all Petrobangla which would apply for the stay of the injunction so that it could perform the obligation as it says it wanted to do. The Tribunal put the question squarely to Petrobangla\u2019s counsel:\n\n\"PROFESSOR PAULSSON:.. It is a straightforward question then it is for Petrobangla to do something about this impediment.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nPROFESSOR MCLACHLAN: I think the Tribunal\u2019s point to you, Mr Gonzalez, is your submission to us at the outset is you were then and are still now under an injunction from the Bangladesh courts, breach of which will expose your clients to proceedings for contempt of court and it is that interdiction which prevents you from doing which you would otherwise wish to do, which is to pay, and the most straightforward way of resolving that would appear to be simply to apply yourself to the court to seek to have the restriction limited in order to enable you to comply with your contractual obligations.\n\nOf course, you might have applied and failed. The court might have said no, but what we are on at the moment is simply the question given that the legal impediment is one that rests upon you, why not apply?\n\nMR GONZALEZ: In hindsight, of course, why did not we do this, why did not we do that? Again, I go back to this test, the test of reasonableness and it says not to do everything that you can, all that can be done is what was reasonable and what our submission is let us look at what Niko was asking Petrobangla to do and in 2007 the request, Niko\u2019s request and Niko\u2019s understanding was,..\"149\n\nHT Day 3, pp. 127-129\n\n224.\n\nCounsel then proceeded to discuss ways that Niko sought to receive payment despite the injunction - a matter quite different from the question the Tribunal had asked. The central question remained: why did Petrobangla itself not take any steps to have the injunction removed by the Court or in appeal?\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the answer that it received wholly unsatisfactory. When signing the GPSA on 27 December 2006, Petrobangla made a firm commitment to pay for the gas delivered in the past and to pay for future deliveries within 45 days upon receipt of the invoices. If it was prevented from making such payments it had to take all possible steps to remove the impediment. The question is not what Niko could or should have done or what Niko\u2019s understanding was. The commitment was made by Petrobangla and Petrobangla had to take the necessary steps in order to be able to perform its payment obligations.\n\n226.\n\nSince the impediment which Petrobangla invokes is the injunction, the most obvious and direct step to take for Petrobangla to overcome the impediment is and continues to be an application to the competent court requesting that the injunction be lifted. Neither in response to the Tribunal\u2019s questions nor at any other occasion did Petrobangla state that it had taken such a step; nor did it provide any satisfactory explanation as to why it had failed to take such a step.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla knowingly assumed the risk of being prevented from making payments by the continuing injunction and failed to take any serious steps to remove this impediment.\n\n*7.4.5 Conclusion, on the force majeure defence*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla made its payment commitments under the GPSA in full knowledge of the injunction prohibiting such payments. It took the risk that this injunction would continue even after the conclusion of the GPSA. It may not now rely on the injunction as excuse for not making the payments that it promised to make.\n\n229.\n\nTherefore Petrobangla\u2019s failure to make the contractual payments is not excused by the defence of *force majeure*. Petrobangla is in default of its payment obligations under the GPSA.\n\n230.\n\nDespite the failure of Petrobangla to make the payments due under the GPSA, Niko continued delivering gas, month after month. It did so for over three more years until April 2010, issuing no less than 40 additional invoices for monthly deliveries. Petrobangla enjoyed the benefit of these deliveries without any counterpart. The law and the Contract require that Petrobangla must pay the agreed price and, since it has failed to do so, be held liable for this failure.\n\n**8. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n**8.1 The issues in dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant seeks interest at the rate of 5% on all payments awarded on account of its invoices for gas deliveries pursuant to the GPSA; simple interest until the date of the award and monthly compounding thereafter until full payment. Alternatively, the Claimant adds: \"if the Tribunals are minded to take a complex approach and apply a variable interest rate, such as one based on LIBOR, the rate it should apply should be that of sixth-month LIBOR plus 2%\".150\n\nC-PC.1, paragraph 19.\n\n232.\n\nPetrobangla objects to the interest claim, in particular to the application of compound interest. It argues that \"interest should only run from the point at which the terms of the Injunction granted by the High Court Division in the BELA\u2019s Writ Petition are satisfied\", adding that Petrobangla should not be penalised for \"obeying the law\".151 As part of the \"actions [which] need to be taken\" according to the relief requested by it at the April 2014 hearing, Petrobangla provides for the deposit of amounts due in an account at a Designated Bank. This account \"will be interest bearing at prevailing interest rates as provided by the Designated Bank\".\n\nP-PC.2, paragraph 64.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Petrobangla committed to make payments according to the GPSA and that it did so in full knowledge of the injunction. Petrobangla failed to make these payments and may not rely on the injunction as excuse for this failure. Payments are due as per the terms of the GPSA.\n\n234.\n\nThe Parties agree that the claim for interest on Niko\u2019s invoices is governed by Section 61(2) of the Bangladesh 1930 Sale of Goods Act which provides as follows:\n\n\"In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the Court may award interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the amount of price -\n\n(a) To the seller in a suit by him for the amount of the price from the date of the tender of the goods or from the date on which the price was payable.\"\n\n235.\n\nConcerning the starting date for Petrobangla\u2019s obligation to pay interest, the Tribunal found that all invoiced amounts were due and payable 45 days after receipt of the respective invoice but not before 14 May 2007.152 According to Section 61(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, these due dates for the payments also constitute the dates when interest starts running on each of the invoiced amounts.\n\nAbove Section 7.1\n\n236.\n\nWith respect to the rate of interest, there is no statutory rate for payments in default.153 Both Section 61(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, quoted above, and Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code leave it to the courts to fix the rate. The latter provision reads as follows:\n\n\"Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of money, the Court may, in the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable to be paid on the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to the institution of the suit, when further interest at such rate as the Court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum so adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of payment or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.\"\n\nAs explained by Petrobangla at the April hearing (HT Day 5, p. 564); confirmed by the Claimant (HT Day 5, p. 566).\n\n237.\n\nOn this basis the courts apply \"commercially reasonable rates of interest\".154 This is not disputed; the controversy concerns what is reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nClaimant at HT Day 5, p. 566.\n\n238.\n\nThe Parties agree that with respect to the invoices payable in taka, the rate of 5%, as sought by the Claimant, is reasonable. Niko claims interest with respect to these invoices at that rate. At the hearing, Petrobangla explained that \"the prevailing interest rate on saving accounts in taka, it varies from 5 to 8 per cent\".155 The position was confirmed in Petrobangla\u2019s submission on interest, where it stated that it \"agrees that should Tribunal decide to award interest, it could consider the applicable interest rates on BDT deposits which is around 5% at the moment\".156\n\nHT Day 5, p. 567.\n\nP-PC Interest.1, paragraph 12.\n\n239.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties concerns the rate applicable to the invoices in US Dollars. Here, too, Niko claims simple interest at 5%, alternatively a LIBOR based rate.157 Petrobangla argues that the interest should be calculated at \"interest rate provided by commercial banks in Bangladesh on USD deposits\".158 The disagreement between the Parties concerns, first, the question of whether the rates applicable to debts in taka should apply also to the invoice amounts in US Dollars and, second, whether the relevant rates should be those for deposits or for loans.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraphs 9-12 and 13-19.\n\nP-PC Interest.1, paragraph 4.\n\n240.\n\nIn support of its interest claim, the Claimant had submitted a document from the Central Bank of Bangladesh which showed interest rates paid by commercial banks in Bangladesh during the period from January 2009 to September 2013.159 Petrobangla argued at the hearing that the rates shown on this document applied to deposits in taka and were not applicable to US Dollars.160 The document indeed does not indicate that the rates applied by the commercial banks also apply to deposits or loans in US Dollars.\n\nExhibit C-23.\n\nHT Day 5, p. 574 et seq.\n\n241.\n\nPrior to the hearing Petrobangla merely contested that any interest was due and, with respect to interest concerning US Dollars, stated in its Rejoinder that interest on deposits in US Dollars was \"based on LIBOR\" without further specification.161\n\nP-PC.2, footnote 86.\n\n242.\n\nAt the hearing the Claimant, on the basis of a \"quick calculation\", advanced 3,712% as average LIBOR one month rate from 2007 to 2014. With an appropriate mark-up, this would confirm the 5% interest rate claimed also for US Dollars.162 Petrobangla requested time to make its own investigation with the Central Bank.\n\nHT Day 5, pp. 568- 569.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal granted Petrobangla time to make a submission on interest rates for US Dollars and for a reply by the Claimant. These submissions were made on 22 May and 6 June 2014, respectively. Since the Claimant\u2019s submission contained new allegations and evidence, the Tribunal granted Petrobangla an opportunity to comment. Petrobangla submitted these comments on 17 June 2014. The Tribunal considered the two questions identified above in light of these submissions, together with the argument raised in prior submissions and at the April 2014 hearing.\n\n**8.2 Do the commercial interest rates for taka deposits apply to the claim in US Dollars?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nConcerning the application of the agreed rates for taka debts to the invoices in US Dollars, Petrobangla argued that, when determining the applicable interest rate, a distinction must be made according to the \"relevant currency\".163 It stated:\n\n\"Our submission is that a court in Bangladesh will normally commercially look at the interest rate that is prevailing in Bangladesh. Therefore, because it is US dollar amount the interest rate will be what the Central Bank says on that -\"164\n\nP-PC Interest.1, paragraph 4.\n\nHT Day 5, p. 571.\n\n245.\n\nPetrobangla produced a number of documents from commercial banks and from the Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank of Bangladesh). The documents from the commercial banks showed that, depending on the currency, different interest rates were quoted. The Bangladesh Bank wrote to the Respondents\u2019 counsel on 20 May 2014, explaining the \"Interest on foreign currency accounts held in Bangladesh\" and attached an extract of the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions (2009) edition, spelling out \"the basis on which Authorised Dealer Banks pay interest on foreign currency deposits in accounts held with them\". The letter continued:\n\n\"As per regulation referred above, Authorized Dealer Banks can pay interest on such accounts at the prevailing Eurocurrency deposit rates. Bangladesh Bank does not fix interest rates on deposits. Interest rate depends on the length of time and amount of deposits. Authorized Dealer Banks apply interest rate on foreign currency deposits based on their interest earnings against their deposits placed in international markets....\"165\n\nUnnumbered attachment to P-PC Interest.1.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that information provided by the Bangladesh Bank on interest rates distinguishes between rates for deposits in taka and those in foreign currencies. The publication on which the Claimant relied for the calculation of the claimed interest concerns deposits in taka and does not apply to deposits in US Dollars or other currencies.\n\n247.\n\nThe distinction of interest rates according to currencies, as applied by the Bangladesh Bank, reflects economic reality: interest rates for a debt in a certain currency are related to the corresponding economy and thus may vary from one currency to another, reflecting for instance differences in the rate of inflation. Irmgard Marboe, in the study on which the Claimant relies, mentions as an example, the differences in LIBOR rates for US Dollars and Euros and concludes that \"the choice of currency also plays an important role for the determination of the interest rate\".166\n\nIrmgard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law, Oxford UP, 2009, paragraph 6,131.\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the interest rates applicable to deposits in taka, on which the Claimant relied, are not applicable for determining interest on the amount due in US Dollars by Petrobangla. The rates applicable for the calculation of interest on that amount must be determined separately by reference to deposits or debts in US Dollars.\n\n**8.3 The relevant rate for the debt in US Dollars - rates for deposits or for loans?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nWhen determining the relevant rate for Petrobangla\u2019s debt in US Dollars, both Parties refer to LIBOR rates. With its submission on Interest the Claimant produced a table for LIBOR rates from January 2007 to May 2014. During this period the six-month rates varied between a high of 5.40140% in January 2007 and a low of 0.38780% in February 2010; the average calculated by the Claimant for this period is 1.57446%.\n\n250.\n\nPetrobangla stated that \"interest is paid on one month deposit in US dollar based on LIBOR\".167 In its submission on interest Petrobangla explained that\n\n\"... interest rate on USD deposits varies from bank to bank. Since banks would normally get interest at the rate of LIBOR on their deposits placed with international banks, the usual practice for a bank in Bangladesh is, determine a suitable *margin* for itself taking into account its own balance sheet position and then determining interest rate on UDS [sic] deposits by deducting the *margin* from LIBOR.\"168\n\nLater Petrobangla clarified:\n\n\"... a commercial bank in Bangladesh, while giving interest on USD deposit would apply \u2018LIBOR *minus* margin\u2019 approach and it is submitted that the Tribunal should also opt for the same.\"169\n\nP-PC.2, footnote 86.\n\nP-PC Interest.1, paragraph 8.\n\nP-PC Interest.2, paragraph 1(iv).\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimant also referred to LIBOR, but it claimed a premium on the published rate. It referred to \"the differing credit and country risks\"170 and explained\n\n\"Niko found itself in the position of involuntarily loaning to Petrobangla an ever increasing sum of money for almost a decade\".171\n\nIt added:\n\n\"If Niko had been paid as it was entitled to under the GPSA, it would have reinvested that money into its business and generated additional returns at rates significantly higher than 5% per year. In other words, the gas payments that Niko should have been receiving each month since 2004 would have earned returns on investment, but for Petrobangla\u2019s failure to pay.\"172\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 15.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 10.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 11.\n\n252.\n\nThe Parties agree that LIBOR rates reflect rates between banks and are not rates at which Niko or Petrobangla normally may borrow or lend on the market. The principal issue which the Tribunal must resolve is whether interest must be calculated by reference to the Claimant\u2019s approach of \"LIBOR plus\", as it would apply when Niko borrows US Dollars from a bank in Bangladesh, or at \"LIBOR minus\" when it would make a deposit in US Dollars in a such a bank.\n\n253.\n\nWhen proposing the \"LIBOR minus approach\", Petrobangla argues that it \"has been an agreed position of both parties that, if interest is to be allowed then the appropriate benchmark would be to consider interest rates given respectively to BDT deposits and USD deposits by commercial banks in Bangladesh\"; it added that \"both Petrobangla and Niko have submitted interest rates should be linked with interest on deposits as opposed to interest on lending by commercial banks\".173\n\nP-PC Interest.2, paragraphs 1(i) and (v).\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the passage on which Petrobangla relies when making this affirmation and examined whether it justifies the conclusion that the Claimant accepted in a binding manner interest calculation at LIBOR minus. When it first specified its interest claim, the Claimant indicated a fixed rate of 5%, applicable for both taka and US Dollars. It explained that interest rates for commercial banks in Bangladesh \"were diverse\". It referred to the tables published by the Bangladesh Bank mentioned above,174 and, without presenting any calculation, proposed the rate of 5%.175 That calculation may have been based on rates for varying deposits, but it did not constitute an acceptance by the Claimant of a \"LIBOR minus approach\", as now applied by Petrobangla.\n\nExhibit C-23.\n\nThe passage on which Petrobangla relies is at C-PC.1, paragraph 45 and Goyal WS I, paragraph 15.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has no agreed position adopted by both Parties on which it may rely, but must consider the respective positions of the Parties, as they were proposed in the submissions on Interest.\n\n256.\n\nNeither Party has provided any explanation concerning the factual solution adopted in the circumstances and the alternatives in case the payments would have been made. It is therefore not known whether Niko had to borrow money to compensate the amounts withheld by Petrobangla or whether it would have invested them in operations which would have been more profitable than US Dollar deposits in Bangladesh.\n\n257.\n\nIn this situation the Tribunal, following Section 61(2) of the Bangladesh Sales of Goods Act, considers what would be reasonable in the circumstances. In applying such a broad discretion to the case of an unpaid contract debt the Tribunal is guided by the objective that the successful party should be compensated for having been kept out of its money to which it was entitled.\n\n258.\n\nThis objective cannot adequately be achieved by limiting the compensation to that which the creditor would have obtained by depositing the funds in a bank account. This is only one of the options which a creditor has if the debtor makes timely payment. Especially for a commercial company such a deposit may well be the least attractive option. Normally such a company can be expected to invest the money in its business, as the Claimant states that it would have done.176\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 11.\n\n259.\n\nThe debtor\u2019s failure to make payment deprives the creditor of the options which it would have if the payment is made. Therefore the Tribunal considers that the appropriate reference is to determine the costs which the creditor would have had to incur in order to obtain the funds which would provide these options and of which the creditor was deprived by the debtor\u2019s failure to pay. For these reasons, the Tribunal takes as reference the rate at which the Claimant would have had to borrow the funds.177\n\nThis is also the position taken under English law, applying a statutory discretion in similar terms to the Bangladesh statutes: *Peter Cremer v General Carriers SA* [1973] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 366, 376 per Kerr J. See also CHITTY on Contracts, vol. I, 30th ed. (2008), 26-178 who conclude from this case that the Commercial Court awards \"interest at a rate which broadly represents the rate at which the successful party would have had to borrow the amount recovered over the period in question\".\n\n260.\n\nWhere, as here, the debt was expressly payable in Bangladesh, the Tribunal considers that it is the situation in Bangladesh which has to be considered. The proper approach is therefore to determine the rate or rates at which Niko could have borrowed US dollars from a commercial bank in Bangladesh.\n\n261.\n\nThe evidence on US Dollar related interest rates produced by Petrobangla, while confirming the reference to LIBOR as a \"benchmark\",178 concerns the conditions at which banks accept deposits and not the conditions at which they lend in US Dollars. For the Tribunal\u2019s decision they are therefore not helpful.\n\n*E.g.* the letter of Standard Chartered Bank, dated 19 May 2014, attached to P-PC Interest.1, referred to as Exhibit R-39.\n\n262.\n\nThe Claimant produced an extract of the 2012/2013 Annual Report of Bangladesh Bank in which the activities of the Export Development Fund (EDF) are described. The Fund is intended to provide to authorised dealer (AD) banks foreign currency facilities which these lend to Bangladesh exporters. The report explains the conditions at which these facilities are provided:\n\n\"The interest rate on USD under EDF is charged at six-month LIBOR+2.5 percent out of which LIBOR+1 percent is for EDF and the rest 1.5 percent is for concerned AD banks.\"179\n\nUnnumbered Attachment to C-PC.1, referred to as Exhibit C-102.\n\n263.\n\nPetrobangla confirmed that the rates quoted in this passage are rates \"charged from a customer who borrows from the Authorised Dealer under the EDF facility\".180\n\nP-PC Interest.2, paragraph 1(v).\n\n264.\n\nIt follows that a commercial enterprise in Bangladesh seeking to borrow US Dollars may obtain from the EDF programme facilities at LIBOR +2.5 %. The Tribunal takes this as a credible representation of commercial conditions in Bangladesh for the interest on US Dollar loans. The rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2%, as sought by the Claimant, thus is a reasonable rate in the context of commercial conditions in Bangladesh.\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant also produced extracts from a Production Sharing Contract concluded by the Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla with several other companies which provides under the heading of \"Late Payments\" that \"overdue payments shall bear interest at LIBOR plus two percent (2%)...\".181 The definitions contained in that contract clarify that reference is made to six month deposits for US Dollars.182 Petrobangla objects that this contract is not applicable in the present dispute. The Tribunal agrees. However, it takes the rate provided in this contract as an indication that default interest at the rate of six month LIBOR + 2%, as claimed by the Claimant, is commercially not unreasonable.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 18; Exhibit C-101.\n\nUnnumbered Attachment to C-PC.1, referred to as Exhibit C-101.\n\n266.\n\nOn the basis of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla must pay interest on the outstanding invoices at six-month LIBOR + 2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in taka.\n\n267.\n\nThroughout the proceedings the Claimant sought simple interest on the outstanding payments for the period up to the award. Only for the period thereafter it sought interest at \"an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the award is paid in full\".183 In its Observations on Applicable Interest dated 6 June 2014, the Claimant confirmed the claim for simple pre-award interest at the annual rate of 5%.\n\nC-PC.1, paragraphs 78(c) and (f); HT Day 5, p. 578.\n\n268.\n\nHowever, in this very last submission the Claimant added: \"if a commercial rate such as [the LIBOR + 2%] is applied, the commercial practice of compounding of interest should also be applied\"; it stated that \"it would be logical and fair, to compound interest on a monthly basis to correspond to the period in which the LIBOR rate is updated in the calculation\".184\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 20.\n\n269.\n\nPetrobangla responded by stating that the claim for monthly compounding \"is not either reasonable nor is supported by any of the materials produced by Niko and therefore should be rejected\".185\n\nP-PC Interest.2, paragraph 1(vii).\n\n270.\n\nAs explained above, the proceedings on the Payment Claim were closed at the end of the April 2014 hearing. The submissions which were authorised thereafter were limited to the narrow question of the interest rate in Bangladesh for US Dollar debts. The question of single or compound interest had not been raised before and was not part of what was allowed as additional submission at that stage.\n\n271.\n\nMoreover, even in this limited submission on interest rates after the hearing, Niko stated expressly that it \"maintains its position that interest at a simple annual rate of 5 percent is reasonable\n\n...\"186 and confirmed its request that \"it is fair to award interest at a simple annual rate of 5 percent...\".187 It was only in the alternative that the Tribunal would award interest at a rate fluctuating with LIBOR that Niko for the first time requested that pre-award interest be compounded monthly.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 4.\n\nC-PC Interest.1, paragraph 12.\n\n272.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider the Claimant\u2019s new claim for pre-award compound interest as admissible. Moreover, the Claimant having confirmed even after the hearing its claim for simple interest at the flat 5% rate, the Tribunal sees no justification for granting compound interest for the alternative LIBOR + 2% rate.\n\n273.\n\nIn denying the Claimant\u2019s request for compound pre-award interest, the Tribunal does not express any position as to the question whether compound interest can or must be awarded under the law of Bangladesh or in ICSID proceedings. It leaves open the question of whether compound interest should be paid for the period after the notification of the decision.\n\n274.\n\nAs explained in the following section, the Tribunal invites the Parties to consult with the objective of an interim arrangement, dealing *inter alia* with the principal and interest subject of this decision. If that arrangement is found, the question of interest most likely will become moot. If the Parties fail to reach an agreement, the Parties may have to consider the matter further and, in this context, may also consider the question of whether compound interest must be paid on the amount due according to the present decision.\n\n275.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal awards simple interest and reserves the question of compound interest for the period after the notification of the decision.\n\n**9. THE FUTURE OF THE INJUNCTION AND A POSSIBLE INTERIM REGIME**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that, in the circumstances of the present case, the injunction prohibiting payment to Niko is a risk assumed by Petrobangla against which it failed to take adequate action and which does not excuse its failure to make payment under the GPSA. This being said, the injunction is still in place and, under the law of Bangladesh, is binding on Petrobangla.\n\n277.\n\nThe injunction prohibits Petrobangla and the other respondents in the BELA suit to make payment to Niko; and it defines its term:\n\n\"This order of injunction shall remain in force till disposal of the money suit or till amicable settlement amongst the parties, whichever is earlier.\"188\n\nExhibit C-21, p. 42.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, according to this order, \"all Petrobangla need do in order to be able to make payment to Niko is to agree with Niko\".189\n\nHT Day 4, p. 287.\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that such amicable settlement can be brought about on the basis of the dispute settlement clauses in the JVA and the GPSA. Article 13 of the GPSA requires the parties to \"make their best efforts to settle amicably through consultation any dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement\". If they fail to settle their dispute amicably, the dispute may be referred to arbitration and the arbitral tribunal takes their place in providing the settlement.190\n\nC-PC.2, p. 37.\n\n280.\n\nNow that the Tribunal has resolved the central point of disagreement between the Parties and decided that Petrobangla may not rely on a *force majeure* defence, the Tribunal does not exclude that the Parties reach the amicable settlement referred to in the order of the BELA Court. The Tribunal is encouraged in this belief by the fact that, at the April 2014 hearing, the Parties were able to resolve their difference with respect to their respective requests for provisional measures and made a joint application which the Tribunal transformed into Procedural Order No. 6 of 1 May 2014.\n\n281.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal invites the Parties to seek an amicable settlement which would satisfy the order of the BELA Court and permit Petrobangla to meet its payment obligations under the GPSA. If the Parties were unable to reach such an amicable settlement, the Tribunal will have to decide and, in this context will have to address the various interim arrangements which the Claimant has set out in some of its alternative claims.\n\n282.\n\nIt may be of assistance to the Parties if the Tribunal, at this stage and without wishing to restrict the Parties in their search for the terms and conditions of their amicable settlement, make some preliminary observations concerning possible elements of a settlement arrangement and the Tribunal\u2019s powers to order them if the Parties fail to reach agreement.\n\n283.\n\nAs to possible elements of interim arrangements which the Parties may agree or, in the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal may order, it may be useful to consider the following elements:\n\n(a) Petrobangla has agreed in Article 11.1.4 GPSA to pay in US Dollars an agreed share of the amounts due for the gas delivered under the GPSA. As a foreign currency payment, the amounts due to Niko in that currency must therefore be freely available.\n\n(b) The Tribunal has been seized of the Claimant\u2019s request for the Compensation Declaration and, concluding from the Parties\u2019 submissions made until now, expects that Niko\u2019s liability for damage caused by the two blow outs and the quantum of such damage will have to be addressed. If Niko were found liable for some or all of that damage, one of the Claimant\u2019s alternative claims, which expressly refers to the possibility of setting off claims for compensation of such damage against the amounts owed under the Payment Claim, would have to be considered. In the context of the now pending issues, interim arrangements may have to make allowance for this possibility.\n\n(c) Niko has made commitments that, at least for the time being, it will not remove assets from Bangladesh and, at repeated occasions, Niko has agreed that the amounts due from Petrobangla \"would be used by the Joint Venture to fund further work as prescribed by the JVA\".191 Any such assignment of the funds, if agreed between the Parties, could be regulated in the interim arrangement.\n\n(d) Funds payable by Petrobangla may have to be placed into an escrow account at a bank and at terms to be agreed, and the conditions for their release may have to be fixed. These conditions may include the use of the funds for the purposes of the JVA.\n\n(e) The question of the term of Petrobangla\u2019s obligation to pay interest may have to be addressed, for instance by determining that payment of the outstanding amounts into an escrow account or their reinvestment for the purposes of the JVA work terminates Petrobangla\u2019s obligation to pay interest.\n\n(f) For good order\u2019s sake it may be proper that the Parties jointly notify the High Court Division having issued the injunction, informing it of any settlement and, possibly, requesting jointly the termination of the order prohibiting payment to Niko as contained in the Judgment of 17 November 2009.\n\nSee *e.g.* Goyal WS II, paragraph 79.\n\n284.\n\nThe preceding considerations have arisen from the Parties\u2019 explanations and arguments. They are provisional and the Tribunal may reconsider them when making any order for provisional measures, or any substantive decision, in the event the Parties fail to reach agreement.\n\n285.\n\nConcerning the powers of the Tribunal, it should be recalled that Petrobangla and BAPEX, exercising rights and powers of the Government as described in the Preambles of the JVA and referred to in the GPSA, have agreed in the GPSA to submit all disputes with Niko to ICSID arbitration. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction to decide Niko\u2019s claim against Petrobangla under the GPSA. This includes jurisdiction with respect to Provisional Measures according to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, including such measures which the Tribunal may recommend on its own initiative.\n\n286.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the present Tribunal is exclusive with respect to the merits of the dispute validly brought before it. Since the Parties have not availed themselves of the possibility afforded under Rule 39 (6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to request provisional measures from judicial or other authorities, the Tribunal\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction also extends to provisional measures.\n\n287.\n\nBy virtue of its ratification, the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh and all of its organs, including the courts, are bound by the ICSID Convention and must give effect to awards rendered in ICSID arbitration.\n\n288.\n\nWhen the High Court Division and the Appellate Division of the Bangladesh Supreme Court were seized of issues affecting the contractual relationship between Niko and Petrobangla, and when they issued and partially confirmed the injunction against payment to Niko, the present arbitration had not yet commenced. As far as the Tribunal was able to determine from the procedural records of these court proceedings as they were filed in the present proceedings, no reference was made in the Bangladesh court proceedings to the existence of the contractual provision which required that disputes under the GPSA be submitted to ICSID arbitration.\n\n289.\n\nNow that the present ICSID Tribunal has been seized of the Payment Dispute, a new situation has arisen. The payments which Niko must make under the GPSA must be decided by this Tribunal, including any injunctions against such payments.\n\n290.\n\nThe present Tribunal has no reason to believe that, when this exclusive jurisdiction, founded on the ICSID Convention, is brought to the attention of the courts in Bangladesh, in particular the High Court Division having issued the injunction, these courts would disregard the international obligations assumed by Bangladesh when adhering to that Convention.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal is confident that the present Decision on the Payment Claim settles the dispute with respect to that claim and that the remaining issues should be susceptible to a mutually acceptable resolution crafted by the Parties themselves. The Tribunal nevertheless remains seized of the dispute in the event such a resolution is not achieved.\n\n**10. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n292.\n\nBased on the argument and evidence before it and in view of the considerations set out above, the Arbitral Tribunal now makes the following decision:\n\n(1) Petrobangla owes Niko USD 25\u2019312\u2019747 plus BDT 139\u2019988\u2019337 as per Niko\u2019s invoices for gas delivered from November 2004 to April 2010;\n\n(2) Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko\u2019s invoices at the rate of six month LIBOR + 2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT; interest is due on the amount of each invoice as from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007 and until it is placed at Niko\u2019s unrestricted disposition;\n\n(3) The claim for compound interest on the amount awarded under above item (1) and (2) is reserved;\n\n(4) The entitlement of BAPEX to payments under the GPSA is not affected by the present decision;\n\n(5) The Parties are invited to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the present decision and to report by no later than 30 September 2014;\n\n(6) Failing amicable settlement, any Party may seize the Tribunal for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts;\n\n(7) The decision on costs of the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim is reserved."}, {"Title": "Decision on Implementation of the Decision on the Payment Claim", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2015-09-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Implementation of the Decision on the Payment Claim\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY** | |\n| Bangladesh Bank | Central Bank of Bangladesh |\n| BAPEX | Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited, the Second Respondent |\n| BDT | Bangladeshi taka |\n| BELA Proceedings | Proceedings brought by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) and others in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division against the Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and others |\n| Centre or ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Chattak field | One of the gas fields to which the JVA relates |\n| Claimant's Clarification | Submission of 5 December 2014, responding to the Tribunals' invitation in Procedural Order No 9. |\n| Claimant's Request | Request of 25 November 2014 for Provisional Measures concerning the Decision on the Payment Claim |\n| Compensation Claims | Claims for compensation brought by the First and Third Respondents in the Court of District Judge, Dhaka, against the Claimant and others for damages alleged to arise from the blowout of 2 wells in the Chattak field (subject matter of ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11) |\n| Compensation Declaration | The declaration requested by the Claimant concerning the Compensation Claims |\n| Convention or ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States |\n| Crore | 10 million in the South Asian numbering glossary |\n| Decision or Decision on the Payment Claim | The Tribunals' Decision of 11 September 2014 concerning the Claimant's Payment Claim |\n| Feni field | One of the gas fields to which the JVA relates |\n| GOB or Government | The Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the First Respondent until the Decision on Jurisdiction |\n| GPSA | Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of 27 December 2006 between Petrobangla and the Joint Venture Partners BAPEX and Niko |\n| Joint Venture Partners | BAPEX and Niko |\n| JVA | Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and Niko, dated 16 October 2003 |\n| Ministry | Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, unless otherwise specified |\n| Money Suit | Proceedings brought by Bangladesh and Petrobangla in the Court of the District Judge in Dhaka against Niko and others (see Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 102) |\n| Niko Canada | Niko Resources Ltd., the Canadian parent company of the Claimant |\n| Niko, Niko Bangladesh or NRBL | Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd., the Claimant |\n| Payment Claim | Claims to payment under the GPSA for gas delivered (subject matter of ARB/10/18) |\n| Petrobangla | Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation, the Third Respondent |\n| Respondents' Observations | Submission of 25 June 2015 |\n| Respondents' Request | Submission of 6 August 2015 concerning the Implementation of the Decision on the Payment Claim |\n| Revised Submission | The Claimant's submission of 29 April 2014 |\n| Tk | Bangladeshi taka (also BDT) |\n| Tribunals | Collectively, the two Arbitral Tribunals constituted in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18 |\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThese two arbitrations concern an investment project that successfully commenced the development of a marginal and previously abandoned gas field (**the Feni Field**), leading to the production and sale of important quantities of gas. It then ran into two difficulties: during attempts to develop another field, the **Chattak Field**, two blow-outs occurred, causing damage to the well and the environment as to the responsibility for which there is a dispute (which has given rise in these arbitrations to the Claim for a so-called **Compensation Declaration** by which in effect the Claimant seeks to establish its non-liability); and Petrobangla, the buyer of the gas from the Feni Field, failed to make payment under the Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (**GPSA**).\n\n2.\n\nIn these arbitrations, the Claimant seeks, in addition to the Compensation Declaration, payment of the sums due under the GPSA (the **Payment Claim**). In a decision of 11 September 2014 the Tribunals confirmed Petrobangla's payment obligation (the **Decision** or the **Decision on the Payment Claim**).\n\n3.\n\nHowever, the Tribunals had noted that, despite the difficulties that had arisen in the Parties' relations, neither the Joint Venture Agreement between the Claimant and BAPEX (**the JVA**) nor the GPSA between the Claimant and Petrobangla were terminated. In a 2009 letter, Niko had stated that the funds owed to it under the GPSA would be reinvested into the Joint Venture \"*for drilling of more wells at Feni Gas Field and the development of a commercial gas reserve at Chattak Gas Field*\".1 At the 2014 hearing on the Payment Claim, the Claimant proposed to use the funds owed by Petrobangla in the territory of Bangladesh2 and confirmed this position as one of the alternatives in its submissions of 29 April 2014 (**Revised Submissions)**. Moreover, the Claimant made the commitment not to remove assets from Bangladesh.3\n\nExhibit R-24, Letter of Niko to State Minister, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, at 1, paragraph 1, (10 February 2009); referred to in WS II Amit Goyal (paragraph 27) and Request paragraph 9.\n\nConfirmed by the Claimant in the Request, paragraph 10, with references to the Transcript.\n\nDecision, paragraph 283(c).\n\n4.\n\nNoting the possibility of using the funds owed by Petrobangla in a manner that would have assisted the Parties in resuming their cooperation and the need for gas in Bangladesh emphasised by both sides, the Tribunals were of the view that the Parties should be afforded an opportunity of determining the most effective use of the funds by agreement among themselves.\n\n5.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunals, rather than simply ordering payment of the funds, found it desirable to afford to the Parties the opportunity of employing the funds for the purposes of the project or otherwise in Bangladesh. They invited the Parties to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the Tribunal's decision on the Payment Claim.\n\n6.\n\nIn order to assist the Parties in their attempts to reach such an amicable settlement, the Tribunals identified \"*possible elements of interim arrangements which the Parties may agree or, in the absence of such agreement, the Tribunals may order*\".4\n\nDecision, paragraph 283.\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties informed the Tribunals that subsequent to the Decision they had indeed conferred with a view to finding such a solution. Regrettably, however, their efforts were not ultimately successful. The letter dated 6 August 2015, which the Tribunals now received from the Respondents, leaves little hope for an agreement between the Parties as to the use of the funds: Petrobangla states that it wishes to conserve the funds it owes to the Claimant, giving no sign of an intention to seek an agreement with the Claimant as to the employment of these funds.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunals therefore must now decide on the modalities for implementing their Decision by directing how payment is to be made and by addressing certain open issues with respect to interest on the amounts owed by Petrobangla.\n\n**2. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-----------------------------\n\n**2.1 The Tribunals' Decision on the Payment Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nA detailed account of the procedural history in these two arbitrations until the Tribunals' Decision on the Payment Claim was set forth in that decision, issued on 11 September 2014.\n\n10.\n\nIn the Decision on the Payment Claim, the Tribunals held that:\n\n*(1) Petrobangla owes Niko USD 25'312'747 plus BDT 139'988'337 as per Niko's invoices for gas delivered from November 2004 to April 2010;*\n\n*(2) Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko's invoices at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT; interest is due on the amount of each invoice as from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007 and until it is placed at Niko's unrestricted disposition;*\n\n*(3) The claim for compound interest on the amount awarded under above item (1) and (2) is reserved;*\n\n*(4) The entitlement of BAPEX to payments under the GPSA is not affected by the present decision;*\n\n*(5) The Parties are invited to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the [11 September 2014] decision and to report by no later than 30 September 2014;*\n\n*(6) Failing amicable settlement, any Party may seize the Tribunals for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts;*\n\n*(7) The decision on costs of the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim is reserved.*\n\n11.\n\nWhat follows summarises the procedural steps in relation to the Payment Claim which occurred following the Decision.\n\n**2.2 Developments since the Tribunals' Decision on the Payment Claim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 30 September 2014, Petrobangla wrote to the Tribunals to report that the Parties were in ongoing discussions regarding the modalities for implementing the Decision on the Payment Claim, and that the Parties planned to meet in October 2014 for further discussions on this subject.\n\n13.\n\nOn 30 October 2014, the Tribunals invited the Parties to provide an update on the status of their discussions regarding the modalities for implementing the Decision on the Payment Claim. By email of 4 November 2014, the Claimant indicated that the Parties had not yet reached an agreement, but that they continued to explore possible amicable means for resolving the dispute. The Claimant also indicated its agreement that the Parties would provide an update to the Tribunal by 9 November 2014.\n\n14.\n\nOn 12 November 2014, Petrobangla wrote to the Tribunals and confirmed that the Parties' discussions had not resulted in an agreement.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 November 2014, the Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures concerning the Decision on the Payment Claim (**Claimant's Request**). The Claimant requested that \"the Tribunals order provisional measures that provisionally give effect to the Decision on the Payment Claim pending the Tribunals' decision in the Compensation Declaration.\" (Claimant's Request, \u00b624.) Together with the Request, the Claimant enclosed a calculation of interest through the date of the Decision on the Payment Claim, 11 September 2014, pursuant to paragraph 275 of the Decision. At the same time, the Claimant inquired how the Tribunals wished the Parties to address the question of costs and post-award interest. (Claimant's Request, \u00b622.)\n\n16.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No 9, which invited the Claimant to submit, by 5 December 2014, clarifications to its Request for Provisional Measures and to specify its request for post-award interest. The Tribunals invited Petrobangla to provide a response to the Claimant's Request, including matters addressed in the 5 December 2014 submission, by 18 December 2014. In particular the Tribunal invited Petrobangla to address the following issues:\n\n*(a) the question whether the Request should be granted as a matter of principle;*\n\n*(b) the specific measures requested by the Claimant; and, if Petrobangla does not agree with the measures requested by the Claimant,*\n\n*(c) identify any other measures which Petrobangla would find appropriate, reserving, if it wishes to do so, any objections in principle;*\n\n*(d) the interest calculation attached to the Request; if it sees the need for any corrections, Petrobangla must provide a corrected calculation by the same date; and*\n\n*(e) present its position on the Claimant's request for postaward compound interest.*\n\n17.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No 9, on 5 December 2014 the Claimant submitted clarifications to its request of 25 November 2014 (**Claimant's Clarification**). The Claimant confirmed that \"*the relief sought concerns the Tribunal's decision on the merits of the dispute in the Payment Claim*\".5 The Claimant also specified its request for post-award interest compounded monthly at the rate of 5 per cent per year.\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 2.\n\n18.\n\nOn 11 December 2014, Petrobangla notified the Tribunals that Mr David Branson of Washington, D.C. had joined the team of legal representatives for the Respondents.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 December 2014, the Respondents informed the Tribunals that Messrs Tawfique Nawaz, Imtiaz Farooq, and David Branson were no longer part of the legal team representing the Respondents, and that Mr Luis Gonzalez Garcia and Ms Alison Macdonald would continue to represent the Respondents in these arbitrations.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 19 December 2014, Petrobangla advised the Tribunals that the Parties were in discussions regarding a possible extension of the deadline for Petrobangla's response to the Claimant's Request, which was originally due by 18 December 2014. On the same day, the Claimant confirmed the Parties' agreement to discuss an extension. The Tribunals subsequently confirmed that they had no objections to the approach proposed by the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nOn 26 December 2014, Petrobangla notified the Tribunals of the Parties' agreement to extend the deadline for Petrobangla's response until 5 February 2015. The Claimant confirmed this agreement by email of the same date.\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 February 2015, Petrobangla informed the Tribunals of an agreement reached by the Parties to further extend the deadline for Petrobangla's response until 5 May 2015. On 3 February 2015, the Claimant confirmed the Parties' agreement.\n\n23.\n\nPetrobangla did not file its submission by the extended deadline of 5 May 2015. On 6 May 2015, Petrobangla informed the Tribunal that the Parties were in active negotiation for a fourth extension of the deadline for Petrobangla's response to the Claimant's Request and that it would update the Tribunals regarding the outcome of the Parties' discussions. On the same day, the Claimant confirmed the status of the Parties' discussions as described by Petrobangla. The Tribunals informed the Parties that they had no objection to the extension of the deadline for Petrobangla's response until a date to be specified by the Parties at a later time.\n\n24.\n\nOn 13 May 2015, Petrobangla notified the Tribunals of the Parties' agreement to extend the deadline for Petrobangla's response to the Claimant's Request until 19 May 2015. On the same day, the Claimant confirmed the Parties' agreement regarding the extended deadline.\n\n25.\n\nPetrobangla failed to submit its response to the Claimant's Request by the extended deadline of 19 May 2015. On 27 May 2015, the Claimant, noting that the deadline of 19 May 2015 for Petrobangla to submit its response had passed, requested that the Tribunals decide on the Claimant's Request in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 26.\n\n26.\n\nOn 28 May 2015, Petrobangla and BAPEX informed the Tribunals that Mr Luis Gonzalez Garcia and Ms Alison Macdonald no longer represented the Respondents and that they would inform the Tribunals of their new legal representatives in due course.\n\n27.\n\nHaving considered the circumstances of the Respondents' change in legal representatives, on 30 May 2015, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No 10, granting Petrobangla a final extension to submit its response to the Claimant's Request, as reiterated on 27 May 2015, by 11 June 2015. The Tribunals noted that they would rule on the Claimant's Request, including the Claimant's Clarification of 5 December 2014, even in the absence of a response from Petrobangla.\n\n28.\n\nOn 8 June 2015, Petrobangla, writing on behalf of both Respondents, advised the Tribunals that Petrobangla and BAPEX were in the process of appointing Watson Farley & Williams (Thailand), to serve as the Respondents' legal representatives in these proceedings. On 10 June 2015, the Secretary of Petrobangla confirmed that Watson Farley & Williams (Thailand) would serve as the Respondents' legal representatives for the 11 June 2015 filing.\n\n29.\n\nOn 11 June 2015, Petrobangla notified the Tribunals that due to its recent appointment of new legal representatives, Petrobangla was in ongoing discussions with the Claimant regarding a further extension of the deadline to submit its response to the Claimant's Request and that it would write to the Tribunals by 15 June 2015.\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 June 2015, Petrobangla informed the Tribunals that the Parties were unable to agree on an extension and requested an extension from the Tribunals.\n\n31.\n\nOn 16 June 2015, writing on behalf of both Respondents, Petrobangla informed the Tribunals of appointment of Watson Farley & Williams (Thailand) as counsel for the Respondents in these proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nFurther to an invitation by the Tribunals, the Claimant provided comments to Petrobangla's 15 June 2015 request for a further extension by letter of 19 June 2015. The Claimant requested that the Tribunals deny Petrobangla's request.\n\n33.\n\nOn 23 June 2015, the Tribunals informed the Parties of their decision to deny Petrobangla's request for a further extension of the deadline to file its response to the Claimant's Request. The Tribunals noted that Petrobangla had had more than six months to respond to the Claimant's Request before the resignation of its previous legal representatives, and given the Tribunals' responsibility to conduct the proceedings in a manner that is fair to both sides and proceed with reasonable dispatch, the Tribunals concluded that there was no justification for a further extension.\n\n34.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, the Respondents filed an unsolicited letter with the Tribunals containing observations on the question whether the Claimant's \"*Request should be granted as a matter of principle*\" and on the request for \"*post-award compound interest*\" (**Respondents' Observations**).\n\n35.\n\nPetrobangla wrote on 9 July 2015 informing the Tribunals that Foley Hoag LLP had been appointed to represent both Petrobangla and BAPEX in the arbitrations and that partners Paul S. Reichler and Derek C. Smith were authorised to communicate on their behalf with ICISID; all previous authorisations for other external counsel were withdrawn. In the letter Petrobangla provided details about the representation about by its previous legal counsel, explaining that it had not been properly informed by its previous counsel about details of the proceedings. It stated in particular: \"*We were not initially aware that essentially no case had been presented to the Tribunals on our behalf regarding the Compensation Declaration Claim.*\"\n\n36.\n\nThe newly appointed counsel wrote on the same day announcing the appointment of new experts and requesting an extension of time for the submission concerning the Compensation Declaration. After further correspondence, the matter was dealt with by the Tribunals in Procedural Order No 11 of 19 August 2015.\n\n37.\n\nOn 6 August 2015 the Respondents requested that the Tribunals decide that the amounts outstanding under the Decision on the Payment Claim be payable only after \"*all issues regarding Niko's liability are resolved*\" (**Respondents' Request**).\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunals deliberated about all issues concerning the Claimant's Request as well as the Respondents' Request. They reached unanimously the present decision.\n\n**3. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS AND THE ISSUES TO BE DECIDED**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIn its Request of 25 November 2014 and its Observations of 5 December 2014, **the Claimant**\n\n(i) sought measures to give effect to the Tribunals' Decision by referring to different alternative conclusions which had been made in its Revised Submission of 29 April 2014; in these conclusions the Claimant had set out several alternatives for the manner in which the amounts owed by Petrobangla should be paid.\n\n40.\n\nThe alternatives proposed by the Claimant were as follows:\n\n*In the alternative, Niko respectfully submits that the Tribunals should issue an award in its favor and against Petrobangla and BAPEX:*\n\n*Alternative A*\n\n*a) Declaring that Niko is entitled to bring and capable of bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices owed to Niko on its own;*\n\n*b) Finding that Petrobangla and Niko have agreed that Petrobangla owes to Niko and should pay to Niko the total amount owing to Niko under the Invoices, being 25,312,747.00 USD plus 139,988,337.00 BDT;*\n\n*c) Finding that this agreement reflects an amicable settlement within the meaning of the BELA injunction of 17 November 2009;*\n\n*d) Ordering Petrobangla to pay to Niko the total amount stated above;*\n\n*e) Ordering Petrobangla to pay interest on any payment awarded under paragraph b above at a simple annual rate of 5 percent through the date of the award;*\n\n*f) Ordering post-award interest at an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the award is paid in full;*\n\n*g) Awarding Niko costs in accordance with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention; and*\n\n*h) Awarding such other and further relief as the Tribunals deem appropriate.*\n\n*Alternative B*\n\n*a) Declaring that Niko is entitled to bring and capable of bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices owed to Niko on its own;*\n\n*b) Declaring that Petrobangla owes to Niko the total amount due under the Invoices, being 25,312,747.00 USD plus 139,988,337.00 BDT;*\n\n*c) Declaring that Petrobangla shall pay interest on the amount under paragraph b above at a simple annual rate of 5 percent through the date of the award;*\n\n*d) Declaring that Petrobangla shall pay post-award interest at an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the amount in full is paid in accordance with paragraph e below;*\n\n*e) Ordering Petrobangla to pay the amounts stated under paragraphs b, c and d to a bank designated by Niko, which bank shall act as account holder and independent escrow agent with respect to such funds pursuant to a standard escrow account agreement of such bank with the following characteristics:*\n\n*i. Petrobangla and Niko shall appoint the bank as escrow agent;*\n\n*ii. The funds on account shall bear interest;*\n\n*iii. The funds shall remain owned by Petrobangla until disbursed;*\n\n*iv. The funds shall be disbursed only to parties unrelated to Niko and upon presentation by Niko of* *(a) bank details for such a party; and (b) a certification that the payee is not affiliated with Niko by common ownership or control and that the payment concerns operations or activities in the territory of Bangladesh;*\n\n*f) Ordering that, in the event that Petrobangla fails to make the payment specified in paragraph e within 120 days of the award, Petrobangla shall make payment to Niko directly;*\n\n*g) Awarding Niko costs in accordance with the Article 61 of the ICSID Convention; and*\n\n*h) Awarding such other and further relief as the Tribunals deem appropriate.*\n\n*Alternative C*\n\n*a) Declaring that Niko is entitled to bring and capable of bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices owed to Niko on its own;*\n\n*b) Declaring that Petrobangla owes to Niko the total amount due under the Invoices, being 25,312,747.00 USD plus 139,988,337.00 BDT;*\n\n*c) Declaring that Petrobangla shall pay interest on the amount under paragraph b above at a simple annual rate of 5 percent through the date of the award;*\n\n*d) Declaring that Petrobangla shall pay post-award interest at an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the amount in full is paid in accordance with paragraph e below;*\n\n*e) Ordering Petrobangla to pay the amounts stated under paragraphs b, c and d to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which shall hold such sums in an interest-bearing account pending the Tribunals' award in the Compensation Declaration and disbursed by the Centre in accordance with the directions of the Tribunals, it being understood that such sums shall be paid to Niko only if the Tribunals in the Compensation Declaration find that Niko is not liable for the blowouts at issue or only to the extent that Nikos' liability is less than the amount paid by Petrobangla pursuant to paragraphs b, c and d above, and also understood that any moneys not paid to Niko further to the preceding phrase shall be paid at the direction of Petrobangla or BAPEX;*\n\n*f) Ordering that, in the event that Petrobangla fails to make the payment specified in paragraph e within 120 days of the award, Petrobangla shall make payment to Niko directly;*\n\n*g) Awarding Niko costs in accordance with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention; and*\n\n*h) Awarding such other and further relief as the Tribunals deem appropriate.*\n\n*Alternative D*\n\n*a) Declaring that Niko is entitled to bring and capable of bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices owed to Niko on its own;*\n\n*b) Finding that Petrobangla and Niko have agreed that Petrobangla owes to Niko and should pay to Niko the total amount owing to Niko under the Invoices, being 25,312,747.00 USD plus 139,988,337.00 BDT;*\n\n*c) Finding that Petrobangla and Niko have expressed in the GPSA their mutual agreement to arrive at an extrajudicial settlement in the present circumstances and have appointed these Tribunals to arrive at, and formally record, the Parties' amicable settlement;*\n\n*d) Ordering Petrobangla to pay to Niko the total amount stated above;*\n\n*e) Ordering Petrobangla to pay interest on any payment awarded under paragraph b above at a simple annual rate of 5 percent through the date of the award;*\n\n*f) Ordering post-award interest at an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the award is paid in full;*\n\n*g) Awarding Niko costs in accordance with Article 61 of the ICSID Convention; and*\n\n*h) Awarding such other and further relief as the Tribunals deem appropriate.*\n\n41.\n\nIn addition to this request concerning the payment modalities, the Claimant\n\n(ii) quantified the interest that, by the time the Decision was notified, had accumulated on the amount owed by Petrobangla;\n\n(iii) requested that, for the period after the notification of the Decision, the outstanding amounts bear interest at 5% per annum;\n\n(iv) requested that interest be payable after the notification of the Decision be compounded monthly; and\n\n(v) requested that the costs of the proceedings be assessed at this point of the proceedings and that these costs be added to the principal, bearing compound interest as part of the total principal.6\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 23.\n\n42.\n\n**The Respondents** did not take any position on the Claimant's Request within the procedural time limits set by the Tribunals. As stated above, the Respondents nevertheless submitted Observations on 25 June 2015, concluding that\n\n(i) \"... *it is not appropriate to grant the provisional measure requested by Niko. The most effective way to preserve the status quo, which has existed since the commencement of both ICSID arbitrations, is to refuse to grant Niko's Request and to reserve a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts in the Payment Decision pending resolution of the Compensation Declaration*\";\n\n(ii) the \"*post-award annual rate should match the pre-award rates*\"; and\n\n(iii) only simple interest should be awarded and, if compound interest were admitted, compounding should not be monthly but annually.\n\n43.\n\nIn their Request of 6 August 2015 the Respondents requested\n\n(iv) \"*.that the Tribunals decide that the outstanding amounts under the Payment Claim Decision will be payable (to the extent they remain outstanding) only after all issues regarding Niko's liability are resolved.*\"\n\n44.\n\nWith regard to the Respondents' Request, **the Tribunals** first need to examine whether, in view of the timing of this submission, the Respondents' Request should be admitted.\n\n45.\n\nOn the substance to be addressed by the present Decision, the Tribunals then need to examine the following issues:\n\n(i) whether the relief requested by the Claimant concerning the payment modalities is admissible;\n\n(ii) whether in the circumstances it is appropriate to order any of the measures requested by the Claimant or the Respondents;\n\n(iii) the interest rate applicable during the period after the notification of the Decision;\n\n(iv) whether compound interest is admissible as a matter of principle and, if so, whether in the circumstances of the Payment Claim it should be awarded and, if so, at what interval;\n\n(v) whether costs of the proceedings as claimed in the Claimant's Clarification should be assessed at this stage and, if so, should be added to the principle, bearing interest.\n\n46.\n\nIn the sections below, the Tribunals will set out in further detail the positions of the Parties and the relief requested by them.\n\n**4. THE PAYMENT MODALITIES**\n-----------------------------\n\n**4.1 The measures requested by the Claimant**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn the Decision on the Payment Claim the Tribunals had determined the amount which Petrobangla owed to Niko under the GPSA and the related interest rate. During the hearing in April 2014, preceding the September 2014 decision, the Parties considered the relationship between the amount due by Petrobangla to Niko and the Compensation Declaration sought by Niko. In this context, the Tribunals noted a commitment by Niko \"*that, at least for the time being, it will not remove assets from Bangladesh*\" and an agreement by Niko that the amounts due from Petrobangla \"*would be used by the Joint Venture to fund further work as prescribed by the JVA*\".7 Niko's Revised Submissions of 29 April 2014, in some of the alternatives, reflected aspects of this commitment and agreement.\n\nDecision, paragraph 283 (c).\n\n48.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunals invited the Parties\n\n*... to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the present decision and to report by no later than 30 September 2014;*\n\n*Failing amicable settlement, any Party may seize the Tribunal for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts*.8\n\nDecision, paragraph 292 (5) and (5).\n\n49.\n\nIn its Request the Claimant explained that, further to this invitation by the Tribunals,\n\n*... the Parties have attempted to reach an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the Decision on the Payment Claim*.9\n\nSee Claimant's Request, paragraph 5 and FN 3.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant then announced to the Tribunals its conclusion that\n\n*... the Parties have failed to reach an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the Decision on the Payment Claim*.10\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 6.\n\n51.\n\nIn its Request the Claimant referred to the relief set out in its revised submission of 29 April 2014, as they have been reproduced above, and requested\n\n*... that the Tribunals adopt provisional measures ordering] Petrobangla to pay the outstanding amounts stated in paragraph 292 (1) and (2) of the Decision on the Payment Claim (amounts in principal and pre-award interest) along the lines suggested in Alternatives A to D of Niko's Revised Submissions of 29 April 2014, and as the Tribunals deem fit*.11\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 8.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant added\n\n*... that, in deciding] on provisional measures, the Tribunals take into account the position that Niko has taken in this arbitration on the use of funds in the period between the issuance of provisional measures and the decision in the Compensation Declaration*.12\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 9.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant recalled the following positions it had taken with respect to the use of funds:\n\n*... to use the funds owed by Petrobangla for operations in the territory of Bangladesh at large, rather than for operations limited to Chattak and Feni* ;\n\nand\n\n*... that Petrobangla shall be ordered to pay the amounts owing to Niko into an escrow account and that the funds shall be disbursed to parties unrelated to Niko for 'operations or activities in the territory of Bangladesh*'.13\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraphs 10 and 11.\n\n54.\n\nWith respect to the payment mechanism which it requested to be put in place, the Claimant specified its objective as\n\n... ensuring that Niko will be paid the outstanding amounts due to it by Petrobangla once the Tribunals issue an award in the Compensation Declaration. If the outstanding amounts in the Payment Claim are paid into an escrow account or a similar vehicle, these amounts can be used to satisfy any liability of Niko found in the Compensation Declaration (although Niko's position is that it is not liable for the blowouts). The balance of the funds held in escrow, after satisfaction of Niko's liability - if any - to BAPEX pursuant to the Compensation Declaration, would then be paid to Niko.14\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 19.\n\n55.\n\nIn the Clarification the Claimant explained, in response to the question in the Tribunals' Procedural Order No 9, that the \"*relief sought concerns the Tribunals' decision on the merits of the dispute in the Payment Claim*\".15\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 2.\n\n**4.2 The Respondents' Observations and Request**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn their Observations of 25 June 2015 the Respondents' counsel stated:\n\n*... our client is not in a position to offer instructions on the substantive issues raised in the Request*.16\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 2.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondents' Observations continued nevertheless by arguing that the requirements under the ICSID Convention for ordering provisional measures are not met so that it is \"*not appropriate to grant the provisional measures requested by Niko*\".17\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 10.\n\n58.\n\nThese Observations were made after the time allowed for their submission had expired. The Tribunals nevertheless considered the Observations since they were made at a time when the Tribunals had not completed their deliberations and no delay was caused by their late submission. Since no reply to the Respondents' submission had been foreseen, the late production of the Observations caused no disadvantage to the Claimant.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondents' Request of 6 August 2015 relied on a passage of the Decision quoted above, according to which in the absence of an amicable settlement with respect to implementing the Decision\n\n*... any Party may seize the Tribunal for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts*.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondents continued by noting that the\n\n*\u2026 negotiations to reach an amicable settlement effectively came to an end in May 2015. In light of the lack of an amicable settlement and mindful of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, Respondents respectfully seize the Tribunals to request a decision that the outstanding amounts under the Payment Claim will be payable (to the extent they remain outstanding) only after the Tribunals reach a final decision regarding Niko's requests for relief in the Compensation Declaration phase*.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondents' Request is presented as an application provided by the Tribunals' Decision for which the Tribunals had not fixed a time limit. In substance, however, this request amounts to refuting the Request of the Claimant in all its alternatives and to denying that any effect be given to the Payment Decision prior to the decision on the Compensation Declaration.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunals therefore take the Respondents' Request of 6 August 2015 as a response to the Claimant's Request which requires no further argument and can be decided as part of the decision on the Claimant's Request.\n\n**4.3 The admissibility of the measures requested by the Claimant**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn its Request the Claimant sought \"*provisional measures that provisionally give effect to the Decision on the Payment Claim pending the Tribunals' decision in the Compensation Declaration*\".18 The Claimant also explained that the measures requested were intended to replace the failure of the Parties to reach agreement \"*with respect to the modalities for implementing the Decision on the Payment Claim*\".19\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 2.\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraphs 5 and 6.\n\n64.\n\nFollowing Procedural Order No 9, the Claimant clarified the nature of the requested measures, stating that \"*the relief sought concerns the Tribunals' decision on the merits of the dispute in the Payment Claim*\".20 The Claimant also explained that, with the exception of Alternative C, the measures were not tied to any future relief and requested final relief. Alternative C could be deemed \"*interim*\" in the sense \"*that the final relief depends upon the outcome of the Compensation Declaration*\".21\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 2\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 4.\n\n65.\n\nIn their Observations the Respondents contested the admissibility of the measures requested by reference to criteria for the admissibility of provisional measures. They identify the requirements for the granting of such measures, examine whether the relevant criteria are met and conclude that this was not the case.22 On this basis the Respondents declared that it was not appropriate to grant the measures requested by the Claimant.\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 4.\n\n66.\n\nIn their letter of 6 August 2015 the Respondents no longer contested the admissibility of the measures but denied the justification of any such measures before the decision on the Compensation Declaration.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondents' reasoning for denying admissibility of the Claimant's Request presumes that the measures requested are indeed \"provisional measures\". The ICSID Convention provides in its Article 47 for \"*provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party*\". Similarly, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 concerns measures which a party requests \"*for the preservation of its rights*\".\n\n68.\n\nMore generally, as defined by KAUFMANN-KOHLER and ANTONIETTI,\n\n*Interim measures are temporary in nature and are traditionally intended to 'preserve the respective rights of the Parties pending the decision' of a tribunal*.23\n\nGabrielle KAUFMANN-KOHLER and Aur\u00e9lia ANTONIETTI, Interim Relief in International Investment Agreements, in Katia YANNACA-SMALL, Arbitration under International Investment Agreements, 2010, 307 at 314, quoting from the ICJ decision on Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. (United Kingdom v. Iran) of 5 July 1951, ICJ Reports 1951, p. 91.\n\n69.\n\nIn the present case, the right which the Claimant's Request seeks to protect is that of payment for the invoiced amounts. This right has been confirmed in the September 2014 Decision. The measures which the Claimant seeks by its Request concern the modalities of implementing this right: when and how the Claimant receives the amounts which are due to it. This is obviously the case with respect to Alternatives A and D, by which the Claimant seeks an order that \"*Petrobangla pay to Niko the total amount*\" due. This request plainly seeks enforcement of the right, not provisional protection until the existence of the right has been accepted by the Tribunals.\n\n70.\n\nThe situation is no different with respect to those alternatives by which the Claimant accepts that it be paid only at some future time and subject to a condition. Here, too, the right to payment is already established but its implementation is uncertain; the measures are intended to regulate modalities of this implementation, not the right in principle.\n\n70.\n\nIn conclusion, the measures sought by the Claimant's Request are intended to give effect to the Claimant's rights themselves and are not measures intended to protect these rights subject to a future decision by the Tribunals. By their nature, they are not provisional measures in the sense of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The question whether the requirements for the admissibility of such provisional measures are met therefore does not arise.\n\n**4.4 The content of the measures implementing the September 2014 Decision**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunals now therefore proceed to examine the relief sought by the Claimant on the basis that it is to be treated not as a provisional measure but rather as the implementation of its September 2014 Decision. Such implementation is plainly within the Tribunals' jurisdiction and foreseen by that Decision in the event that the Parties were not otherwise able to reach agreement on implementation.\n\n72.\n\nThe measures requested by the Claimant require that the amounts owed by Petrobangla be actually paid, directly to the Claimant or into some form of escrow arrangement. Petrobangla takes the position that, for the time being and until the Tribunals have made their decision on the Compensation Declaration, it should not be required to make any payment.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunals have considered the Parties' positions against the following background: Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement of 2003, the Claimant invested significant funds to develop the Feni and the Chattak fields and, starting with November 2004, delivered gas to Petrobangla. The GPSA between Petrobangla and the Joint Venture, which regulates these deliveries and payment for them, was concluded in 2006. On the basis of this agreement, Petrobangla owes some USD 25 million and some BDT 140 million to Niko, plus interest, as confirmed by the Tribunals in their Decision on the Payment Claim.\n\n74.\n\nUntil today, some eleven years after the start of deliveries, Petrobangla has not made any payment for the gas it received, apart from two initial interim payments of altogether USD 4 million. The Respondents' Request of 6 August 2015 seeking a decision allowing Petrobangla to continue withholding the amounts which it owes must be seen in this context.\n\n75.\n\nIn this request the Respondents argue that it was Niko that created the link between the Payment Claim and the determination of Niko's liability for compensation for damage resulting from the blow-outs. Relying on observations in one of the expert reports, Petrobangla further argues that Niko's design of the wells was deficient and that for that reason the Tribunals may find Niko liable for the damage caused.\n\n76.\n\nPetrobangla concludes that\n\n*it would unnecessarily prejudice Respondents, and the sovereign State of Bangladesh, to have to pay or set aside a substantial sum for Claimant that may not be owed at all. Even payment into an escrow account, entailing the corresponding loss of access to a very substantial sum of money, would be an unfair burden on Petrobangla when the amount owed depends on the resolution of all of the issues Niko brought before the Tribunals.*\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunals do not accept this reasoning. The \"*substantial sum of money*\" is owed by Petrobangla to Niko and is long overdue. It is Niko that is prejudiced by the \"*loss of access*\" to this sum, due to Petrobangla's withholding it.\n\n78.\n\nWhile the debt of Petrobangla is established, the question whether Niko is liable for the damage resulting from the blowouts remains to be determined. If any liability of Niko were established, it is not certain that it would require payment specifically to Petrobangla rather than to BAPEX or some other entity. Indeed, Petrobangla decided not to bring any claims in these arbitrations and the liability which Niko seeks to have the Tribunals consider seems to involve alleged entitlements of BAPEX.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that there is no justification for Petrobangla to further withhold the funds owed to Niko.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunals also have taken note of the Claimant's proposal at the 2014 hearing, later confirmed in the Claimant's Request, \"t *o use the funds owed by Petrobangla for operations in the territory of Bangladesh at large, rather than for operations limited to Chattak and Feni*\".24 It insisted that this and other positions underlying the alternatives in the Revised Submissions of 29 April 2014 \"*be duly taken into account by the Tribunals' when considering Niko's present request for provisional measures*\".25\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 10.\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 12.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunals are receptive to these considerations, in particular since they preserve the funds owed to Niko for possible payments in the event Niko were found liable for damage caused by the blow-outs and the quantum was determined. This was indeed one of the points indicated by the Tribunals in the context of the interim arrangements to which it referred in the Decision on the Payment Claim.26\n\nParagraph 283 (b) and (c).\n\n82.\n\nWhen discussing in their Decision possible elements of interim arrangements which the Parties may agree or (in the absence of such agreement) the Tribunals may order, the Tribunals considered the possibility of the Parties' agreeing to put the funds to productive use in Bangladesh. Some of the alternatives in the Claimant's Revised Submissions identified such objectives.\n\n83.\n\nSince then the Parties have informed the Tribunals that their discussions in this direction did not lead to any result. The Tribunals have taken note of this situation. They also have taken note that Petrobangla wishes to withhold payment and has not made any proposals for an interim arrangement.\n\n84.\n\nIn these circumstances and unless the Parties requested them to do otherwise, the Tribunals do not see any merit in ordering interim arrangements ordering any specific use of the funds, as envisioned by paragraph (e) iv in Alternative B in the Claimant's Revised Submissions or any variation thereof.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunals therefore conclude that any order made by the Tribunals relating to the implementation of the Decision on the Payment Claim must provide for an escrow account into which Petrobangla pays forthwith the amounts owed to Niko. The funds in this account shall be used, in case the Tribunals find Niko liable for all or part of the damage resulting from the blow-outs, to satisfy any compensation obligations found, and the directions given, by the Tribunals in this respect. The escrow arrangement must ensure now that funds not used for such compensation will at that point be made freely available to Niko, as indicated in the Tribunals' Decision.\n\n86.\n\nThese considerations lead the Tribunal to exclude Alternatives A and D and provide for the payment into an escrow account. This possibility is foreseen by Claimant's Alternative B, which the Tribunal adjusts as follows.\n\n87.\n\nPetrobangla shall pay the sums owed to Niko into an escrow account opened by the Claimant. The sums shall be released as instructed by the Tribunals or agreed by the Parties. The U.S. Dollar part of the amounts shall be available free of any currency control in Bangladesh. Petrobangla's interest obligations, as specified in the Decision on the Payment Claim and in the present decision, shall continue to apply until the funds are paid to Niko at its free disposition. Interest earned on the escrow account during a given period may be deducted by Petrobangla from the interest due for the corresponding period.\n\n**5. QUANTIFICATION OF PRE-DECISION INTEREST**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAs explained above, the Decision contained an order for payment of interest in the following terms\n\n*Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko's invoices at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT; interest is due on the amount of each invoice as from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007 and until it is placed at Niko's unrestricted disposition;*\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimant joined to its Request a spreadsheet setting out the its\n\n*... calculation of interest through the date of the notification of the Decision on the Payment Claim (11 September 2014) (Exhibit C-22 quarter). Interest is calculated on the amount of each invoice as from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007 and until the date when the Decision on the Payment Claim was dispatched to the Parties (11 September 2014). The calculation establishes that, as of 11 September 2014, the total amount of interest accrued in US dollars using the methodology ordered in the Decision was USD 5'932'833 and the total amount in taka was BDT 49'849'961. For the Tribunals' information that taka amount is equal to USD 643'682 at the exchange rate of 11 September 2014.*27\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 21.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant clarified that the \"*pre-award interest*\" was so calculated to be treated as part of the \"*total amount awarded to Niko*\" to which \"*post-award interest\"* be applied *.*28\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 23.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunals take these submissions as a request for giving effect to the Decision by ordering the payment of the interest amount as quantified by the Claimant.\n\n92.\n\nIn Procedural Order No 9 the Tribunals invited Petrobangla to provide a response both to the Request and the Clarification, including \"*the interest calculation attached to the Request; if it sees the need for any corrections, Petrobangla must provide a corrected calculation by the same date*\".\n\n93.\n\nPetrobangla did not respond on 18 December 2014, the date that had been fixed in Procedural Order No 9, nor during any of the subsequently granted extensions; BAPEX did not provide any response either. In their unsolicited submission of 25 June 2015 and in the Respondents' Request of 6 August 2015 the interest calculation as submitted by the Claimant is not addressed.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that the Claimant's calculation of the interest due by Petrobangla until 11 September 2014 remains uncontested.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunals have nevertheless examined the elements of the Claimant's calculation. They note that, according to the indications in the spreadsheet, interest was calculated only as from 14 May 2007 and, with respect to invoices issued subsequently, 45 days after the invoice date. The rates applied in the Claimant's spreadsheet are 5% with respect to amounts in BDT and 2% above the rate of six month LIBOR for U.S. Dollar amounts. The calculation is made by applying simple interest.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that the calculation was made in line with the Tribunals' Decision of 11 September 2014. The Tribunals award **USD 5'932'833 and BDT 49'849'961** for interest due until 11 September 2014.\n\n**6. THE POST-DECISION INTEREST RATE FOR THE U.S. DOLLAR DEBT AND THE REQUEST FOR RECONSIDERATION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Decision determines that Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko's invoices at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT until the outstanding amounts are *\"placed at Niko's unrestricted disposition*\"; no distinction is made with respect to the interest rate before and that after the Decision. The reservation of the \"*claim for compound interest*\" concerned the principle of compounding and not the rate.\n\n98.\n\nIn its Request the Claimant asked the Tribunals to indicate how they wished the Parties to address \"*post-award interest*\". In the Clarification, the Claimant requested that post-Decision interest be awarded at the rate of 5%, irrespective of the currency in which it was to be calculated.29 This amounts to a change in the postDecision interest rates for the U.S. Dollar debt. Petrobangla argued that \"*the rate should not change post-award*\".30\n\nClaimant's Clarification, p. 7 et seq. and p. 10, paragraph 30.\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 22.\n\n99.\n\nIn order to grant the Claimant's request concerning the postDecision interest, the Tribunals would have to reconsider their ruling on the interest rate for the U.S. Dollar debt. The Tribunals have heard the Parties on the issue of the interest rates and closed the issue by their Decision. The Claimant does not provide any reason why this ruling should be reconsidered and the Tribunals do not see any.\n\n100.\n\nIn any event, even if reconsideration of this aspect of the September 2014 Decision would be admissible, the Tribunals see no justification for applying a different rate for the post-Decision interest. When they fixed the interest rate in the Decision, the Tribunals were \"*guided by the objective that the successful party should be compensated for having been kept out of its money to which it was entitled\"*.31 The Claimant has not shown any evidence nor even argued that the loss which it suffered by reason of Petrobangla's failure to pay would have changed on the date when the Tribunals issued their Decision.32 As stated by the ICSID Tribunal in *Micula v. Romania* :\n\n*... the Tribunal does not see why the cost of the deprivation of money (which interest compensates) should be different before and after the award*.33\n\nDecision, paragraph 257.\n\nThe Tribunals are aware that in some legal systems a difference is made between pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and that this distinction has been applied in some awards, including awards by tribunals in ICSID arbitrations. The Tribunals see no justification to apply the distinction in the present case.\n\nIoan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. Romania, ICSID Case No ARB/05/20, Award of 11 December 2013 (Laurent L\u00c9VY (President), Stanimir A. ALEXANDROV and Georges ABI-SAAB), paragraph 1269.\n\n101.\n\nWhile one does find in the practice of ICSID tribunals cases where a difference was made between pre- and post-award interest, \"[i]*n most cases, tribunals have not considered post-award interest separately from pre-award interest, and have simply granted it until the date of full payment of the award*\".34\n\nSergey RIPINSKY, Kevin WILLIAMS, Damages in International Law, BIICL, London, 2008, 387.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to justify its claim for a different interest rate for post-Decision interest by arguing that \"*post-award interest*\" has a purpose different from \"*pre-award interest*\".\n\n103.\n\nIn support of this argument the Claimant relies on an award in ICSID proceedings and the opinion of a legal writer. The award in *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* contains the following passage, quoted by the Claimant:\n\n*... As requested by the Claimant, the Tribunal may also determine a different interest rate to apply to post-Award interest than that applied to pre-Award interest. This is because the purpose of post-Award interest is arguably different - damages become due as at the date of the Award, and from this time, Respondent is essentially in default of payment. As such, the Tribunal considers that continuing to apply a risk-free interest rate would be inappropriate*.35\n\nGold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 (Piero BERNARDINI (President), Pierre-Marie DUPUY and David A.R.WILLIAMS), paragraph 856, quoted after the Claimant's Clarification, paragraph 13.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant also quotes Professor MARBOE's study in the following terms:\n\n*From the moment a legally binding ruling has been rendered, the amount and time of the payment obligation is defined. The respondent is in default if it does not fulfil the payment obligation. This type of default may be penalized by a much higher interest rate which is no longer limited to the concrete damage actually incurred by the party*.36\n\nIrmgard MARBOE, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law, Oxford UP, 2009, paragraph 6,245.\n\n105.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunals decided that Petrobangla was in default of its payment obligations at various dates, prior to the Decision and that from these dates onward interest was due to compensate the Claimant's loss. The considerations of the tribunal in the *Gold Reserve* case, which seemed to have fixed the rate for pre-award interest at a rate inappropriate for a case of default, do not apply here.\n\n106.\n\nAs to the considerations of Professor MARBOE, the Tribunals are mindful of the fact that they have been appointed by the Parties to resolve a specific dispute arising out of their contracts. The Tribunals do not exclude that the parties to a contract provide, in one form or another, that an arbitral tribunal may \"*penalise*\" a party failing to comply with its award by sanctions in the form of \"*astreinte*\" or increased interest rates, with the objective of promoting compliance with its decisions. However, this does not mean that the ICSID Convention empowers or entitles arbitrators, on grounds independently of the parties' agreement, to impose sanctions on a party for non-compliance with a tribunal's decision.37\n\nThe matter will be considered further below in Section 7.3 in the context of the choice of the interval for compound interest.\n\n107.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunals reject the Claimant's request for reconsideration and confirm the decision concerning the interest rate for the U.S. Dollar debt.\n\n**7. COMPOUNDING**\n------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant further seeks an order that post-Decision interest be compounded monthly.\n\n109.\n\nDuring the proceedings leading to the September 2014 Decision the Claimant had sought simple interest on the outstanding payments for the period up to the Decision. Only for the period thereafter it sought interest at \"*an annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the award is paid in full*\". After the proceedings on the Payment Claim had been closed and before they issued the Decision, the Tribunals authorised submissions on the narrow question of the interest rate in Bangladesh for U.S. Dollar debts. In its submission on that issue the Claimant confirmed the claim for simple pre-award interest at the annual rate of 5%, but added \"*if a commercial rate such as [LIBOR +2%] is applied the commercial practice of compounding of interest should also be applied*\".\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunals decided that this new alternative claim for preaward compound interest was late and therefore not admissible. They awarded only simple interest, but left open the question of whether for the period after the notification of the Decision interest should be compounded.38\n\nSee paragraphs 267 to 273 of the Decision and above section 5.\n\n111.\n\nAfter the Decision had been notified and the Parties' attempts to settle amicably the remaining issues relating to the Payment Claim had failed, the Claimant filed its Request of 25 November 2014 which also addressed the question of compounding. In its Clarification the Claimant argued that post-Decision interest should be compounded and the compounding should be effected monthly.39\n\nClaimant's Clarification, pp. 6 et seq.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondents argued that in ICSID cases, compound interest could only be awarded for expropriation cases but not for contract claims; since the present claim is based on delay in payment under a contract, only simple interest would be admissible. If interest would be compounded, this should be calculated only annually.40\n\nRespondents' Observations, pp. 6 et seq.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunals considered the argument of the Parties and the authorities to which they refer. They note from the outset that the issue of compound interest is particularly controversial. The Tribunals therefore will examine (i) whether ICSID tribunals may award compound interest in a case as the present one and, if they may, (ii) under what conditions they should award compounding and (iii) at what intervals.\n\n114.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not regulate the question whether tribunals proceeding under the Convention and its Arbitration Rules may award compound interest. The question therefore must be decided under the applicable law, in the present case international law governing the Convention and the arbitral process as defined therein and the law of Bangladesh chosen by the Parties otherwise governing the GPSA.\n\n115.\n\nWhile the question of the interest rate was argued and decided on the basis of Bangladesh law,41 neither Party relied on the law of Bangladesh with respect to the compounding issue. In particular, neither Party argued that, under the law of Bangladesh, compounding was prohibited. The Tribunals, too, are not aware of such a prohibition. The Tribunals consider therefore the admissibility of compound interest and its applicability in the present case by reference to general principles applicable in international arbitration, and in particular to ICSID proceedings.\n\nDecision, p. 73 et seq.\n\n**7.1 Admissibility of compound interest in ICSID arbitration**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant argues that awards of compound interest have become the norm in ICSID cases.42 The Respondents rely on an ICSID award from which they conclude, as mentioned above, that \"*compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims*\";43 they point out that the present case is \"*a simple breach of contract claim*\".44\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 9.\n\nThe Respondents refer to Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19. The case and this reference shall be discussed in further detail below.\n\nObservations, paragraph 12, relying on Duke Energy Elecrtoquil Partners and Electroquil SA v Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award of 18 August 2008 (Gabrielle KAUFMANN-KOHLER (President), Enrique G\u00d3MEZ-PINZ\u00d3N and Albert Jan VAN DEN BERG), paragraph 838 and cases cited.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunals are aware that, historically, many legal systems have taken a restrictive position toward compounding interest.45 The traditional position in international adjudication has been expressed in a much quoted passage by WHITEMAN in 1943:\n\n*There are few rules within the scope of the subject of damages in international law that are better settled than the one that compound interest is not allowable. Although in rare cases compound interest, or its equivalent, has been granted, tribunals have been almost unanimous in disapproval of its allowance*.46\n\nFor some examples see F.A. MANN, Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in International Law, U.C. Davis Law Review, 21 (Festschrift in Honour of Edgar Bodenheimer), 1988, 577-86; reproduced in Further Studies in International Law (New York: Oxford UP) 1966, 377 at 381.\n\nMajorie M. WHITEMAN, Damages in International Law, vol. 3 (Washington DC) 1943 at 1997; quoted from BROWER and SHARP, Awards of Compound Interest in International Arbitration: The Aminoil Non-Precedent, in Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce and Dispute Resolution, Liber Amicorum for Robert Briner, Paris (ICC) 2005, 155 at 157; the passage is also quoted by MANN, 377 (the passage \"is not allowable\" there is reproduced as \"is now allowable\" - an obvious error).\n\n118.\n\nIn an article of 1988, Dr F.A. MANN examined the law and practice with respect to compound interest in international law. Starting with the passage from WHITEMAN and a similar statement by ROUSSEAU in 1983,47 he commented on international decisions and legal writers dealing with the subject:\n\n*Numerous decisions, mainly arbitral awards, support both these statements. At the same time, however, it should be recognized that, as an item of damage, the problem of compound interest apparently has never been fully analysed. Most learned writers ignore it or fail to give any reason for their conclusion that compound interest is or is not payable*.\n\nCharles ROUSSEAU, Droit international public, V (1983), paragraph 242.\n\n119.\n\nThe only exception, which MANN recognised, is Jean-Luc SUBILIA who dealt with the problem \"a little more carefully\" and who concluded in his study of 1972:\n\n*As far as compound interest is concerned, it seems that one cannot go further than to state that such recovery generally is not granted by international tribunals. Beyond that, the few precedents favourable to compound interest, which have been mentioned in Chapter VI, do not support the existence of a case law rule which would preclude them as a matter of international law.*48\n\nJean-Luc SUBILIA, L'allocation d'int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la jurisprudence internationale, Lausanne 1972, 124; the translation is by MANN.\n\n120.\n\nThe reservations against compound interest nevertheless persisted. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, for instance, consistently awarded only simple interest. Relying on the above quoted study of WHITEMAN, one chamber of that tribunal assumed in 1986 an \"*international rule*\" according to which, in the absence of a clear contrary agreement, compound interest was excluded.49\n\nR.J- Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. Iran, Award No 145-33-3 of 31 July 1984 (Mang\u00e2rd presiding), 7 Iran-US CTR. 181, 192.\n\n121.\n\nShortly thereafter, in 1986, another chamber sounded more flexible:\n\n*Most awards allocate only simple interest, but occasionally compound interest has been awarded*...50\n\nMcCollough & Co, Inc. v. Ministry of Post, Award No 225-89-3 of 22 April 1996 (VIRALLY presiding), 11 Iran-US CTR p. 28 paragraph 96. In a subsequent decision the same chamber interpreted a contractual clause restrictively and excluded compound interest: Anaconda Iran Inc. v. Iran, Award No ITL. 65-167-3 (VIRALLY presiding), 13 Iran-US CTR, 199, 234-235.\n\n122.\n\nThe occasional exception to which this decision makes reference and which is often relied on is the *Aminoil* award, which ordered 7.5% interest and 10% \"level of inflation\", both compounded annually.51 Nevertheless, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, as just mentioned, persisted in awarding only simple interest.\n\nAmerican Independent Oil Co. (Aminoil) v. Government of the State of Kuwait, Award of 24 March 1982 (Paul REUTER (President), Hamed SULTAN and Gerald FITZMAURICE) in 21 ILM (1982), 976. The relevance of this award as an example for compound interest has been questioned by BROWER and SHARPE, in Liber Amicorum Briner), Paris 2005, 155, 160.\n\n123.\n\nThe view of WHITEMAN and the assumption of a rule in international law excluding compound interest had been contradicted forty years ago already by SUBILIA:\n\n*In our view, in the absence of a well-established case law on the subject, one may not exclude a priori the award of compound interest. Therefore, one must examine, in the light of the circumstances of each case and in view of the requirement of the principle of full reparation, whether interest must be capitalised*.\"52\n\nSUBILIA, op. cit. 163-164 ; the original text stated: \"A notre avis, l'absence d'une jurisprudence ferme sur ce point interdit d'exclure a priori l'allocation d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s. Il y a donc lieu d'examiner \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des circonstances de chaque cas si une capitalisation des int\u00e9r\u00eats s'impose au regard des exigences du principe de la r\u00e9paration int\u00e9grale.\"\n\n124.\n\nSince then, this view has gained increasing strength. In the Iran-US Claims Tribunal itself, the majority view was criticised even by some of its members. Judge BROWER, for instance, wrote:\n\n*Compound interest has a rightful place in international arbitration, especially in the context of international commercial arbitration.*53\n\nBROWER and SHARPE, loc. cit, p.160.\n\n125.\n\nIn particular, Judge HOLTZMAN, in a concurring opinion to a subsequent case in 1987, examined the circumstances of the case, considering the facts that the claimant was borrowing money on a compound basis and that the claimant's expert applied compound interest in the damage valuation, and referring to a legal opinion of Dr F.A. MANN. He concluded:\n\n*Modern economic reality, as well as equity, demand the injured parties who have themselves suffered actual compound interest charges be compensated on a compound basis in order to be made whole. International tribunals and respected commentators have come to recognize this principle: it is unfortunate that the Final Award does not.*54\n\nStarrett Housing Corporation et al. v. Iran, Concurring Opinion to Award No 314-24-1, of 14 August 1987, 16 Iran-US CTR. 112, 237, 254.\n\n126.\n\nThe view expressed by Judge HOLTZMANN has gained ground. In the above quoted article of 1988, Dr MANN developed the views expressed in the legal opinion on which Judge HOLTZMANN relied and concluded:\n\n*... it is submitted that, on the basis of compelling evidence, compound interest may be and, in the absence of special circumstance, should be awarded to the claimant as damages by international tribunals*.55\n\nMANN, loc. cit. p. 385.\n\n127.\n\nA decade later, Judge SCHWEBEL concluded:\n\n... *it is plain that the contemporary disposition of international law accords with that found in the national law of States that are commercially advanced, namely, it permits the award of compound interest where the facts of the case support the conclusion that that is appropriate to render just compensation*.56\n\nStephen M SCHWEBEL, Compound Interest in International Law, TDM 5, November 2005.\n\n128.\n\nArbitration practice confirms that compound interest is increasingly recognised as an admissible remedy. Some arbitration rules expressly mention the power of arbitrators to grant compound interest;57 the fact that other rules do not expressly mention this power does not mean that they exclude it.58\n\nWIPO Rules Article 60 (b), AAA International Arbitration Rules, Article 28(4), LCIA International Arbitration Rules, Rule 26.4, Article 27.6 Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). The fact that other rules do not mention such powers may well be due to the different approach in civil law systems, as described above.\n\nIn this sense see e.g. Natasha AFFOLDER, Awarding Compound Interest in International Arbitration, 12, American Review of International Arbitration (2001), 45, 52.\n\n129.\n\nCommercial arbitration awards have granted compound interest by reference to commercial usages, in cases where the creditor showed that its financing obligations included compounding59 or by references to local legislation where \"*the matured interest are added to the sum at the end of each year*\".60\n\nSee for instance ICC Award in Case No 5514 of 1990, Collection of ICC Arbitral Awards 1991 -1995, 459, 463 et seq., comments by Y.D. express scepticism as to a general principle but approve the solution which is based on compensation for loss suffered, 467.\n\nICC Award in Case No 12112 (no date indicated), Collection of ICC Arbitral Awards 2008 - 2011, 179, 210.\n\n130.\n\nIn ICSID arbitration compound interest has been awarded in an increasing number of cases. In the *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* Award of 2000, the tribunal found:\n\n*... while simple interest tends to be awarded more frequently than compound, compound interest certainly is not unknown or excluded in international law. No uniform rule has emerged from the practice in international arbitration as regards the determination of whether compound or simple interest is appropriate in any given case. Rather, the determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgement, taking into account all of the circumstance of the case at hand and especially considerations of fairness....*\n\n*... It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances.*61\n\nCompa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000 (L. Yves FORTIER (President), Elihu LAUTERPACHT and Prosper WEIL), paragraphs 103 and 104.\n\n131.\n\nThis case was followed by a large number of other awards in which compound interest was granted. In their study based on 42 ICSID awards from the period 2000 to 2013, UCHKUNOVA and TEMNIKOV state:\n\n*At the outset, it shall be noted that the previously prevailing practice of awarding only simple interest has been discarded thanks in large part to the work of scholars such as Dr FA Mann, Prof. John Gotanda and Judge Stephen Schwebel.*\n\n[...]\n\n*... following the landmark* Santa Elena v. Costa Rica *case, only ten out of the 42 awards examined have applied simple interest. Of those, the decision to apply simple interest is explained by the applicable law, and in one case, the claimant himself requested simple interest.*62\n\nInna UCHKUNOVA and Oleg TEMNIKOV, A Procrustean Bed: Pre- and Post-award Interest in ICSID Arbitration, 29 ICSID Review (2014), 648-659.\n\n132.\n\nOn the basis of this practice in ICSID arbitration, the Claimant argues that \"*awards of compound interest, as opposed to simple interest, have become the rule rather than the exception*.\"63\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 9.\n\n133.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Respondents rely on a principle according to which \"*compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims*\", adding that the present case concerns \"*a simple contract claim*\".64 In support of this statement the Respondents rely on an award in ICSID proceedings in which the tribunal indeed awarded only simple interest. However, the tribunal in that case did so because the local law prohibited compound interest65 and the applicable BIT specified that the treaty shall not derogate from the laws and regulations of the host State.66 The passage which the Respondents quote as expressing the \"*principle*\" asserted by this award in reality is found in a part of the award which presents the position of the respondent party,67 but is not adopted by the tribunal.\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 12.\n\nDuke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award of 18 August 2008 (Gabrielle KAUFMANN-KOHLER (President), Enrique G\u00d3MEZ-PINZ\u00d3N and Albert Jan VAN DEN BERG), paragraph 457.\n\nIbid, paragraph 473.\n\nIbid, paragraph 432.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondents argue more generally that the ICSID cases in which compound interest was applied concern expropriation cases and that UCHKUNOVA and TEMNIKOV expressly excluded from their study of ICSID awards cases of breach of contract.68 In support for the distinction between expropriation cases and contract cases the Respondents rely on the *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* Award of 2000 quoted above. That award indeed contains the following passage:\n\n*Even though there is a tendency in international jurisprudence to award only simple interest, this is manifested principally in relation to cases of injury or simple breach of contract. The same considerations do not apply to cases relating to the valuation of property or property rights. In case such as the present, compound interest is not excluded where it is warranted by the circumstances of the case.*69\n\nRespondents' Observations, paragraph 11, referring to UCHKUNOVA and TEMNIKOV, 651.\n\nLoc. cit. paragraph 97.\n\n135.\n\nThe *Santa Elena* award does not explain the origin of the distinction between \"*injury or simple breach of contract*\" cases where only simple interest is awarded and \"*valuation of property and property rights*\" where compound interest may be awarded. In particular, it does not explain why the damage suffered as a result of money withheld should be different according to the legal basis on which the money is due.\n\n136.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunals, such a distinction cannot be justified by reference to the ICSID Convention nor by reference to general principles of law. Since it is generally accepted that interest is intended to compensate for the loss of use of money, there is no reason why these costs should be assessed differently when the money is owed in a case of \"*simple breach of contract*\" and not for expropriation. The Tribunals therefore take the numerous cases in which ICSID tribunals have awarded compound interest as confirmation of the conclusion that compound interest is admissible in ICSID Convention arbitration even when the claims made are based on a contract, as in the present case.\n\n137.\n\nThe question therefore is not whether an ICSID tribunal may award compound interest but in what circumstances it may or must do so and at what interval or rest.\n\n**7.2 The circumstances justifying compound interest in the present case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nBased on the principle that interest is intended to compensate a creditor for the loss suffered as a result of the debtor's failure to pay amounts due when they fell due, the Tribunals have accepted that the loss to be compensated may include compound interest and that, therefore, compound interest may be awarded in \"*appropriate circumstances*\"70 or \"*if it is necessary to ensure full reparation*\".71 When examining in which circumstances it is \"appropriate\" to award compound interest and when quantifying such interest one must, therefore, consider primarily the loss which the claimant demonstrates having suffered. This is a question of evidence. Professor MARBOE states:\n\n*In the absence of specific evidence on compounding and the compounding intervals, the acceptance of compound of [* sic *] interest by international investment tribunals is still not to be taken for granted*.72\n\nSanta Elena v. Costa Rica, paragraph 104.\n\nContinental Casualty v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award of 5 September 2008 (Giorgio SACERDOTI (President), V.V. VEEDER and Michell NADER), paragraph 310.\n\nOp. cit, paragraph 6,242.\n\n139.\n\nProfessor BERGER explains it in the following terms:\n\n*Given that the practice of banks varies as to the exact method of compound interest charge, especially if the sum outstanding is calculated on the basis of continued capitalisation of interest with quarterly, half-year or yearly rests, the claimant may not rely on a prima facie rule as to the amount of compound interest but has to provide the tribunal with detailed evidence substantiating his damages caused by the bank's charging compound interest*.73\n\nKlaus Peter BERGER, International Economic Arbitration, Kluwer 1993, 631.\n\n140.\n\nThis position reflects a distinction between statutory interest, legal interest, or *int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires* (on the one hand) and compensatory interest (on the other), recognised in many jurisdictions as well as in ICSID awards. The former are due at a prescribed rate on the sole basis of the delay without the requirement of showing evidence of any damage, while the latter require proof of the loss claimed.74\n\nSee e.g. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest-Africaine de B\u00e9ton Industriel (SOABI), ICSID Case No. ARB 82/1, Award of 25 February 1988 (Aron BROCHES (President), J.C. SCHULSZ and Keba MBAYE), paragraph 636; Herbert SCHONLE, Int\u00e9r\u00eats moratoires, int\u00e9r\u00eats compensatoires et dommages-int\u00e9r'ets de retard en arbitrage international, in DOMINIC\u00c9, PATRY, REYMOND, \u00c9tudes de droit international en l'honneur de Pierre Lalive, Basel 1993, 649; also UNIDROIT Principles Article 7.4.9; MARBOE, op. cit. paragraph 6.52 uses the term \"legal interest\" for interest where the claimant need no prove \"the actual damage caused by the delay\".\n\n141.\n\nSimilarly, tribunals have adopted a \"conservative approach\" in cases where the claimant failed to provide evidence for the calculation.75\n\nMarion Unglaube and Reinhard Unglaube v. Republic of Costa Rica, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/08/1 and ARB/09/20, Award of 16 May 2012 (Judd KESSLER(President), Franklin BERMAN and Bernardo CREMADES), paragraph 319., The passage concerns the rate of interest but the reasoning can be applied equally to compounding.\n\n142.\n\nIn most cases in which ICSID tribunals have awarded compound interest, they have done so without discussing the question whether the party claiming compound interest actually demonstrated having suffered loss in the form of paying compound interest or foregoing an investment opportunity on terms including such interest. Instead, tribunals and scholarly writers discussing the matter have relied on the decisions of other tribunals, concluding that *\"compound interest is the norm in recent expropriation cases under ICSID*\";76 or they have considered more closely financial practice, accepting that, in modern commercial relations, compounding is a commercial reality. In these relations a creditor is adequately compensated for its loss only if it receives compound interest.\n\n*In finance and all commercial transactions, compound interest is the norm. [...] parties dealing at arm's length will always insist that interest be compounded on any outstanding balances for the simple reason that compound interest could have been earned on the money had it been paid*.77\n\nOccidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award of 5 October 2012 (L. Yves FORTIER (President), David A.R. WILLIAMS and Brigitte STERN), paragraph 840.\n\nJeffrey M. COL\u00d3N and Michael S. KNOLL, prejudgment Interest in International Arbitration, Transnational Dispute Management, vo. 4, Issue 6 (November 2007), 9.\n\n143.\n\nThe position has been adopted by ICSID tribunals. One such tribunal, for instance, stated:\n\n*... it is universal practice of banks and other loan providers in the world market to provide monies at a cost amounting to or equivalent to compound rates of interest and not simple interest.*78\n\nGemplus S.A., SLP S.A. Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States and Talsud v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case Nos. ARB (AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4, Award of 16 June 2010 (L. Yves FORTIER (President), Eduardo MAGALL\u00d3N and V.V. VEEDER), paragraphs 16-26.\n\n144.\n\nAs stated by an author who has extensively addressed matters of interest in international arbitration:\n\n*In short, in the modern world of international commerce, almost all financing and investment vehicles involve compound, as opposed to simple, interest. Thus, it is neither logical nor equitable to award a claimant only simple interest when the respondent's failure to perform its obligations in a timely manner caused the claimant either to incur finance charges that included compound interest or to forego opportunities that would have had a compounding effect on its investment.*79\n\nJohn Yukio GOTANDA, Compound Interest in International Disputes, Oxford International Law Forum, at http://ouclf.iuscomp.org/articles/gotanda. At FN 275 with further references.\n\n145.\n\nBased on the experience of the Banking Commission of the International Chamber of Commerce and its members, S\u00c9N\u00c9CHAL contrasted the absence of a \"*real international consensus in international arbitration*\" concerning the choice between simple or compound interest with the reality of the financial world:\n\n*Still, in the finance world, compound interest is the international standard applied in most time value applications. Indeed, the adoption of compound interest reflects the majority of commercial realities, in that a loss of value incurred by a company that is active in normal trading operations implies the loss of use of that value. Not recognising that reality would lead to awarding a windfall to the respondent*.80\n\nThierry J S\u00c9N\u00c9CHAL, Present-day Valuation in International Arbitration: a Conceptual Framework for Awarding Interest, in DE LY and L. L\u00c9VY, Interest, Auxiliary and Alternative Remedies in International Arbitration, Paris (ICC Publication No 684), 219, 230.\n\n146.\n\nOne ICSID tribunal expressed this conclusion as follows:\n\n*The time value of money in free market economies is measured in compound interest; simple interest cannot be relied upon to produce full reparation for a claimant's loss occasioned by delay in payment*.81\n\nContinental Casualty v. Argentina, paragraph 309.\n\n147.\n\nIn the light of these and other concurring statements about international commercial practice,82 the Tribunals accept that compounding is a commercial reality firmly established in international commercial relations and therefore presumed to be a regular element of damages when money owed is withheld. Consequently, the Tribunals are of the view that in international commercial relations a claim for compound interest does not require any specific evidence.\n\nE.g. AFFOLDER, loc. cit. 91.\n\n148.\n\nSome ICSID tribunals have reached this conclusion by accepting that \"*compound interest reflects economic reality*\" as an inherent general rule of the time value of money rather than by insisting that the specific incidence of this reality be demonstrated in each case.83 On this basis and referring to the writings of MANN and SCHWEBEL, to the *Santa Elena* award and other legal materials, the tribunal in the *Oko Pankki v. Estonia* case, concluded:\n\n*This discretionary approach to the award of compound interest under international law may now represent a form of* jurisprudence constante *in ICSID awards*.84\n\nOKO Pankki Oyj and others v. Republic of Estonia, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6, Award of 19 November 2007 (Otto L.O. DE WITT WIJNEN (President), L. Yves FORTIER and V.V. VEEDER), paragraph 345.\n\nIbid. paragraph 349.\n\n149.\n\nThe tribunal in *Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico* stated in even firmer terms:\n\n*In the Tribunal's opinion, there is now a form of*\"jurisprudence constante *\"where the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest, rather than vice-versa*.85\n\nGemplus and Talsud v. Mexico, paragraphs 16-26.\n\n150.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunals consider that they should recognise this ordinary commercial reality by making provision for compound interest. The question that remains to be considered is that of the most appropriate interval to be ordered.\n\n**7.3 The interval or rest**\n----------------------------\n\n151.\n\nWhile commercial practice is firmly established with respect to the principle of compounding, the intervals (or rests) for compounding vary considerably. This has been observed by learned writers and by ICSID tribunals:\n\n*There are no general rules regarding the compounding intervals*.86\n\nOccidental Petroleum v. Ecuador, paragraph 843.\n\n152.\n\nS\u00c9N\u00c9CHAL describes the practice:\n\n*There are no prescribed standards for choosing one particular compounding period over another (annually, quarterly, monthly or daily are the most common options). The compounding period usually depends on the financial products chosen by the client*.\n\n\u2026\n\n*On the conservative side, we suggest using the yearly approach. Furthermore, the yearly compounding period is implicit in using average annual returns on the market.*87\n\nLoc. cit. 231, 233.\n\n153.\n\nIntervals may be annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly or even shorter. In the practice of international arbitral tribunals, including ICSID tribunals, various intervals have been applied. In many cases arbitral tribunal have chosen an interval without providing an explanation.88\n\nThe Tribunal in Gemplus and Talsud v. Mexico, at paragraphs 16-26 simply stated \"As to rest-periods, the Tribunal is content to accept the Claimants' submission that these should be yearly rests.\" The Tribunal in Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/09/1, Award of 22 September 2014 (Piero BERNARDINI (President), Pierre Marie DUPUY and David A.R. WILLIAMS), awarded interest compounded annually; it justified why it awarded compound interest but did not explain why it chose annual compounding (paragraph 854). In Micula v. Romania the Claimant sought interest compounded quarterly; the Tribunal gave reasons why compound interest had to be awarded but did not discuss the interval. It simply found the request for interest compounded quarterly to be \"reasonable\"; paragraph 1271. Significantly, the tribunal in the OKI Pankki v. Estonia case discussed in some detail the justification of compound interest (paragraphs 343 - 357), but then decides on annual compounding without giving reasons for the choice of the interval (paragraph 357). The tribunal in the ICSID case of SAIPEM S.p.A v. People's Republic of Bangladesh (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), awarded simple interest because that had been the decision in the underlying ICC award. UCHKUNOVA and TEMNIKOV mention four ICSID tribunals having awarded shorter compounding intervals for post award interest of which only one provided reasons for the choice of the interval; those reasons consisted in observing that current LIBOR interests rates were very low (p. 665).\n\n154.\n\nLegal writers provide some guidance. MANN points out the considerable variations in the choice of the interval and suggested that \"*in a specific case it may be necessary to investigate local practices*\", adding that \"*a judge who would award quarterly or half-yearly rests would not go far wrong*\".89\n\nCompound interest, loc. cit., 585.\n\n155.\n\nMARBOE refers to the study of the ICC Banking Commission as reported by S\u00c9N\u00c9CHAL and mentions the yearly compounding. She adds as a suggestion, \"*if a certain financial product has been chosen as a reference for setting the interest rate, the compounding interval of this instrument should be used..*.\".90\n\nOp. cit. paragraph 6,224.\n\n156.\n\nSimilarly COL\u00d3N and KNOLL refer to the period over which interest is calculated and conclude: \"*A tribunal should therefore use the same compounding period in computing the award as the reference interest rate*\".91\n\nLoc. cit. p. 18. They refer to a case in which a court in the United States awarded interest on the basis of the U.S. prime rate, which in practice is compounded quarterly, but ordered annual compounding.\n\n157.\n\nA different approach was chosen by the tribunal in the ICSID case of *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador* : the tribunal decided on an annual interval; it did so by reference not to the specific costs incurred by the claimant but in consideration of \"*recent trends in investment arbitration*\" and \"*the large amount of the Award and the number of years that have passed since the violation*\".92\n\nParagraph 845.\n\n158.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant seeks monthly compounding; but does not adduce any evidence that could assist the Tribunals in deciding that compounding should be in monthly intervals rather than in any other intervals. Given the variety of intervals which occur in practice, the Tribunals are not in a position to accept that any specific interval of compounding is so firmly established that it can be taken as commercial practice which does not require further demonstration.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant has not shown that its costs, incurred specifically or shown to be current in the market in which it operates, include monthly compounding; or that foregone investments would have enabled it to receive interest compounded in this interval. The Tribunals have no basis for assuming that the Claimant incurred such costs or was preventing from earning interest at that basis. They must therefore make the most conservative assumption and can award compounding only in annual intervals.\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to support its request for monthly compounding by a different line of argument, stating that \"*compounded interest is justified to encourage Petrobangla to comply in a timely fashion with its payment obligation*\" and compounding interest on a monthly basis \"*furthers this result*\".93 Some tribunals have indeed included in the award an element to \"*encourage*\" the award debtor to comply in a timely fashion with its obligations flowing from the award, for instance by increasing the rate for post-award interest and reducing the compounding interval.\n\nClaimant's Clarification, paragraph 18.\n\n161.\n\nThis practice implies that considerations other than the compensation for the Claimant's loss would impact on the decision on the compounding interval. The issue has been considered already above in Section 6. To complete these considerations the following explanations may be added:\n\n*These changes can be explained by the desire of some tribunals to ensure prompt compliance with the award by adding a punitive element to interest and thereby turning the post-award interest from a purely compensatory instrument into a sanction. It is not clear whether international law permits the use of post-award interest to punish the respondent for non-compliance with the award.*94\n\nRIPINSKY and WILLIAMS, loc. cit. 389.\n\n162.\n\nThe practice of adding a punitive element in the decision on interest has been considered by the ICSID tribunal in the case of *EDF v. Argentina* :\n\n*In connection with the terms of compound interest, the change from annual to monthly compounding sought by Claimants and adopted by some tribunals can be explained by the desire of these tribunals to ensure prompt compliance with the award by adding what can be seen as a punitive element, a change that this Tribunal cannot endorse*.95\n\nEDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award of 11 June 2012 (William W. PARK (President), Gabrielle KAUFMANN-KOHLER and Jes\u00fas REM\u00d3N), paragraph 1340.\n\n163.\n\nAs explained above, the Tribunals see no basis in the circumstances of the present case which would empower or entitle them to impose sanctions on a Party for non-compliance with their decision.\n\n164.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant has not established a basis for compounding interest at an interval shorter than annual. In the absence of such evidence, the Tribunals consider that a conservative approach to the requisite interval for compounding is warranted. The Tribunals order that interest must be compounded annually.\n\n**8. COSTS**\n------------\n\n165.\n\nIn its Request the Claimant also sought a decision on cost in terms that would include the awarded costs to be capitalised and subject to compound interest as the remainder of the sum awarded. It requested \"*post-award interest on the total amount awarded to Niko, that is the amount in principal, plus pre-award interest, plus costs*\", specifying its \"*submission that the Tribunals should assess costs at this point of the proceedings, so that the principal amount on which post-decision interest will be due is known*\".96\n\nClaimant's Request, paragraph 23.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunals recognise that it may be indicated in certain circumstances to decide on a party's costs not only in the final award but also at some prior stages of the proceedings. In the present case, the claims and the decisions made by the Tribunals and those still outstanding are interrelated to a point that the Tribunals consider it preferable to defer the cost decision to a later stage.\n\n**9. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n167.\n\nBased on the arguments and evidence before it and in view of the considerations set out above, the Arbitral Tribunals now make the following decision:\n\n(i) Petrobangla shall pay into an escrow account USD 25'312'747 and BDT 139'988'337, plus interest (a) in the amounts of USD 5'932'833 and BDT 49'849'961 and (b) as from 12 September 2014 at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually;\n\n(ii) The escrow account shall be opened by the Claimant at a reputable, internationally operating bank according to standard conditions in international banking practice and providing that funds in the escrow account shall be released only (a) as instructed by the present Arbitral Tribunals or (b) by joint instructions of Niko and Petrobangla;\n\n(iii) Petrobangla shall ensure that the U.S. Dollar amounts paid into the Escrow Account are freely available to Niko without any restrictions if and when payment to Niko is ordered by the present Arbitral Tribunals;\n\n(iv) Until the amounts due as per above (i) have been fully paid to Niko at its free disposition or otherwise released from the Escrow Account, Petrobangla shall continue to pay interest on these amounts at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually. At the end of each year, the Bank shall inform Petrobangla about any interest earned on the Escrow Account during the course of the year. Petrobangla may deduct the interest so earned from its interest payments for the corresponding period. If the interest earned on the amounts in the Escrow Account during a year exceeds the interest due by Petrobangla, the exceeding amount shall remain in the account without any credit to Petrobangla;\n\n(v) If any difficulties occur which prevent the operation of the Escrow Account as intended by the present decision, any Party may address the Tribunals for a ruling as required."}, {"Title": "Third Decision on the Payment Claim", "Type": "Compensation", "Date": "2016-05-26T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Third Decision on the Payment Claim\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY** | |\n| 2005 Injunction | Injunction issued on 12 September 2005 by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, further to Writ Petition no 6911 by BELA against ten respondents, including BAPEX and Niko |\n| 2016 Injunction | Order issued on 12 May 2016 by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, further to Writ Petition N. 5673 of 2016 by Professor M.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Third Decision on the Payment Claim relates to the Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of 27 December 2006 (**GPSA**) concluded between Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (**Petrobangla**) and the Joint Venture between Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Limited (**Niko**) and Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (**BAPEX**). The decision concerns the payment for Niko's share in the price for the gas delivered to Petrobangla pursuant to the GPSA (the **Payment Claim**).\n\n2.\n\nIn the First Decision on the Payment Claim of 11 September 2014, the Tribunals determined that Petrobangla owed Niko USD 25,312,747 plus BDT 139,988,337 as per Niko's invoices for gas delivered from the Feni Field between November 2004 and April 2010, plus interest. During the proceedings a number of issues had been raised by the Parties concerning an injunction before the Courts of Bangladesh, the liability for two blow-outs in the Chattak Field, and possible set-offs. The Tribunals had noted indications that the Parties might be able to resolve these differences amicably, including the placement of the funds in an escrow account and interim arrangement concerning the use of the funds in Bangladesh. Rather than simply ordering payment of the funds, the Tribunals gave to the Parties an opportunity of determining the most effective use of the funds by agreement among themselves. In the First Payment Decision, the Tribunals therefore invited the Parties to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the decision.\n\n3.\n\nSubsequent to this First Decision, the Parties did indeed report to the Tribunals several times indicating that they had conferred with a view to finding such a solution; but no agreement was reached. The Claimant then requested a decision from the Tribunals regarding the implementation of the First Decision on the Payment Claim, proposing several alternatives on which the Respondents were invited to comment, including payment into an escrow account. Despite several extensions of the deadline for such comments, the Respondents did not take any position.\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 August 2015 the newly appointed counsel of the Respondents wrote to the Tribunal, making no proposal concerning the use of the funds or the implementation of the Tribunals' First Payment Claim Decision but requested that a decision on the outstanding funds be made \"*only after all issues regarding Niko's liability are resolved*\". The Tribunals concluded that there were no longer any real chances for an agreement between the Parties about the implementation of the First Decision.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunals therefore issued on 14 September 2015 a decision, entitled Decision on the Implementation of the Decision on the Payment Claim and now referred to as the Second Decision on the Payment Claim. They ordered that the funds owing to Niko be paid into an escrow account and indicated the modalities for this account. The decision concluded by providing the following:\n\n*(v) If any difficulties occur which prevent the operation of the Escrow Account as intended by the present decision, any Party may address the Tribunals for a ruling as required.*\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant prepared the documentation for the Escrow Account, consulted the Respondents about the terms of this account, made the modifications in the documentation to take account of the Respondents' observations and signed the documentation. The Tribunals approved the documentation. The Respondents confirmed that they were willing to implement the Escrow Agreement but stated that, before they could do so, they had to obtain a modification of the injunction which had been issued in 2005 by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (the **2005 Injunction**).\n\n7.\n\nThereupon the Claimant requested on 15 December 2015 that the Tribunals issue an award ordering payment by Petrobangla of the amount which the Tribunals had found to be due to Niko.\n\n8.\n\nIn response, the Respondents explained that on 6 January 2016 they had applied for the modification of the 2005 Injunction and that it would take some three months for the court to decide.\n\n9.\n\nAt the expiration of this period, no information about the status of the 2005 Injunction and the related proceedings was provided. Instead, the Respondents submitted on 25 March 2016 documentation on which they rely to demonstrate that the Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and Niko (the **JVA**) and the GPSA were procured by corruption and are void or voidable and declared that they avoided these agreements. In response to the Tribunals' invitation the Parties provided explanations on 29 April 2016. The Respondents argued that Petrobangla did not owe anything under the GPSA; if Niko made a claim for unjust enrichment, they would have to compensate for the value of the gas; but this value could not be more than the price agreed under the GPSA.\n\n10.\n\nOn 12 May 2016 the Respondents submitted to the Tribunals an injunction of the same date by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court directing the Respondents and the Government of Bangladesh \"*not to give any kind of benefit*\" and \"*not to make any kind of payment*\" to the Claimant and its mother company (the **2016 Injunction**). On 19 May 2016 the Claimant requested Provisional Measures in relation to this injunction.\n\n11.\n\nThe Payment Claim is part of two arbitration proceedings, introduced on 1 April and 16 June 2010, registered on 27 May and 28 July 2010 as ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18, respectively against the Respondents and the Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh. The Tribunals in these two cases, constituted on 20 December 2010, are composed of Professor Jan Paulsson, Professor Campbell McLachlan and Mr Michael E. Schneider. In the First Session of these two arbitrations, the Parties agreed *inter alia* that the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner, that the Tribunals may issue a single instrument in relation to both cases and that they may deal with the two cases jointly except where circumstances distinct to one case necessitate a separate treatment.\n\n12.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction of 19 August 2013, the Tribunals determined that they did not have jurisdiction over Bangladesh but accepted jurisdiction over the remaining two Respondents. The Tribunals then proceeded to the examination of the Payment Claim and, after having issued the First Decision on this claim, are examining another claim by which Niko seeks a declaration that it is not liable for the damage caused by two blow-outs that occurred in 2005 in the Chattak Field and, contrary to the claims made against it in the courts of Bangladesh, owes no compensation for the blow-outs (the **Compensation Declaration**). This latter phase of the proceedings is still pending.\n\n**2.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**3.1 Prior Decisions on the Payment Claim**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nA detailed account of the procedural history in the two arbitrations until the Tribunals' Second Decision on the Payment Claim was set forth in the First and Second Decisions on that claim, issued on 11 September 2014 and 14 September 2015, respectively.\n\n25.\n\nIn the First Decision on the Payment Claim, the Tribunals held that:\n\n*(1) Petrobangla owes Niko USD 25'312'747 plus BDT 139'988'337 as per Niko's invoices for gas delivered from November 2004 to April 2010;*\n\n*(2) Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko's invoices at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT; interest is due on the amount of each invoice as from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007 and until it is placed at Niko's unrestricted disposition;*\n\n*(3) The claim for compound interest on the amount awarded under above item (1) and (2) is reserved;*\n\n*(4) The entitlement of BAPEX to payments under the GPSA is not affected by the present decision;*\n\n*(5) The Parties are invited to seek an amicable settlement with respect to the modalities for implementing the [11 September 2014] decision and to report by no later than 30 September 2014;*\n\n*(6) Failing amicable settlement, any Party may seize the Tribunals for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision concerning the outstanding amounts;*\n\n*(7) The decision on costs of the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim is reserved.*\n\n26.\n\nAs explained above, the Parties reported that they did indeed confer further to the Tribunals' invitation but they did not reach agreement. Upon the Claimant's request, the Tribunals then issued on 14 September 2015 the Second Decision on the Payment Claim.\n\n27.\n\nIn the Second Decision on the Payment Claim the Tribunals held:\n\n*(i) Petrobangla shall pay into an escrow account USD 25'312'747 and BDT 139'988'337, plus interest (a) in the amounts of USD 5'932'833 and BDT 49'849'961 and (b) as from 12 September 2014 at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually;*\n\n*(ii) The escrow account shall be opened by the Claimant at a reputable, internationally operating bank according to standard conditions in international banking practice and providing that funds in the escrow account shall be released only (a) as instructed by the present Arbitral Tribunals or (b) by joint instructions of Niko and Petrobangla;*\n\n*(iii) Petrobangla shall ensure that the USD amounts paid into the Escrow Account are freely available to Niko without any restrictions if and when payment to Niko is ordered by the present Arbitral Tribunals;*\n\n*(iv) Until the amounts due as par above (i) have been fully paid to Niko at its free disposition or otherwise released from the Escrow Account, Petrobangla shall continue to pay interest on these amounts at the rate of six month LIBOR + 2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually. At the end of each year, the Bank shall inform Petrobangla about any interest earned on the Escrow Account during the course of the year. Petrobangla may deduct the interest so earned from its interest payments for the corresponding period. If the interest earned on the amounts in the Escrow Account during a year exceeds the interest due by Petrobangla, the exceeding amount shall remain in the account without any credit to Petrobangla;*\n\n*(v) If any difficulties occur which prevent the operation of the Escrow Account as intended by the present decision, any Party may address itself the Tribunals for a ruling as required.*\n\n28.\n\nIn the reasons for their Second Decision on the Payment Claim of 14 September 2015, the Tribunals concluded \"*that there is no justification for Petrobangla to further withhold the funds owed to Niko*\". They considered the different proposals which the Claimant had made, receptive to considerations of preserving \"*the funds for possible payments in the event Niko were liable for damage caused by the blow-outs*.\"\n\n29.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunals granted the Claimant's request, adopting from among the proposals included in its request for relief the one that provided for payment into an Escrow Account. They considered, however, the possibility that \"*difficulties occur which prevent the operation of the Escrow Account as intended by the present decision*\" and, for that eventuality, reserved the possibility for any Party to \"*address itself [to] the Tribunals for a ruling as required*.\"\n\n**3.2 Procedure following the Second Decision on the Payment Claim**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nUpon receipt of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim, Petrobangla confirmed to the Tribunals on 23 September 2015 that it *\"intends to comply with the Tribunals' decision as expeditiously as possible.*\"\n\n31.\n\nBy the same letter, Petrobangla expressed concerns with respect to the injunction that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, had issued on 1 September 2005, and confirmed by order of 17 November 2009 (the **2005 Injunction**5), in the context of the proceedings instituted by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (**BELA**) against the Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko. Petrobangla stated that this injunction remained in force.\n\nThe history of this injunction has been discussed by the Tribunals in their First Decision on the Payment Claim, pp. 53 to 57.\n\n32.\n\nSpecifically, Petrobangla expressed concern that a payment by Petrobangla pursuant to the Tribunals' First Decision on the Payment Claim would be considered \"*a violation of the injunction*\", and that \"*any official who authorizes a payment into the escrow account without seeking a modification of the order would be subjected to contempt of court proceedings and be exposed to a risk of penal sanctions*\". Petrobangla informed the Tribunals that \"*in order to comply with the Tribunals' decision, Petrobangla will seek a modification of the injunction order to permit the payment into the escrow account as directed by the Tribunal[s].*\" It announced that \"*Petrobangla will file its request on 30 October 2015 and inform the Tribunal as soon as it has been filed*\".\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 28 September 2015, the Claimant objected to Petrobangla's understanding that payment made into an escrow account would constitute a violation of the November 2009 order, submitting that \"*Petrobangla's suggested application to a Bangladesh national court can be viewed only as a delaying tactic to avoid payment of the money it has owed for a decade.*\"\n\n34.\n\nBy the same letter, the Claimant requested \"*that the Tribunals rule that Petrobangla is indeed obligated to make the payment ordered by that Decision immediately upon establishment of the escrow account*.\" The Claimant went further on to say that\n\n*Payment to the account of an independent third party who under no circumstances can take instructions from Niko can in no way be seen as '*making any payment to [Niko]*' within the meaning of the BELA injunction. Nor can the ultimate disposition of the escrow funds as contemplated by the* [Second Decision on the Payment Claim Decision] *be seen to contravene the BELA injunction. The Decision orders two alternative conditions to the release of the funds: '* (a) as instructed by the present Arbitral Tribunals or (b) by joint instructions of Niko and Petrobangla' *.*\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunals responded on 10 October 2015, informing the parties that they \"*consider that the matter is sufficiently clear given their rulings in paragraph 167 of the* [Second Decision on the Payment Claim] and confirm that payment is to be made by Petrobangla immediately upon establishment of the Escrow Account\".\n\n36.\n\nBy that time, the Claimant had filed on 8 October 2015 a Draft Escrow Agreement and accompanying documentation, requesting that the Tribunals \"*confirm that the draft escrow agreement secured by Niko meets the requirements*\" of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim. The Tribunals invited the Respondents by their correspondence of 10 October 2015 to file by 16 October 2015 any observations they might have had in regard to the proposed escrow agreement.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondents did indeed file observations in their letter of 16 October 2015, requesting changes in the draft agreement. The Claimant commented on these observations and submitted on 23 October 2015 a revised version of the escrow agreement in which the changes requested by the Respondent had been made. It \"*reiterated its request that the Tribunals decide whether these escrow arrangements accord with the Decision on Implementation*\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunals invited on 23 October 2015 \"*the Respondents' views as to the Claimant's calculations*\" of the amount to be deposited in the escrow account by no later than 27 October 2015. No further comments were received from the Respondents by that date nor thereafter, despite a reminder from the Claimant dated 28 October 2015.\n\n39.\n\nAt the opening of the 2 - 7 November 2015 hearing, the Claimant recalled its request for the Tribunals' confirmation that the draft escrow agreement met the requirements of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim. As recorded in the Summary Minutes of the November 2015 hearing, the Tribunals noted the absence of further comments from the Respondents and \"*that therefore there were no objections to the Tribunals now approving the arrangements as amended by the Claimant following the Respondents' initial observations. These arrangements were thus accepted for implementation*\".6\n\nSummary Minutes of the Hearing of 2 to 7 November 2015, section 7.\n\n40.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunals about the events following this approval as follows:\n\n*On 13 November [2015], Petrobangla and BAPEX communicated to Niko the details (contact information etc.) required for the completion of the Escrow Agreement. On 16 November, Niko circulated a new draft of the USD Escrow Agreement, including the details (contact information, etc.) communicated by Petrobangla and BAPEX. On 18 November* [2015] *, Respondents indicated that they had one editorial change they wished to make to the new draft of the USD Escrow Agreement. Niko consented to the proposed change on 19 November.*\n\n*On 23 November, Niko emailed to Petrobangla and BAPEX a PDF of the counterpart of the USD Escrow Agreement executed by Niko which Niko had delivered to Madison Pacific by courier.*\n\n41.\n\nIn its communication of 1 December 2015 the Claimant requested from the Tribunals an order in the following terms:\n\n*(1) each of Respondents Petrobangla and BAPEX to execute a counterpart of the USD Escrow Agreement that the Tribunals approved at the hearing in early November 2015, to provide Niko with a PDF of such executed document by email, and to transmit the original of such document to Madison Pacific by courier;*\n\n*(2) each of Respondents Petrobangla and BAPEX to provide to Madison Pacific by email the information pertinent to Petrobangla and BAPEX that is required by Madison Pacific's KYC Certification Protocol and by the FATCA Entity Certification; and*\n\n*(3) Petrobangla to proceed to pay the amounts ordered by the Decision on Implementation of the Payment Claim Decision forthwith after the USD Escrow Account is opened.*\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondents requested an opportunity to file observations. The request was granted by the Tribunals. On 10 December 2015, they presented these observations, explaining that\n\n*execution of the Escrow Agreement may be determined by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh to be a violation of its injunction order in Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 (Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) v. Bangladesh and others) against payments in favor of Niko referred to in paragraph 277 of the Tribunals' Decision on the Payment Claim. Respondents' officials would therefore risk contempt of court and criminal proceedings against them in Bangladesh if they execute the Escrow Agreement.*\n\n43.\n\nReferring to their letter of 23 September 2015, the Respondents further explained that Petrobangla had presented a petition to the Supreme Court to review the judgement imposing the 2005 Injunction so as to permit Petrobangla to make the payment ordered by the Tribunal. The petition was attached to the letter. It was dated 10 December 2015.\n\n44.\n\nThereupon the Claimant noted that \"*Petrobangla and BAPEX refuse to sign the Escrow Agreement and, as a result, the Escrow Account cannot be opened, much less operated or funds paid*\". It concluded that a \"*difficulty has occurred that prevents the operation of the Escrow Account as intended*\". Relying on item (v) of paragraph 167 of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim, the Claimant requested on 15 December 2015:\n\n*an award in the Payment Claim ordering Petrobangla unconditionally to make payment to Niko of the amounts the Tribunals found to be due and owed.*\n\n45.\n\nIn its 15 December 2015 application the Claimant also requested that\n\n*the Tribunals fix a prompt schedule for costs submissions in order to place the Tribunals in a position to render a final and unconditional award in the Payment Claim as soon as possible.*\n\n46.\n\nIn support of the application, the Claimant submitted that Petrobangla had not in fact filed a petition for a modification of the November 2009 order, but had filed an \"*application for review of the judgment and order*\" which in the Claimant's estimate would take *\"a minimum of two years, if not more*\" to be decided upon. The Claimant further reiterated its view that \"*the Respondents are not prepared to comply with the Decision*\" and that Petrobangla was \"*attempting to delay indefinitely the date when it makes the payment to Niko*\". The letter concluded the explanations on the escrow arrangements as follows:\n\n*Finally, it bears noting that the link between the Compensation Declaration and the Payment Claim implied by the escrow arrangements ordered by the Tribunals is one that benefits the Respondents only. The Payment Claim debt is independent from Niko's potential liability in the Compensation Declaration. Connecting one to another provides additional security for the Respondents in the event that the Tribunals were to find some liability in the Compensation Declaration. Petrobangla and BAPEX have expressed their disinterest in putting into place the security contemplated. Given that that is the case, there is no reason to wait further before the issuance of a final award in Niko's favour in the Payment Claim.*\n\n47.\n\nFollowing an invitation by the Tribunals, Petrobangla responded to the Claimant's 15 December 2015 application on 6 January 2016, requesting the Tribunals to reject the same. The Respondents confirmed that in their view \"*[t]here is no difficulty preventing operation of the Escrow Account\",* adding that \"*[t]he Respondents have not refused to sign the Escrow Agreement. They simply seek the opportunity to do so in conditions that do not create a risk of their officials being held in contempt of court.*\"\n\n48.\n\nIn the 6 January 2016 observations, the Respondents confirmed Petrobangla's undertaking that it \"*has committed to making payment into the escrow account as soon as the injunction is modified or lifted.*\" With regard to the type of application filed with the Supreme Court, Petrobangla indicated that it \"*chose the procedural mechanism its lawyers recommended as the most effective means of achieving its goal of being able to comply with the Tribunals' order without being subject to contempt of court proceedings in Bangladesh*\", and that \"*based upon Petrobangla's Bangladeshi Supreme Court litigation counsel's extensive experience with the Bangladeshi judicial system, Petrobangla anticipates that the petition for revision of the injunction should be resolved in approximately three months.*\" Petrobangla added that *\"[a]s they have previously committed, upon lifting or modification of the injunction, Respondents will sign the escrow agreement and Petrobangla will pay the amount owed into the escrow account.*\"\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondents joined to their observations a letter from their counsel in the court proceedings dated 5 January 2016 which contained the following passage:\n\n*Based on my experience as a practising Barrister before the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, I anticipate that this petition will be resolved within the next 3 (three) months.*\n\n50.\n\nThe matter was discussed with the parties during the 28 January 2016 pre-hearing telephone conference, during which the Respondents confirmed that they would provide the Tribunals with a status update regarding their application before the Supreme Court.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter of 17 February 2016, the Respondents stated that their petition for a modification of the 2005 Injunction was before the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court awaiting allocation of the bench that will hear that petition.\n\n52.\n\nNo further information was provided to the Tribunals about the Respondents' petition concerning the 2005 Injunction.\n\n53.\n\nOn 25 March 2016 the Respondents submitted, as part of the proceedings on the Compensation Declaration, \"BAPEX Memorial on Damages\". In this Memorial, BAPEX requests a declaration that (i) Niko procured the JVA through corruption, (i) that Niko is not entitled to \"*use the international arbitration system to pursue claims related to the JVA*\", (iii) that the JVA is voidable and BAPEX avoided it. In support of these requests the Respondents produced documentation to demonstrate that JVA and the GPSA were procured by corruption.\n\n54.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondents wrote to the Tribunals and, relying on BAPEX's Memorial on Damages and the documentation produced, sought declarations with respect to the GPSA as BAPEX had requested for the JVA and requested that the Tribunals vacate the First and Second Decisions on the Payment Claim.\n\n55.\n\nOn 18 April 2016 the Tribunals invited the Claimant to comment on the new requests from the Respondents and the Respondents to comment\n\n*on the consequences of the avoidance of the JVA and the GPSA with respect to, in particular, past performance, addressing:*\n\n*(i) with respect to the GPSA the question of payments which Petrobangla may owe, in case of a rescission, for the gas received (explaining whether Petrobangla considers owing no payment at all or payment valued for instance at the price agreed in the GPSA or at its commercial value, taking into account the price at which Petrobangla purchases gas from other suppliers);*\n\n*(ii) with respect to the JVA, whether any credit must be given to investments made by Niko in performance of the agreement and how such credit is to be valued.*\n\n56.\n\nOn 29 April 2016 the Claimant made submissions with respect to both the JVA and GSPA. The Claimant argued that the documents produced with BAPEX's Memorial did not contain any new evidence and that the earlier charges had been considered by Tribunals and rejected. Any avoidance of a contract for corruption had to be made \"*unequivocally and timeously*\". The Claimant argued that \"*Petrobangla offers neither argument nor authority to suggest that the Tribunals' Decision was incorrect - even if that Decision could be reopened, which it cannot*.\" It declared Petrobangla's application as frivolous and that it \"*should summarily be rejected*\".\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondents submitted on 29 April 2016 Revised Conclusions of BAPEX and Submissions for the Memorial on Damages and, in a separate document, replies to the Tribunals' questions. They argued that Niko was barred from seeking any remedy from the Tribunals and that the JVA and the GPSA were null and void; alternatively, they confirmed that *\"BAPEX and Petrobangla exercise their rights to rescind the JVA and the GPSA respectively*\". They argued that Petrobangla did not owe anything under the GPSA; if Niko made a claim for unjust enrichment, they would have to compensate for the value of the gas; but the compensation could not be more than the price agreed under the GPSA.\n\n58.\n\nOn 12 May 2016 the Respondents submitted to the Tribunals an injunction of the same date by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court, directing the Respondents and the Government of Bangladesh \"*not to give any kind of benefit*\" and \"*not to make any kind of payment*\" to the Claimant and its mother company (as indicated above, this is referred to as the 2016 Injunction).\n\n59.\n\nOn 19 May 2016 the Claimant requested Provisional Measures in relation to this injunction\n\n60.\n\nIn the present decision the Tribunals will address the Claimant's request of 15 December 2015, concerning an award on the Payment Claim and those aspects of subsequent applications which have a bearing on the requested decision. Other pending issues will be addressed by Procedural Order No 13, which the Tribunals intend to issue immediately following the present decision.\n\n**4. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n----------------------------\n\nThe Claimant's requests\n-----------------------\n\n61.\n\nIn its application of 15 December 2015, the Claimant requested \"*that the Tribunals issue an award in the Payment Claim ordering Petrobangla unconditionally to make payment to Niko of the amounts the Tribunals found to be due and owed*\".7 It also requested that \"*the Tribunals fix a prompt schedule for costs submissions in order to place the Tribunals in a position to render a final and unconditional award the Payment Claim as soon as possible*\".8\n\nApplication of 15 December 2015, p. 1.\n\nIbid. p. 4.\n\n62.\n\nWith respect to the Respondents' applications of 25 March 2016 the Claimant concluded that \"*Petrobangla's application is frivolous and should be summarily be rejected*\".\n\n63.\n\nIn its application of 19 May 2016 the Claimant requested the Tribunals to order provisional measures:\n\n*(a) Declaring that these Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction over the questions of: (i) the validity of the JVA and GPSA as concerns Niko, BAPEX and Petrobangla, and their successors, predecessors, assignors and assignees; (ii) whether Petrobangla must pay Niko for gas delivered under the GPSA; and (iii) whether Niko is liable to BAPEX or any of its successors, predecessors, assignors and assignees and if so, what compensation is due;*\n\n*(b) Ordering BAPEX and Petrobangla to consent to the removal of the interim injunction in Writ Petition No. 5673 before the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, and to take all measures to request and support the removal or discontinuance of such interim injunction and dismissal of the Writ Petition.*\n\nThe Respondents' requests\n-------------------------\n\n64.\n\nConcerning the Claimant's application of 15 December 2015, the Respondents requested on 6 January 2016 that \"*the Tribunals reject Claimant's application and maintain the [Second Decision] on the Payment Claim in place while the petition for review of the injunction from the Supreme Court of Bangladesh is under consideration*\".\n\n65.\n\nIn their application of 25 March 2016 the Respondents requested on behalf of Petrobangla that\n\n*the Tribunal[s] find that the GPSA was procured by corruption and is thus voidable. It further informs the Tribunal of its decision to rescind the GPSA.*\n\n[...]\n\n*the Tribunal[s] vacate [their] Decision on the Payment Claim of 11 September 2014 as well as [their] Decision on Implementation of that prior decision, and enter an award dismissing Niko's claims. Petrobangla further requests that the Tribunal order Niko to bear all the costs of these proceedings and reimburse Petrobangla for all its legal fees and expenses.*\n\n66.\n\nIn their submission of 29 April 2016 the Respondents submitted that\n\n*Niko is not entitled to any payment or credit for past performance. As a result of Niko's corruption, the Tribunal should reject all of Niko's claims and any attempt by Niko to have the Tribunal[s] give it a benefit for its corrupt acts. In addition, in accordance with the above, the Respondents wold like to modify their requests to the Tribunal[s]. Respondents first ask that the Tribunal[s] recognise that the JVA and GPSA are void under Bangladesh law and without legal effect. In the alternative, Respondents maintain their request to void the agreements.*\n\n67.\n\nIn its communication of 12 May 2016, transmitting the 2016 Injunction, the Respondents provided information about the injunction but did not make any requests.\n\n**5. THE CLAIMANT'S REQUEST FOR AN AWARD CONCERNING THE PAYMENT CLAIM**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant relies on item (v) of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim and argues that difficulties have occurred which prevent the operation of the Escrow Account as intended by that decision and now requires an award ordering Petrobangla unconditionally to make payment to Niko of the amounts the Tribunals found to be due and owed.\n\n**5.1 The difficulties invoked by the Claimant**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe difficulties on which the Claimant relies consist in the refusal of Petrobangla and BAPEX to sign the Escrow Agreement thus preventing the Escrow Account from being opened.9\n\nApplication of 15 December 2015, p. 2.\n\n70.\n\nThe arrangements for the Escrow Account have been prepared and the required documents have been executed by the Claimant. The Respondents examined these documents and made some observations. These observations were taken into account in the finalisation of the documentation. No further objections were raised by the Respondents.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunals therefore have approved the documentation at the November 2015 Hearing.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondents explained that, following this approval, they\n\n\"*provided all of the information necessary to complete the Escrow Agreement*\".10 On the basis of this information the Escrow Agreement was completed and signed by the Claimant.\n\nLetter of 10 December 2015.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that, given the Parties' complete agreement on its text, the Escrow Agreement could have been executed by both Parties, thus enabling the opening of the Escrow Account and Petrobangla's payment into the account.\n\n74.\n\nBy 15 December 2015 the Escrow Agreement had not been executed by the Respondents and there is no information that, since then, over five months later, any change occurred in this situation.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that, indeed, difficulties did occur, preventing the Escrow Account to operate. The Claimant, therefore, is justified in addressing the Tribunals, as envisaged in the Second Decision on the Payment Claim.\n\n**5.2 The Respondents' defence: the 2005 Injunction**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn their letter of 10 December 2015, the Respondents explained that they were advised by their Bangladesh counsel \"*that execution of the Escrow Agreement may be determined by the Supreme Court to be a violation*\" of the 2005 Injunction. They stated that Petrobangla sought a modification of the Injunction by a petition, dated 10 December 2015. The application was attached.\n\n77.\n\nIn the First Decision on the Payment Claim, the Tribunals considered the history of the 2005 Injunction and its relevance for the present ICSID arbitration. They stated in particular;\n\n*... Petrobangla and BAPEX, exercising rights and powers of the Government as described in the Preamble of the JVA and referred to in the GPSA, have agreed in the GPSA to submit all disputes with Niko to ICSID arbitration.* [\u2026]\n\n*286. The jurisdiction of the present Tribunal* [recte: Tribunals] *is exclusive with respect to the merits of the disputes validly brought before it. Since the Parties have not availed themselves of the possibility afforded under Rule 39 (6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to request provisional measures from judicial or other authorities, the Tribunal's exclusive jurisdiction also extends to provisional measures.*\n\n*287. By virtue of its ratification, the People's Republic of Bangladesh and all of its organs, including the courts, are bound by the ICSID Convention and must give effect to awards rendered in ICSID arbitration.*\n\n78.\n\nIt follows from the exclusive jurisdiction of these Tribunals, as recalled in the First Decision on the Payment Claim, that an injunction by a court in Bangladesh may not be invoked as justification for a failure to comply with a decision from these Tribunals.\n\n79.\n\nWhen the issue of the 2005 Injunction was raised by the Respondents on 23 September 2015 and the Claimant requested a ruling from the Tribunals holding that the Petrobangla was obligated to make payment into the Escrow Account, the Tribunals confirmed by their letter of 10 October 2015 that \"*payment is to be made by Petrobangla immediately upon establishment of the Escrow Account*\".\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that there is no justification for the Respondents' failure to execute the Escrow Agreement and for Petrobangla to make payment into the Escrow Account.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunals note in passing that throughout the period following the First Decision on the Payment Claim of 11 September 2014 until 10 December 2015 the Respondents do not seem to have taken any steps that would have allowed the courts in Bangladesh to comply with the international obligations of the State.\n\n82.\n\nIn the First Decision the Tribunals also had noted that the 2005 Injunction had been issued before the commencement of these ICSID arbitrations and that, with the commencement of these proceedings, a new situation had arisen with respect to the disputes now subject to ICSID arbitration. They added that they had no reason to believe that the courts of Bangladesh, including the High Court Division having issued the 2005 Injunction, would disregard the international obligations assumed by Bangladesh when adhering to the ICSID Convention.\n\n83.\n\nThe First Decision on the Payment Claim was issued on 11 September 2014. It would therefore have been in the interest of the Respondents to bring this decision to the attention of the Court in Bangladesh. The Respondents failed, however, to bring the decision to the attention to the court having issued the 2005 Injunction for over a year until, by the petition of 10 December 2015, Petrobangla informed the court of the ICSID proceedings and sought a modification. As the Respondents explained later, a\" *petition for revision of the injunction should be resolved in approximately three months*\".11\n\nRespondents' letter of 6 January 2016, confirmed by a letter from the Respondents' counsel in the court proceedings of the same date.\n\n84.\n\nEventually, the Respondents addressed the court in Bangladesh on 10 December 2015, making an application for a modification of the 2005 Injunction; but by now, more than five months have elapsed without any indication whether any modification of the 2005 Injunction will be issued.\n\n85.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt the Tribunals add that the Respondents' failure to apply in timely fashion to the court in Bangladesh and the absence of a modification of the 2015 Injunction are not decisive matters with regard to whether the Respondents have complied with the decisions of the present Tribunals. As stated above, the Respondents have, without justification, failed to execute the Escrow Agreement and make payment into the Escrow Account. They are responsible for the difficulties which arose, preventing the operation of the Escrow Account as intended.\n\n**5.3 The new decision**\n------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunals now must make, further to item (v) of the operative part of the Second Decision on the Payment Claim, \"*a ruling as required*\".\n\n87.\n\nWhen determining the ruling that now must be made, the Tribunals start from their First Decisions on the Payment Claim in which they determined the amounts owed by Petrobangla to Niko and the Second Decision on the Payment Claim in which they concluded \"*that there is no justification for Petrobangla to further withhold the funds owed to Niko*\".12\n\nParagraph 79.\n\n88.\n\nWhen making the Second Decision, the Tribunals considered a proposal by the Claimant \"*to use the funds owed by Petrobangla for operations in the territory of Bangladesh at large, rather than for operations limited to Chattak and Feni*\".13 They also considered arrangements which \"*preserve the funds owed to Niko for possible payments in the event Niko were found liable for damage caused by the blow-outs and the quantum was determined*\".14\n\nParagraph 80\n\nParagraph 81.\n\n89.\n\nIn view of these considerations the Tribunals decided in the Second Decision on the Payment Claim that payment by Petrobangla be made into an escrow account. Thereby they provided for a modality for the payment by Petrobangla by which the right of Niko to receive the payment was restricted by the conditions of the Escrow Account. As Niko pointed out in its request of 15 December 2016, the escrow arrangement \"*benefits the Respondents alone*\".\n\n90.\n\nThese escrow arrangements have been frustrated by the Respondents and by no fault of the Claimant. The objectives considered by the Tribunals when they ordered payment into an Escrow Account cannot be achieved in the manner contemplated. No other arrangement has been proposed which would satisfy these objectives.\n\n91.\n\nThe ruling which is now required must give effect to the principles of the First and Second Decision and adapt the modalities to the situation that has now arisen. Since the Parties were unable to agree on these modalities and since the creation of an Escrow Account has been frustrated by the Respondents, the Tribunals see no other manner of implementing these decisions but by requiring Petrobangla to make direct payment to Niko. It is thus neither possible nor justified to maintain the restriction imposed on the use of the funds by Niko. Unrestricted payment to Niko must thus be ordered.\n\n92.\n\nAt the present state this decision cannot be made in the form of an award since the proceedings in the two arbitrations have not been completed. The Tribunals point out, however, that their decisions, whether in the form of an award or otherwise, must be complied with in good faith by the Parties.\n\n**6. THE RESPONDENTS' CORRUPTION CLAIM**\n----------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunals were about to issue the Third Decision on the Payment Claim as just described, when they received the Respondents' submissions of 25 March 2016. In these submissions, as modified in the submissions of 29 April 2016, the Respondents not only seek avoidance of the JVA and the GPSA but also request that the Tribunals vacate the two decisions on the Payment Claim (the Corruption Claim). The Claimant requests that these applications be rejected.\n\n93.\n\nGiven the gravity of the accusations made by the Respondents, the Tribunals have decided to examine, by their own initiative, the allegations of corruption and to give priority to this examination. In Procedural Order No 13 that will be issued today, the Tribunals give initial directions concerning this examination.\n\n94.\n\nNeither party has requested that, pending this examination, the Respondents' payment obligation be suspended. Since they will direct in Procedural Order No 13 that the proceedings on the Compensation Declaration be suspended, the Tribunals have examined whether a similar effect should be granted with respect to the Payment Claim.\n\n95.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunals found that there is no illegality in the content of the Agreements or in their performance. The Respondents do not allege now that the content or performance of the GPSA were illegal. There is no indication in the material presented now which would suggest any such illegality.\n\n96.\n\nThere is, therefore, no risk that, by requiring Petrobangla to make immediate payment as set out in this decision, the Respondents would be required to perform any illegal act.\n\n97.\n\nRather the question to be considered here is whether the possibility of a finding by the Tribunals that corruption did occur and that the Respondents' claims are justified requires the Tribunals to suspend the Respondents' payment obligation and the present Third Decision on the Payment Claim until the Corruption Claim has been decided.\n\n98.\n\nOn the one hand, the gas for which the Claimant seeks payment has been delivered during the period from November 2004 to December 2006 and still has not been paid for. The Tribunals have decided that the amounts claimed for these deliveries are owed by Petrobangla and that there is no justification for Petrobangla to further withhold the payment. From this perspective there is no justification for now suspending the performance of this payment obligation.\n\n99.\n\nOn the other hand the acts of corruption concern the conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA in 2003 and 2006, respectively. The Tribunals dealt with those aspects which had been raised in the initial phase of the arbitration proceedings in their Decision on Jurisdiction of 19 August 2013. It is difficult to understand why the Respondents raise their claim only now. The Claimant argues that the facts now relied on by the Respondents \"*were either presented to the Tribunals at the jurisdictional phase or could have been so presented if the Respondents had deemed it desirable*.\"15\n\nSubmission of 29 April 2016, p. 2.\n\n100.\n\nAs to the merits of the Corruption Claim and the consequences of the alleged corruption, it is part of the Respondents' claim that, as a consequence of its acts of corruption and the avoidance of the Agreements, the Claimant may not benefit from the agreements and has no contractual claims. They accept, however, that the Claimant may be entitled to payment on other grounds. In their submission of 29 April 2016 the Respondents explained:\n\n*If, as Respondents maintain, the agreements are void, any claim for payment for gas delivered under the GPSA or credit for investment made under the JVA would be limited to restitution for 'unjust enrichment'. The limitation to unjust enrichment is the result under the Bangladesh Contract Act as well as long-standing English jurisprudence. It is axiomatic that a party to a void contract can make no claims pursuant to that contract, and Niko is entitled to no relief under the GPSA or the JVA. Niko can only make a claim for the limited relief of restitution under sections 64 and 65 of the Bangladeshi\" Contract Act.16*\n\nSubmission of 29 April 2016, p. 9.\n\n101.\n\nWhen discussing how to establish the value by which Petrobangla's enrichment is determined, the Respondents refer to the price which Petrobangla agreed to pay under the GPSA, as compared to the prices paid by Petrobangla to other suppliers. The Respondents produced an expert valuation in support of their claim for the loss of gas due to the blow-outs. This valuation determined that during the period from 2004 and 2015 Petrobangla paid to other suppliers of gas between USD 2.31 USD 2.92 per Mcf; the average price over this period is USD 2.69 per Mcf;17 the price agreed under the GPSA was USD 1.75 per Mcf.\n\nReport of Dr Paul R. Carpenter, Brattle Group (24 March 2016) Table 9 at p. 22.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondents argue that their enrichment should be determined not by reference to the price which they agreed to pay to other suppliers but to the price agreed under the GPSA. They explain:\n\n*The best indication of what 'a reasonable person in [Petrobangla's] position would have paid for' Feni gas is the price negotiated between Petrobangla and the Feni joint venture partners. Where parties have agreed in an arm's length transaction on a price, that is the best measure of the market price for the good, particularly where, as here, none of the conditions of the sale would change between the negotiated price and the hypothetical price.18*\n\nSubmission of 29 April 2016, p. 12.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunals are aware that, as the Respondents rightly point out,19 at this stage the Claimant has not made any claim for enrichment; no decision in this respect is required of the Tribunals at this stage. The Tribunals conclude, however, from the Respondents' explanations about possible claims for enrichment that the Respondents will suffer no loss if they now make payment for the gas on the basis of the agreed contract price and later prevail with their Corruption Claim. As they themselves have explained, they will then have to compensate Niko for their enrichment, valued on the basis of the contract price.\n\nSubmission of 29 April 2016, p. 1.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, the Tribunals observe that they had previously sought to put in place, by their First Decision on the Payment Claim, an interim arrangement. The parties failed to agree on the modalities. The interim arrangements ordered by the Tribunals in the Second Decision on the Payment Claim was frustrated by the Respondents. There is no indication that further attempts in setting up an interim arrangement will be more successful.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunals conclude that there is no justification for deferring their Third Decision on the Payment Claim or to suspend its effect until the Corruption Claim has been decided. Petrobangla must pay the outstanding amounts forthwith.\n\n**7. THE 2016 INJUNCTION**\n--------------------------\n\n106.\n\nOn 12 May 2016 the Respondents informed the Tribunals of another injunction issued by a court in Bangladesh concerning, inter alia, payments to be made under the GPSA (as indicated above, this is referred to as the 2016 Injunction).\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunals have explained above that they have exclusive jurisdiction concerning the claims for payment under the GPSA, including interim measures. The injunction is therefore of no effect on the Respondents' payment obligation, as confirmed in the present decision. The State of Bangladesh, including its courts, is bound by its commitment under the ICSID Convention.\n\n108.\n\nIf the Respondents believe that this new injunction causes difficulties, it is for them to overcome these difficulties.\n\n109.\n\nConcerning the Claimant's request for interim measures, the Tribunals have made it clear and confirm, once again, that their jurisdiction is exclusive and that the courts of Bangladesh must respect this exclusive jurisdiction. It is for the Respondents to deal with possible obstacles to their performance under the GPSA.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimant's request therefore would seem to be moot: there is no need for the Tribunals to order the Respondents to take any steps to remove or discontinue an injunction which is of no effect on their obligation to comply with decisions of these Tribunals.\n\n111.\n\nIn the forthcoming Procedural Order the Tribunals, nevertheless, will invite comments from the Respondents and request specific information from them and they will invite the Claimant to examine whether it wishes to amend its Request in light of this Decision and the Procedural Order.\n\n**8. THE TRIBUNALS' DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nBased on the arguments and evidence before it and in view of the considerations set out above, the Arbitral Tribunals now make the following decision:\n\n(1) Petrobangla shall pay to Niko forthwith and free of any restrictions USD 25,312,747 and BDT 139,988,337, plus interest (a) in the amounts of USD 5,932,833 and BDT 49,849,961 and (b) as from 12 September 2014 at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually;\n\n(2) This payment must be made immediately and is not subject to any contrary orders from the Courts in Bangladesh;\n\n(3) In view of the difficulties which have occurred in the past with respect to the payment of the amount owed to the Claimant, the Tribunals remain seized of the matter until final settlement of this payment."}, {"Title": "Decision Pertaining to the Exclusivity of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2016-07-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision Pertaining to the Exclusivity of the Tribunal's Jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY** | |\n| 2005 Injunction | Injunction issued on 12 September 2005 by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, further to Writ Petition No. 6911 by BELA against ten respondents, including BAPEX and Niko |\n| 2016 Injunction | Order issued on 12 May 2016 by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, further to Writ Petition No. 5673 of 2016 by Professor M.

ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18. The Tribunals are requested to decide claims with respect to (i) payments to be made by Petrobangla to Niko under the Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of 27 December 2006 between Petrobangla and the Joint Venture Partners BAPEX and Niko (**the GPSA**), (ii) the liability of Niko for two blow-outs of wells in the Chattak field in 2005 and, if Niko is found to be liable, the quantum of the damage for which Niko is liable, and (iii) the avoidance of the Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and Niko, dated 16 October 2003 (**the JVA**), and the GPSA on the grounds of corruption.\n\n2.\n\nIn several earlier decisions, the Tribunals have described the factual context of the disputes and have addressed a number of issues, in particular\n\nI. The Decision on Jurisdiction of 19 August 2013;\n\nII. The First Decision on the Payment Claim of 11 September 2014;\n\nIII. The Second Decision on the Payment Claim of 15 September 2015; and\n\nIV. The Third Decision on the Payment Claim of 26 May 2016.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunals refer to these decisions for the factual and legal context and limit themselves in the present decision to a brief description of the circumstances specific to the issues to be decided now:\n\n4.\n\nFollowing the blow-outs in 2005 the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh issued an injunction in 2005 which eventually was confirmed by an order of 17 November 2009, restraining Petrobangla from making any payment to Niko (**the 2005 Injunction**). In the meantime, on 27 May 2008, the People's Republic of Bangladesh and Petrobangla initiated proceedings in the Court of the District Judge in Dhaka against several parties, including Niko, claiming compensation for the damage resulting from the blow-outs (**the Money Suit**). On 12 May 2016 the High Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh issued another injunction, directing the Respondents and the Government of Bangladesh \"*not to give any kind of benefit*\" and \"*not to make any kind of payment*\" to Niko and its mother company (**the 2016 Injunction**).\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunals found in their Decision on Jurisdiction that they had jurisdiction both with respect to the payments due by Petrobangla under the GPSA and with respect to the question whether Niko is liable for the two blow-outs under the JVA. This jurisdiction extends to the question whether the GPSA and the JVA are avoided on grounds of corruption.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunals determined in their First Decision on the Payment Claim the amounts due to Niko by Petrobangla for the gas delivered to it and the interest on these payments. In that Decision the Tribunals provided for the Parties to agree terms for the payment of these amounts into an Escrow Account, pending the outcome of the other claims outstanding in the proceedings. In view of Respondent's failure to subscribe to the Escrow Agreement at the agreed terms and make payment into the Escrow Account provided by it, in the Third Decision on the Payment Claim, the Tribunals ordered immediate payment of the outstanding amounts.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunals also had proceeded to examine the issues concerning the liability for the blow-outs and heard evidence and argument on these issues in November 2015 and in February 2016. Before the Tribunals had issued their decision on liability and while the Parties were producing their submissions on the quantum of the resulting damage, BAPEX and Petrobangla served their requests concerning the avoidance of the JVA and the GPSA on grounds of corruption (**the Corruption Claim**). The Tribunals then decided to assign first priority to this claim and suspended the proceedings on liability. The Tribunals gave directions for the proceedings on the Corruption Claim. They nevertheless decided in the Third Decision on the Payment Claim that, in the circumstances, Petrobangla's obligation to make payment for the gas delivered in the amounts previously determined, as it had been determined in the First Decision of 11 September 2014, continued to exist, and ordered immediate payment thereof. The decision was in the following terms:\n\n*1. Petrobangla shall pay to Niko forthwith and free of any restrictions USD 25,312,747 and BDT 139,988,337, plus interest (a) in the amounts of USD 5,932,833 and BDT 49,849,961 and (b) as from 12 September 2014 at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually;*\n\n*2. This payment must be made immediately and is not subject to any contrary orders from the Courts in Bangladesh;*\n\n*3. In view of the difficulties which have occurred in the past with respect to the payment of the amount owed to the Claimant, the Tribunals remain seized of the matter until final settlement of this payment.*\n\n8.\n\nNiko thereafter addressed a request for provisional measures to the Tribunals on 19 May 2016 and amended on 1 June 2016 (**the Request**). In its amended version, the Request seeks the following relief:\n\n*(a) Declaring that these Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction over the questions of: (i) the validity of the JVA and GPSA as concerns Niko, BAPEX and Petrobangla, and their successors, predecessors, assignors and assignees; (ii) whether Niko is liable to BAPEX or any of its successors, predecessors, assignors and assignees and if so, what compensation is due; and (iii) any requests for interim or provisional measures concerning any matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of these Tribunals, including any injunction, stay of payment, attachment or other relief.*\n\n*(b) Ordering BAPEX and Petrobangla to consent to the removal of the interim injunction in Writ Petition No. 5673 before the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, and to take all measures to request and support the removal or discontinuance of such interim injunction and dismissal of the Writ Petition.*\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondents were invited to comment on the Request in its original and amended version and did so on 1 June 2016 and 15 June 2016, respectively. Further submissions were made by the Respondents on 7 and 12 July 2016 and the Claimant on 11 and 13 July 2016. By instructions of 14 July 2016 the Tribunals closed the proceedings relating to the Request.\n\n10.\n\nIt follows from the Parties' submissions that, in order to respond to the Request, the Tribunals have to examine the following issues:\n\n(i) The scope of the Tribunals' jurisdiction with respect to the requests;\n\n(ii) The question whether the relief sought by Niko can be granted in the form of provisional measures and, if not,\n\n(iii) Whether it can be granted\\_in the form of another decision; and\n\n(iv) Whether the Request is justified on its merits.\n\n11.\n\nConcerning the scope of jurisdiction, the Tribunals have taken throughout these proceedings the following consistent position:\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunals have described the process by which the Government of Bangladesh had delegated to Petrobangla and to BAPEX the exercise of its rights and powers in the field of the JVA and the GPSA, as recorded in the Preamble of the JVA and referred to in the GPSA.1 The Tribunals concluded that they did not have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Government. They do, however, have exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of these two agreements, including provisional measures. On the basis of the ICSID Convention, this exclusive jurisdiction *ratione materiae* binds the People's Republic of Bangladesh and all its organs, including the courts.2 The Tribunals have stated expressly that\n\n*... the Tribunals' exclusive jurisdiction also extends to provisional measures*.3\n\nIt follows from this decision that the Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the issues that are validly brought before them.\n\nSee in particular Section 3 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and paragraph 251 of that decision.\n\nFirst Decision on the Payment Claim, in particular paragraphs 285 to 287; and the Third Decision on the Payment Claim, in particular paragraph 77, 78.\n\nThird Decision on the Payment Claim, paragraph 286.\n\n12.\n\nThis finding does not affect the personal jurisdiction of the courts in Bangladesh in other respects. These courts may well receive and determine claims by persons over which the Tribunals do not have jurisdiction and adjudicate such claims. In making their decision involving other parties, the courts of Bangladesh, however, are bound to conform to and implement the decisions rendered by these Tribunals that are within the competence of these Tribunals. This means, for instance, that it is for these Tribunals, and the Tribunals alone, to decide whether the JVA and the GPSA were procured by corruption, whether the blow-outs were caused by Niko's breach of the standards it had to observe under the JVA and the amount of the damage caused by such a breach. When seized by a claim of a party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribunals, a court in Bangladesh may entertain that claim but it must conform in its decision to those of the Tribunals.\n\n13.\n\nIf it were otherwise, the international commitments of the State of Bangladesh, bound by its adherence to the ICSID Convention and its decision to delegate the Chattak and Feni investments to Petrobangla and BAPEX, could be rendered ineffective by the simple expedient of any third parties claiming to be affected in their rights by the actions and occurrences over which the Tribunals have jurisdiction, bringing claims before the courts of Bangladesh and having these courts render decisions which conflict materially with the decisions of the Tribunals operating under the ICSID Convention and thereby also conflicting with Bangladesh's obligations as a party to that Convention. This is particularly striking in a case in which the plaintiff does not seek to vindicate his own rights, but acts by way of a derivative action invoking rights of public bodies which the plaintiff, in his vision of the public interest, prefers to be pursued in national courts rather than before the international tribunal whose jurisdiction have been accepted by those public bodies, including delegation of the State as a signatory to the ICSID Convention.\n\n14.\n\nSuch a conflicting position is indeed now taken by the Respondents when they argue that a court in Bangladesh may order measures in conflict with the decisions of the Tribunals, simply because the application is made by a person not party to the Convention and the Arbitrations. On the basis of this position the Respondents argue that, for instance a payment ordered by these Tribunals under the ICSID Convention could be prevented by the order of a court in Bangladesh simply because the order is made at the request of a person not party to these proceeding.\n\n15.\n\nAccepting this position would subvert the international obligations assumed by Bangladesh by virtue of its decision to become a party to the ICSID Convention. The Tribunals are not prepared to give effect to such a position.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunals have considered Niko's requests from the perspective of the type of decision that is sought by Niko. They have examined in particular the question whether the relief requested can be granted in the form of provisional measures. They have concluded that the relief granted is not provisional but requires a final determination of the issues raised. Therefore, the Tribunals are of the view that the requested relief, while justified in substance, cannot take the form of provisional measures.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunals observe, however, that the Respondents' submissions show a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope and implication of the Tribunals' jurisdiction. In particular, they note the Respondents' statements such as that denying \"*the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction posited by the Claimant that would preclude proceedings instituted by a non-party to the ICSID proceedings*\".4 The position so expressed fails to distinguish between the two aspects of jurisdiction. Exclusive subject matter jurisdiction does not prevent a court in Bangladesh to be seized by a party not party to the ICSID proceedings; it does, however, bind the court in Bangladesh, when deciding the claim of such a party, to conform its decision to that of the ICSID Tribunals in all those matters for which the ICSID Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction.\n\nRespondents' Observations of 15 June 2016, paragraph 4\n\n18.\n\nIt follows from the Respondents' submissions, including the one just quoted, that a further clarification of the jurisdictional issues is required. Given the actions that the Respondents have taken before the courts in Bangladesh and those which they have failed to take before these courts, the Tribunals conclude that the clarification of these matters is a matter of urgency. The urgency results from the conduct of the Respondents and is irrespective of the question whether the injunctions cause immediate financial difficulties to Niko, as asserted by the Claimant in its recent submissions and denied by the Respondents.\n\n19.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunals find it necessary and justified to render the present decision in the form of a Declaratory Decision concerning the jurisdictional issues and an order to the Respondents indicating the action the latter are required to take.\n\n20.\n\nFor the reasons set out above the Tribunals now grant in substance the relief requested but do so in the form not of a provisional measure but in the following decision. The Tribunals:\n\n1. Declare that the Tribunals have sole and exclusive subject matter jurisdiction with respect to all matters which have validly been brought before it, notably\n\n(a) The validity of the JVA and the GSPA, including all questions relating to the avoidance of these agreements on grounds of corruption;\n\n(b) The liability of Niko under the JVA for the blow-outs that occurred in the course of its activity in the Chattak field and the quantum of the damage for which it may be responsible in case such liability were found to exist;\n\n(c) The payment obligations of Petrobangla towards Niko under the GSPA for gas delivered, the jurisdiction for injunctions seeking to prevent such payments and to retract such injunctions;\n\n2. Order BAPEX and Petrobangla\n\n(a) to intervene with all courts and other authorities in Bangladesh that are or may be concerned with issues identified above under (1) to bring to their attention the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunals in respect of these issues and the international obligations of the State of Bangladesh resulting therefrom under the ICSID Convention; and\n\n(b) to take all steps necessary to terminate any proceedings and orders by the courts in Bangladesh which are in conflict with this order."}]}
