Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 1, dated June 29, 2020, the Tribunal established the Procedural Calendar of the arbitration. In this respect, Section 3.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\nNo later than in its Statement of Defense, the Respondent may submit a request that the Tribunal rule on certain matters pertaining to jurisdiction and / or liability in a preliminary phase, setting forth in full the grounds for such request.\n\n2.\n\nOn December 9, 2020, the Respondent submitted a Notice of Intent to Submit Preliminary Objections (the \"**Respondent's Application**\"), whereby it requested that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits and consider the following objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as preliminary questions:\n\n1. One (1) objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty []:\n\na. Objection 1: Assuming all of his allegations of fact as true, Mr. Amorrortu does not possess any rights to either a direct negotiation or to a contract protected under the Treaty;\n\n2. Five (5) jurisdictional objections under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules []:\n\na. Objection 2: Mr. Amorrortu is not a protected investor under the Treaty;\n\nb. Objection 3: Mr. Amorrortu does not have a protected investment under the Treaty;\n\nc. Objection 4: Mr. Amorrortu did not submit a valid waiver;\n\nd. Objection 5: Mr. Amorrortu's claims were not brought within the mandatory period provided in Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty and are thus time-barred; and\n\ne. Objection 6: The alleged measures which allegedly violated the Treaty are not attributable to Peru under international law.\n\n3.\n\nOn December 10, 2020, the Tribunal (i) invited the Claimant's comments on the Respondent's Application; and (ii) ordered the suspension of the deadline for the filing of the Respondent's Statement of Defense due December 21, 2020, as well as all subsequent deadlines set out in the Procedural Calendar.\n\n4.\n\nOn December 22, 2020, the Claimant (i) submitted a Motion for Leave to Amend his Notice of Arbitration \"to provide the purportedly defective waiver that Peru claims Article 10.18.2(b) requires\"; and (ii) requested that the Tribunal adjudicate such motion \"before proceeding with the other jurisdictional objections raised by Peru and the merits of Amorrortu's claims\" (the \"**Claimant's Application**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn January 15, 2021, the Respondent requested the Tribunal \"(1) to reject Claimant's Application, or (2) in the alternative, [to] reserve decision on the Application until it has heard Peru's Article 10.20.4 objections and Rule 23(3) jurisdictional objections, and (3) to proceed with establishing a procedural calendar to hear all of Peru's preliminary objections on a concurrent basis.\"\n\n6.\n\nOn January 17, 2021, the Claimant requested leave to reply to the Respondent's communication of January 15, 2021.\n\n**II. Analysis**\n----------------\n\n7.\n\nAs set out above, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits and consider its six jurisdictional objections as an ensemble in a preliminary phase. The Claimant does not object to have Objection 4 (\"Mr. Amorrortu did not submit a valid waiver\") adjudicated in a preliminary fashion, but requests that the adjudication of the Respondent's remaining jurisdictional objections and the merits of the case be deferred until a later stage.\n\n8.\n\nThe governing rule is Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, which reads:\n\nWithout prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.1.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Objection 1, as described above, is clearly an \"objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made\" for the purposes of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty. As such, the Tribunal does not enjoy discretion to defer consideration of Objection 1 or join it to the merits. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Objection 1 shall be addressed and decided as a preliminary question.\n\n10.\n\nArticle 10.20.4 of the Treaty, however, is \"[w]ithout prejudice to the tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question\". In this regard, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent's remaining jurisdictional objections (numbered 2 through 6) are brought pursuant to Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, under which the Tribunal enjoys discretion to rule on a plea as to its jurisdiction either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. Thus, the question before the Tribunal is whether Objections 2 through 6 should be heard in a preliminary phase together with Objection 1.\n\n11.\n\nIt is undisputed that Objection 4, concerning the Claimant's allegedly defective waiver, is capable of being decided in a preliminary fashion. The Tribunal also recalls that the Claimant has foreshadowned his intention to file an amended notice of arbitration should the Tribunal uphold Objection 4, while the Respondent has already advanced the position that the Claimant's claims are time-barred. In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Objection 4 should be decided as expeditiously as possible. Therefore, the Tribunal decides that Objection 4 shall also be decided as a preliminary question.\n\n12.\n\nObjections 2, 3, 5 and 6 merit a separate analysis. The Tribunal considers that such objections, as pleaded by the Respondent, potentially raise mixed issues of fact and law and would thus require a more fact-intensive inquiry than Objections 1 and 4, which are concerned with discreet legal issues. Deciding Objections 2, 3, 5 and 6 together with Objections 1 and 2 will necessarily create delay, potentially impacting whatever time-limited rights the Claimant may wish to assert in a new proceeding in the event that Objection 4 is upheld. In the Tribunal's view, this consideration outweighs the Respondent's concerns about procedural efficiency. For these reasons, the Tribunal joins Objections 2, 3, 5 and 6 to the merits of the case.\n\n13.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal requests the Parties to confer and attempt to agree on a schedule for submissions on Objections 1 and 4, and to inform the Tribunal of the outcome of their discussions no later than **Monday, February 1, 2021**. The Parties' respective applications are otherwise dismissed."}, {"Title": "Partial Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2022-08-05T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Partial

or \"**Mr. Amorrortu**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by:\n\n**Francisco A. Rodriguez**  \n**Rebeca E. Mosquera**  \n**Gilberto A. Guerrero-Rocca**  \nReed Smith LLP\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Peru (\"**Peru**\" or the \"**Respondent**\" and, together with the Claimant, the \"**Parties**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by:\n\n**Vanessa Rivas Plata Saldarriaga**  \n*Presidenta de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial*  \n*que representa al Estado en Controversias Internacionales de Inversi\u00f3n*  \n**M\u00f3nica Guerrero Acevedo**  \n**V\u00edctor Giancarlo Peralta Miranda**  \n*Secretar\u00eda T\u00e9cnica de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial*  \n*que representa al Estado en Controversias Internacionales de Inversi\u00f3n*\n\n**Kenneth Juan Figueroa**  \n**Ofilio J. Mayorga**  \nFoley Hoag LLP\n\n**B.** **T****he** **D****ispute**\n----------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute concerns the Respondent\u2019s alleged frustration of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations to obtain a contract to perform oil drilling and extraction operations in oil Blocks III and IV of the Talara Basin, in the Province of Talara, Piura Region, Peru. In particular, the Claimant asserts that Peru ignored the rights he acquired directly to negotiate the contracts for Blocks III and IV (\"**Direct Negotiation(s)**), and instead initiated a \"rigged\" public bidding process to favor another company, Grana y Montero S.A.A. (\"**Grana y Montero**\"), based on corrupt motives.1\n\nMemorial, para. 251.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant claims that, through this conduct, the Respondent violated its fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") obligations under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, ratified by Peru in June 2006, signed by the United States on December 14, 2007 and entered into force on February 1, 2009 (the \"**USPTPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\").\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent has advanced one objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty and five jurisdictional objections under Article 23(3) of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as revised in 2013 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").2 By its Decision on Bifurcation, dated January 21, 2021 (the \"**Decision on Bifurcation**\") the Tribunal ordered the bifurcation of the proceedings, such that two of those objections would be decided as preliminary questions: (i) the Respondent\u2019s objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty (\"**Objection 1**\"); and (ii) the Respondent\u2019s objection that Mr. Amorrortu did not submit a valid waiver as required under Article 10.18.2(b) of the Treaty (\"**Objection 4**\").3 In this Partial Award, the Tribunal decides Objections 1 and 4 (together, the \"**Preliminary Objections**\").\n\nNotice of Intent to Submit Preliminary Objections, para. 2.\n\nDecision on Bifurcation, paras. 9, 11.\n\n8.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, Objection 1 is dismissed but, by majority of the Tribunal, Objection 4 is upheld and the claim is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n**C.** **B****ackground**\n-------------------------\n\n9.\n\nMr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim concerns the negotiation, execution and supervision of operating concessions for the exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Talara Basin of Peru. The Respondent has entrusted its authority in this respect to PeruPetro S.A. (\"**PeruPetro**\"), whose corporate purpose is to promote investment in hydrocarbon exploitation activities and negotiate contracts, in accordance with Law No. 26225, PeruPetro Organization and Functions Law,4 and the Unique Arranged Text of the Organic Law on Hydrocarbons.5 PeruPetro S.A. is authorized, in its discretion, to award operating concessions either by Direct Negotiation or public bidding. The Parties agree that a concession block opened up to public bidding is not available for Direct Negotiation.6\n\n**Exhibit CLA-041**, Organization and Functions Law of PeruPetro, S.A., Law No. 26225, August 20, 1993 provides, in relevant part, as follows:  \nORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS LAW OF PERUPETRO S.A.  \nArticle 1. PERUPETRO S.A., is a state entity under the Energy and Mining Sector governed by private law, which operates under the name of PERUPETRO S.A., which will carry out its activities in accordance with the provisions of this Law, its Bylaws and, additionally, the General Law of Companies and other rules of the private regime.  \nArticle 3. The corporate purpose of PERUPETRO S.A. is the following:  \na) Promote investment in Hydrocarbon exploitation and exploration activities.  \nb) Negotiate, execute and supervise in its capacity as Contracting party, by the power conferred by the State by virtue of this Law, the Contracts that it establishes, as well as the technical assessment agreements. (Claimant's translation in **Exhibit CER-001**, First Quiroga Report, para. 88)\n\n**Exhibit Quiroga-2**, Unique Arranged Text of the Organic Law on Hydrocarbons, Approved by Decree No. 042-2005-EM, October 7, 2005 provides, in relevant part, as follows:  \nArticle 6. Created under the corporate name of PERUPETRO S.A., the Private Law State Enterprise of the Energy and Mining Sector, organized as a Public Limited Company according to the General Law of Companies, whose organization and functions will be approved by Law, and its corporate purpose will be the following:  \na) Promote investment in Hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities.  \nb) Negotiate, execute and supervise in its capacity as Contracting party, by the power conferred by the State by virtue of this Law, the Contracts that it establishes, as well as the technical assessment agreements. (Claimant's translation in **Exhibit CER-001**, First Quiroga Report, para. 88)\n\nMemorial, para. 197; Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 29.\n\n*(i) The Investor*\n------------------\n\n10.\n\nMr. Amorrortu is a Peruvian-born citizen who says he fled \"political persecution\"7 to the United States in 2000, was granted asylum in 2011, renounced Peruvian citizenship and was granted permanent US residence in 2005.8 Through various Peruvian corporations, he has been involved since the 1970s in providing maintenance and well services to oil companies operating in the Talara Basin.9 In 1990, his company, Propetsa, was government-certified to undertake oil exploration and exploitation as well as maintenance activities.10\n\nMemorial, para. 50.\n\nMemorial, paras. 47-48.\n\nMemorial, paras. 32-33.\n\nMemorial, para. 37.\n\n*(ii) The Investment*\n---------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Amorrortu formed Baspetrol S.A.C. (\"**Baspetrol**\"), a Peruvian company, to service the oil industry in Talara.11 The investment in Baspetrol, according to the Claimant\u2019s Memorial of September 11, 2020 (the \"**Memorial**\"), falls under the broad definition of \"investment\" pursuant to the USPTPA, which explicitly includes an investment in \"an enterprise.\"12\n\nMemorial, para. 53.\n\nMemorial, para. 19.\n\n12.\n\nMr. Amorrortu also asserts that his \"investment\" includes (independently of his investment in Baspetrol) the bundle of procedural rights he says he acquired as a result of his application for Direct Negotiation for Blocks III and IV. The USPTPA, according to his Memorial, protects \"any rights acquired by Amorrortu under Peruvian law, to wit: the right ... explicitly enumerated in the USPTPA ... to expand his investment [in Baspetrol] through the Direct Negotiation Process for the license contract to operate, maintain, and exploit Blocks III and IV.\"13\n\nMemorial, paras. 19, 21.\n\n13.\n\nHis application for Direct Negotiation was, he says, \"instructed\" by Mr. Luis Enrique Ortigas C\u00faneo (\"**Mr. Ortigas**\"), the President and CEO of PeruPetro as of May 22, 2014 as follows:\n\nDuring the meeting, Ortigas **instructed Amorrortu to prepare a proposal for direct negotiation ...** for the operation of Blocks III and IV. Ortigas further told Amorrortu that the Baspetrol Proposal would be subject to a legal-technical-economic analysis by PeruPetro\u2019 [*sic*] Administration and that it would be discussed by PeruPetro\u2019s Board, which is the process required by PeruPetro\u2019s Rules and Procedures.\n\nAccordingly and **in compliance with Ortigas\u2019 instructions**, Amorrortu sent the Baspetrol Proposal via email to PeruPetro on May 28, 2014. A hard copy of the Proposal was also submitted to PeruPetro at their offices in Lima, Peru. **The Proposal complied with all the requirements as instructed by Ortigas**, including the additional proposal to operate Talara\u2019s Block IV.14\n\nMemorial, paras. 73-74 (emphasis added).\n\n14.\n\nOn the basis of these \"instructions\" from Mr. Ortigas, Mr. Amorrortu contends that he acquired statutory rights to a **process** of Direct Negotiation through Baspetrol for Blocks III and IV. The procedural rights required PeruPetro to negotiate with him in good faith. While Direct Negotiations do not necessarily result in a contract, Mr. Amorrortu alleges that based on PeruPetro\u2019s past practice, a contract is the most likely outcome of good faith negotiations, as stated in his Memorial:\n\nIf Peru had complied with its obligation to protect Amorrortu\u2019s investment, Baspetrol would be operating Blocks III and IV ... There is simply no doubt that the exclusive Direct Negotiation Process to which Amorrortu was entitled, would have culminated with the execution of the contracts to operate Blocks III and IV in favor of Baspetrol.15\n\nMemorial, para. 22.\n\n**PART 2 - PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, the Claimant commenced these arbitral proceedings by serving upon the Respondent a Notice of Arbitration (the \"**Notice of Arbitration**\") pursuant to Chapter 10 of the USPTPA and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Notice of Arbitration was received by the Respondent on February 13, 2020.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 21, 2020, the Respondent filed its Response to the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration (the \"**Response to the Notice of Arbitration**\").\n\n**B.** **C****onstitution of the** **T****ribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn his Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed Prof. Bernard Hanotiau, a Belgian national, as the first arbitrator.\n\n18.\n\nIn its Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby Landau, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as the second arbitrator.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the Parties appointed Hon.

The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.18\n\n**Exhibit CLA-001**, USPTPA Investment Chapter, Article 10.20.4.\n\n57.\n\nThe events described below are drawn from the Parties\u2019 submissions and constitute a recount of the facts that the Parties consider must be assumed as true for the purposes of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty. They do not constitute factual findings of the Tribunal.\n\n58.\n\nThis summary of events is followed by the Parties\u2019 respective positions on Objection 1. As more fully elaborated below, assuming all of the Claimant\u2019s allegations of fact as true, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has no interests protected under the Treaty, meaning that his claims fail as a matter of law.

First, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant did not comply with any of the three preconditions for Direct Negotiation foreseen under Peruvian law, meaning that no Direct Negotiation process was ever commenced. Even assuming that a Direct Negotiation actually started, the Respondent considers that it could not guarantee the conclusion of a contract, while also observing that a mere expectation to obtain a contract is not protected under the Treaty. Similarly, the Respondent maintains that participation in a public tender does not guarantee the conclusion of a contract, noting that the Treaty does not include a general right to be free of corruption. Lastly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claim is not viable as a matter of law because he is not entitled to the damages he seeks, which is sufficient to dismiss his claim under Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA.\n\n**1.** **Preconditions for a Direct Negotiation as a Matter of Peruvian Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent denies that a Direct Negotiation process commences upon submission of a letter of interest, as asserted by the Claimant; rather, three preconditions must be met under Peruvian law before a Direct Negotiation can commence.45\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 38-39.\n\n73.\n\nFirst, the Respondent states that PeruPetro must formally confirm its discretionary decision to engage in a Direct Negotiation46 \"by sending a written communication to the interested company setting forth the commencement date of negotiations and requesting that the interested company designate the representatives who will participate in the negotiation.\"47 According to the Respondent, it is for PeruPetro alone to determine whether an oil block is to be assigned through Direct Negotiation or through a different process.48\n\nThe Respondent notes that, pursuant to Article 11 of the Hydrocarbons Law, PeruPetro has the discretion to select direct negotiation as one of two modalities to enter into hydrocarbon exploitation contracts. *See* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 40, 46; **Exhibit CLA-045**, Organic Hydrocarbons Law No. 26221, August 13, 1993, Article 11.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 40, 48; Reply on Preliminary Objections, fn. 59; **Exhibit RER- 001**, First Vizquerra Report, para. 44.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 47;

Therefore, no Direct Negotiation was ever commenced and neither Baspetrol nor the Claimant acquired a right to such procedure.56\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 46.\n\n78.\n\nFirst, the Respondent asserts that there was never a formal determination by PeruPetro to commence Direct Negotiations as required by law.57 On the contrary, the Respondent states that PeruPetro communicated \"on various occasions and in various ways\" its intention to submit Blocks III and IV to a public tender,58 including, among others, Mr. Ortigas\u2019 communication of August 13 , 20 1 359 and PeruPetro\u2019s directory decision of March 20, 2014.60 The Respondent further indicates that the only formal determination made by PeruPetro with respect to Blocks III and IV was to submit them to a public tender.61\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 49.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 49.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63; **Exhibit C-003**, Directory Agreement No. 034-2014, March 20, 2014\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 49.\n\n79.\n\nIn respect of the Availability Requirement, the Respondent claims that Blocks III and IV were never available for Direct Negotiation. In particular, the Respondent notes that (i) in August 2013, Mr. Ortigas informed the Claimant that they were not available for Direct Negotiation;62 (ii) the Interoil temporary contract extension \"expressly indicated that PeruPetro needed time to organize a public tender;\"63 and (iii) after Ms. Tafur requested a copy of the Baspetrol Proposal, PeruPetro reiterated that the Blocks were subject to a public tender.64\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 34. *See* **Exhibit C-006**, Letter from Luis Ortigas to Bacilio Amorrortu, August 12, 2013.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 34. *See* **Exhibit C-003**, Directory Agreement No. 034-2014, March 20, 2014, p. 1.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 34; **Exhibit C-013**, Letter from PeruPetro, S.A. to Bacilio Amorrortu, August 20, 2014.\n\n80.\n\nWith regard to Mr. Ortigas\u2019 instruction of May 22, 2014, the Respondent contends that it had no effect from a legal point of view, as PeruPetro does not act by virtue of the decisions and instructions of a single official.65 Instead, PeruPetro\u2019s corporate decisions are taken by a vote of the general board of shareholders, which also approves all contracts with PeruPetro.66 The Respondent observes that this was recognized by the Claimant\u2019s legal expert, Mr. Quiroga.67 Lastly, the Respondent submits that, even if Mr. Ortigas\u2019 instruction had estopped Peru from claiming the unavailability of Blocks III and IV, the Claimant would still have to demonstrate that he acquired a right protected by the Treaty, as estoppel cannot create otherwise inexistent rights under international law.68\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62; **Exhibit CLA-041**, Organization and Functions Law of PeruPetro, S.A., Law No. 26225, August 20, 1993, Articles 12, 15.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 62; Transcript (English), 195:25, 196: 1-7.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 66-67; *Vestey Group Ltd v.

It states that a company\u2019s request or proposal for Direct Negotiation does not by itself constitute a request for qualification unless it includes all the documents required in Articles 5 and 6 of the Regulation on Qualification,69 none of which was submitted with the Baspetrol Proposal.70 As a result, the Respondent concludes, the Baspetrol Proposal did not formally trigger the qualification process or the ten-day period established in Article 14 of the Regulation on Qualification.71\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 58;

The Claimant stresses that Baspetrol submitted the Proposal because PeruPetro requested him to do so \"not once, but twice,\"117 when (i) Mr. Ortigas asked Baspetrol, on May 22, 2014, to prepare a proposal for Direct Negotiation; and (ii) when Ms. Tafur requested of a copy of the Baspetrol Proposal in July 2014. Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s allegations, the Claimant submits that Mr. Ortigas had the authority to invite the Claimant to submit a proposal because he, as CEO of PeruPetro, had a power of attorney from Peru \"to manage Peru\u2019s resources and to bind Peru in the management of those resources.\"118\n\nMemorial, paras. 73, 84;

Romania* the tribunal determined that corruption \"is a violation of the [FET] obligation owed to the [c]laimant pursuant to the BIT, as well as a violation of international public policy.\"135 In the Claimant\u2019s view, this is particularly relevant under the Treaty, which devotes an entire chapter to anti-corruption practices and lists the elimination of corruption as one of its goals.136\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 87 (emphasis removed); **Exhibit CLA-004**, *EDF (Services) Limited v.

The Respondent then corruptly steered the award of Blocks III and IV to a competitor, Grana y Montero.149\n\nMemorial, para. 304.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 75.\n\n114.\n\nMr. Amorrortu\u2019s two distinct allegations are summarized at para. 341 of the Memorial:\n\nPeru\u2019s failure to consider and evaluate the Baspetrol Proposal, Peru\u2019s purported rejection of the Proposal [for Direct Negotiations] without any technical, legal basis or justification, **and** Peru\u2019s fabrication of a public bidding plagued with irregularities and corruption to ultimately benefit a hand-picked company (Grana y Montero) by the highest public servants of the government, were decisions taken for purely arbitrary and capricious reasons; and therefore, violate the fair and equitable treatment standard.150\n\nMemorial, para. 341 (emphasis added).\n\n115.\n\nMr. Amorrortu\u2019s claims are most easily explained by a chronology of what he asserts are the key events.\n\n116.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Amorrortu caused Baspetrol to be incorporated expecting to operate oil fields in Peru under contractual rights to operate Block III.151\n\nMemorial, paras. 8, 53; Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 15; Answer on Preliminary Objections, para. 23.\n\n117.\n\nOn **August 8, 2013**, Mr. Amorrortu, as President of Baspetrol, presented to the Chairman of the Board of PeruPetro, Mr. Ortigas, a letter expressing \"the interest of [his] Oil Company Baspetrol, established in the city of Talara, to operate Block III located in the area of Talara, Northwest Peru, for which we estimate a sizeable investment in the production of hydrocarbons.\"152 Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s legal expert, Mr. Quiroga, alleges, and the Respondent denies, that this communication initiated the Direct Negotiation procedure to operate Block III.153\n\n**Exhibit C-031**, Letter from Bacilio Amorrortu to Luis Ortigas, July 31, 2013 (Claimant's translation).\n\n**Exhibit CER-001**, First Quiroga Report, para. 42.\n\n118.\n\nOn **August 12, 2013**, Mr. Ortigas replied that Block III \"is not an area currently available for direct negotiation.\"154 Mr. Amorrrotu says that through 2013 and 2014, \"he made several trips to Talara with his team to coordinate the various projects in which Baspetrol was trying to participate.\"155\n\n**Exhibit C-006**, Letter from Luis Ortigas to Bacilio Amorrortu, August 12, 2013 (Claimant's translation).\n\nMemorial, para. 60. *See* **Exhibit CWS-001**, Witness Statement of Bacilio Amorrortu, para. 68.\n\n119.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Mr. Amorrortu was aware that the original contract to operate Block III was coming to an end and, on **January 16, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu sent an e-mail to PeruPetro expressing his disagreement with PeruPetro\u2019s decision to extend the current contract for Block III and reiterated that he was willing and capable of operating Block III.156\n\n**Exhibit C-007**, E-mail from Bacilio Amorrortu to Maria Angelica Cobena Memorial; Memorial, para. 69.\n\n120.\n\nOn **February 6, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu held a telephone conference with Mr. Ortigas, in which he gave the latter more details about his plan to modernize the oil industry in Talara.157\n\nMemorial, para. 70.\n\n121.\n\nOn **March 20, 2014**, PeruPetro approved, and published notice thereof in *El Peruano* [the official register], a 12-month interim operating contract for Blocks III and IV with another oil company, InterOil.158\n\n**Exhibit C-003**, Directory Agreement No. 034-2014, March 20, 2014; Memorial, para. 71.\n\n122.\n\nOn **March 20, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu, through his company Baspetrol, sent an e-mail to PeruPetro reiterating that Baspetrol was immediately available to operate Block III.159\n\n**Exhibit C-028**, E-mail from Bacilio Amorrortu to Maria Angelica Cobena, March 20, 2014; Memorial, para. 217.\n\n123.\n\nIn **April 2014**, PeruPetro\u2019s Board of Directors made a decision to offer Blocks III and IV by public tender.160\n\nMemorial, fn. 102.\n\n124.\n\nOn **May 22, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu and Mr. Ortigas held a meeting at which, (notwithstanding the April decision of the PeruPetro Board of Directors of which Mr. Ortigas was Chair), Mr. Ortigas as President and CEO of PeruPetro, instructed Mr. Amorrortu to prepare a Direct Negotiation proposal for the operation of Blocks III and IV, advising him that it would be submitted to technical, economic and legal analysis and, subsequently, discussed by the company\u2019s Board of Directors. In this conversation, according to Mr. Amorrortu, Mr. Ortigas \"instructed\" the terms and conditions that the proposal should contain in relation to technical matters, investment, royalties, and any other term that Baspetrol wished to propose.161 The proposal, according to Mr. Amorrortu, was \"instructed\" to be submitted within seven days.162\n\nMemorial, paras. 73-74:  \n73. During the meeting, Ortigas **instructed Amorrortu to prepare a proposal for direct negotiation** \u2026 for the operation of Blocks III and IV. Ortigas further told Amorrortu that the Baspetrol Proposal would be subject to a legal-technical-economic analysis by PeruPetro's Administration and that it would be discussed by PeruPetro's Board, which is the process required by PeruPetro's Rules and Procedures.  \n74. Accordingly and **in compliance with Ortigas' instructions**, Amorrortu sent the Baspetrol Proposal via email to PeruPetro on May 28, 2014. A hard copy of the Proposal was also submitted to PeruPetro at their offices in Lima, Peru. **The Proposal complied with all the requirements as instructed by Ortigas**, including the additional proposal to operate Talara's Block IV (emphasis added).\n\nTranscript (English), 75:19-20.\n\n125.\n\nOn **May 28, 2014**, by e-mail and physical delivery, Mr. Amorrortu submitted to PeruPetro the Baspetrol Proposal, in terms \"instructed\" by Mr. Ortigas,163 expressly stating that:\n\nBaspetrol SAC hereby requests that Perupetro [S.A.] initiate direct negotiations, in order to reach the best Contract Terms, the signing thereof and an orderly and timely transfer of Blocks III and IV from the current operator to Baspetrol S.A.C.164\n\nMemorial, para. 74.\n\n**Exhibit C-010**, Receipt of Baspetrol Proposal Stamped by PeruPetro, May 28, 2014.\n\n126.\n\nThe Baspetrol Proposal was titled and addressed to \"SE\u00d1ORES PERUPETRO S.A.\" Mr. Amorrortu states that the Baspetrol Proposal included, among other matters, (i) \"relevant technical information showcasing Amorrortu\u2019s expertise and Baspetrol\u2019s qualifications to operate Blocks III and IV;\"165 (ii) a guarantee that Baspetrol would engage \"a first-class international technical team;\"166 and (iii) an economic framework which \"contemplated significant and realistic investments in the drilling of new oil wells, in the reactivation of existing oil wells, and allocated 50% of revenue to PeruPetro.\"167 He states that the Baspetrol Proposal met all the requirements, as instructed by Mr. Ortigas, including the additional proposal to operate Block IV.168\n\nMemorial, para. 75; Answer on Preliminary Objections, para. 32. *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 19.\n\nMemorial, para. 76; Answer on Preliminary Objections, para. 33. *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 19.\n\nMemorial, para. 80; Answer on Preliminary Objections, para. 37. *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 19.\n\nMemorial, para. 74.\n\n127.\n\nOn **June 30, 2014**, PeruPetro announced the terms of an International Bidding Process for Blocks III and IV.169\n\n**Exhibit C-036**, PeruPetro Board Agreement No. 071-2014, June 30, 2014.\n\n128.\n\nOn **July 14, 2014**, PeruPetro announced the International Public Tender for the exploitation of Blocks III and IV calling for a Minimum Work Program that included an investment of more than US$ 200,000,000.00.170\n\n**Exhibit C-012**, PeruPetro S.A., Press Release, July 14, 2014.

Ortigas further told Amorrrotu that the Baspetrol Proposal would be subject to a legal-technical-economic analysis by PeruPetro' [*sic*] Administration and that it would be discussed by PeruPetro's Board, which is the process required by PeruPetro's Rules and Procedures.  \nAccordingly and **in compliance with Ortigas' instructions**, Amorrortu sent the Baspetrol Proposal via email to PeruPetro on May 28, 2014. A hard copy of the Proposal was also submitted to PeruPetro at their offices in Lima, Peru. **The Proposal complied with all the requirements as instructed by Ortigas**, including the additional proposal to operate Talara's Block IV. (emphasis added).\n\n129.\n\nOn **July 16, 2014**, Mr. Ortigas advised Mr. Amorrortu that the Board of PeruPetro had rejected Baspetrol\u2019s Proposal for Direct Negotiation of Blocks III and IV in favor of a public tender process.171\n\nMemorial, para. 83.\n\n130.\n\nHowever, also on **July 16, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu was told, he says, by the Chief Administrator of PeruPetro, Ms. Tafur, that the Baspetrol Proposal was never analyzed by PeruPetro\u2019s management, which she oversees.172\n\nMemorial, para. 84.\n\n131.\n\nAlso on **July 16, 2014**, Mr. Amorrortu sent Ms. Tafur a copy of the Baspetrol Proposal of May 28, 2014, and expressed his \"surprise and concern\" that \"our Proposal has not received a formal response from PeruPetro S.A., considering the long time that has elapsed.\"173\n\n**Exhibit C-032**, Letter from Bacilio Amorrortu to Isabel Tafur, July 16, 2014.\n\n132.\n\nOn **August 20, 2014**, Ms. Tafur informed Mr. Amorrortu that \"on July 14, 2014 PeruPetro **initiated** an International Public Tender process to grant license contracts for the exploitation of hydrocarbons in Blocks III and IV, in order for interested companies to participate in said Tenders,\" and cordially invited him \"to participate in these processes in line with the proposal you sent us.\"174 The Baspetrol Proposal was then sent to Ms. Tafur who confirmed receipt.175 As will be seen, the fact the International Public Tender was not \"initiated\" until July 14, 2014 is of significance.\n\n**Exhibit C-013**, Letter from PeruPetro, S.A. to Bacilio Amorrortu, August 20, 2014 (emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit C-010**, Receipt of Baspetrol Proposal stamped by PeruPetro, May 28, 2014.\n\n133.\n\nOn **October 2, 2014**, the bidding rules were changed while the selection process was ongoing176 to enable, according to Mr. Amorrortu, Grana y Montero to qualify as a bidder.177 (On December 12, 2014, a second modification was required because, he says, Grana y Montero still did not qualify as a bidder in the International Bidding Process178 despite the October 2, 2014 amendment.)\n\n**Exhibit C-050**, Memorandum No. CONT-0107-2014, September 12, 2014;

**Exhibit CLA-044**, PeruPetro Procedure GFCN-008, Contracting Through Direct Negotiation, August 13, 2012.\n\nTranscript (English), 117:19-25.\n\nFirst Quiroga Report, para. 110; **Exhibit Quiroga-15**, PeruPetro Procedure GFCN-006, Qualification of Oil Companies, Version 3.0, February 7, 2013.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objection can largely be disposed of on the basis of the evidence of the Respondent\u2019s own legal expert, Mr. Vizquerra, who presented a concise picture of the law and procedures governing Direct Negotiation.\n\n143.\n\nMr. Vizquerra explained that Qualification Procedure 6 is independent from Direct Negotiation Procedure 8,190 but is connected at Step 13 of Direct Negotiation 8*,* which requires a Qualification Certificate to allow the application to proceed further. As Mr. Vizquerra explained at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections:\n\nClearly, that letter of interest does not implement the qualification process of an oil company. In the context of a Direct Negotiation procedure, that **qualification only comes into play when the prior activities have been conducted, activities prior to Step 13 of the Direct Negotiations procedure**.191\n\nTranscript (English), 120:23.\n\nTranscript (English), 118:2-7 (emphasis added).\n\n144.\n\nThe steps to be taken under Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 after the applicant oil company\u2019s expression of interest but prior to \"Step 13,\" when \"Qualification\" of the oil company comes \"into play,\" are set out in Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 and described by Mr. Vizquerra as follows:\n\n(i) it must first be verified that the area is available for Direct Negotiation;192\n\n(ii) second, PeruPetro \"has to determine a minimum program of work in connection with hydrocarbon activities;\"193\n\n(iii) third, prior to Qualification \"coming into play,\" PeruPetro must determine \"the economic, technical, and financial indicators [it is] going to use to evaluate the capacity of the candidates.\"194 (Mr. Amorrortu notes that these indicators track the legal-technical-economic factors referenced in the instruction given by Mr. Ortigas.)195\n\nTranscript (English), 119:10-13. Mr. Vizquerra stated: \"First, when there is an interest, the Company \u2013 rather, the State Company, PeruPetro, has to verify whether the area or Block that is being requested is available for Direct Negotiation.\"\n\nTranscript (English), 119:13-15.\n\nTranscript (English), 119:15-17.\n\nMemorial, para. 73.\n\n145.\n\nMr. Vizquerra explained that the preliminary steps to define the \"available area\" and the \"tentative working program\" must be done **before** the Qualification Process (at Step 13) because \"without that,\" he says, \"one cannot establish the indicators that the Company has to abide by and that will show that it has a legal, technical, economic and financial [capability] to participate in the Direct Negotiations Process.\"196 In other words, PeruPetro cannot decide whether an oil company is \"qualified\" for a contract until the \"indicators that the Company has to abide by\" have been established.\n\nTranscript (English), 122:12-15 (emphasis added). In contrast, Mr. Vizquerra explains:  \nAnd the third case in which a Procedure 6 applies, qualification of an oil company, has to do with a Direct Negotiation Process if and only if PeruPetro has delimited and defined the Block or the available area, the available area that is the subject matter of the expression of interest. Also, the minimum tentative working program has to be established. Without that, one cannot establish the indicators that the Company has to abide by and that will show that it has a legal, technical, economic and financial [capability] to participate in the Direct Negotiation Process.  \nIf the Block is not available, and if the minimum working program has not been determined, then it would be impossible for an oil company to become qualified in the context of Procedure 8. (Transcript (English), 122:5-19)\n\n146.\n\nAfter establishment of the \"indicators,\" according to Mr. Vizquerra, \"Qualification ... comes into play\" at Step 13.\n\n147.\n\nWith this background, it is convenient for the Tribunal to turn to the points in issue.\n\n**2.** **The Legal Experts are Agreed that the Direct Negotiation Procedure is Started by An Applicant\u2019s \"Letter of Interest\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nAs Mr. Vizquerra explains:\n\nAccording to Step 1 [of the Direct Negotiation] Procedure, the procedure starts with the presentation of a letter of interest from the person interested in conducting exploration and exploitation activities, or the exploitation of hydrocarbons within a given surface area.197\n\nTranscript (English), 117:21-25.\n\n149.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is clear that Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s letter of May 28, 2014 expressed \"an interest in conducting exploration and exploitation activities\" within Blocks III and IV.\n\n**3.** **The Respondent's Expert, Mr. Vizquerra, Acknowledged that After Receipt of a \"Letter of Interest\" the Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 Obliged PeruPetro to Take a Number of Administrative Steps**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Direct Negotiation could not proceed until Mr. Amorrortu/Baspetrol was \"qualified\" but, as stated, PeruPetro never took the administrative steps necessary to reach Step 13 where, according to Mr. Vizquerra, \"Qualification only comes into play.\"198\n\nTranscript (English), 118:2-7:  \nClearly, that letter of interest does not implement the qualification process of an oil company. In the context of a Direct Negotiation procedure, that **qualification only comes into play when the prior activities have been conducted, activities prior to Step 13 of the Direct Negotiations Procedure**. (emphasis added)\n\n151.\n\nIn particular, the legal-technical-economic analysis referenced by Mr. Ortigas to Mr. Amorrortu on May 22, 2014 was not carried out because, despite his \"instruction\" to Mr. Amorrortu199 and Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s evidence of his compliance with that instruction, PeruPetro declined to treat the May 28, 2014, letter as a \"letter of interest\" within the scope of Direct Negotiation Procedure and did nothing.\n\nMemorial, para. 73:  \nDuring the meeting, Ortigas **instructed Amorrortu to prepare a proposal for direct negotiation** \u2026 for the operation of Blocks III and IV. Ortigas further told Amorrortu that the Baspetrol Proposal **would be subject to a legal-technical-economic analysis by PeruPetro' [*****sic*****] Administration** and that it would be discussed by PeruPetro's Board, which is the process required by PeruPetro's Rules and Procedures (emphasis added).\n\n152.\n\nMr. Amorrortu contends that this refusal was part of the \"Corrupt Plan.\"\n\n153.\n\nMr. Amorrortu pleads \"the evidence of corruption discovered by this [government] investigation\" confirms that \"Amorrortu\u2019s Direct Negotiation Process was aborted by order of [First Lady] Nadine Heredia because Blocks III and IV had been requested by Grana y Montero.\"200 He says, \"in other words, Peru had no intention to engage in the direct negotiation of Blocks III and IV, because it had already **promised** them to Grana y Montero - a company with an established and consistent corruption profile.\"201\n\nMemorial, para. 148.\n\nMemorial, para. 152 (emphasis in the original).\n\n154.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is unnecessary to address the alleged \"corrupt scheme\" on this preliminary objections application. It is sufficient to conclude that, according to the Direct Negotiation Procedure 8, for which Mr. Amorrortu says he was \"instructed\" by Mr. Ortigas to make application, a number of initial steps were required in response to the \"letter of interest\" (including the \"legal-technical-economic\" analysis referenced by both Mr. Ortigas and Mr. Vizquerra) and none of these steps was taken by PeruPetro.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal is obliged for present purposes to accept Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s factual description of events as correct, and based on those facts, it would be open to the Tribunal to conclude that the refusal of PeruPetro to take these (or any) steps in a procedure which Mr. Amorrortu says PeruPetro through its President instructed him to pursue, constituted a denial of FET in the application of Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 as promised by the President himself, thereby justifying an award in Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s favor. It would be open to the Tribunal to conclude, based on the facts stated by Mr. Amorrortu, that he stood in a different position *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Respondent than other oil companies contemplating application because of the express instruction of Mr. Ortigas to participate in the very process that failed him.\n\n**4.** **In the Circumstances, the Respondent\u2019s Argument that PeruPetro Never Issued a \"Qualification Certificate\" to Mr. Amorrortu or Baspetrol Would Not Prevent an Award in the Claimant\u2019s Favor**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nMr. Vizquerra explains that the \"qualification application has to be accompanied by all of the documents established in the Regulations for the Qualification of Oil Companies. Any communication that contains good intentions or allusions cannot be considered a request for the qualification of an oil company.\"202 For that reason, in his view, Mr. Amorrortu never made a proper application for the Qualification Certificate.203\n\nTranscript (English), 123:4-9.\n\nTranscript (English), 124:24-125:2; 123:14-124:20. Mr. Vizquerra explains that:  \n[T]he qualification process will begin with the presentation of a request from the oil company to PeruPetro, S.A., together with the documents provided for in Article 5 of this Regulation.\" He goes on to explain that \"Article 5 indicates the documents that need to be attached: First, an uncertified copy of the document of incorporation of the oil company; also, there has to be a sworn statement indicating that the oil company is not in bankruptcy, insolvency, or has some kind of impediment to enter into contracts with the State of Peru; the oil company has to attach to the application a sworn statement indicating that it has managerial, professional and specialized staff in the field of hydrocarbons. Also, the Company has to attach the financial statements of the Company for the last three years, showing the economic and financial capabilities. How else it is going to show its condition?  \nAnd last, but not least, it has to show its experience by showing information in connection with the experience it has related to the carrying out of hydrocarbon activities. The experience has to date back three years \u2013 only the last three years \u2026 [a]nd it also has to detail every year's works of exploration, the number and type of wells, oil wells, drilled, what is the production level and the proven crude reserves, natural gas, investments.  \nAlso, the Company has to show PeruPetro the License Agreements, and also the technical evaluation agreements, that it has entered into.  \nAlso, it has to show the activities that it is carrying out in the different areas it is exploiting and the activities carried out in investments and the results, as well as the participation interest that it has in each one of those Blocks and whether it is an operator or not of those Blocks, because the Applicant will have a different qualification if it is an operator or if it is not an operator.\n\n157.\n\nHowever, as Mr. Vizquerra explained earlier, Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 is \"independent\" of Qualification Procedure 6 and the latter does not come \"into play\" until Step 13 of the former - which PeruPetro never reached. In fact, on the evidence, PeruPetro did nothing in response to Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s letter of interest except to acknowledge receipt.\n\n**5.** **The Respondent Contends that PeruPetro\u2019s President, Mr. Ortigas, Did Not Have the Authority to Give the Instructions Alleged by Mr. Amorrortu**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the President had at least the ostensible authority to bind the company. He was the President, the corporation\u2019s most senior officer, and Chairman of the Board of Directors. It would be open to the Tribunal to find that Mr. Ortigas was PeruPetro\u2019s \"directing mind\" and, as such, in a position to bind the company. The Respondent argues that the alleged \"instructions\" were contrary to the regulatory requirements. At this stage, the Tribunal does not have the benefit of Mr. Ortigas\u2019 recollection of what he said or why he said it. On the present record, Mr. Amorrortu was entitled to rely on \"the instructions\" and representations by the President of PeruPetro and did rely on them by submitting a proposal within seven days which Mr. Amorrortu says \"complied with all the requirements as instructed by Ortigas.\"204\n\nMemorial, para. 74.\n\n**6.** **The Respondent Contends that Direct Negotiations Never Actually Began**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent rejects Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s reliance on what the Respondent describes as the \"central facts\" of his meeting with Mr. Ortigas on May 22, 2014, because, according to the Respondent, nothing in Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s allegations indicate that negotiations **were** ever actually commenced, or that meetings were ever held to discuss a possible contract.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that Direct Negotiations never actually commenced. That is Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s complaint. As the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Mr. Vizquerra explained, PeruPetro was required to ask the oil company at a later stage in Direct Negotiation Procedure 8 to appoint its representative for the negotiation \"because these negotiations are to be carried out by specific individuals representing the Companies for the License Agreement.\"205 At that point, Mr. Vizquerra says, PeruPetro will also ask the oil company \"to establish the date of the start of the first meeting, the kickoff meeting\" and, Mr. Vizquerra explains, \"**this is when the Direct Negotiation begins**, and this has to be done within 60 days.\"206\n\nTranscript (English), p. 120:9-13.\n\nTranscript (English), 120:10-13 (emphasis added).\n\n161.\n\nThis comment by Mr. Vizquerra [\"This is when the Direct Negotiation begins\"] reflects his distinction between the \"Direct Negotiation **Process**\" which begins with the first meeting of negotiators and the Direct Negotiation **Procedure** which starts with receipt of the Letter of Interest.\n\n162.\n\nMr. Amorrortu claims an award in his favor based on PeruPetro\u2019s alleged non-compliance with the Direct Negotiation **Procedure**. The fact the Direct Negotiation **Process** never began (to adopt Mr. Vizquerra\u2019s nomenclature) is the essential subject matter of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s complaint.\n\n**7.** **The Respondent Contends that the Facts Alleged by Mr. Amorrortu Concerning the International Public Tender, Even if Established, Do Not Constitute a Claim for Which an Award in his Favor May be Made Under USPTPA Article 10.26**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that allegations are made by Mr. Amorrortu concerning corruption of the public tender. As stated, the Memorial contends that PeruPetro made certain modifications to the bidding rules and requirements which were \"ostensibly neutral\" but actually intended to rig the process in favor of Grana y Montero by disqualifying all other bidders. However, the Respondent argues that conduct related to the public tender is at most an \"ancillary factual allegation\" and should not be construed as a separate and distinct breach of the USPTPA.207\n\nTranscript (English), 26:6-27:7.\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Memorial identifies the appropriate date of valuation for damages as \"the date PeruPetro announced the International Public Bidding Process,\"208 i.e., July 14, 2014, and that this pre-dated any of the alleged irregularities in the International Public Tender. In light of the fact Mr. Amorrortu claims that on July 14, 2014, \"breaches to the USPTPA led to an irreversible and substantial deprivation of the value of Amorrortu\u2019s investment,\"209 the Respondent says, this arbitration is only about the failure of Direct Negotiations, in respect of which Mr. Amorrortu has no case. According to Mr. Amorrortu, the pleading of July 14, 2014, is correct but does not preclude the Respondent\u2019s accountability for subsequent breaches in the International Public Tender.\n\nTranscript (English), 120:14-17.\n\nMemorial, para. 377.\n\n165.\n\nThe onus is on the Respondent to establish as a matter of law that on the facts alleged in Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s attack on the International Public Tender an award could not be made in his favor.\n\n166.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent has failed to meet the USPTPA Article 10.26.4 threshold in this respect.\n\n167.\n\nThe prayer for relief seeks declaratory and substantive relief related generally to \"failure\" to accord Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s investment in Peru FET.210 The prayer for relief is not tied to the \"Direct Negotiation\" claim.\n\nMemorial, paras. 408-412:  \nPrayer for Relief:  \n408. On the basis of the foregoing, without limitation and reserving Amorrortu's rights to supplement these prayers for relief, including without limitation in the light of further action by Peru, Amorrortu respectfully requests that the Tribunal:  \n409. **DECLARE** that Peru has breached Article 10.5 of the USPTPA by failing to accord Amorrortu's investment in Peru fair and equitable treatment; and  \n410. **ORDER** Peru to pay damages to Amorrortu for its breaches of the USPTPA in the amount of USD $96,900,000, plus interest.  \n411. **AWARD** such other relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate; and  \n412. **ORDER** Peru to pay all of the costs, attorneys' fees, and expenses of this arbitration, including \u2026\n\n168.\n\nWhile Mr. Amorrortu certainly puts emphasis in his Memorial on his \"Direct Negotiation\" complaint as the Respondent points out, he wraps this complaint in a more general allegation of corruption which, he says, affected **both** the Direct Negotiation **and** the \"rigged\" International Public Tender as follows:\n\n145. [Peru] cannot seriously dispute that corruption drove the decision to abort Amorrortu\u2019s Direct Negotiation Process for Blocks III and IV, in favor of the rigged International Public Bidding designed to favor Grana y Montero.211\n\ncoupled with the allegations in para. 341 concerning:\n\n[Peru\u2019s] fabrication of a public bidding plagued with irregularities and corruption to ultimately benefit a hand-picked company (Grana y Montero) by the highest public servants of the government, were decisions taken for purely arbitrary and capricious reasons; and therefore, violate the fair and equitable treatment standard.212\n\nMemorial, para. 145.\n\nMemorial, para. 341.\n\n169.\n\nMr. Amorrortu pleads that it is \"inescapable\" that \"Blocks III and IV were part of the package of government contracts that Grana y Montero received in exchange for its multimillion dollar bribes.\"213 His Memorial alleges that \"[t]here is no question that the Public Bidding Process for Blocks III and IV was staged and plagued with corruption to benefit Grana y Montero.\"214\n\nMemorial, para. 149.\n\nMemorial, para. 157.\n\n170.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent has failed to establish that the express invitation of PeruPetro to Mr. Amorrortu by Chief Administrator Ms. Tafur to participate in the International Public Tender could not give rise to rights of procedural fairness on which an award might be made in Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s favor.\n\n171.\n\nThe exclusion of Mr. Amorrortu and other bidders was accomplished, he pleads, by the unlawful modification of the bidding rules at least twice while the selection process was ongoing.215 An initial change on October 2, 2014, was designed to allow Grana y Montero to qualify as a bidder.216 On December 12, 2014, a second modification was required because Grana y Montero did not qualify as a bidder in the International Public Tender.217\n\nMemorial, para. 160.\n\nMemorial, para. 162.\n\nMemorial, paras. 161-162.\n\n172.\n\nMr. Amorrortu contends that the second modification enabled Grana y Montero to exceed the minimum production by improperly allowing it to include production of LGN not linked to Block III, but to the Cryogenic Plant that Grana y Montero has in the district of Parinas. Yet, Mr. Amorrortu says, the International Bid Commission unlawfully declared Grana y Montero\u2019s wrongful calculation to be valid218 because otherwise it would have had to exclude Grana y Montero from the International Public Tender and thereby frustrate the alleged \"corruption scheme.\"\n\nMemorial, para. 162.\n\n173.\n\nGiven the nature of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claims, it follows that the Respondent cannot demonstrate at this stage of the proceedings and as a matter of law that these are not claims for which an award in favor of Mr. Amorrortu may be made under Article 10.26 of the USPTPA.\n\n**8.** **Conclusion with Respect to the Respondent\u2019s Application Under Article 10.26.4 of the USPTPA**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the USPTPA Article 10.26.4 application (Objection 1) is dismissed.\n\n**PART 5** - **OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 10.18.2 OF THE TREATY (OBJECTION 4)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has presented an invalid waiver under USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b), pursuant to which:\n\n[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant\u2019s written waiver, ...\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n176.\n\nFor this reason, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and the Claimant\u2019s claims must be dismissed.\n\n**A. T****he** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s waiver does not comply with the formal and substantive requirements set out in the USPTPA. In the Respondent\u2019s view, such defective waiver cannot be cured by the Claimant, as the submission of a valid waiver is a precondition to the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate and to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n178.\n\nFurther, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s proposition that it is estopped from arguing that it did not consent to arbitration because it failed to reserve its rights to submit jurisdictional objections in its Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement.\n\n**1.** **Formal Requirements**\n------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the waiver provided by the Claimant is invalid as a matter of form because it was incorporated as a paragraph into the Notice of Arbitration and was signed by Claimant\u2019s counsel, instead of filing it as a separate document signed by the Claimant himself.219 Such requirements are enshrined in Article 10.18.2 of the USPTPA, which the Respondent reads as requiring that the waiver must (i) accompany the notice of arbitration as a separate document; and (ii) be signed and submitted by the claimant himself, and not his counsel.220\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 88; Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 80.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 76.\n\n180.\n\nIn respect of the first requirement, the Respondent notes that the USPTPA uses the word \"accompanied,\" which, according to the Respondent, should be understood to mean \"[p]rovide (something) as a complement or addition to something else.\"221 The Respondent recalls that the United States has amended the waiver language in its treaties \"to expressly state that the waiver must accompany the 'notice of arbitration\u2019.\"222 In particular, the Respondent refers to the change from the word \"included\" in the North America Free Trade Agreement (the \"**NAFTA**\"), to the word \"accompany\" in the USPTPA and the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (the \"**CAFTA-DR**\").223 Additionally, the Respondent submits that arbitral tribunals examining similar treaty language have held that \"physically submitting the waiver document accompanying his request for arbitration\" is the only way to preserve the \"*effet utile'\u2019\"* of the treaty\u2019s provisions.224\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 77; **Exhibit R-002**, Lexico, 'Accompany,' *available at* https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/accompany (last accessed February 4, 2021); **Exhibit R-001**, Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition (December 2011), 'Accompany,' Definition 2.a.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 69; **Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

Thus, the decision as to whether the waiver may be cured lies within the discretion of the Respondent.239 Since the Respondent \"did not [and] does not\" consent to such a cure, it requests that the Tribunal dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.240\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 88; **Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

In addition, the Respondent explains that, under Article 10.16.4 of the USPTPA, a claim is deemed submitted when the notice of arbitration and the statement of claim are received by the respondent. The Respondent concludes that, once a claim is deemed to be submitted, claimant is no longer able to cure a jurisdictional defect caused by an improper waiver. *See* Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, January 15, 2021, p. 5. *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 95, fn. 166; Reply on Preliminary Objections, paras. 90, 92.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, paras. 90, 92.

Second, the Respondent characterizes the Claimant\u2019s suggestion that he would not have complied with the Tribunal\u2019s order had he known Peru\u2019s reservation on jurisdiction as \"incredible.\" Finally, the Claimant has failed to show any detriment from having relied on Peru\u2019s conduct.263\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Claimant on the three elements of the doctrine of estoppel. *See* Answer on Preliminary Objections, para. 95; Reply on Preliminary Objections, para. 63.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, para. 63.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **C****laimant****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the formal and substantive requirements that must be fulfilled to submit a valid waiver under USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b). Should his waiver be considered defective, the Claimant considers that he should be granted leave by the Tribunal to cure it.\n\n195.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is estopped from arguing that it did not consent to this arbitration, as it obtained \"significant\" relief from the Tribunal before objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**1.** **Formal Requirements**\n------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 10.18.2(b) of the USPTPA is not supported by the ordinary meaning of its terms or by its object and purpose.264\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 107; **Exhibit RLA-001**, VCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n197.\n\nFirst, the Claimant notes that there is nothing in Article 10.18.2(b) explicitly requiring a waiver to be filed in a separate form signed by the claimant.265 The word \"accompany\" in that provision, the Claimant argues, is better understood as meaning \"to be present or occur at the same time as.\"266 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent \"chooses the definition that bests suits its argument to the prejudice of other\" equally valid definitions.267\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, paras. 106, 109, 111, 112.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 110; **Exhibit R-001**, Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition (December 2011), 'Accompany,' Definition 1.c.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 110.\n\n198.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant considers that none of the decisions in the DR-CAFTA decisions relied upon by the Respondent \"go as far as saying that a physical separate waiver signed by the claimant (and not its counsel) was the exclusive and sole manner to comply with the waiver requirement.\"268\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 113; Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 77.\n\n199.\n\nLastly, the Claimant submits that the object and purpose of Article 10.18.2(b) (\"to avoid duplicative litigation and inconsistent verdicts\") is accomplished irrespective of whether the waiver is in a separate form signed or included in the text of any pleading or signed by the claimant or his representative.269 The Claimant notes that the Respondent has avoided any reference to the object and purpose of the provision.270\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 114.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 114.\n\n**2.** **Substantive Requirements**\n-----------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that neither the ordinary meaning of Article 10.18.2(b) nor its object and purpose supports the Respondent\u2019s interpretation that the USPTPA requires an absolute waiver.271\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 115.\n\n201.\n\nFirst, the Claimant notes that the waiver requirement is triggered after a claim has been submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), which, in turn, provides that \"the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration . a claim that the respondent has breached an obligation.\"272 Thus, the Claimant concludes that \"a claimant that 'may [not] submit a claim to arbitration\u2019 because such a claim is outside of the jurisdiction of the tribunal, does not have to provide such waiver.\"273\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 116; **Exhibit CLA-001**, USPTPA Investment Chapter, Articles 10.18.2(b), 10.16.1(a).\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 117.\n\n202.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s contrary interpretation is not consistent with other provisions of the USPTPA. The Claimant explains that Article 10.18.4 of the USPTPA, the so called \"fork in the road\" provision, expressly \"warns\" the claimant that its election of forum is definite.274 Since USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) contains no such \"warning\", it is consistent with the interpretation that such provision \"does not require the type of forfeiture\" that the Respondent invokes.275\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, paras. 119-120; **Exhibit CLA-001**, USPTPA Investment Chapter, Article 10.18.4(b), (\"For greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim \u2026 to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedures, that election shall be definite, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.\").\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 120.\n\n203.\n\nIn respect of the use of the word \"any\" in USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b), the Claimant maintains, as concluded by the tribunal in *Renco I,* that \"the qualifier 'any\u2019, must be construed in the appropriate statutory context and does not automatically mean all claims.\"276\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 121.\n\n204.\n\nFinally, the Claimant asserts that the object and purpose of the provision is equally accomplished under the Claimant\u2019s interpretation, as a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction would not result in inconsistent verdicts.277\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 124.\n\n**3.** **Whether the Waiver May Be Cured**\n------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal accepts the interpretation of the waiver suggested by the Respondent, the Claimant asserts that there is no reason to reject his Motion for Leave to Amend the Notice of Arbitration, which is still pending.\n\n206.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that the USPTPA explicitly contemplates the possibility of filing an amended notice of arbitration and the UNCITRAL Rules allow for the amendment of the statement of claim.278 The Claimant also recalls that it has filed a declaration complying with the Respondent\u2019s demands together with the aforesaid Motion.279\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, paras. 127-128;

(ii) the Tribunal was then constituted; and (iii) thereafter, the Tribunal, \"using its inherent powers under the Treaty,\" set the date for the filing of the Memorial.283\n\nTranscript (English), 96:23-97:8.\n\nTranscript (English), 97:23-98:4.\n\nTranscript (English), 100:1-4.\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the powers of the Tribunal to set the date of acceptance of Peru\u2019s offer to arbitrate include the power to allow him to supplement or amend the Memorial and, therefore, to amend a purportedly defective waiver.284 The Claimant insists that this differentiates the present case from *Renco I*, where the investor filed the notice of arbitration together with the statement of claim, before the tribunal was even constituted.285\n\nTranscript (English), 100:5-11.\n\nTranscript (English), 99:13-21.\n\n**4.** **Estoppel**\n-------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent is estopped from objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because it obtained relief from this Tribunal without making any objection regarding its consent to arbitrate.286\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 94.\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the doctrine of estoppel requires the presence of three elements: (i) a clear and unequivocal statement or conduct; (ii) reliance on that statement or conduct by one party; and (iii) detriment to the party invoking the estoppel or an advantage to the party who made the statement.287 The Claimant determines that the doctrine of estoppel applies with equal force to a statement or conduct in litigation (judicial estoppel).288 In the Claimant\u2019s view, all three elements are satisfied in this case.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 95;

In particular, the Claimant avers that the Respondent \"availed itself of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal\" by submitting the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement without raising any objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or denying Peru\u2019s arbitral consent.289 The Claimant notes that \"other than a vague reference purportedly reserving the right to argue lack of jurisdiction . in the [Response to the Notice of Arbitration],\" the Respondent never indicated that it had not given its consent to the arbitration.290\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 94; Request for Disclosure of Funding Agreement, para. 8.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 98.\n\n213.\n\nSecond, the Claimant avers that he complied with the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order relying on the Respondent\u2019s \"decision to avail itself of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\" by submitting the disclosure request.291 It is irrelevant, in the Claimant\u2019s view, whether he would have adopted a different course of action if the Respondent \"had objected to its arbitral consent\" before requesting relief from the Tribunal.292 The Claimant notes, however, that he could have requested the Tribunal to adjudicate a hypothetical objection from the Respondent before ruling on its request for relief.293\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 99; Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 40.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 40.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 40.\n\n214.\n\nFinally, the Claimant concludes that the Respondent benefitted from the Claimant\u2019s reliance, as the Respondent has now obtained the name and identity of the Claimant\u2019s third party funder.294\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 99.\n\n**C . The** **P****osition of the** **U****nited** **S****tates of** **A****merica**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe United States recalls that, in the absence of a disputing party\u2019s consent to arbitrate, a tribunal lacks jurisdiction.295 Accordingly, the United States submits, \"provided that a respondent raises jurisdictional or preliminary objections within the timeframes established by the treaty, the applicable rules, the tribunal, or otherwise by agreement of the parties, a respondent is not precluded or estopped from raising such objections solely by virtue of participating in the proceeding or availing itself of the authority of the tribunal.\"296\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 11.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 15.\n\n216.\n\nWith regard to the waiver requirements under USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b), the United States indicates that they are among the requirements upon which the Contracting Parties have conditioned their consent. Thus, the United States considers that a valid waiver is a precondition to the parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate claims and, accordingly, to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.297 The United States avers that the date of submission of an effective waiver is the date on which the claim has been submitted to arbitration for purposes of Article 10.18.1 of the USPTPA.298\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 17.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 18.\n\n217.\n\nThe United States considers that any valid waiver must be in writing and also be \"clear, explicit and categorical.\"299 It must also be \"definit[e] and irrevocabl[e],\" as evidenced from the language requiring the investor to provide a waiver of \"**any** right to initiate or continue before any [forum] **any** proceeding with respect to **any** measure alleged to constitute a breach.\"300 Citing the decision in *Renco I,* the United States concludes that USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) is \"intended to operate as a 'once for all\u2019 renunciation of all rights to initiate claims in a domestic forum, whatever the outcome of the arbitration (whether the claim is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds or on the merits).\"301\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 19.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 19 (emphasis in original).\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 19; **Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 99.\n\n218.\n\nAccording to the United States, if the waiver does not comply with the requirements under USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b), \"the waiver is ineffective and will not engage the respondent State\u2019s consent to arbitration or the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ab initio* under the Agreement.\"302 In the United States\u2019 submission, such compliance should be determined by the tribunal, which, nevertheless, does not have the authority to remedy an ineffective waiver,303 thus agreeing with the Respondent that an invalid waiver can only be remedied with the consent of the respondent State.304\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 24.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 24.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 25.\n\n219.\n\nLastly, citing to customary international law principles of treaty interpretation, as reflected in Article 31(1)(a)-(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT)**\", the United States invites the Tribunal to take into account the United States\u2019 and Peru\u2019s common understanding, as evidenced by their submissions.305\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 25; **Exhibit RLA-001**, VCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n**PART 6 - THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS OF OBJECTION 4 BASED ON NON-COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 10.18.2**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAs noted earlier, USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) provides that:\n\n[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant\u2019s written waiver, ...\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) in accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Article 31 of the VCLT. In particular, the text must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"306\n\n**Exhibit RLA-001**, VCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n**A. The** **F****ormal and** **S****ubstantive** **R****equirements for a** **V****alid** **W****aive****r**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Parties disagree over the formal and substantive requirements for a valid waiver. The Respondent argues that the waiver must: (i) be included in a separate document accompanying the Request for Arbitration; (ii) be signed by the Claimant himself; and (iii) be unqualified and not subject to any condition. The Claimant, for his part, contends that USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b): (i) does not require that the waiver be filed in a separate document and be signed by the Claimant (a signature by the claimant\u2019s counsel should suffice); and (ii) does not require that the waiver be absolute (e.g., given even in instances where claims are outside the treaty tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction).\n\n223.\n\nIn its Submission, the United States interprets Article 10.18.2(b) to require that the waiver be in writing and \"clear, explicit and categorical.\"307 However, the United States does not agree with the Respondent\u2019s interpretation that the waiver must be signed by the Claimant himself and must be included in a separate document.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 74; *see also* **Exhibit CLA-028**, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States II*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, para. 71.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no support in the text of USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) for the Respondent\u2019s position that the waiver must be included in a document separate from the Request for Arbitration and must be signed personally by the Claimant. The use of the word \"accompanied\" is insufficient to support such an interpretation. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the ordinary meaning of the word \"accompanied\" is \"to be present or occur at the same time as.\"308 In any event, the word itself says nothing about the validity of a signature provided by the Claimant\u2019s counsel.\n\n**Exhibit R-001**, Oxford English Dictionary, Third Edition (December 2011), 'Accompany,' Definition 1.c.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal however agrees with the Respondent that USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) requires an unqualified and unconditional waiver, including for instances where the claims may be dismissed by the treaty tribunal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n226.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the language employed in USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) is very broad indeed, requiring a claimant to waive \"**any** right to initiate or continue before **any** administrative tribunal or court under the law of **any** Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, **any** proceeding with respect to **any** measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 (emphasis added).\" The intent of the Contracting Parties to be comprehensive in respect of the scope of the waiver could not be any clearer. There is simply no textual support for the Claimant\u2019s attempt to carve out of USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) claims that may eventually be dismissed by the treaty tribunal for lack of jurisdiction or otherwise (i.e., without deciding on the merits). Such an interpretation would in fact amount to an impermissible rewriting of the text of the USPTPA. A similar argument was heard and dismissed by the *Renco I* tribunal, with whose views on this point this Tribunal also aligns:\n\n79. ... [T]he repeated references to the word 'any\u2019 in Article 10.18 demonstrate that an investor\u2019s waiver must be comprehensive: waivers qualified in any way are impermissible.\n\n80. Renco has purported to qualify its written waiver by reserving its right to bring claims in another forum for resolution on the merits if this Tribunal were to decline to hear any claims on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds.\n\n81. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this qualification is not permitted by the express terms of Article 10.18(2)(b). ...\n\n82. In the considered judgment of this Tribunal, the term 'any proceeding\u2019 in Article 10.18(2)(b) must be interpreted to cover proceedings which are or may be 'initiated or continued\u2019 either:\n\n(a) At the time the notice of arbitration is filed;\n\n(b) During the pendency of the arbitration; and/or\n\n(c) After the arbitration has concluded, whether or not the investor\u2019s claims are dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds or on the merits.\n\n83. The Tribunal considers that this interpretation is clear from the ordinary meaning ofthe words 'any proceeding\u2019 in Article 10.18(2)(b). There is no basis in the text of the Treaty for qualifying the temporal scope of the 'proceeding[s]\u2019 in respect of which a written waiver must be provided, for example by excluding future proceedings which may be 'initiated\u2019 by the investor if the Tribunal were to decide that it lacked jurisdiction or that Renco\u2019s claims were inadmissible.309\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, paras. 79-83.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal further aligns itself with the detailed reasoning of the *Renco I* tribunal with regard to the object and purpose of Article 10.18.2(b), and its \"No U-turn\" structure,310 which explains why the Claimant\u2019s argument that the provision must permit a reservation with regard to claims that are not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is incorrect.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, paras. 84-118.\n\n228.\n\nThe fact that Article 10.18.4 of the USPTPA expressly warns investors, \"[f]or greater certainty\" that, once they submit a claim to a different forum than the treaty tribunal, \"that election shall be definitive\" is not a sufficient argument in support of a different interpretation of USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b). There is absolutely no requirement for international treaties to expressly warn investors of the consequences of their choice of forum. Moreover, the clarification in Article 10.18.4 of the USPTPA is provided \"[f]or greater certainty,\" which implies that, in instances where the text is sufficiently clear, no such clarifications are called for.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b) requires that the Claimant provide an unqualified waiver that is clear, explicit and categorical, but also definitive.\n\n**B.** **H****as the** **C****laimant** **P****rovided a** **V****alid** **W****aiver****?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nMr. Amorrortu provided with his Notice of Arbitration a waiver that was both limited and conditional: \"to the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds,\" Mr. Amorrortu said, \"Claimant reserves the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.\"311\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 88.\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that the Claimant\u2019s waiver is conditional. For this reason, it does not comply with the requirement in USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b).\n\n232.\n\nThe question to be answered next concerns the consequences of submitting an invalid waiver and whether this invalidity may be cured.\n\n**C.** **D****ecision of the** **T****ribunal** **M****ajority** **P****rofessor** **B****ernard** **H****anotiau and** **M****r****.

Indeed, the titles of the waiver provisions in the USPTPA, the DR-CAFTA and the US Model BIT were amended to include the word \"consent\" - a significant point of difference from NAFTA\u2019s Article 1121. The Tribunal by majority finds, similarly to the *Renco I* tribunal,312 that the submission of a compliant waiver is not a condition for the admissibility of claims, but a precondition for the very existence of the State\u2019s consent to arbitrate, and, by way of necessary implication, to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. This is also confirmed by the United States\u2019 position in this arbitration.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 142.\n\n*(i) When Does the USPTPA Require That a Compliant Waiver be Submitted?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe critical question here is one of timing. According to Article 10.18.2 (b) of the USPTPA, \"[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration ... unless ... (b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied ... by the claimant\u2019s written waiver.\" Article 10.16 of the USPTPA, entitled \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration,\" provides in subparagraph 4 that \"[a] claim shall be submitted to arbitration . when the claimant\u2019s notice of or request for arbitration . together with the statement of claim . are received by the respondent.\" The Tribunal by majority recalls that the Notice of Arbitration was filed on February 13, 2020. The Claimant\u2019s Memorial was filed on September 11, 2020. Therefore, in accordance with Article 10.16.4, the claim was deemed submitted to arbitration on September 11, 2020. However, on September 11, 2020, no compliant waiver existed. Only the Claimant\u2019s conditional (and invalid) waiver had been submitted. Since a valid waiver is a pre-condition to consent, as at September 11, 2020, the Respondent\u2019s consent was lacking and no arbitration agreement existed.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimant is now seeking to cure his defective waiver. Significantly, faced with the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection, the Claimant (i) filed an application on December 22, 2020, requesting the Tribunal\u2019s leave to amend his Notice of Arbitration; and (ii) submitted a compliant (i.e*.*, an unqualified) waiver on April 25, 2021. The Respondent expressly refused to give its consent to such a cure and argues that, absent such consent, the Tribunal does not have the power to cure the defective waiver. According to the Respondent, such power is solely within the discretion of a respondent State, since - without a further consent - there is no arbitration agreement. This corresponds to the position of the United States, which argues that if the waiver does not comply with USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b), \"the waiver is ineffective and will not engage the respondent State\u2019s consent to arbitration or the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ab initio* under the Agreement.\"313 Hence the United States also submits that an invalid waiver can only be remedied with the consent of the respondent State.\n\nSubmission of the United States, para. 24.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal by majority agrees with the Respondent. In view of the express and unequivocal language of Article 10.18.2(b) providing that the submission of a valid waiver is a precondition to a State\u2019s consent to arbitration, it follows that, if an invalid or non-compliant waiver is submitted, a State\u2019s offer of arbitration and an investor\u2019s acceptance of the same do not meet. No arbitration agreement is formed and, by way of necessary implication, any arbitral tribunal that is constituted on the basis of such non-existent arbitration agreement will be deprived of jurisdiction *ab initio*. Since this Tribunal has been constituted on the basis of such a non-existent arbitration agreement, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Parties and has in fact never had any jurisdiction from the very beginning of these proceedings.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, because the Tribunal has the power to allow him to amend or supplement the Notice of Arbitration and/or Memorial under the UNCITRAL Rules, this also includes the power to grant him leave to amend a defective waiver. The Tribunal is not persuaded. A tribunal\u2019s power to grant leave to amend or modify a notice of arbitration and/or statement of claim is part of the general power of a tribunal over arbitral proceedings. It is a matter of case management and sound administration of justice. In contrast, granting leave to cure a defective waiver, over the objection of the Respondent, would be tantamount to the Tribunal creating consent to arbitration where no such consent existed when the Tribunal was constituted. The Tribunal simply fails to see how, despite having been constituted on the basis of an invalid arbitration agreement, and hence not having jurisdiction over the Parties from the beginning of these proceedings, it could purport to exercise a power to cure the Claimant\u2019s defective waiver over the objection of the Respondent, and thereby endow itself with jurisdiction.\n\n238.\n\nThe *Renco I* tribunal by majority reached a similar conclusion and found that a claimant could not cure a defective waiver absent the respondent\u2019s consent:\n\n152. In the present case, however, the jurisdictional defect (Renco\u2019s non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b)) remains uncured. This jurisdictional defect could only be cured (a) if Renco took the positive step of withdrawing the reservation of rights, or submitting a new waiver without the reservation of rights, **and Peru consented to this by way of a variation of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty**, or (b) if Renco commenced a new arbitration together with a waiver without any reservation of rights.\n\n...\n\n160. ... [T]he Tribunal has concluded that Renco **cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver** by withdrawing the reservation of rights.314\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, paras. 152, 160 (emphasis added).\n\n239.\n\nThe *Renco I* tribunal also found that Article 10.18 of the USPTPA represented a *lex specialis,* which prevailed over the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* doctrine. In other words, even if a compliant waiver were submitted before a tribunal had had the opportunity to rule on its jurisdiction, the tribunal would remain deprived of jurisdiction:\n\n157. The Tribunal is faced with an apparent conflict between the interpretation of Article 10.18 adopted by the United States and Peru and the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice as evidenced in the *Mavrommatis* doctrine. Having given careful consideration to the matter, the Tribunal has felt constrained to conclude that the clear and express language of Article 10.18 of the Treaty, as well as its object and purpose, establishes a *lex specialis* which must prevail over, or in any event precludes, the *Mavrommatis* doctrine ...\n\n158. Under Article 10.18, the submission of a valid waiver is a condition and limitation on Peru\u2019s consent to arbitrate. This is a precondition to the initial existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and as such leads to a clear timing issue: if no compliant waiver is served with the notice of arbitration, Peru\u2019s offer to arbitrate has not been accepted; there is no arbitration agreement; and the Tribunal is without any authority whatsoever. If the Tribunal applied the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, the Tribunal would be exercising powers it simply does not have (because there is no arbitration agreement, and so the Tribunal is not a tribunal). In effect, it would be creating, retrospectively, an arbitration agreement for the Parties when no agreement had ever come into existence. To put it colloquially, the Tribunal would be 'pulling itself up by its own bootstraps\u2019 in order to create jurisdiction where none existed. In the Tribunal\u2019s considered opinion, this would be entirely unprincipled and obviously impermissible.315\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, paras. 157-158.\n\n240.\n\nThe majority of this Tribunal agrees with the above conclusion of the *Renco I* tribunal. While certainly it would have been more efficient if the *Mavrommatis* doctrine applied, the Tribunal simply lacks the power to go against the special agreement reached by the United States and Peru in Article 10.18 of the USPTPA as to what will constitute a valid basis to proceed to arbitration and (necessarily) constitute a tribunal.\n\n241.\n\nIn this regard, it must be emphasized that, unlike the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") and the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"**PCIJ**\"), this Tribunal is not a standing body with its own independent existence or powers. It was appointed and constituted pursuant to a particular arbitration agreement, and its entire existence depends upon the validity of that arbitration agreement. It obviously cannot be constituted validly pursuant to a future, but yet to be concluded, arbitration agreement. As recognized by the tribunal in *Renco I,* it is the specific requirements for a valid arbitration agreement, upon which a tribunal may be constituted, that is the *lex specialis* here.\n\n242.\n\nThe arbitration agreement in question here was never concluded, because a specifically negotiated condition was never met. It necessarily follows that the Tribunal was never validly constituted. Because the Tribunal has no existence or authority independent of the arbitration agreement on the basis of which it was purportedly appointed, it has no power to direct a party to cure a defect in that agreement, in order - retrospectively - to endow itself with jurisdiction.\n\n243.\n\nIndeed, if the defect in the arbitration agreement were cured, a new tribunal would have to be appointed and constituted (which, depending on the Parties\u2019 consent, might or might not comprise the same members as the previous panel).\n\n244.\n\nThe minority criticizes the majority\u2019s analysis on the basis that it freezes the evidentiary record as of the date of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s deficient filing,316 and means, in effect, \"one strike and you\u2019re out.\"317 But this - again - overlooks the fact that the standing and authority of the Tribunal must necessarily be tested as of the date of its purported constitution. It cannot be tested from a later date, retrospectively, and on the basis of steps the (invalidly constituted) panel has taken in the meantime.318\n\nPara. 268 below.\n\nPara. 269 below.\n\nThe minority comments on this, at para. 286(vi), below as follows: \"... it is not clear what steps our 'validly constituted' panel has taken 'in the meantime' (unless reference is made to the third party funding disclosure order, in which the Tribunal was unanimous) because in fact the Tribunal has taken no 'steps' in respect of Objection 4 until now apart from setting a schedule.\" To be clear, the \"step\" referred to here would be the (requested) admission by the (invalidly constituted) Tribunal of the Claimant's subsequent waiver, as a means to give retrospective validity to the arbitration agreement upon which the Tribunal was purportedly constituted.\n\n245.\n\nTo put this another way, the minority considers that there is nothing in the text of the Treaty to preclude the Tribunal from receiving evidence in the ordinary way of dealing with interlocutory matters,319 including a revised acceptance by the Claimant of the Respondent\u2019s offer to arbitrate. But as of the date the Claimant submitted his revised acceptance, there was no valid \"tribunal\" to receive it.\n\nPara. 282 below.\n\n246.\n\nAs to this, the minority counters that \"[i]t is not clear how a tribunal that does not exist can nevertheless pronounce on its own existence unless, like Schrodinger\u2019s famous cat, it is simultaneously both alive and dead.\"320 But this is to ignore the doctrine of *kompetenz-kompetenz*. The Tribunal, having been purportedly constituted and faced with jurisdictional objections, has a mandate to rule upon its own jurisdiction - and indeed \"pronounce on its own existence\" (albeit not finally). In order to discharge this mandate, it must conduct an arbitral procedure, with all steps, orders and directions that may be necessary in order to ensure a fair and legally compliant process. But this mandate obviously does not mean that the Tribunal is in fact \"alive,\" or is in fact a valid Tribunal for any purpose beyond *kompetenz-kompetenz*. Whether or not the Tribunal is \"alive\" or \"dead\" will ultimately depend on the ruling of a competent court. In the meantime, it may continue in order to rule on its own jurisdiction and (if it considers itself \"alive,\" subject to a court\u2019s final ruling) the merits.\n\nPara. 279 below.\n\n247.\n\nThe minority states that \"[i]n dealing with interlocutory or procedural issues including *kompetenz-kompetenz*, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure including ... determining the evidentiary record it considers relevant to the validity of Objection 4\"321 and the evidence now comprises a (subsequently introduced) valid waiver. But it is important to recall the nature of the *\"kompetenz* issue.\" In particular, it must encompass the question whether this Tribunal was constituted pursuant to a valid arbitration agreement.\n\nPara. 281 below.\n\n248.\n\nThis limited mandate certainly does not authorize the panel to take steps to create retrospectively its own jurisdiction (such as curing an invalid arbitration agreement). If this were not so, as the *Renco I* tribunal noted, every tribunal would have a license to \"pull itself up by its own bootstraps.322\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 158.\n\n249.\n\nEqually, the UNCITRAL Rules, which allow a tribunal to \"decide the scope of admissible evidence on which to base its decision on Objection 4,\"323 are of no assistance. Like the *kompetenz-kompetenz* principle, which only permits a tribunal to determine for itself if it has jurisdiction but is not and cannot be a sufficient basis for a tribunal to create such jurisdiction, the UNCITRAL Rules cannot create consent where consent did not already exist at the relevant time - in this case, at the time when the claim was submitted to arbitration pursuant to the express terms of the USPTPA.\n\nPara. 280 below.\n\n250.\n\nFor these reasons, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the Claimant\u2019s defective waiver cannot be cured as the Respondent has refused to give its consent thereto.\n\n251.\n\nThe final question that the Tribunal needs to address is whether the Respondent should be estopped from raising this jurisdictional objection as a result of its conduct during these proceedings (i.e., applying for relief from the Tribunal).\n\n*(ii) Is the Respondent Estopped from Raising Jurisdictional Objections?*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, because the Respondent availed itself of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for purposes of obtaining the disclosure of the Claimant\u2019s third party funder, it is now estopped from raising jurisdictional objections premised on its lack of consent to arbitration. The Respondent takes strong exception to this argument, contending that the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement cannot be construed as consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or support an estoppel argument.\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent.\n\n254.\n\nArticle 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence\" and that \"[a] party is not precluded from raising such a plea by the fact that it has appointed, or participated in the appointment of, an arbitrator.\" These provisions establish two important principles: (i) a jurisdictional objection raised in the statement of defense is timely, and no such objection need be raised earlier than the statement of defense; and (ii) by simply participating in the appointment of an arbitrator, a respondent does not lose the right to contest the jurisdiction of the tribunal.\n\n255.\n\nGiven principle (i) above, it would take something more than the simple participation in proceedings before filing of the statement of defense for a respondent to be construed as consenting to jurisdiction. The Tribunal considers that a respondent would have to engage in an act or an omission which would unquestionably show that it has decided to avail itself of the power of the tribunal to decide the case on the merits.\n\n256.\n\nIn the case before the Tribunal, the Respondent expressly reserved its right to contest jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, *ratione personae*, *ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis* in its Response to the Notice of Arbitration dated March 21, 2020.324 On December 9, 2020, after the Claimant had filed its Memorial, the Respondent gave Notice of Intent to Submit Preliminary Obj ections, which it then duly filed on March 15, 2021. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent filed its jurisdictional objections in a timely manner.\n\nResponse to the Notice of Arbitration, para. 5.\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimant however argues that, prior to its Notice of Intent to Submit Preliminary Objections, the Respondent conducted itself in a manner that \"clearly and unequivocally\"325 established its consent to arbitration. The Claimant refers in particular to the Respondent\u2019s Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement, dated September 25, 2020, where the Respondent availed itself of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction but did not clearly indicate that it was contesting jurisdiction. According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s reservation of rights in the Response to the Notice of Arbitration was too vague to be interpreted as containing jurisdictional objections.\n\nAnswer on Preliminary Objections, para. 94.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded.\n\n259.\n\nFirst, as shown above, the UNCITRAL Rules are such that a respondent is within its rights to raise jurisdictional objections as late as the statement of defense. In these proceedings, the Respondent expressly reserved the right to raise jurisdictional objections in its Response. The Claimant was thus on notice that such objections would indeed be raised thereafter, and in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules. The fact that the Respondent\u2019s objections were not yet articulated in the Response cannot be construed as consent to jurisdiction. The Respondent was perfectly entitled to reserve the right to formulate proper jurisdictional objections after having seen the full arguments of the Claimant in the Memorial.\n\n260.\n\nSecond, there is nothing in the UNCITRAL Rules or in the USPTPA that requires a respondent to reaffirm its intention to raise jurisdictional objections at every instance it addresses the Tribunal. It was thus unnecessary for the Respondent to reiterate in the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement that it was objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In any event, the Respondent had already indicated in its Response to the Notice of Arbitration that it would be contesting jurisdiction, and the nature and breadth of that statement naturally conditioned every statement thereafter.\n\n261.\n\nThird, while the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement certainly did request some form of relief from the Tribunal, that relief was intended to protect the integrity of the proceedings and did not in any way signal consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Even though this Tribunal did not have jurisdiction *ab initio*, it was nevertheless empaneled. By virtue of simply being constituted, the Tribunal had a duty to protect the integrity of the arbitral proceedings and the Parties\u2019 due process rights. One important aspect of due process is the right to an independent and impartial tribunal, which is free of conflicts. This right exists regardless of whether a tribunal were ultimately to find that it does not have jurisdiction. Indeed, in circumstances where jurisdictional objections had been raised, the Tribunal was authorized to conduct an arbitral process to rule upon its own jurisdiction (i.e., to exercise *kompetenz-kompetenz),* and each Party was entitled to ensure the Tribunal\u2019s independence and impartiality even for this (limited) arbitral process. Consequently, by formulating the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement, the Respondent availed itself of the Tribunal\u2019s power to protect the integrity of these proceedings, and not of the Tribunal\u2019s power to decide the merits of this case. Indeed, in order to rule on the Respondent\u2019s application, the Tribunal was not required to express any view or to make any finding in any way connected to the substance of the dispute. Consequently, the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement did not evidence the Respondent\u2019s consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with regard to the merits of this case.\n\n262.\n\nFourth, the fact that the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement was filed before the Respondent could articulate its jurisdictional objections is immaterial. It was within the Respondent\u2019s right to ascertain from the very beginning of these proceedings that the Tribunal was free of conflicts. Moreover, a delay in the filing of the application could have entailed risks, such as a potential argument that the application had to be dismissed on the basis of delay alone.\n\n263.\n\nFifth, the fact that the Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement referred to a possible future request for security for costs or an adverse costs award does not in any way signal consent to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Indeed, it is perfectly reasonable for a respondent to consider a request for security for costs when it objects to a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction: if a tribunal were to uphold jurisdictional objections and dismiss the case on that basis, it would be in a respondent\u2019s interest to be able to collect on any costs award in its favor issued by the tribunal.\n\n264.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s filing of its Request for Disclosure of the Funding Agreement did not in any way evidence the Respondent\u2019s consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. By way of necessary implication, the Claimant\u2019s estoppel argument is also dismissed, as there is nothing in the Respondent\u2019s conduct that could be construed as a clear and unequivocal statement or conduct in support of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that the Claimant has failed to provide a compliant waiver within the deadline provided in the USPTPA. Consequently, the Tribunal by majority concludes that no arbitration agreement was ever formed, and this Tribunal lacked jurisdiction *ab initio*. Moreover, the Claimant cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver. For its part, the Respondent never consented, either expressly or impliedly, to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. For all these reasons, the Tribunal by majority concludes that it does not have jurisdiction to hear the present dispute and dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claims on this basis.\n\n**D.** **D****issenting** **O****pinion of** **the** **H****onourable** **I****an** **B****innie****,** **C.C., Q.C.,** **on** **O****bjection** **4**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nI agree with my colleagues that the issue of consent is jurisdictional and that, as they state, \"in circumstances where jurisdictional objections had been raised, the Tribunal was authorized to conduct an arbitral process to rule upon its own jurisdiction (i.e. to exercise *kompetenz-kompetenz).\"**326* This jurisdiction is rooted in Article 23 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which is made applicable by Article 10.16.3(c) of the Treaty, and provides that 'the arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on its own jurisdiction ...\" My dissent concerns how this undoubted power is to be exercised.\n\nPara. 261 above.\n\n267.\n\nMy colleagues state that the dispositive question is \"one of timing.\"327 However, in their view the only timing question has to do with whether the compliant waiver was filed with the Notice of Arbitration on April 4, 2020 or, at the latest, with the Memorial which was delivered on September 11, 2020. Having not been so filed or delivered, they say, \"[s]ince a valid waiver is a pre-condition to consent, as of September 11, 2020, the Respondent\u2019s consent was lacking and no arbitration agreement existed.\"328\n\nPara. 234 above.\n\nPara. 234 above.\n\n268.\n\nI agree that in the absence of a compliant waiver \"no arbitration agreement\" was formed **at that time***.* I also agree that no arbitration agreement can be formed unless and until the claimant\u2019s notice of arbitration or statement of claim \"is accompanied by\" (to quote the USPTPA) a compliant waiver. The jurisdictional facts must be conjoined at the same time. Hence the real \"timing\" issue, in my view, is whether jurisdiction is to be judged on the evidentiary record frozen as of the date of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s deficient filing as my colleagues insist or (in accordance with applicable principles of international law), as of the date the Tribunal makes its decision on the jurisdictional objections, which is now. The Tribunal has had in the evidentiary record Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s compliant waiver since April 25, 2021, and as of that date all of the jurisdictional facts were collectively present and correct.\n\n269.\n\nMy colleagues proceed on the basis that once Mr. Amorrortu delivered a non-compliant waiver, Peru's \"offer to arbitrate\" was exhausted and spent and somehow became incapable of acceptance. My colleagues adopt the view of the *Renco I* majority (Landau, Moser, Fortier dissenting) that Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s initial misstep is not curable unless Peru consents.329 In my view, on the contrary, there is nothing in the Treaty to support this \"one strike and you\u2019re out\" limitation. Peru\u2019s \"offer to arbitrate\" remained open (and remains open to this day) for acceptance and was in fact accepted by Mr. Amorrortu when he supplemented his initial filing with a compliant waiver on April 25, 2021. At that point, in line with *Renco I's* references to the judgment of the ICJ in the *Genocide Convention* case, \"the unmet condition is met.\"330 In that judgment, while acknowledging that the prerequisites for jurisdiction are generally assessed as of the time an application is filed, the Court declared its preference for a different timing when the issues \"governing the Court\u2019s jurisdiction were not fully satisfied when proceedings were initiated but were subsequently satisfied, **before the Court ruled on its jurisdiction**.\"331\n\nPara. 236 above.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

The *Renco I* tribunal considered the *Mavrommatis* doctrine to be relevant and applicable to investor-state arbitration. The question before this Tribunal, as it was before the *Renco I* tribunal, is whether \"special circumstances\" exist to displace the ordinarily applicable *Mavrommatis* rule.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

For example, as we have just seen with respect to Peru\u2019s Objection 1, the Treaty expressly precludes the reception of any fact evidence in applications under Article 10.20.4 where a state contends that, as a matter of law, the claimant cannot succeed and \"the tribunal shall assume to be true claimants\u2019 factual allegations.\" There are no such words of limitation in the USPTPA applicable to evidence that may be considered in relation to Objection 4. The Tribunal is to apply its ordinary authority to \"determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\"334\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Article 27(4).\n\n*(ii) The \"Accompanied By\" Issue*\n---------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Treaty says the notice of arbitration or statement of claim must be \"accompanied by\" a compliant waiver. The condition was not met with the original filing but as of now \"the unmet condition is met\" and, if the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is to be determined as of now (when for the first time Peru\u2019s objection is presented for decision) all of the jurisdictional prerequisites are satisfied.\n\n276.\n\nIn my respectful opinion, the analysis of the *Renco I* majority conflated the questions of **what** must be proven to establish jurisdiction with the separate question of **when** the relevant evidentiary record is to be considered perfected. The Treaty established a *lex specialis* with respect to the **what** (being the substantive requirements) but contains no direction (or limitation) as to **when** the evidentiary record must be taken as ripe for adjudication.\n\n*(iii) The Non-Existent Tribunal Issue*\n---------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nMy colleagues\u2019 theory seems to be that the *kompetenz* tribunal is different from the merits tribunal and if the *kompetenz* tribunal makes a negative decision then the merits tribunal never comes into existence.\n\n278.\n\nThen, at para. 239, my colleagues adopt the conclusion of the *Renco I* majority that \"there is no arbitration agreement, and so the Tribunal is not a tribunal.\" This theory adopts the somewhat different approach that the Tribunal is \"alive\" for purposes of *kompetenz-kompetenz,* then dead if no *kompetenz,* but continues in life if there is *kompetenz,* but if dead then \"the Tribunal is not a tribunal.\" This exclusive focus on the disputed arbitration agreement fails to identify where, in the absence of a valid arbitration agreement, Peru consented to the Tribunal exercising *kompetenz-kompetenz* jurisdiction in the first place.335\n\nMy colleagues state at para. 246 above: \"\u2026 Whether or not the Tribunal is 'alive' or 'dead\" will ultimately depend on ruling of a competent court. In the meantime, it may continue in order to rule on its own jurisdiction and (if it considers itself 'alive,' subject to a court's final ruling) the merits.\"\n\n279.\n\nIt is not clear how a tribunal that does not exist can nevertheless pronounce on its own existence unless, like Schrodinger's famous cat, it is simultaneously both alive and dead. Elsewhere the majority acknowledge that at least for present purposes the Tribunal is a tribunal and\n\n... has a mandate to rule upon its own jurisdiction - and indeed \"pronounce on its own existence\" (albeit not finally). In order to discharge this mandate, it must conduct an arbitral procedure, with all steps, orders and directions that may be necessary in order to ensure a fair and legally compliant process. But this mandate obviously does not mean that the Tribunal is in fact \"alive,\" or is in fact a valid Tribunal for any purpose beyond *kompetenz-kompetenz*.336\n\nIn the end, therefore, we all agree the Tribunal is \"alive\" and is a \"valid Tribunal\" for purposes of *kompetenz-kompetenz* which is the only jurisdiction being exercised at this stage. At issue, as mentioned, is the Tribunal's authority to determine the evidentiary record relevant to this limited mandate.\n\nPara. 246 above.\n\n280.\n\nIn my view the source of *kompetenz-kompetenz* jurisdiction lies outside the agreement to which Peru is said never to have consented and the obvious source is the Treaty and its authorization of the UNCITRAL process including *kompetenz-kompetenz*. As Peru's consent to the application of the UNCITRAL Rules is the basis for the present (limited) mandate the Tribunal has under the UNCITRAL Rules the usual procedural authority to decide the scope of admissible evidence on which to base its decision on Objection 4, including taking into account Mr. Amorrortu's April 25, 2021 compliant waiver.\n\n281.\n\nIn carrying out its duties under the UNCITRAL Rules, a tribunal can and does receive evidence except where directed not to do so (as in respect of Peru's Objection 1 under Article 10.20.4 of the USPTPA). In dealing with interlocutory or procedural issues including *kompetenz-kompetenz*, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure including, in my view, determining the evidentiary record it considers relevant to the validity of Objection 4. Evidence can be received on jurisdictional issues in UNCITRAL arbitrations just as it may be received by the international courts. If *Mavrommatis* was not the general rule applicable except in \"special circumstances,\" the *Renco I* majority (and my colleagues at para. 239) would not have found it necessary to contend that in the case of the USPTPA the *lex specialis* \"prevails\" over *Mavrommatis.* If, however, the USPTPA does not provide evidentiary instructions inconsistent with *Mavrommatis,* then Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s compliant waiver should be taken into consideration just as in the *Genocide Convention* case the ICJ had no trouble taking cognizance of the fact Serbia had subsequent to the deficient initiation of proceedings, become a member of the United Nations.\n\n282.\n\nMy colleagues take comfort from the fact that the United States agrees \"with the Respondent that an invalid waiver can only be remedied with the consent of the respondent State.\"337 While the Tribunal is to take into account the views of the Treaty Parties as to what they intended,338 the Tribunal is not bound by their views, particularly as their submissions in this case are based on the text of the USPTPA and the Tribunal can see for itself that there is nothing in the text of the Treaty to impose a \"frozen record\" theory or a \"one strike and you\u2019re out\" limitation to terminate Peru\u2019s \"open offer\" to arbitrate, nor is there anything in the Treaty to preclude the Tribunal from receiving evidence in the ordinary way into the evidentiary record that is probative of whether or not Mr. Amorrortu has waived other potential remedies.\n\nPara. 218 above.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-001**, VCLT, Article 31(3)(a)-(b).\n\n283.\n\nThe *Renco I* tribunal majority took the view that while in the *Mavrommatis*339 and *Genocide Convention* cases, \"the jurisdictional defect was **cured** as a result of a subsequent event during the proceedings340 ... in the present case, the jurisdictional defect ... remains **uncured**.\"341 Of course, the only reason the jurisdictional defect remained \"uncured\" was because the *Renco I* majority refused Renco\u2019s request to file a compliant waiver. The *Renco I* majority froze the jurisdictional record once Renco had made its misstep. Similarly, in this case, my colleagues agree with *Renco I* that the Tribunal is not allowed to take into account Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s compliant waiver even though it has been part of the Tribunal evidentiary record for more than a year and Peru has not sought to have it struck. Peru says the compliant waiver is irrelevant but relevance is a decision for the Tribunal.\n\n*See* **Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 146:  \nThe Court rejected the submission of the United Kingdom and held as follows: Even assuming that before that time the Court had no jurisdiction because the international obligation referred to in Article II was not yet effective, it would always have been possible for the applicant to re-submit his application in the same terms after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lausanne, and in that case, the argument in question could not have been advanced. Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant's suit. **The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. Even, therefore, if the application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications** (emphasis added).\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v.

Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 152 (emphasis added).\n\n*(iv) More Than Just \"Efficiency\" Is at Stake*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nMy colleagues acknowledge that \"it would have been more efficient if the *Mavrommatis* doctrine applied\"342 but the ICJ did not adopt the *Mavrommatis* doctrine purely for the sake of efficiency (although of course it is more efficient) but because \"it is not in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel the applicant to begin the proceedings anew.\"343 The relevant passage in *Genocide Convention* reads as follows,\n\nWhat matters is that, at the latest by the date when the Court decides on its jurisdiction, the applicant must be entitled, if it so wishes, to bring fresh proceedings in which the initially unmet condition would be fulfilled. In such a situation it is not in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel the applicant to begin the proceedings anew - or to initiate fresh proceedings - and it is preferable, except in special circumstances, to conclude that the condition has, from that point on, been fulfilled.344\n\nPara. 240 above.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 149.\n\n**Exhibit RLA-032**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, July 15, 2016, para. 149, fn. 29, *citing* Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), [2008] ICJ Reports 412, Judgment, November 18, 2008, para. 441.\n\n285.\n\nAs in *Mavrommatis* and *Genocide Convention,* the missing jurisdictional link in the present case arrived late but it arrived in time for the Tribunal\u2019s current deliberations on jurisdiction. Peru\u2019s offer to arbitrate under the UNCITRAL Rules was never withdrawn. *Genocide Convention* asks the question \"is the unmet condition now met\" and the answer in the present case is yes because if, instead of contesting the jurisdictional objection, Mr. Amorrortu had withdrawn his claim, he could forthwith have filed a fresh Notice of Arbitration \"accompanied by\" a compliant waiver and there would have been no objection under Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty. Mr. Amorrortu thus meets the *Genocide Convention* test for the application of *Mavrommatis*. Accordingly, in the absence of any \"special circumstances\" compelling a \"frozen record\" or \"one strike and you\u2019re out\" limitation, and rejecting the *lex specialis* argument of the *Renco I* majority (adopted by my colleagues) which reads into the Treaty words that are not there, my view is that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to proceed to decide Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim on its merits and ought to do so.\n\n*(v) Areas of Agreement with the Majority*\n------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nIt is convenient to summarize areas of agreement and disagreement:\n\n(i) The Tribunal is unanimous that the foundation of its jurisdiction is consent. There is no doubt that \"unlike the [ICJ] and the [PCIJ], this Tribunal is not a standing body with its own independent existence or powers.\"345 However, in my view, the fact this Tribunal is not \"a standing body with its own independent existence and powers\" is not relevant to the ruling once it is recognized that the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules, to which Peru consented, provide the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s *kompetenz-kompetenz* jurisdiction.\n\n(ii) My colleagues assert that \"the Tribunal has no existence or authority independent of the arbitration agreement on the basis of which it was purportedly appointed\"346 and that the Tribunal cannot \"endow itself with jurisdiction\" because it was \"constituted on the basis of an invalid arbitration agreement.\"347 But it my view, the Tribunal does have \"existence and authority\" under the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules to determine its *kompetenz-kompetenz*, which is the only subject matter of the present deliberations, including the identification of the relevant evidentiary record.\n\n(iii) My colleagues then write that the \"UNCITRAL Rules cannot create consent where consent did not already exist at the relevant time,\"348 which is true, but the UNCITRAL Rules permit the *kompetenz* tribunal to determine when is the \"relevant time,\" namely whether it is when Mr. Amorrortu made his initial misstep or, as the *Mavrommatis* doctrine holds, at the time the Tribunal decides on the validity of Peru\u2019s jurisdictional objection, which is now.\n\n(iv) My colleagues state that \"as of the date the Claimant submitted his revised acceptance, there was no valid 'Tribunal\u2019 to receive it.\"349 The assertion that there was no \"valid tribunal\" in existence in April 2021 seems to me inconsistent with our shared view that now, more than a year later, and from the time Mr. Amorrortu filed his claim, there has been a Tribunal validly seized of the *kompetenz* issue. Under the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, there could be no objection to the filing of a claimant\u2019s \"revised acceptance,\" just as evidence of changed circumstances was received and acted upon in the *Mavrommatis* and the *Genocide Convention* cases when the courts were similarly faced with (and rejected) the argument that the \"unmet condition\" could not be subsequently met.\n\n(v) There is nothing retrospective about the application of the *Mavrommatis* doctrine. It simply identifies the relevant evidentiary record at the time jurisdiction is ripe for adjudication and that time is now.\n\n(vi) My colleagues then state that jurisdiction to determine the merits of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim is fixed and determined as of his initial deficient filing date and not \"from a later date, retrospectively, and on the basis of steps the (invalidly constituted) panel has taken in the meantime.\"350 But the majority had earlier stated that the panel is **validly** constituted for purposes of *kompetenz-kompetenz* and it is not clear what steps our \"validly constituted\" panel has taken \"in the meantime\" (unless reference is made to the third party funding disclosure order, in which the Tribunal was unanimous) because in fact the Tribunal has taken no \"steps\" in respect of Objection 4 until now apart from setting a schedule.\n\n(vii) My colleagues assert that the \"mandate to rule upon its own jurisdiction ... does not mean that the Tribunal is in fact 'alive,\u2019 or is in fact a valid Tribunal for any purpose beyond *kompetenz-kompetenz*.\"351 However, it is precisely *kompetenz-kompetenz* that we are engaged upon and in my view, in the absence of any \"special circumstances,\" the Tribunal can and should apply the *Mavrommatis* doctrine.\n\n(viii) My colleagues take the view that if the Tribunal determines that it has no *kompetenz* to rule on Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim, it \"will be deprived of jurisdiction *ab initio*.\"352 If what is meant is that in that situation the Tribunal never had jurisdiction **to adjudicate on the validity of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim on the merits**, it would be true, but a tribunal\u2019s decision to reject jurisdiction to try the ultimate issue does not mean the Tribunal never had **any** jurisdiction under Peru\u2019s consent to the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules. The present application engages only the exercise of *kompetenz-kompetenz* jurisdiction, which in turn requires the Tribunal to determine the relevant evidentiary record to be considered in that exercise.\n\n(ix) My colleagues assert that \"if the defect in the arbitration agreement were cured, a new tribunal would have to be appointed and constituted .\"353 However, according to the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, the effect of its application is not a new claim but simply a determination by the Tribunal that the initial claim proceeds because \"the unmet condition is met.\" In neither *Mavrommatis* nor the *Genocide Convention* cases were claims considered new as opposed to the original claims which were permitted to proceed on the merits based on the evidentiary record as of the relevant date.\n\n(x) My colleagues\u2019 contention that \"the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Parties and has in fact never had any jurisdiction from the very beginning of these proceedings\"354 will come as a surprise to Mr. Amorrortu, who was obliged to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s third party funding disclosure order.\n\n(xi) My colleagues then assert that \"the standing and authority of the Tribunal must necessarily be tested as of the date of its purported constitution.\"355 Even if the statement were limited to the \"standing and authority of the Tribunal **to decide the ultimate merits of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim**,\" it merely restates the frozen record theory which was rejected in *Mavrommatis* and the *Genocide Convention* judgments.\n\nPara. 241 above.\n\nPara. 242 above.\n\nPara. 237 above.\n\nPara. 249 above.\n\nPara. 245 above.\n\nPara. 244 above.\n\nPara. 246 above.\n\nPara. 236 above.\n\nPara. 243 above.\n\nPara. 236 above.\n\nPara. 244 above.\n\n*(vi) The Preferred Disposition*\n--------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nI conclude that Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s compliant waiver forms part of the relevant evidentiary record, and thus that all of the jurisdictional prerequisites were in place before (to paraphrase the ICJ) the Tribunal \"rules on its jurisdiction.\" As a result (in my view) Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim can proceed to the merits and I need not deal with the Claimant\u2019s alternative arguments on waiver and estoppel. However I agree with the disposition of the estoppel/waiver issue proposed by my colleagues for the reasons they have given.\n\n288.\n\nI would dismiss the Respondent\u2019s objection in respect of Article 10.18.2, without, of course, forming any view at this early stage about the strengths or weaknesses of Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claim.\n\n**PART 7** - **DECISION**\n-------------------------\n\n289.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal by majority:\n\n(i) finds that the Claimant has failed to comply with the requirement of Article 10.18.2(b) of the USPTPA by not providing a compliant waiver within the deadline specified in Article 10.16.4 of the USPTPA;\n\n(ii) finds that the Claimant has failed to establish the requirements for the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate under the USPTPA;\n\n(iii) rejects the Claimant\u2019s request for leave to amend his Notice of Arbitration in order to attempt to cure his defective waiver;\n\n(iv) dismisses the Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction; and\n\n(v) reserves the issue of costs pending receipt of the submissions from the Parties, after which the Tribunal will render a Final Award.\n\n**Seat of the arbitration: Paris, France**\n\n**Date: August 5, 2022**"}, {"Title": "Final Award on Costs", "Type": "Costs", "Date": "2022-10-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award on Costs\n--------------------\n\n**DEFINED TERMS**\n-----------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Claimant** | Mr. Bacilio Amorrortu |\n| **Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs** | Claimant\u2019s Submission on Fees and Costs, dated August 26, 2022 |\n| **Notice of Arbitration** | Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration, dated February 13, 2020 |\n| **Objection 1** | The Respondent\u2019s objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty |\n| **Objection 4** | The Respondent\u2019s objection that Mr. Amorrortu did not submit a valid waiver as required under Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty |\n| **Partial Award** | The Partial Award on Jurisdiction, issued on August 5, 2022 |\n| **Parties** | Claimant and Respondent |\n| **PCA** | Permanent Court of Arbitration |\n| **Peru or Respondent** | The Republic of Peru |\n| **Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs** | Submission on Costs of the Republic of Peru, dated August 26, 2022 |\n| **UNCITRAL Rules** | Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as revised in 2013 |\n| **USPTPA or Treaty** | United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, entered into force on February 1, 2009 |\n\n**PART 1 - INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------------\n\n**A.** **T****he** **P****arties**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimant is Mr. Bacilio Amorrortu (the \"**Claimant**\" or \"**Mr. Amorrortu**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by:\n\n**Francisco A.

Ian Binnie, CC, KC, a national of Canada (appointed as presiding arbitrator by the Parties on April 24, 2020).\n\n(ii) In accordance with Section 3.1 of the Terms of Appointment, the UNCITRAL Rules govern this arbitration.\n\n(iii) Pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Terms of Appointment, the legal place (or \"seat\") of arbitration is Paris, France.\n\n(iv) Pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Terms of Appointment, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") acts as Registry in these proceedings. Mr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Aragon Cardiel, PCA Legal Counsel, was designated to act as Registrar and Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n(v) Pursuant to Section 2.1 of the Procedural Order No. 1, the languages of the arbitration are English and Spanish. In accordance with Section 2.10 thereof, this Final Award on Costs is rendered in English and accompanied by a translation into Spanish.\n\n10.\n\nThe full history of these proceedings is set forth in the Partial Award and will not be repeated here. For the sake of simplicity, the Tribunal hereby incorporates by reference Part 2 of the Partial Award and recounts here the history of these proceedings following the Partial Award.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated August 5, 2022, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file submissions on costs.\n\n12.\n\nOn August 26, 2022, the Claimant and the Respondent filed simultaneously their submissions on costs (respectively, the \"**Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs**\" and the \"**Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs**\").\n\n**PART 3 - COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimant****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimant quantifies its legal costs at USD 919,349.16, excluding the Claimant\u2019s portion of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA. This amount includes USD 770,758.72 in attorney\u2019s fees and USD 148,590.44 in expenses for experts and vendors.4\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 15.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant cites Articles 10.20.6 and 10.26 of the USPTPA, as well as Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, as the relevant rules governing costs.5 Having regard to those provisions, the Claimant contends, first, that he is entitled to an award of his costs incurred in opposing Objection 1 under USPTPA Article 10.20.6 because, in its view, Objection 1 was \"meritless\" and \"frivolous\"6 and, in any event, he is the prevailing disputing party as regards that objection.7 In this respect, the Claimant recalls that he cautioned at the inception of the proceedings that \"the only preliminary objection that should be adjudicated separately from the merits argument is [Objection 4].\"8\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, p. 3. USPTPA Article 10.20.6 provides:  \nWhen it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous\u2026\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 4-5; **Exhibit C-73**, Letter from Claimant in response to Peru's intent to submit jurisdictional objections, December 22, 2020.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that he is entitled to his reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in opposing the Respondent\u2019s \"meritless\" objections and that the Respondent is not entitled to costs.9\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 6-14.\n\n16.\n\nIn this regard, while his claim was ultimately dismissed by the Tribunal, the Claimant considers that several circumstances of the case caution against the Claimant bearing the full costs of the arbitration. Recalling the findings of the tribunal in *Renco I,* the Claimant considers several factors to be dispositive. First, the Claimant argues that \"Peru achieved a relative success.\"10 In this regard, the Claimant emphasizes that of the six jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent, only one\u2014Objection 4\u2014prevailed. Furthermore, the Claimant has commenced arbitration proceedings *de novo* against the Respondent. As such, the Claimant concludes that \"Peru could hardly be considered a prevailing party.\"11\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 8; **Exhibit CLA-125**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Final Award, November 9, 2016, para. 31.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 9.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the issue of his non-compliant waiver was \"inherently complex.\"12 He observes in this respect that (i) it took the Tribunal a year after the Hearing on Preliminary Objections to issue the Partial Award; and (ii) the Partial Award was subject to dissent on the issue of whether or not the Claimant could remedy his non-compliant waiver. The Claimant therefore \"assum[es] ... that the Tribunal required 'extensive and intensive deliberations,\u2019\" the standard upon which the *Renco I* tribunal departed from the general principle that the unsuccessful claimant should pay the prevailing party\u2019s arbitration costs.13\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 10; **Exhibit CLA-125**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Final Award, November 9, 2016, para. 40.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 11 (emphasis removed).\n\n18.\n\nLastly, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to consider the fact that the Respondent did not raise its preliminary objections until more than a year after the initiation of the arbitration. The Claimant avers that it is not the first time that the Respondent engages in such behavior and submits that the Respondent\u2019s failure to raise these objections at the outset of the proceedings caused both Parties to incur unnecessary expenses.14\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 13; **Exhibit CLA-125**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Final Award, November 9, 2016, para. 31.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s request for relief is as follows:\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Claimant respectfully submits that the entirety of the costs and fees associated with Peru\u2019s preliminary objections should be paid by Peru, and, accordingly, requests that this Tribunal:\n\na. ORDER Peru to reimburse Amorrortu for the Claimant\u2019s portion of the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, along with the PCA\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, associated with Peru\u2019s preliminary objections;\n\nb. ORDER Peru to reimburse Amorrortu in the amount of **US $148,590.44**, representing the costs incurred in experts and vendors retained in defending against Peru\u2019s preliminary objections; and\n\nc. ORDER Peru to reimburse Amorrortu in the amount of **US $770,758.72**, representing the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by the Claimant in defending against Peru\u2019s preliminary objections.15\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 16.\n\n**B.** **T****he** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the overall total of costs it incurred in this proceeding is USD 1,677,425.53.16 This amount includes (i) costs of arbitration advanced to the PCA (USD 240,000); (ii) fees for legal representation/assistance of Lazo & de Romana (USD 10,700.00) and Foley Hoag LLP (USD 1,320,013.50); (iii) fees for legal assistance on Peruvian law by Dr. Vizquerra (USD 71,100.00); and (iv) out-of-pocket expenses for legal representation/assistance corresponding to Foley Hoag LLP (USD 35,612.03). However, the Respondent requests reimbursement only of its advance payments of USD 240,000 and its costs and fees for legal representation and assistance in the amount of USD 1,335,955.21,17 totaling USD 1,575,955.21.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 24(i)-(ii).\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes a clear presumption that the unsuccessful party must bear the costs of the arbitration.18 When allocating costs, the Respondent notes, arbitral tribunals have held that success in the proceedings on jurisdiction is the main circumstance relevant to determining which party bears the costs of the arbitration.19 Noting the conduct of the Parties as another relevant factor, the Respondent argues that where a claimant persists in pursuing a claim despite being made aware of jurisdictional defects, it should be ordered to make the respondent whole for the costs incurred in its defense,20 particularly if it directly and unnecessarily imposed additional costs on its adversary.21 The Respondent cites in this regard to *Alps Finance and Trade v. Slovakia,* where the Tribunal awarded all costs of the arbitration and legal representation to the respondent where the claimant pursued its claim despite the fact that it \"was made aware of the doubts and queries raised by the Respondent concerning the jurisdictional requirements set forth in\" the treaty at issue.22 This was so despite the fact that the Tribunal did not accept all of the respondent\u2019s objections.23\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 7; *Alps Finance and Trade AG v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, March 5, 2011, para. 268; *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Canada) v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, UNCITRAL, Costs Order, August 30, 2010, paras. 32-33; *Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, June 14, 2013, paras. 339-341.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 10.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para 10.\n\n22.\n\nApplying this rationale to the case at hand, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear Respondent\u2019s costs in their entirety, as (i) the Respondent is the prevailing party, and (ii) the Claimant insisted in pursuing his claims despite being given a clear warning of his defective waiver.24 With respect to the first point, the Respondent contends that there can be no question that it is the successful party in this arbitration: the Tribunal dismissed the Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety, exactly the result the Respondent was seeking with its preliminary objections.25\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 14; *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated (Canada) v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, UNCITRAL, Costs Order, August 30, 2010, paras. 32-33.\n\n23.\n\nAs to the second point, the Respondent submits that \"Claimant\u2019s conduct throughout these proceedings 'directly and unnecessarily\u2019 aggravated the dispute, prolonged the proceedings, and increased Respondent\u2019s costs of legal representation.\"26 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s lack of transparency in freely disclosing the identity of his third party funder both threatened the integrity of the arbitral proceeding and unnecessarily increased the Respondent\u2019s costs.27 The Respondent further notes that the Claimant proceeded with the arbitration, rather than discontinuing the proceedings, despite being made aware that his waiver under USPTPA Article 10.18.2(b)(i) was defective. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant could not have been unaware of the very clear and unequivocal requirement under Article 10.18.2(b)(i) of the submission of an unconditional waiver as a prerequisite to Peru\u2019s consent to arbitrate, nor of the legal authority (*Renco I*) which was unequivocal about the consequences of presenting a defective waiver.28 According to the Respondent, \"Claimant\u2019s conduct in proceeding with a defective waiver in this arbitration cost Peru, the parties and the Tribunal, months, indeed years of unnecessary costs and time.\"29 Given that the result of the Partial Award should have been expected by the Claimant, it is he who should pay the price for pursuing his case. This applies even more so, the Respondent submits, when the costs are incurred by a sovereign State, and hence ultimately by the people of Peru.30\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 16.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 17.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 20.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 22.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para 22.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s request for relief is as follows:\n\n[]For the foregoing reasons, Respondent respectfully requests that, pursuant to Articles 40 to 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal order Claimant to:\n\n(i) Reimburse Respondent\u2019s advance payments of US$ 240,000.00;\n\n(ii) Reimburse Respondent\u2019s full costs and fees for legal representation and assistance in the amount of US$ 1,335,955.21; and\n\n(iii) Compound interest at a rate that the Tribunal deems reasonable from the date of the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s order until the date of Claimant\u2019s payment in full.\n\n[]As the Tribunal is aware, Claimant has been financed by a third party funder in this arbitration. Moreover, Mr. Amorrortu is a natural person whose financial capabilities and assets have not been demonstrated in this arbitration. There thus exists a possibility that Mr. Amorrortu is unable to cover an award on costs on this arbitration. Accordingly, in order to give full effect to the Tribunal order requested above, the Republic of Peru also respectfully request that it:\n\n(iv) Order Mr. Amorrortu to cause his third party funder, Longford Capital Management, LP, or any of its successors or assigns, to pay the above referenced costs on behalf of Mr. Amorrortu..31\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 24-25.\n\n**C. T****he** **T****ribunal****\u2019****s** **A****nalysis**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.** **Relevant Provisions**\n------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Treaty contains several provisions governing costs. First, USPTPA Article 10.20.6 provides:\n\nWhen it decides a respondent\u2019s objection under paragraph 4 or 5 [of Article 10.20], the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2019s claim or the respondent\u2019s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n26.\n\nIn turn, USPTPA Article 10.26.1 reads:\n\n1. Where a tribunal makes a final award against a respondent, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:\n\n(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest; and\n\n(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.\n\nA tribunal may also award costs and attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n27.\n\nPursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\" Article 40 defines \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\nThe term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n28.\n\nIn respect of allocation of costs, Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n**2.** **Allocation of the Costs of Arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nPursuant to Article 10.26.1 of the USPTPA, the Tribunal may award costs and attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with Chapter 10, Section B of the Treaty (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) and the applicable arbitration rules (here, the UNCITRAL Rules).\n\n30.\n\nAs regards provisions governing costs in the Treaty, Article 10.20.6 grants discretion to the Tribunal to \"award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in submitting or opposing\" an objection by the Respondent under paragraph 4 or 5 of Article 10.20. Thus, this provision applies directly to the allocation of costs arising in connection with the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Objection 1.\n\n31.\n\nAs regards all other costs incurred by the Parties, Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules prescribes the principle of \"costs follow the event\" in respect of all categories of costs listed in Article 40. However, Article 42 grants discretion to the Tribunal to \"apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\"\n\n32.\n\nIt follows from these provisions that the Tribunal enjoys wide discretion in allocating the costs of arbitration between the Parties. However, in making such determination, the Tribunal must pay regard to several factors, including which is the overall unsuccessful party and, as regards Objection 1, which is the \"prevailing disputing party\" as regards such objection.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 5, 2022 the Tribunal issued its Partial Award dismissing the proceedings brought under the USPTPA for want of jurisdiction.\n\n34.\n\nWhile the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional Objection 1 under USPTPA Article 10.20.4 (in which the Respondent contended that as a matter of law Mr. Amorrortu\u2019s claims were not claims for which an award may be made under Article 10.26) the Tribunal by majority upheld the Respondent\u2019s Objection 4 under Article 10.18.2(b) (resulting from the Claimant\u2019s failure to submit a compliant waiver within the deadline specified in Article 10.16.4). The Parties have advised the Tribunal that the Claimant has already presented the Respondent with a new notice of arbitration with a new waiver.32\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 9; Respondent's Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\n35.\n\nThe Partial Award reserved in para. 289(v) \"the issue of costs pending receipt of the submissions from the Parties after which the Tribunal will render a Final Award.\"\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs contends that as he succeeded on Objection 1 he should be awarded \"reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in opposing Peru\u2019s Objection No 1.\"33 With respect to the Respondent\u2019s Objection 4, the Claimant points out that the tribunal in *Renco I*, on whose majority decision the majority in this case relied, did not award costs against the claimant in part because the issue of the claimant\u2019s waiver in that case was considered \"inherently complex ... requiring extensive and intensive deliberations by the Tribunal over the months.\".34 Moreover, the Claimant says, had the Respondent not delayed bringing Objection 4 before the Tribunal for over a year \"the disputing parties could have saved time and money\".35\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Submission on costs, para. 8(b); **Exhibit CLA-125**, *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru [I]*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1, Final Award, November 9, 2016, para. 40.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 13.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs dated August 26, 2022 contends that as \"the prevailing party\" it should be awarded its costs \"in their entirety including legal fees plus compound interest from the day of the Tribunal\u2019s order until the date of payment by the Claimant\" at a rate \"the Tribunal deems reasonable\".36 The Respondent cites prior awards where, it says, full costs were awarded where the respondent had been \"completely successful on a jurisdictional objection\".37 Here the Claimant, by insisting on pursuing this arbitration despite being clearly alerted to the deficiency in his waiver \"directly and unnecessarily imposed additional costs on the Republic\". In fact, the Claimant effectively acknowledged the non-compliant nature of his original waiver when he belatedly filed a compliant waiver months after the non-compliance had been pointed out to him. Further unnecessary costs were incurred because the Claimant should have been \"more cooperative and transparent\" in disclosing the identity of his third party funder.38 The Respondent seeks to have the Claimant ordered to \"cause\" his third party funder to pay the above referenced costs on his behalf.39\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 1.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 7; *Alcor Holdings Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2018- 45, Award, March 2, 2022, para. 289; *Chevron Corporation (U.S.A.) and Texaco Petroleum Corporation (U.S.A.) v. Republic of Ecuador I*, PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277, Final Award, August 31, 2011, para. 375.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 17.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 25(iv).\n\n38.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view \"the circumstances of the case\" warrant an apportionment. While the Claimant succeeded on Objection 1, and can thus claim a measure of divided success, the Respondent\u2019s Objection 4 proved fatal to the present proceeding and obliged Mr. Amorrortu to start over again with a fresh notice of arbitration accompanied by a compliant waiver. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that both Parties incurred the bulk of their costs in respect of Objection 1, which, unlike Objection 4, required extensive expert evidence and analysis. While the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that he should be awarded costs on Objection 1, his success in that regard should be reflected in the award. Each Party \"prevailed\" in respect of one of the objections, but the award of costs must recognize that the Respondent\u2019s success on Objection 4 was the more significant.\n\n39.\n\nIn these \"circumstances of the case\", the Tribunal orders that the Claimant pay the Respondent two-thirds of its claimed costs, inclusive of the advanced payments on the costs of the arbitration as well as legal representation and assistance. The Tribunal does not have sufficient information to make any direction regarding the liability of the third party funder and therefore declines to do so.\n\n40.\n\nThe costs award will carry interest at the rate of 1 % above the 6-month LIBOR commercial lending rate for US dollars. Interest is to compound annually. The Tribunal understands that the publication of LIBOR rates may be discontinued at some point in 2023. In that event, if monies are still owed as of that date, interest will continue to accumulate at 1% above the rate last published prior to discontinuance of publication.\n\n**3.** **Quantification of the Costs of Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Parties deposited USD 480,000 with the PCA to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of registry services. These funds has been disbursed as follows:\n\n(i) The fees and expenses of Prof. Bernard Hanotiau amount to USD 113,866.66 and USD 28.63, respectively.\n\n(ii) The fees of Mr. Toby Landau, KC amount to USD 59,651.00.\n\n(iii) The fees of the Hon. Ian Binnie, CC, KC amount to USD 136,990.00.\n\n(iv) The registry fees of the PCA amount to USD 72,607.01.\n\n(v) All other costs of the arbitration, including the translation of the Partial Award and this Final Award and the expenses incurred in connection with the Hearing on Preliminary Objections held on August 9, 2021 amount to USD 32,186.82.\n\n(vi) The outstanding balance of the deposit amounts to USD 64,669.88.\n\n42.\n\nIn accordance with Section 11.4 of the Terms of Appointment, the Tribunal orders that the PCA reimburse half of the outstanding balance of the deposit (i.e. USD 32,334.94) to each Party.\n\n43.\n\nBased on the above figures, the costs of arbitration comprising the items covered in Articles 40(2) (a) to (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, total USD 415,330.12. The Respondent has effectively borne half of this amount, that is, USD 207,665.06. As directed by the Tribunal at para. 39 above, the Claimant shall reimburse two-thirds of such amount (i.e. USD 138,443.37) to the Respondent.\n\n44.\n\nAs also directed by the Tribunal at para. 39 above, the Claimant shall also reimburse to the Respondent two-thirds of its claimed costs for legal representation and assistance (i.e. USD 890,636.81).\n\n45.\n\nThus, the Claimant shall reimburse a total of USD 1,029,080.18 to the Respondent towards its costs in this arbitration.\n\n**PART 4 - DECISION**\n---------------------\n\n46.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal:\n\n(i) declares that the Claimant shall bear two-thirds of the costs claimed by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings;\n\n(ii) accordingly, orders the Claimant to reimburse USD 1,029,080.18 to the Respondent towards its costs in this arbitration, together with annually-compounded interest at the rate of 1 % above the 6-month LIBOR commercial lending rate for US dollars and, if this Award has not been fully satisfied by the Claimant as of the date of discontinuance of publication of LIBOR rates, interest will continue to accumulate at 1% above the rate last published prior to discontinuance of publication of LIBOR;\n\n(iii) directs the Parties to indicate no later than Wednesday, November 9, 2022 whether they wish to designate any information contained in this Final Award on Costs as confidential or protected information in accordance with the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules and Article 10.21 of the Treaty prior to the publication of this Final Award, for which purpose the Tribunal shall remain constituted; and\n\n(iv) dismisses all other requests for relief.\n\nSeat of the arbitration: Paris, France\n\nDate: October 25, 2022"}]}
