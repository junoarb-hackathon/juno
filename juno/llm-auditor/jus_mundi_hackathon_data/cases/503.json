Short Identification of the Case**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**C.I. The Claimant\u2019s Perspective**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe following quotation from the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration summarizes the main aspects of the dispute as follows (C-I, paras. 1-7):\n\n*\"1. [...] Claims in this arbitration relate to breaches of the [USA-Kazakhstan BIT]1 and also breaches of Contract No. 954 dated 27 May 2002 (as amended) (the \"Contract\") which provided for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons within parts of Blocks XXIV-20-C and XXIV-21-A including the Caratube Field in the Baianin District of the Aktobe Oblast region of Kazakhstan (the \"Field\").*\n\n*2. In short, following five years of successful and harmonious operation during which time the Claimant made very substantial investments in the Field, from September 2007 the relationship between the parties suddenly and dramatically deteriorated, apparently for reasons unconnected with the contractual performance of [Claimant]. By order of 30 January 2008 the Minister of Energy and Minerals Resources (the \"Minister\") purported to inform [Claimant] that the Contract was \"unilaterally terminated\". [Claimant] denies that it was in breach of the Contract or failed to fulfil its obligations as alleged or at all.*\n\n*3. The Kazakh Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the \"Ministry\"), acting on behalf of the State, has acted in flagrant breach of the Contract by purporting unilaterally to terminate Claimant\u2019s rights in circumstances where there is no justification for doing so. Furthermore, Claimant, together with its principal shareholder and his family, as well as senior management and employees of Claimant, have been subjected to a campaign of sustained and unlawful harassment. In particular there has been a series of protracted, intrusive and burdensome investigations into the affairs of Claimant conducted by various authorities, including the finance police, state prosecutors, the police force, secret services and the tax authorities. Claimant\u2019s principal shareholder and his family, as well as senior management and employees of Claimant, have also been subjected to personal threats and intimidation.*\n\n*4. Kazakhstan has repeatedly breached not only its obligations under the Contract but also its obligations under both international and Kazakh law with respect to [Claimant's] investment in Kazakhstan. These breaches have caused very substantial loss and damage to Claimant, not least because Claimant stood to make at least 2 USD billion from the Production stage of the reserves it had already identified in the Exploration stage of the Contract. Claimant commences these proceedings to enforce its rights, and seeks compensation for the loss and damage which it has suffered as a result of Kazakhstan\u2019s breaches.*\n\n**B.1 The Claimant**\n\n*5. The Claimant, CIOC, is a corporation constituted under the laws of Kazakhstan, with legal domicile at 92A Polezhaeva St., Zhelysusskiy Region Almaty, 050050, Republic of Kazakhstan.*\n\n*6. CIOC is directly owned by nationals of the United States of America and the Republic of Lebanon, namely:*\n\n*(a) Mr Devincci Salah Hourani, a national of the United States of America, who owns 92% of the shares of CIOC.*\n\n*(b) Mr Kassem Omar Abdallah, a national of the Republic of Lebanon, who owns the remaining shares of CIOC.*\n\n*7. Accordingly, 92% of CIOC\u2019s shares are controlled directly or indirectly by a US national.\"*\n\nThe Treaty is attached as Exhibit C-1.\n\n2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits of 14 May 2009 (C-III, paras. 7-12) contains the following Executive Summary of the case:\n\n*\"7. In this Memorial, CIOC sets out what is a substantial claim against Kazakhstan, currently estimated in the Quantum Report to be **USD 1,121.4 million**, for damages and compensation (including interest) arising out of the expropriation of its investment, a significant oil field in an oil rich area of the country.*\n\n*8. Not only had CIOC invested millions of dollars in the exploration of the oil field and its development, it was also entitled to an exclusive 25-year commercial production licence since it had a commercial discovery. These rights, of which CIOC has been deprived, underpin CIOC\u2019s claim for damages and compensation, but CIOC also claims non-material damages in respect of the moral harm that CIOC, its majority owner, senior management and employees have suffered at the hands of Kazakhstan.*\n\n*9. For five years CIOC had successfully, and without any serious controversy, pursued its investment. New oil wells were drilled and Soviet-era ones were reopened, extensive geological testing and exploration work was carried out, infrastructure was installed at the field and pilot production commenced. Suddenly in mid 2007, the political landscape changed. A political rivalry that had developed between President Nazarbayev and his powerful son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev flared into open hostility. In Kazakhstan\u2019s campaign to persecute Rakhat Aliyev that followed, it seems it became no longer politically convenient for Kazakhstan to allow CIOC to continue its business since the brother of Devincci Hourani, CIOC\u2019s majority owner, is Rakhat Aliyev\u2019s brother-in-law. A reasonable person might have thought that CIOC was sufficiently far removed from the dispute between the President and Rakhat Aliyev however, in Kazakhstan, \"politics is a family affair\"2. Family, business partners and associates of Rakhat Aliyev have all been victimised in the course of the fall out between the President and Mr Aliyev.*\n\n*10. As a result, CIOC, its majority owner, senior management and employees have been subjected to a campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution at the hands of the Kazakh authorities. As at the date of this Memorial the victimisation continues. Armed guards remain at the site of CIOC\u2019s oilfield and its offices in Aktobe. Kazakh authorities have seized and still retain (amongst other items) large numbers of CIOC\u2019s documents and files, as well as corporate seals and computer hard drives from CIOC\u2019s head office in Almaty, its branch office in Aktobe and from the oil field itself. Devincci Hourani, his brothers and his senior manager Omar Antar feel unable to return to Kazakhstan. CIOC is not the only investment that Devincci Hourani has lost as a result of the abusive exercise of Kazakh sovereign power. He and his brothers have lost all their substantial business interests in Kazakhstan.*\n\n*11. Kazakh officials concocted unsubstantiated allegations that CIOC was in breach of its contractual obligations as a pretext for what was no more than a politically-motivated campaign against the company and its owner. CIOC\u2019s answers to these allegations went unheard and unanswered. In its haste to purport to terminate the Contract, Kazakhstan also failed to follow the stipulated legal procedures.*\n\n*12. The Tribunal is likely to read and hear a great deal about CIOC\u2019s performance of its obligations under the Contract during the course of this proceeding, but this case is not about CIOC\u2019s contractual performance, which in any event provided no reason for complaint let alone termination. In the normal course, a contractual counterpart does not substantiate its grounds for termination by seizing the other party\u2019s majority owner from his bed in the middle of the night and subject him to hours of questioning at its interior Ministry. In the normal course, the focus of such questioning would not be on the owner\u2019s family relationship with the President\u2019s sworn political enemy. In the normal course, it would also be highly unlikely that parties would mutually agree to extend a contract by a further two years, for one party later to allege that all along the other had been in material breach. But this is not a normal case, and the dispute at its heart is not at all about contractual termination.\"*\n\nAs reported by BBC News, see **Exhibit C-21** to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n**C.II. The Respondent\u2019s Perspective**\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nIn its Summary Reply to Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration Respondent inter alia states (R-I, para. 6):\n\n*\"6. [...] Respondent will show that all of the claims currently brought by Claimant relate to lawful actions the Republic took in an effort to obtain that to which it was rightfully entitled, namely Claimant\u2019s proper performance of the Contract. Despite Claimant\u2019s contention to the contrary, Respondent will demonstrate that the termination notices issued by the Republic were justified.\"*\n\n**D. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 June 2008 Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Kazakhstan pursuant to the USA-Kazakhstan Bilateral Investment Treaty of 19 May 1992, following the unilateral termination of the contract No. 954 of 27 May 2002 (as amended) in relation to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons, inter alia in the Caratube Field, by the order of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of Kazakhstan dated 30 January 2008.\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 February 2009 the Tribunal was constituted. By ICSID letter of 23 February 2009 the Parties were also informed that Mr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn a letter of 25 February 2009, the Secretary of the Tribunal Mr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds drew the attention of the Parties to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14 which provides for periodic advance payments to be made to the Centre by parties to ICSID arbitration proceedings in order to enable the Centre to meet the costs of such proceedings, including the fees and expenses of arbitrators. The Centre estimated, after consultation with the President of the Tribunal, that an amount of US$200,000 (two hundred thousand United States dollars) would be required to meet the costs to be incurred in the proceeding during the next three to six months, including the costs related to the first session of the Tribunal. Pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d), each party was accordingly requested to pay the sum of US$100,000 (one hundred thousand United States dollars). Pursuant to Regulation 14, each advance payment of US$100,000 (one hundred thousand United States dollars) was to be made in full thirty days after the request for payment has been made, i.e., on or before 27 March 2009 to the account of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Account holder) in New York.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal, by letter of 25 February 2009, referred to Rule 13 of ICSID Arbitration Rules which provides that the first session of the Tribunal should take place within 60 days after the Tribunal\u2019s constitution, unless the Parties agree otherwise, and proposed to hold the First Session at the Frankfurt International Arbitration Centre, Germany, on 16 April 2009. Parties were invited to submit any observations concerning the date and venue by 4 March 2009. The President of the Tribunal further invited the Parties to confer and jointly advise the Tribunal by 25 March 2009 of any points of the provisional agenda attached, on which they were able to reach agreement.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2009 the President wrote to Respondent referring to Respondent\u2019s reservation of all defenses to the claims asserted in the present proceeding, including jurisdictional defenses, as stated in different letters from the Respondent, such as that of 17 February 2009. The Tribunal informed the Respondent that *\"the Tribunal would be grateful if the Respondent could submit, by March 31, 2009, and without prejudice to later submissions, a short Summary Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration in order to have a more balanced picture of the dispute before the First Session.\"*\n\n9.\n\nBy letters of 3 and 4 March 2009 respectively both Parties agreed with the venue and date for the First Session of the Tribunal (as proposed by Tribunal\u2019s letter of 25 February 2009).\n\n10.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal informed the Parties by letter dated 10 March 2009 of the precise time (9.30 am) and the exact venue (room) for the First Session of the Tribunal. The President of the Tribunal further asked the Parties to submit, by 25 March 2009, a list of the persons who would be attending the session, indicating their affiliation to the relevant Party.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 25 March 2009 Claimant informed the Tribunal that both Parties were working on the matters set out on the draft agenda (as proposed by the Tribunal in a letter of 25 February 2009) and - in the name of both Parties -requested an extension until 3 April 2009.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal, by letter of 25 March 2009, communicated its agreement to the Parties\u2019 proposal to send a joint submission on the matters set out in the draft agenda of the first session on or before 3 April 2009.\n\n13.\n\nOn 31 March 2009 Respondent submitted its Summary Reply to Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nBy Joint Submission of 3 April 2009 the Parties informed the Tribunal about the items on the agenda of the First session on which they were able to reach agreement.\n\n15.\n\nOn 14 April 2009 Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures. The Request was accompanied by a file of supporting materials comprising 31 exhibits (referenced as Annexes 1 to 31) and eight legal authorities (Annexes 32 to 39).\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 April 2009 the Tribunal held its First Session at the Frankfurt International Arbitration Centre, Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce, Borsenplatz 4, 60313 Frankfurt and discussed procedural matters with the Parties.\n\n17.\n\nThe First Session on 16 April 2009 was attended by:\n\n(a) Members of the Tribunal:\n\nProfessor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, President\n\nDr. Kamal Hossain, Arbitrator\n\nDr. Gavan Griffith QC, Arbitrator (absent)\n\n(b) ICSID Secretariat:\n\nMr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n(c) Attending on behalf of the Claimant:\n\nMr. Devincci Hourani, Caratube International\n\nMr. Qassim Omar, Caratube International\n\nMr. Omar Antar, Caratube International\n\nMs. Judith Gill, Allen & Overy LLP\n\nMr. Jan Schafer, Allen & Overy LLP\n\n(d) Attending on behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMr. Peter M. Wolrich, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Geoffroy Lyonnet, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Galileo Pozzoli, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\n18.\n\nThe draft version of the Minutes of the First Session of 16 April 2009 was provided to the Parties by letter of 23 April 2009. Parties were given time until 30 April 2009 for commenting on the contents of the draft minutes.\n\n19.\n\nIn a letter of 24 April 2009 Claimant informed the Tribunal about the raids of Claimant\u2019s regional office in Actobe (16 April 2009), its head office in Almaty (17 April 2009) and its site office at Caratube oilfield (17 April 2009) by officers of the Kazakhstan\u2019s Committee of National Security (KNB). Representatives of KNB, which is Kazakhstan\u2019s security and intelligence agency, searched the offices and seized *\"voluminous records including documents, files, computer disks and hard drives, and other materials\".* The letter also reported that *\"KNB officers interrogated CIOC staff. The officers expressly stated that they were seeking information to establish that Mr Devincci Hourani is not in fact the majority owner of CIOC\"*. Claimant stressed that the raids took place on the day of the first session of the Tribunal and the next day. The letter of the Claimant was accompanied by Protocols of Search and requested the issuance of provisional measures by the Tribunal..\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 27 April 2009 the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit any comments concerning provisional measures as requested by Claimant in its letter of 24 April 2009 by 29 April 2009.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of 29 April 2009 Respondent submitted brief comments on Claimant\u2019s requests for provisional measures and referred to the timetable agreed upon in the first session on 16 April 2009 which provided for a deadline of 15 June 2009 for Respondent to submit a response to the Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 April 2009 Claimant submitted the Amended Request for Provisional Measures. From Claimant\u2019s perspective the amendment of the initial Request for Provisional Measures became necessary following the raids by KNB officers on 16, 17 and 26 April 2009 at Caratube oilfield. Claimant introduced three new exhibits (C-50 to C-52) and provided a consolidated index of the Claimant\u2019s exhibits and authorities.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent confirmed by letter of 30 April 2009 that it had reviewed the draft Minutes of the First session and had no comments in this respect.\n\n24.\n\nClaimant by letter of 30 April 2009 commented on the draft Minutes of the Hearing of 16 April 2009 and proposed two clarifications.\n\n25.\n\nThe final version of the minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal was sent to the Parties on 4 May 2009 including the following provisions relevant in the present context:\n\n***\"I. PROCEDURAL MATTERS***\n\n***...5. Applicable Arbitration Rules (Convention Article 44)***\n\n*The ICSID Arbitration Rules as amended and effective on 10 April 2006, shall apply to the proceedings.*\n\n***6.

By 19 March 2010:*\n\n*Tribunal rules on applications.*\n\n*14.11. The parties shall produce the documents so ordered by 16 April 2010.*\n\n***II. OTHER MATTERS***\n\n***20. Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures***\n\n*The Tribunal noted that the Claimant submitted on 14 April 2009 a request for provisional measures.*\n\n*The Respondent shall submit its response to the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures on 15 June 2009 (within two months from the first session). The Respondent noted that, if necessary, it may request an extension of this deadline.*\n\n*A hearing on provisional measures is provisionally fixed by 30 June 2009 in London, if considered necessary by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n*If the need arises, the Tribunal shall request from the parties additional information prior to issuing its decision on the Claimant\u2019s request.\"*\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 4 May 2009 the Tribunal informed the Parties that in view of the new developments reported by Claimant and the Amended Request for Provisional Measures it considered necessary to hold a Hearing on Provisional Measures in London on 30 June 2009. The venue of the hearing, which would start at 9.30 am, would be the International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC) located at 70 Fleet Street, London. In the same letter the Tribunal stated that Respondent should submit its Reply Memorial to the Claimant\u2019s Requests by 15 June 2009 and underlined that no extension of this date could be granted in view of the above.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of 11 May 2009 the Parties were informed that in accordance with \u00a7 21 of the Minutes of the First Session the President of the Tribunal - in view of the urgent developments of the procedure regarding provisional measures -appointed Mr. Dmitry Marenkov as Assistant. The Parties were invited to submit any comments they might have by 14 May 2009. No comments were received from the Parties.\n\nPursuant to the timetable agreed upon in the First session on 16 April 2009, Claimant on 14 May 2009 submitted its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n28.\n\nIn a letter dated 19 May 2009 Claimant referred to *\"continued and intolerable events at the Claimant\u2019s branch office in Aktobe\"*. The Claimant stated that travel and identity documents of two CIOC\u2019s Palestinian overseas workers (Mr. Rashid Badran and Mr. Nader Hourani) had been seized and remained confiscated. Claimant urged Respondent to return the respective documents and that *\"If a resolution is not reached in the interim, these matters will be raised again at the hearing to take place in London on 30 June 2009\".*\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 2 June 2009 the Tribunal sent the Parties a draft Procedural Order No. 1 regarding details of the Hearing in London on 30 June 2009 to deal with Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures. Parties were given the opportunity to comment on the contents of the draft Procedural Order No. 1 by 17 June 2009.\n\n30.\n\nOn 10 June 2009 Mr. K. Safinov, an Executive Secretary of Kazakhstan\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, wrote a letter replying to Claimant\u2019s letter of 9 December 2008 dealing with issues of negotiations on the hand-over of the Contract Area (Exhibit R-1).\n\n31.\n\nOn 15 June 2009 Respondent submitted a Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures together with its exhibits (including four CD-ROMs).\n\n32.\n\nBy letters of 17 June 2009 both Parties confirmed that they had reviewed the draft Procedural Order No. 1 and had no comments thereon.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 18 June 2009 Parties were provided with the final version of Procedural Order No. 1 which stated:\n\n***\"Procedural Order (PO) No. 1***\n\n***Regarding details of the Hearing in London on June 30, 2009 To deal with Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures***\n\n*The draft of PO-1 was sent to the Parties for comments by 17 June 2009. In view of the short time available after the Respondent\u2019s Response Brief due by 15 June 2009, and to allow input from the Parties before the Tribunal issues the PO in time before the hearing on 30 June, 2009, the draft was sent now, but subject to any reconsideration after that Response Brief has been submitted. Since the Parties have not suggested any changes in their submissions of 17 June 2007, it is now issued in its final version.*\n\n*The **direct mailing** of the Respondent\u2019s Response according to sections 3.1 and 3.2 below was made by 15 June 2009 before the PO is issued after 17 June.*\n\n***1. PLACE AND TIME OF HEARING****:***\n\n*1.1. The Hearing shall take place at the*\n\n***International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC)***\n\n***In London***\n\n***70 Fleet Street***\n\n***on June 30, 2009**.*\n\n*1.2. The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. and conclude at 1:00 p.m, unless otherwise determined by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n*1.3. Should the hearing not be extended into the afternoon, the Tribunal intends to deliberate on its decision that same afternoon.*\n\n***2. Earlier Ruling***\n\n*2.1. The Tribunal recalls from the Minutes of the 1st Session in this case:*\n\n*\u00a7 8 regarding Records of Hearings*\n\n*\u00a7 13 regarding Written and Oral procedures*\n\n*\u00a7 20 regarding the Procedure on Provisional Measures.*\n\n***3. Preparatory Steps***\n\n*3.1. In view of the very short time before the Hearing and to allow the members of the Tribunal sufficient time to evaluate the submissions, the submissions under sections 3.2 and 3.3 below shall be made, both by courier and by e-mail, not only to ICSID, but also **directly to the addresses of the members of the Tribunal.** In that context, courier submissions to CoArbitrator Griffith shall be sent to his address at Essex Court Chambers, London.*\n\n*3.2. The Respondent\u2019s Response to the Claimant\u2019s Request due on **15 June 2009** shall be made also directly to the addresses of the Tribunal as provided in section 3.1. above.*\n\n*3.3. **By June 22, 2009**, the Parties shall submit*\n\n*1) lists of the persons attending the hearing from their respective sides,*\n\n*2) any documents (in the form provided in \u00a7 9.8 of the Minutes of the 1st Session) they intend to rely on during the hearing in addition to the documents they have submitted with their briefs, accompanied by a short explanation of the documents newly submitted.*\n\n*3.4. The Tribunal has taken note of the many and voluminous exhibits submitted by the Parties up to this point. As only a limited number of these exhibits will be used at the Hearing on Provisional Measures, to avoid that all exhibits have to be transported to London, the members of the Tribunal intend to bring to the Hearing what they consider the most relevant documents, but, in order to facilitate and speed up references to documents during the hearing, the Parties shall prepare and provide in the hearing room **at the beginning of the Hearing:***\n\n*\\* For the other Party and each member, the Secretary, and the Assistant of the Tribunal, \"**Hearing Binders\"** containing copies of those exhibits or parts of exhibits to which they intend to refer in their oral presentations at the Hearing,*\n\n*\\* one full set of all documents so far submitted in this procedure.*\n\n***4. Conduct of the Hearing***\n\n*4.1. No new documents may be presented at the Hearing. But demonstrative exhibits may be shown using documents submitted earlier in accordance with the timetable or with this Order.*\n\n*4.2. The Tribunal has taken note of the written submissions by the Parties and there is no need to repeat the contents of such submissions.*\n\n*4.3. Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal, the **Agenda of the Hearing** shall be as follows:*\n\n*1. Short Introduction by Chairman of Tribunal.*\n\n*2. Opening Statement by Claimant of up to 30 minutes.*\n\n*3. Opening Statement by Respondent of up to 30 minutes.*\n\n*4. Questions by the Tribunal.*\n\n*5. Closing Statements by the Claimant of up to 30 minutes.*\n\n*6. Closing Statements by the Respondent of up to 30 minutes.*\n\n*7. Further questions by the Tribunal, if any.*\n\n*8.

Changes of Rulings***\n\n*The Tribunal may change any of the rulings in this Order, if considered appropriate under the circumstances.\"*\n\n34.\n\nIn its letter of 22 June 2009 (Exhibit C-138) Claimant\u2019s counsel referred to the letter by Mr. Safinov, Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, of 10 June 2009 in which the latter replied to Claimant\u2019s letter of 9 December 2008 and expressed his interest and readiness to meet with Claimant\u2019s representatives to discuss the handover of the Contract Area:\n\n*\"Notwithstanding this delay of over six months, our client remains willing to meet with representatives of the Ministry to discuss an orderly handover of the Contract Area. However, we propose that such a meeting should take place at the Contract Area on 24, 25, or 26 June 2009. [...] If the parties are not able to reach agreement as a result of that meeting, the Tribunal will still be able to consider CIOC\u2019s request for provisional measures as to the orderly handover of the Contract Area at the hearing in London on 30 June 2009.\"*\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 22 June 2009 Claimant - in accordance with para. 3.3 of PO 1 -provided a list of six individuals who would be attending the Hearing in London on 30 June 2009 on behalf of Claimant. Claimant\u2019s response of 22 June 2009 to Respondent\u2019s letter of 10 June 2009 (Exhibit R-1) was introduced as Exhibit C-138 and attached to this letter. Claimant stated that this letter might be relied upon during the Hearing on 30 June 2009.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent informed the Tribunal by letter of 22 June 2009 with reference to PO No. 1 the persons who would be attending the Hearing concerning Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures on 30 June 2009 on behalf of the Respondent. Respondent further stated in this letter that it did not intend to rely during the hearing on any documents other than those that were submitted by the Parties with their briefs as of the date thereof.\n\n37.\n\nBy letter of 24 June 2009 Claimant informed that it wished to add Mr. Kassem Omar, minority participant in CIOC, to the list of attendees on behalf of the Claimant.\n\n38.\n\nWith reference to Claimant\u2019s letter dated 22 June 2009 Respondent by its letter of 24 June 2009 (Exhibit R-4) communicated that it was logistically impossible to organize the meeting on any of the dates (24, 25 or 26 June 2009) proposed by Claimant. Respondent confirmed its willingness to have constructive meetings at the Contract Area. However, Respondent would need - the letter further stated - to send a number of representatives to the meeting who could not be available on such short notice. Respondent\u2019s letter further stated that there were no conditions concerning the handover of the Contract Area beyond those stated in the letter of 10 June 2009 by Respondent\u2019s Mr. Safinov. Any specific terms would have to emerge from discussions between the Parties.\n\n39.\n\nBy e-mail of 29 June 2009 Claimant provided an Index of the Hearing Bundle listing Exhibits and Authorities relied upon by the Claimant. A further e-mail attachment contained Procedural Order No. 3 in the ICSID Case (No. ARB/05/22) *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *United Republic of Tanzania.*\n\n40.\n\nA hearing on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures was held on 30 June 2009 in London, UK. The Hearing was attended by:\n\n(a) Members of the Tribunal:\n\nProfessor Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, President\n\nDr. Kamal Hossain, Arbitrator\n\nDr. Gavan Griffith QC, Arbitrator\n\n(b) Attending on behalf of the Claimant:\n\nMs. Judith Gill, Allen & Overy LLP\n\nMr. Matthew Gearing, Allen & Overy LLP\n\nMr. Anthony Sinclair, Allen & Overy LLP\n\nMr. Alexander Thavenot, Allen & Overy LLP\n\nMr. Omar Antar, Caratube International\n\nMr. Devincci Hourani, Caratube International\n\nMr. Kassem Omar, Caratube International\n\n(c) Attending on behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMr. Peter M. Wolrich, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMs. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Geoffroy Lyonnet, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\nMr. Galileo Pozzoli, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP\n\n41.\n\nA transcript of the Hearing was prepared by the court reporter Mrs. Claire Hill and provided by e-mail of 30 June 2009.\n\n42.\n\nBy letter of 1 July 2009 Claimant confirmed that its representatives would be able to attend the handover meeting on 8 and 9 July 2009. Claimant proposed *\"that the aim of the meeting should be to agree an inventory of the infrastructure, equipment, and machinery at the Contract Area with a view to completing the full handover of the Contract Area on an 'as is\u2019 basis by the end of the meeting\".* Claimant further informed that its representatives Mr. Rashid Badran, Mr. Moussa Abdelghani and Mr. Nadir Hourani would need to travel to the Contract Area on 7 July 2009 and remain there until the handover meeting has been concluded. Claimant requested Respondent\u2019s confirmation that Mr. Badran\u2019s and Mr. Hourani\u2019s identity documents which had been seized by KNB would be returned. Claimant also asked Respondent to provide assurance that Claimant\u2019s representatives would not be detained or obstructed by either the KNB or any other Kazakh authority when they travelled to the Contract Area. In this letter Claimant also informed that - since CIOC\u2019s senior management was currently not able to enter Kazakhstan due to the actions of the Republic - it decided to instruct a representative of TRACS International Consultancy Ltd., Ms. Svetlana Ternovaya, to attend the handover meeting in order to assist Mr. Badran. Claimant asked Respondent to provide an assurance that neither the KNB nor any other Kazakh authority would hinder her travel to the Contract Area. Finally, Claimant also asked to confirm that neither KNB nor any other Kazakh authority would impede the access of Mr. Badran, Mr. Abdelghani and Ms. Ternovaya to the Contract Area and that each such authority would allow them to move freely around the area and not hinder their ability to prepare the inventory. A draft handover agreement prepared by Claimant was attached to the letter.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent replied by letter of 3 July 2009 stating that it was prepared to proceed in a constructive manner with the handover process, starting the meetings at the oil field, as requested by CIOC and described Claimant\u2019s concerns regarding a possible impediment to the ability of CIOC\u2019s representatives, including the three members of CIOC\u2019s personnel mentioned in Claimant\u2019s letter of 1 July 2009 as well as Ms. Svetlana Ternovaya to properly participate in this process, on site or otherwise, due to the anticipated interventions of the Republic as \"unwarranted\". The letter further stated *: \"We nonetheless consulted with representatives of the Republic who confirmed the above to us\".* As to the aim of the meeting and the timing of the handover process, Respondent proposed to remain within the initial common grounds resulting from the terms of Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures and MEMR\u2019s letter of 10 June 2009 and expressed its belief that the meeting should be geared towards making as much progress as possible in view of an orderly handover. Finally, Respondent stated that it was in the process of reviewing the draft handover agreement prepared by Claimant and would get back in due course with its comments, most probably after the meeting in order to take into account matters that came up at the meeting.\n\n44.\n\nOn 6 July 2009 Claimant submitted a letter *\"to bring to the Tribunal\u2019s attention yet more disturbing events that have taken place in Kazakhstan against the Claimant.\"* Claimant\u2019s letter reported that *\"the Republic\u2019s flagrant disregard for the arbitration process was again demonstrated over this last weekend.\"* It mentioned that the offices of Hourani family companies at 92A Polezhaeva in Almaty were again visited on 5 July 2009 by the Finance Police informing that the Kazakh Prosecutor\u2019s Office had decided to confiscate all properties owned by the Claimant\u2019s Director, Mr. Hussam Hourani, including restaurant premises and six residential apartments. *\"This was expressly stated to be in connection with the criminal proceedings against Mr. Hourani and the Claimant in respect of the limited oil production at the Contract Area following the purported termination and expropriation on 1 February 2008; in other words precisely those proceedings which are the subject of the pending application to the Tribunal.\"* The Claimant therefore maintained that *\"these actions constitute yet further harassment of the Claimant and its Director. Such actions only serve to reinforce the urgent need for the Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction and grant the recommendations sought by the Claimant in its application\".*\n\n45.\n\nClaimant presented another letter dated 6 July 2009 referring to Respondent\u2019s letter of 3 July 2009. Claimant complained about the ambiguity of Respondent\u2019s assertions and stated that it was *\"patently inadequate to address the matters raised in our letter. We should therefore make clear that we treat your letter as an unqualified representation by counsel on behalf of the Republic that:*\n\n*\u2022 The Republic will return Mr. Rashid Badran\u2019s and Mr. Nadir Hourani\u2019s identity documents so that they can travel to the Contract Area for the purpose of the scheduled meeting; and*\n\n*\u2022 The Republic\u2019s assurance that none of Mr. Badran, Mr. Hourani or Mr. Moussa Abdelghani will not be detained or obstructed by either the KNB or any other Kazakh authority in attempting to travel to the Contract Area; and*\n\n*\u2022 The Republic\u2019s assurance that neither the KNB nor any other Kazakh authority will hinder Ms. Svetlana Ternovaya of TRACS International Consultyncy Ltd. travelling to the Contract Area; and*\n\n*\u2022 The Republic\u2019s assurance that neither the KNB nor any other Kazakh authority will impede the access of Mr. Badran, Mr. Abdelghani, Mr. Houranim and Ms. Ternovaya to the Contract Area, and will allow them to move freely around the area and not hinder their ability to prepare the inventory.*\n\n*If in fact the Republic is not providing such assurances please say so in unambiguous terms and forthwirth (i.e. not later than 10am CET tomorrow, 7 July 2009). [...] The handover can and should take place without delay in a matter of days or, at most, weeks.\"*\n\n46.\n\nCounsel for Respondent Mr. Lyonnet replied by e-mail of 6 July 2009 stating:\n\n*\"With reference to your letter of today, I have been advised that the Republic is putting everything in place so that the meetings will proceed smoothly. I understand that Mr. Badran has been in direct contact with representatives of the Republic and that all necessary arrangements are being made. I also understand that the appropriate representatives of the Republic are either already in or on their way to Aktobe.\"*\n\n47.\n\nBy letter of 7 July 2009 Claimant submitted an additional authority, a ruling in the ICSID case (No. ARB/08/5) *Burlington Resources Inc. and Others v. Republic of Ecuador and Another* and drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention specifically to:\n\n\u2022 section C2 at paras. 59 to 68 (and in particular paras. 60 and 66)\n\n\u2022 section D (and in particular paras. 73 and 74 on the question of urgency in the context of a request for a recommendation on the non-aggravation of a dispute); and\n\n\u2022 the Tribunal\u2019s Orders nos. 7 and 8 on page 29 of the decision.\n\n48.\n\nPursuant to the schedule agreed upon at the First Session, Respondent by letter of 9 July 2009 informed the Tribunal that it would not request bifurcation of the proceedings. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), Respondent reserved its right to submit objections to jurisdiction together with its Counter-Memorial on the merits.\n\n49.\n\nOn 10 July 2009 Claimant provided a Consolidated Index of all Exhibits and Authorities submitted by the Claimant. It included the two documents produced for the Provisional Measures hearing which are now indexed as \"Exhibit C-138\" and \"Authority C-77\".\n\n**E. The Principal Relevant Legal Provisions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**E.I. BIT Kazakhstan - USA**\n-----------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe principal relevant legal provision for this arbitration in the USA-Kazakhstan Bilateral Investment Treaty of 19 May 1992 (entered into force on 12 January 1994) is:\n\n*\"ARTICLE VI*\n\n*1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party\u2019s foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.*\n\n*2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a Party to the dispute; or*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.*\n\n*3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:*\n\n*(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a Party to such Convention; or*\n\n*(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or*\n\n*(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or*\n\n*(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.*\n\n*(b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either Party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.*\n\n*4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n*(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and*\n\n*(b) an \"agreement in writing,\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").*\n\n*5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a Party to the New York Convention.*\n\n*6. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement.*\n\n*7. In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not assert, as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or company concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its alleged damages.*\n\n*8. For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"*\n\n**E.II. Relevant ICSID Provisions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn respect of the provisional measures requested by Claimant, the principal relevant legal provisions are Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of ICSID Arbitration Rules:\n\n***\"Article 47 ICSID Convention***\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"*\n\n***\"Rule 39***\n\n***Provisional Measures***\n\n*(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\"*\n\n*(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.*\n\n*(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\"*\n\n**F. Relief Sought by the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**F.I. Relief Sought by Claimant**\n----------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAs identified in the Request for Arbitration of 16 June 2008 (C-I, paras. 8386) Claimant asks the Tribunal to award as follows:\n\n*\"83. Kazakhstan\u2019s violations of the Treaty have caused substantial losses to [Claimant]. Under international law principles, the [BIT] and applicable Kazakh law, [Claimant] is entitled to be placed in the position in which it would have been had its rights not been violated.*\n\n*84. In addition, Claimant is entitled to damages under the Contract and other specific contractual entitlements, as will be detailed in Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim. Specifically, [Claimant] is entitled to damages arising from third party claims made against it, e.g. by its subcontractors, as well as reimbursement of its exploration costs of more than USD 35,000,000 pursuant to Clause 10.6 of the Contract and all other losses including those arising from its inability to pursue the Commercial Discovery.*\n\n*85. [Claimant] will quantify and support its computation of its losses in due course. It is clear, however, from the information currently available that [Claimant's] lost profits from the Production of the reserves which it had already identified and was entitled to exploit under the Contract will exceed USD 2 billion. In particular, even on the basis of the extremely conservative official reserves estimates referred to in paragraph 26 above, C-1 and C-2 reserves in the part of the Field contracted to [Claimant] exceed 10,600,000 tonnes (or 77,380,ooo barrels) (in the whole Field the reserves exceed 11,318,000 tonnes or 82,621,400 barrels). Under the Russian system of classification of oil reserves, both classifications designate a high degree of reliability as to the estimate. For ease of reference, one ton of crude oil equals 7.3 barrels and, currently, one barrel of crude oil sells at approximately USD 135 on the world market. The figures were subject to increase and transfer of all C-2 reserves to C-1 reserves after finalisation of the scheduled exploration programme in May 2009.*\n\n*86. Accordingly the Claimant requests the following relief:*\n\n*(i) an order declaring that Kazakhstan has violated Articles II(2)(a), (b) and*\n\n*(c) as well as Article III of the BIT, as well as its obligations under international law, Kazakh law and the Contract;*\n\n*(ii) an order directing Kazakhstan to pay damages equivalent to the financial loss and damage, including lost profit, which [Claimant] has suffered as a result of Kazakhstan\u2019s breaches of the BIT as well as its obligations under international law, Kazakh law and the Contract;*\n\n*(iii) an order directing Kazakhstan to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID, as well as legal and other expenses incurred by [Claimant] including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants and those of [Claimant's] own employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment; and*\n\n*(iv) such other relief as the arbitral tribunal may deem just and proper.\"*\n\n53.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial of 14 May 2009 contains the following prayer for relief (C-IV, para. 285):\n\n*\"285. For the foregoing reasons, CIOC hereby requests:*\n\n*(1) orders adjudging and declaring:*\n\n*(a) that Kazakhstan has violated Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty, by failing to accord to CIOC\u2019s investment \"fair and equitable treatment\";*\n\n*(b) that Kazakhstan has violated Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty, by failing to ensure that CIOC\u2019s investment \"shall enjoy full protection and security\";*\n\n*(c) that Kazakhstan has violated Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty, by failing to ensure that CIOC\u2019s investment shall not be accorded \"treatment less than that required by international law\";*\n\n*(d) that Kazakhstan has violated Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty, by impairing CIOC\u2019s investment \"by arbitrary or discriminatory measures\";*\n\n*(e) that Kazakhstan has violated Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty, by failing to \"observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\";*\n\n*(f) that Kazakhstan has violated Article III of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating CIOC\u2019s investment:*\n\n*(i) without public purpose;*\n\n*(ii) in a discriminatory manner; or*\n\n*(iii) not in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2) of the Treaty;*\n\n*(g) that Kazakhstan has violated Article III of the Treaty by expropriating CIOC\u2019s investment without payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; or*\n\n*(h) that Kazakhstan has violated its legal obligations under customary international law, Kazakh law and the Contract;*\n\n*(2) an order directing Kazakhstan to pay to CIOC the sum of **USD 1,005.7 million**, being damages or compensation for the violations listed in subparagraphs 1(a) to (h) above and determined by reference to the \"fair market value\" of CIOC\u2019s investment as at 31 January 2008, in \"fully realizable\" and \"freely transferable\" currency;\"*\n\n**F.II. Provisional Measures Requested by Claimant**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn its Amended Request of 29 April 2009 Claimant requests the following provisional measures (C-III, para. 53):\n\n***\"3.2 The measures requested***\n\n*53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(a) that within 30 days of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order, representatives of Kazakhstan meet with representatives of CIOC at the Contract Area in order to discuss and agree upon the orderly hand-over of the Contract Area;*\n\n*(b) that within 120 days of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order, or within such other period as the parties may agree, and without prejudice to the parties\u2019 claims in this arbitration, Kazakhstan accepts CIOC\u2019s relinquishment of the field at Kazakhstan\u2019s own expense and risk;*\n\n*(c) that Kazakhstan takes measures to ensure the preservation of all documents, files, computer disks and all other materials taken from CIOC\u2019s offices in Aktobe and Almaty and from the Caratube oilfield since 16 April 2009 and that all such materials, including the corporate seals, are returned to CIOC care of its solicitors, Allen & Overy LLP, within 5 days of the Tribunal\u2019s order;*\n\n*(d) that, in order to avoid an unnecessary aggravation of the dispute, Kazakhstan and all departments, agencies, emanations and other persons for which it is legally responsible stop immediately any harassment of the employees, directors and owners of CIOC, including their families;*\n\n*(e) that Kazakhstan desists from any conduct which violates the parties\u2019 duties of good faith and equality in this arbitration;*\n\n*(f) that Kazakhstan refrain from taking any other measures in relation to CIOC that would aggravate the present dispute; and*\n\n*(g) that for the duration of these arbitration proceedings, the Kazakh authorities do not act upon any existing criminal complaints against CIOC or file any new complaints arising out of CIOC\u2019s continued occupation of the field and activities after 1 February 2008.\"*\n\n**F.III. Relief Sought by Respondent**\n--------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn its Summary Reply to Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration of 31 March 2009 (R-I, paras. 4-7) Respondent seeks the following relief:\n\n*\"4. [\u2026] Based on the facts presently available to it, Respondent has serious doubts as to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s Treaty claims and Respondent fully reserves its right to object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over those Treaty claims. The nature and extent of these objections depend on documents that are now in the possession and control of Claimant and therefore Respondent will not be in a position to formulate jurisdictional objections until Claimant provides adequate responses to Respondent\u2019s evidentiary request. Thus, Respondent hereby respectfully asks the Tribunal to enforce its evidentiary request pursuant to the authority granted to the Tribunal by Rules 33 and 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 43 of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*5. [\u2026] While it is Respondent\u2019s view that this dispute is at its core a contract dispute, Respondent, in the absence of evidence as to the true nature of the purported investor and investment, is unable to determine whether Claimant has stated a claim arising from the Contract which meets the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction until it receives Claimant\u2019s response to Respondent\u2019s evidentiary request (attached as Annex A).*\n\n*6. With respect to the merits, if the Tribunal were to determine that it has jurisdiction to hear any of Claimant\u2019s claims, Respondent will demonstrate in the course of this arbitration that those claims are not meritorious. Respondent will show that all of the claims currently brought by Claimant relate to lawful actions the Republic took in an effort to obtain that to which it was rightfully entitled, namely Claimant\u2019s proper performance of the Contract. Despite Claimant\u2019s contention to the contrary, Respondent will demonstrate that the termination notices issued by the Republic were justified.*\n\n*7. The Republic of Kazakhstan hereby expressly and without prejudice reserves its rights as follows:*\n\n*a. The Republic reserves its right to contest jurisdiction with regard to any and all claims brought by Claimant;*\n\n*b. The Republic reserves its right to request bifurcation of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of its jurisdictional objections, if any, to be filed as soon as possible after receipt of the documents requested in Annex A attached hereto, from the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the merits of the case;*\n\n*c. The Republic reserves its right to request provisional measures as provided for in Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and to raise any ancillary claims it deems appropriate as provided for by Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules; and*\n\n*d. The Republic reserves the right to request the production of additional evidence relevant to this dispute as provided by Rules 33 and 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"*\n\n56.\n\nRespondent\u2019s evidentiary Request for Production of Documents (R-I, Annex A) reads as follows:\n\n***\"Annex A***\n\n***Respondent\u2019s Request for Production of Documents***\n\n*Pursuant to Rules 33 and 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, Respondent hereby respectfully requests that the Tribunal require Claimant to produce the documents described below. The information requested is solely in the possession or control of Claimant and is needed to evaluate whether ICSID has jurisdiction over this dispute.*\n\n*1. Documents related to Devincci Salah Hourani\u2019s citizenship, in particular:*\n\n*a. Documents such as naturalization papers indicating the date and nature of Mr. Hourani\u2019s acquisition of United States citizenship;*\n\n*b.

United States federal or state voter registration records or a statement that no such registration was made;*\n\n*d. Copies of US tax filings for the years 2002-2008, if any, or, if no such filings were made, confirmation that no tax returns were filed by Mr. Hourani;*\n\n*e. Documents related to any other citizenship currently or previously held by Mr. Hourani indicating the date and nature of the acquisition of that citizenship and/or the date and nature of the relinquishment, abandonment or denunciation of that citizenship; and*\n\n*f. Copies of any and all passports, including but not limited to his United States passport, possessed by Mr. Hourani in the period from January 1, 2002 to June 16, 2008, including the identity page and all pages indicating exit or entry into any country.*\n\n*2. Corporate records related to the ownership of shares of Caratube International Oil Company LLP (\"CIOC\"), in particular:*\n\n*a.

Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nRespondent in its Response to the Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures of 15 June 2009 (R-II, paras. 33-34) requests the following:\n\n*\"33. In conclusion, the Republic respectfully requests that this Tribunal reject CIOC\u2019s requests for provisional measures. It has been shown that the requests concerning the hand-over of the Contract Area have been rendered moot by the Republic\u2019s letter to CIOC dated June 10, 2009 in which the Republic agrees to meet with CIOC representatives and proceed with the taking over of the Contract Area subject to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions for the hand-over. It has also been shown that the two remaining categories of CIOC\u2019s requests fail to meet the criteria to be applied in determining whether to grant provisional measures.*\n\n*34. The Republic respectfully submits that it would be wise to let the parties proceed with the hand-over in the absence of pro-active measures by the Tribunal, which may well be more counterproductive than helpful\".*\n\n**G. Short Summary of Contentions Regarding Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**G.I. Short Summary of Contentions by Claimant**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nClaimant substantiates the need for ordering provisional measures (C-III, paras.1-61) as follows:\n\n*\"1. In this Application, CIOC seeks recommendations from the Tribunal:*\n\n*(a) as to the orderly hand-over of the Contract Area from CIOC to the Respondent, the Republic of Kazakhstan (**Kazakhstan**);*\n\n*(b) that Kazakhstan returns documents and materials, including CIOC\u2019s corporate seals, seized from CIOC and its employees in recent raids;*\n\n*(c) that Kazakhstan refrain from taking any steps that violate the duty of good faith the parties owe to each other and to the Tribunal, in international arbitration proceedings, or violate the principle of the equality of the parties; and*\n\n*(d) that Kazakhstan refrain from taking any steps which might undermine the procedural integrity, or the orderly working, of the arbitral process, or which might aggravate or exacerbate the dispute between the parties.*\n\n*2. The need to amend CIOC\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures dated 14 April 2009 was brought about by the events set out in the letter dated 24 April 2009 to the Tribunal (the **24 April 2009 Letter**) (**Exhibit C-50)** and the fact of a further raid at the Caratube oilfield by KNB officers and armed Government agents on 26 April 2009. Such events have escalated the urgency of this Amended Request for Provisional Measures.*\n\n*3. The present amended Application has become necessary in part at least as a result of the uncertain and unsatisfactory position with regard to the continued operation of the Contract Area, as discussed further below. Until very recently, CIOC has been put in a position of being required to continue limited operation of certain wells to avoid potentially catastrophic technical consequences should it fail to do so, and yet at the same time Kazakhstan has instituted criminal proceedings condemning CIOC\u2019s actions. Those criminal charges directly impinge upon and engage the responsibility of CIOC\u2019s director, Mr Hussam Hourani. However, since the original Application was filed, Kazakhstan has ordered CIOC employees at the oilfield to close all wells immediately without regard to best oilfield practices or necessary safety precautions. This request for provisional measures seeks, among other things, to resolve that situation pending the substantive determination of these arbitration proceedings.*\n\n*4. The background to the parties\u2019 dispute, which sets the context for this Application, has already been set out in the Request for Arbitration to which the Tribunal is respectfully referred. The following is a brief summary only of the facts that are key to the Application. CIOC accepts of course that to the extent this summary raises substantive issues for determination in the arbitration, the Tribunal cannot reach a final conclusion on these issues in the context of the current application. Nevertheless CIOC\u2019s position on these issues is relevant to an understanding of why the recommendations currently sought are necessary.*\n\n*5. Reference is made to certain exhibits identified in the form Exhibit C-1, etc. Legal authorities to which CIOC refers are also produced and are referred to in the form Authority C-1, etc. A consolidated index of exhibits and authorities filed to date is provided.*\n\n***2.1 The Contract***\n\n*6. On 27 May 2002, the Contract was awarded by Kazakhstan to Consolidated Contractors (Oil and Gas) Company S.A.L (**CCC**) (**Exhibit C-4**). Pursuant to an amendment to the Contract dated 26 December 2002, CCC assigned all of its rights under the Contract to CIOC with full knowledge and approval of Kazakhstan.*\n\n*7. The Contract grants to CIOC, amongst other things, exclusive right to conduct operations connected with prospecting and exploration for hydrocarbons, their extraction and eventual Production. The Exploration period was initially fixed for five years with the possibility at ClOC\u2019s option of two further extensions of two years each. The Contract was indeed extended for two years by virtue of an amendment dated 27 July 2007. In the event of a Commercial Discovery during the Exploration period, CIOC was given the exclusive right to proceed to the Production stage, which was to last 25 years.*\n\n*8. Pursuant to the Contract, CIOC made substantial investments in Kazakhstan. CIOC\u2019s efforts led to Commercial Discoveries, guaranteeing CIOC a Production licence. Yet CIOC was not able to proceed with its investment as in the latter half of 2007 Kazakh authorities adversely and unlawfully interfered with CIOC\u2019s investment, through a campaign of persecution and harassment of CIOC, its majority owner and employees, and ultimately expropriated it in February 2008 by purporting to terminate without cause, and thus wrongfully repudiating, the Contract.*\n\n***2.2 Violations of the BIT***\n\n*9. In order to understand the position in which CIOC presently finds itself, and its motivation for this Application, it is necessary to recall briefly Kazakhstan\u2019s violations of CIOC\u2019s legal rights, including as an investor entitled to the protection of the Kazakhstan-United States of America bilateral investment treaty (the **BIT**) by virtue of its majority ownership by Mr Devincci Hourani, a national of the United States (**US**). These submissions will, of course, be refined and elaborated upon in due course when CIOC sets out its case in its Memorial.*\n\n*10. Article III of the BIT provides that Kazakhstan shall not expropriate or nationalise the investments of US investors except if this is done for a public purpose, in a non-discriminatory manner and in accordance with due process of law including the general principles of treatment set out in Article II(2) of the BIT, and provided it is accompanied by payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Kazakhstan first substantially eroded the value of, and ultimately expropriated, CIOC\u2019s investment by a campaign of harassment and persecution, carried out by its organs and agencies, culminating in the wrongful and repudiatory termination of the Contract. Kazakhstan did not comply with any of the conditions set out in Article III, including the payment of compensation.*\n\n*11. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT contains Kazakhstan\u2019s undertaking to accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to foreign investments. This provision requires inter alia that Kazakhstan provide a stable and predictable investment environment consistent with investors\u2019 legitimate expectations. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT was breached inter alia by the conduct of Kazakhstan\u2019s organs and agencies which, under the guise of carrying out lawful investigations and monitoring, was both abusive and on such a scale as to disrupt and ultimately destroy CIOC\u2019s investment. Further, Devincci Hourani, along with members of his family and CIOC\u2019s employees, were subjected to intimidation and harassment by Kazakhstan\u2019s organs and agencies. These breaches culminated in Kazakhstan\u2019s repudiation of the Contract by its unlawful purported termination of the Contract.*\n\n*12. Article II(2)(b) of the BIT also provides that Kazakhstan shall not impair the investments of US investors by arbitrary or discriminatory measures. Kazakhstan\u2019s abusive persecution of CIOC culminating in the unjustified and unlawful purported termination of the Contract, and the intimidation and harassment to which Devincci Hourani personally, and his family and CIOC\u2019s employees were subjected, were arbitrary and discriminatory in nature and impaired the \"management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or disposal\" of CIOC\u2019s investment.*\n\n*13. Kazakhstan failed to comply with its undertaking in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT to observe obligations entered into with regard to the investments of US nationals. Such obligations included inter alia those commitments expressed in the Contract. By operation of Article II(2)(c), Kazakhstan\u2019s failure to observe its obligations in the Contract is also a violation of a parallel or \"umbrella\" treaty obligation.*\n\n***2.3 Correspondence concerning the expropriation of the field and its consequences***\n\n*14. Kazakhstan\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the **MEMR**) unilaterally terminated the Contract without proper cause by order dated 30 January 2008 (**Exhibit C-17**) and notice dated 1 February 2008 (**Exhibit C-18**), the latter being only received by at CIOC\u2019s head office ten days later on 11 February 2008 as it had been sent to CIOC\u2019s branch office in Aktobe. In its notice, the MEMR requested CIOC to hand over the exploration site (the **Contract Area**).*\n\n*15. Without setting out the detail here, CIOC has repeatedly and clearly set out in correspondence why the MEMR\u2019s allegations of breach were and remain wholly unfounded, and has made clear the reasons why it believes that the MEMR\u2019s purported termination is unlawful and itself in breach of the terms of the Contract and the BIT.*\n\n*16. CIOC responded to the notice of termination on 12 February 2008 (**Exhibit C-26**). CIOC immediately rejected the MEMR\u2019s unfounded notice of termination. CIOC emphasised that the work it had completed in 2007, and its planned investments for 2008, had all been approved. In summarising its achievements, CIOC pointed out that it had invested tens of millions of US dollars into the development of the Contract Area. Moreover, pursuant to clauses 29.6 and 29.8 of the Contract, CIOC observed that Kazakhstan is not entitled to terminate the Contract or require CIOC to relinquish the Contract Area until an international arbitral tribunal has issued an award on the merits of each party\u2019s respective claims. Accordingly CIOC responded that the MEMR\u2019s demands that it abandon the field and relinquish the Contract Area were without any legal justification. In the circumstances, CIOC refused to comply with such demands.*\n\n*17. On 6 March 2008, CIOC wrote again to the MEMR disputing the alleged grounds for termination and requested negotiations in accordance with the Contract, failing which it stated it would refer the dispute to arbitration (**Exhibit C-27**). On 11 March 2008, CIOC wrote to Mr Batalov, the Executive Secretary of the MEMR (**Exhibit C-6**) and to the Prosecutor General\u2019s office (**Exhibit C-28**), and Devincci Hourani also wrote in near identical terms to the Minister of the MEMR (**Exhibit C-29**) and the Prosecutor General\u2019s office (**Exhibit C-30**), to dispute the existence of grounds justifying termination and to draw attention to the procedures in the Contract to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute.*\n\n*18. By a letter dated 12 March 2008 addressed to CIOC\u2019s director, Hussam Hourani, Mr Baikadamov, the Head of Inspection of the Western Kazakhstan Territorial Administration of Geology and Subsoil Use (**Zapkaznedra**), a subdivision of the MEMR, made further demands that CIOC hand over the Contract Area (**Exhibit C-19**). On this occasion, CIOC was asked to \"reverse the land used\" by no later than 17 March 2008 (just five days later) and to nominate a candidate to participate in an \"Inter-Departmental Contract Area Transfer and Acceptance Commission\".*\n\n*19. CIOC\u2019s response to Mr Baikadamov, dated 17 March 2008, stated that the demand to hand over the Contract Area was premature and in breach of Clauses 27.2 and 29.6 of the Contract (**Exhibit C-20**). CIOC requested that Zapkaznedra and the MEMR desist in their demands to seize the field until the dispute could be amicably resolved or determined by an arbitral tribunal. CIOC pointed out that it had attended meetings on 13-14 March 2008 with MEMR representatives to review the circumstances of the purported termination, and that the MEMR\u2019s official conclusions on the results of those meetings were expected within the next two or three days. In the circumstances, CIOC stated that Zapkaznedra\u2019s \"actions aimed at returning the Caratube field territory are premature and are in breach of the main Contract conditions\".*\n\n*20. In a letter dated 8 May 2008 from its counsel to the MEMR, CIOC set out its view that the MEMR\u2019s alleged termination of the Contract was not based on CIOC\u2019s performance of its obligations but was entirely politically motivated (**Exhibit C-24**).*\n\n*21. By letter dated 19 May 2008 from CIOC\u2019s counsel to the President of Kazakhstan, President Nazarbayev, CIOC again stated that the MEMR\u2019s request for it to hand over the Contract Area was unjustified and in breach of the MEMR\u2019s legal obligations (**Exhibit C-25**). CIOC has not received any reply to this letter.*\n\n*22. Throughout this period, from the date of termination to this day, CIOC remains in possession of the Contract Area. Zapkaznedra\u2019s express acceptance (referred to below) that because of their technical characteristics certain wells cannot be safely shut off has resulted in CIOC continuing the production of very low volumes of crude oil from these wells. However, notwithstanding Zapkaznedra\u2019s understanding of the technical conditions which demand that some wells continue to flow, CIOC has become the object of criminal sanctions in relation to CIOC\u2019s continued activities.*\n\n*23. First, on 1 April 2008 CIOC received a ruling issued by Mr K. K. Tymbayev, Senior Investigator of Special Cases of the Investigation Section of the Department for Economic and Corruption-Related Crimes in the Aktyubinsk Region ordering the seizure of its documents and other information (**Exhibit C-31**). The ruling alleged that from 31 January 2008 to 6 March 2008, CIOC had engaged in illegal business operations in the Caratube oil field, as a result of which it obtained 113,342,860.80 tenge in revenue (around US$885,000 as at 6 March 2008). Then, on 18 April 2008, CIOC received another Order on Execution of Seizure, again issued by Mr Tymbayev (**Exhibit C- 32**). The Order reported that criminal case no. 0815005100091 had been commenced against CIOC and that CIOC had been found to have carried out illegal business activities at the Caratube field, namely subsoil activities without a valid licence, resulting in the seizure of crude oil and an order that CIOC be further investigated. Following those investigations, on 18 June 2008, CIOC received an Ordinance issued by the Tax Committee of the Zhetysusky District of Almaty purporting to freeze CIOC\u2019s bank accounts held with the Almaty Branch of Turan Alem Bank Joint Stock Company (**BTA**) (**Exhibit C-33**). This Ordinance was followed on 20 June 2008 by another, issued by the Investigative Department on Economic Crimes with the Division for Internal Affairs in the Aktyubinsk Region, again based on the so-called illegal business operations between 31 January 2008 to 6 March 2008. (**Exhibit C-34**). The 20 June 2008 Ordinance purported to freeze transactions in all of CIOC\u2019s known bank accounts, including with BTA and another bank, Nurbank Joint Stock Company (**Nurbank**).*\n\n*24. On 19 June 2008, the MEMR sent a letter to CIOC insisting that it had unilaterally terminated the Contract by lawful means (**Exhibit C-35**). The MEMR demanded that CIOC should provide information and hand over control of the Contract Area. The MEMR\u2019s detailed list of demands required CIOC to return or reverse:*\n\n*\"1. Geological information*\n\n*2. Contractual territory*\n\n*3. To reverse the Contract*\n\n*4. To fulfil the obligations currently outstanding as of the time of the Contract termination (paragraph 5 Clause 45-2 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan \"On Subsoil and Subsoil Use\")*\n\n*5. To recover the contractual territory up to the level of environmental and public health and safety in accordance with the legislation (paragraph 6 Clause 45-2 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan \"On Subsoil and Subsoil Use\")*\n\n*6. To take any other action associated with the Contract termination and specified by the applicable legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan*\n\n*7. To submit a brief report on activities directed at implementation of contractual provisions and of the notification\".*\n\n*25. On 2 July 2008, CIOC\u2019s Kazakh legal counsel, Mr S. Z. Musin, sent a petition to the Aktobe Prosecutor\u2019s Office in respect of the criminal case against CIOC (**Exhibit C-36**). Mr Musin pointed out that the investigator who had prepared the charges, Mr Tymbayev, had himself acknowledged that CIOC had good reason to continue to permit low levels of production from a limited number of wells. Mr Musin remarked that Mr Tymbayev had observed in his 20 June 2008 Order (see **Exhibit C-34**, described above) that*\n\n*\"...the continuing production and sale of oil can be explained by the fact that, taking into account the specific nature and particular difficulties of operating the wells, their shutdown might cause blowout of crude hydrocarbons to the surface and also one of the wells in the field is in breakdown condition\".*\n\n*26. Mr Musin added that, given the technical characteristics of some of the wells, the shutdown of CIOC\u2019s wells and operations was extremely difficult if not effectively impossible without risking irreparable harm to the environment. The limited volumes of crude oil that were therefore produced inevitably had to be sold since CIOC\u2019s storage tanks were also full. As Mr Musin explained:*\n\n*\"Thus, the shutdown of the enterprise\u2019s production activities and of operation of the Karatyube Field really is impossible. Otherwise the blowout of crude hydrocarbons may cause irreparable harm to the environment in the places where the wells are situated and operating, and the existing tanks are over-full. Sale of the oil to third parties is a consequence of the impossibility of shutting down the continuous technological process of production at the Karatyube Field. The purpose is, to exclude blowout of crude hydrocarbons to the surface\".*\n\n*27. In the circumstances, Mr Musin petitioned for CIOC\u2019s accounts with BTA and Nurbank to be unfrozen to allow CIOC to pay employees and suppliers, and to continue the limited operations necessary to maintain the integrity of the field. Mr Musin also sought to oblige the MEMR to comply with the dispute settlement obligations in the Contract.*\n\n*28. In July 2008, Zapkaznedra carried out an unscheduled inspection of CIOC\u2019s continued activities. In the resulting Prescriptive Order, Zapkaznedra essentially confirmed CIOC\u2019s explanations and Mr Tymbayev\u2019s findings, described above, in observing that \"suspension of operations is impossible without complex of activities... as the spring, oil blowout to surface, may occur\". A number of wells were sealed, but Well No. G-31 was not sealed \"because of possibility of spring caused by damage of casing integrity\" (**Exhibit C-37**).*\n\n*29. After this time, CIOC remained in the field, monitoring the condition of a few wells with particularly high pressure and permitting low volumes of production from them. This was done with the approval of Kazakh authorities. On 29 July 2008, Mr Baikadamov wrote to CIOC\u2019s geologist, Mr K. A. Djanbekova, observing that CIOC should pay particular attention to well G-38 given its pressure and the risk that it may reach \"critical levels\" (**Exhibit C-38**). On 5 August 2008, a joint meeting was held between CIOC\u2019s field manager Mr Rashid Badran and Mr Djanbekova, and officials from Zapkaznedra, Akberen (a state agency charged with monitoring well safety), the Aktobe Directorate for Investigation of Economic and Financial Crimes, and the Aktobe Geology and Subsoil Use Inspectorate. The minutes of that meeting report that amongst other things it was decided \"to prevent emergency oil spillage and exercise control over the technical condition, to permit resuming operation of [well numbers] 307, 309, 332, 301, 317, 315\" (**Exhibit C-39**). On 8 August 2008, Mr Baikadamov wrote to Mr Badran and confirmed*\n\n*\"In pursuance of the Minutes dated 5 August 2008, I hereby permit to resume operations of wells Nos. 307, 309, 332, 301, 317, 315\" (**Exhibit C-40**).*\n\n*30. On 3 September 2008, CIOC\u2019s counsel, Allen & Overy LLP, wrote to representatives of the Government of Kazakhstan reporting a \"clearly undesirable and unsatisfactory\" threat conveyed to CIOC employees in Almaty that if the ICSID claim was not resolved, an international arrest warrant may be issued through Interpol, presumably for either Devincci or Hussam Hourani (**Exhibit C-41**).*\n\n*31. Also on 3 September 2008, Mr Batalov again wrote to CIOC on behalf of the MEMR to demand that CIOC relinquish the Contract Area, return original documents and restore the field to its pre-Contract condition (**Exhibit C-42**). The deadline set for these works was 30 September 2008.*\n\n*32. In a letter dated 26 September 2008 (**Exhibit C-43**), CIOC responded through its counsel to the MEMR, explaining that the MEMR\u2019s demands were without any legal justification. CIOC explained that even if it were obliged or inclined to do so, it was not practically feasible to meet the MEMR\u2019s demands by the stipulated date. The course of conduct called for by the MEMR also risked:*\n\n*\"the possibility of: (1) alteration of the texture and structure of the reservoir proper due to water encroachment; (2) clogging of the oil reservoir channels; and (3) the discharge of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon pollutants with their consequent ingress into the ground water\".*\n\n*33. CIOC stated that it could not prudently or safely undertake such action and was not willing to be a party to or to take responsibility for such an approach. CIOC warned that if Kazakhstan sought to take control of the field that the Government alone would be responsible for all loss and damage arising from such action.*\n\n*34. On 31 October 2008, the Head of Zapkaznedra, Mr Nadyrbaev, wrote to CIOC requesting a meeting on 6 November 2008 with CIOC\u2019s director, Hussam Hourani, and chief geologist, Professor Nikolai Davydov (**Exhibit C-44**). CIOC only received this letter on 3 November, so the meeting was unable to be arranged in the time available.*\n\n*35. By letter dated 6 November 2008 from its counsel (**Exhibit C-45**), CIOC replied to Mr Nadyrbaev, restating that under clauses 29.8 and 29.9 of the Contract, Kazakhstan is not entitled to transfer of the Contract Area until an international arbitral tribunal has issued an award on the merits of each party\u2019s respective claims. However, CIOC confirmed that*\"whilst retaining all its rights, CIOC will attend, as demanded to do whatever they can to ensure that any damage such as we have described in our [26 September 2008] letter to Mr. Batalov is avoided\"*. CIOC offered to meet with Mr Nadyrbaev in the week beginning 17 November 2008.*\n\n*36. On 10 November 2008, the Deputy Head of Zapkaznedra, Mr Kurbanov, wrote to CIOC care of its counsel and confirmed that a meeting was possible in the week 17-21 November 2008 (**Exhibit C-46**). On 19 November, CIOC confirmed by letter that its Oil Field Manager, Mr Rashid Badran, and an assistant would meet with Mr Kurbanov and Mr Nadyrbaev on 21 November 2008 to discuss the situation at the site (**Exhibit C-47**).*\n\n*37. Mr Badran first telephoned Zapkaznedra in the morning of 21 November 2008 to confirm the meeting, without success, and then visited Zapkaznedra\u2019s offices in person but Mr Nadyrbaev refused to meet with him. Mr Badran recorded his efforts to meet with Mr Nadyrbaev as had been agreed in an attendance note (**Exhibit C-48**).*\n\n*38. In a letter dated 9 December 2008 (**Exhibit C-49**) addressed to Mr Kurbanov, CIOC explained how its attempts to meet Mr Nadyrbaev had failed and reaffirmed its commitment to a meeting. CIOC therefore summarised in writing the matters, which are repeated below, that Mr Badran had intended to convey in person:*\n\n*\"1. CIOC maintains that its rights under Contract No. 954 dated 27 May 2002 for Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons within Blocks XXIV-20-C (partially); XXIV-21-A (partially), including Karatube Field (oversalt) in Baiganin District of Aktobe Oblast of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the **Contract**) have been unlawfully expropriated, for political reasons, and without compensation.*\n\n*2. CIOC denies the existence of any grounds for the termination of the Contract.*\n\n*3. CIOC has commenced international arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Kazakhstan that will determine whether the Government has acted unlawfully.*\n\n*4. As we wrote to you on 6 November 2008 (copied to Mr Batalov), the Government is not entitled to transfer the Licence Area until the international arbitral tribunal has decided the dispute (see Clauses 29.8 and 29.9 of the Contract).*\n\n*5. If the Government is going to force CIOC to hand over the Licence Area, or to shut down the field:*\n\n*(a) the Government will be held responsible for any damages or losses caused, including to the oilfield and infrastructure (in addition to it already being responsible for all damage that has resulted from previously closing the wells);*\n\n*(b) CIOC will not pay for any costs involved in a transfer or shutdown of the field;*\n\n*(c) CIOC will be entitled to claim additional compensation or damages from the international arbitral tribunal for any losses or damage caused as a result of the Government\u2019s actions;*\n\n*(d) CIOC is, however, willing to cooperate with the Government in any transfer or shutdown of the field as a consultant, providing technical advice and information;*\n\n*(e) any cooperation on the part of CIOC is not to be understood as evidence of CIOC\u2019s consent to the transfer or shutdown of the field, or as a waiver of any of its legal rights\".*\n\n*39. CIOC did not receive a response to this letter*.\n\n***2.4 The situation today***\n\n*40. As at the date of this Amended Application, CIOC still retains physical control of the Contract Area, acting primarily out of a sense of duty not to allow damage to occur to the wells or to the oil bearing structures. CIOC continues to monitor and ensure the safety and integrity of the six operating wells and related infrastructure at both some effort and expense to itself (although we understand that CIOC employees have now been ordered to shut down even those six wells during the recent raids). CIOC still employs approximately 60 staff, working mostly in the Contract Area but also at its branch office in Aktobe. As described above and until recently, very low levels of production have been permitted (with the express approval of the relevant authorities) from a small number of wells due to their relatively high pressure. This has been done for reasons explained to and understood by Zapkaznedra, Mr Tymbayev of the Department for Economic and Corruption-Related Crimes in the Aktyubinsk Region, and other competent agencies.*\n\n*41. Yet at the same time, CIOC is subject to criminal investigations linked to the alleged unlicensed oilfield operations. As already mentioned in paragraph 42 of the Request for Arbitration and will be described further in evidence to be served with the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the majority owner of CIOC, Mr Devincci Hourani, his family, and CIOC\u2019s employees have been subjected to a sustained and protracted campaign of harassment and intimidation by Kazakhstan\u2019s organs and agencies including the Kazakhstan national security agents. Devincci Hourani was, on one occasion, dragged from his bed in the middle of the night and taken to an undisclosed location to be subjected to interrogation by armed Government agents. Devincci Hourani and his brothers have also been threatened that they would face criminal charges, in at least one case expressly on the basis that this would happen if they did not assist the Government in its dispute with the President\u2019s former son-inlaw, Rakhat Aliyev.*\n\n*42. All of Devincci Hourani\u2019s business assets in Kazakhstan, including a number of companies besides CIOC, have been taken from him. He finally fled Kazakhstan in March 2008, fearing for his safety, and has not returned since. However members of his family remain, as do CIOC employees who since mid-2007 and to this day continue to be subject to harassment and intimidation. CIOC staff have been subjected to repeated interrogations that have led to a number of employees resigning without notice and had a significant negative impact on the morale of those who remain. Some individuals appear to have suffered health issues caused by the stress of working in such a tense and intimidating environment. The sum of Kazakhstan\u2019s conduct, including the wrongful repudiation of the Contract, as well as the harassment and persecution briefly mentioned above, have destroyed CIOC\u2019s investment such that there is no longer any realistic possibility of resurrecting it.*\n\n*43. In addition, recent events have demonstrated Kazakhstan\u2019s defiance of the arbitral process and its violation of the integrity of the agreed dispute resolution procedure and involve precisely the sort of violations that CIOC sought to prevent in formulating the original Request for Provisional Measures. It is a fitting example of Kazakhstan\u2019s disregard for its international obligations that, on the very day that the parties convened for the First Session of the Tribunal in Frankfurt in an attempt to settle the dispute between them through the proper legal channels and with due regard to legal process, the Kazakhstan authorities raided CIOC\u2019s regional office in Aktobe and the Caratube oilfield and, on the following day, 17 April 2009, CIOC\u2019s head office in Almaty. Since the 24 April 2009 Letter was sent to the Tribunal, further raids have been carried out on 26 April 2009 at the Caratube oilfield when seven KNB officers, and four other armed men dressed in Kazakh military uniform, again visited the field.*\n\n*44. The details of the raids on the 16 and 17 April 2009 are contained within the 24 April 2009 Letter and in the official reports prepared by the Kazakh authorities (**Exhibits C-51 and C-52)**. Whilst CIOC does not agree with every detail recorded, the reports confirm the fact of the pertinent raid and those present (although the report of the raid at the Almaty office fails to mention that there were approximately 30 officers in total present). We have been instructed that although the reports confirm that a large number of documents and files were seized, they materially understate the volume of documents, files and other materials taken.*\n\n*45. The seizure of substantially all of CIOC\u2019s documents and materials (including its corporate seals) reinforces the need for this Amended Application, having put in doubt CIOC\u2019s ability to present its case fully in this arbitration. The documents and materials seized form evidence upon which CIOC might otherwise rely to argue and prove its case, including to quantify the loss it has suffered. The KNB officers carrying out the recent raids also made no attempts to conceal that the purpose of such raids was to find documents to suggest that Devincci Hourani is not the owner of CIOC in an attempt to support potential objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In the raid on 26 April 2006 we are instructed that CIOC staff were even pressured to sign false documents that assert that it was not Devincci Hourani who, in 2002, acquired the rights under the Contract. CIOC staff refused to do so as the allegation is not true.*\n\n*46. It is no surprise that CIOC has come to the realisation over the past year, evidenced by its most recent correspondence described above and confirmed by recent events, that despite its firm view that Kazakhstan has no right to terminate the Contract or to seize the field pending the determination of this arbitration tribunal, nevertheless restitution of the Contract Area and confirmation of CIOC\u2019s contractual rights are not practically possible even if, as a matter of principle, they are available remedies. It may be that restitution is even legally (as well as factually) impossible in circumstances where a State has exercised its sovereign powers to put an end to a contract or licence, such as here. In any event, the position is clear since the primary remedy that CIOC seeks for the expropriation of its investment and other violations of the BIT and the Contract is monetary compensation and damages.*\n\n*47. In these circumstances, CIOC\u2019s continued custody of the Contract Area exposes it to considerable risk and expense. Kazakhstan has made demands that CIOC relinquish the field yet, when CIOC has realised that it has no choice but to accept this outcome and has taken steps to effect an orderly handover, there has been no indication of any cooperation on the part of the MEMR in order to implement the relinquishment demanded in an economically and ecologically correct and responsible manner. Zapkaznedra officials failed to attend a meeting at an agreed time in order to coordinate the orderly handover of the Contract Area and failed to respond to CIOC\u2019s letter in which it proposed principles that would govern such a handover. KNB officers have since demanded that the wells be shut down. This order is in contravention of the recommendations and suggestions that CIOC has made to Kazakhstan as to the safe handover of the site. In particular, CIOC has emphasised that it would not be reasonable for CIOC simply to abandon the wells without proper maintenance and supervision since this would risk substantial economic and ecological damage. Any shut-down of the oil wells without following the appropriate oil field practices would also risk damage to the technical condition of the field and wells, as well as damage to the surrounding environment. Yet CIOC remains exposed to financial and legal risk by its continued occupation of the Contract Area, albeit as a custodian only, with no effective contractual rights. It is in this context that CIOC seeks the provisional measures outlined below.*\n\n***3. PROVISIONAL MEASURES***\n\n*48. Pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention, the Tribunal is competent to recommend any provisional measures that should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party, if the circumstances so require. Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requires that when seeking provisional measures a party must specify:*\n\n*(a) the rights to be preserved;*\n\n*(b) the measures the recommendation of which is requested; and*\n\n*(c) the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*49. A consistent line of decisions by ICSID tribunals confirm that the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party\u2019s rights and that need is urgent. For example, the Tribunal in Saipem v. Bangladesh confirmed that Article 47 requires that*\"the requested measure be both necessary and urgent\"*. ICSID tribunals, including those presiding in Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine and Occidental v. Ecuador, for example, have confirmed that measures are necessary where the actions of a party*\"are capable of causing or threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked\"*, and urgent where*\"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is taken\"*. In sum, as the Tribunal in Occidental v. Ecuador stated:*\n\n*\"...in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm \" (emphasis original).*\n\n*50. CIOC addresses each of these requirements in turn, below, and explains why recommendation of the requested provisional measures is appropriate in the circumstances.*\n\n***3.1 The rights to be preserved***\n\n*51. It is clear, as confirmed by the Tribunal in Biwater v. Tanzania, that the power of ICSID tribunals to grant provisional measures is very broad and is not limited to substantive rights, but also includes procedural rights. By this Application, CIOC seeks to protect the following procedural and substantive rights:*\n\n*(a) CIOC\u2019s right to avoid further exposure to or responsibility for potential economic or ecological damage in the Contract Area, and other uncertainty, risk and responsibility (including further financial exposure) associated with its continued custody of the Contract Area, which may aggravate the dispute;*\n\n*(b) CIOC\u2019s right to pursue its claims in this arbitration without risk of being beholden to Kazakh authorities in such a manner that may aggravate the dispute. In particular, CIOC and its employees should not be exposed to the risk of further sanctions or harassment arising out of its continued occupation of the Contract Area (whether criminal, civil or otherwise) that may have the effect of aggravating the dispute. In the light of the existing criminal charges made against CIOC, continued occupation of the field would appear likely to attract expanded charges or more extensive criminal penalties;*\n\n*(c) CIOC\u2019s right to pursue its claims in this arbitration in an orderly fashion without risk that CIOC or its employees are exposed to the risk of further sanctions or harassment relating to its dispute with Kazakhstan, including arising out of its continued occupation of the Contract Area that may have the effect of intimidating, harassing or inconveniencing CIOC employees upon whom CIOC may wish to rely to produce evidence or to provide information or documents; and*\n\n*(d) CIOC\u2019s right to have access to its documents and materials, including its corporate seals, so that it can present its case in these proceedings to the fullest extent possible.*\n\n*52. Without the requested measures, these rights would be prejudiced. Such prejudice could not be offset by an award of damages alone.*\n\n***3.3 Circumstances requiring the recommendation of provisional measures***\n\n*54. The factual background to this Application is briefly outlined in Section 2 above. As for the applicable legal tests, the requested measures are both urgent and necessary. In the raids at the Caratube oilfield, CIOC\u2019s employees were ordered to shut down the wells immediately without heed of oilfield best practice and without taking necessary precautions. If the field and wells are simply abandoned without an orderly handover of control and responsibility there is a risk of aggravation of the dispute arising out of inter alia the possibility of irreparable economic and ecological damage to the field, and resulting further harassment of and repercussions to CIOC and its employees. On the other hand, the present situation cannot continue. Devincci Hourani and his businesses including CIOC have been the victim of an intense campaign of targeted harassment in Kazakhstan and, recently, raids which have resulted in the seizure of substantially all CIOC\u2019s documents and materials, including its corporate seals. CIOC is the subject of criminal proceedings due to CIOC\u2019s continued occupation and activities at the site, which also engage the responsibility of CIOC\u2019s director, Hussam Hourani. Yet the operating wells require both attention and resources to maintain them in a safe condition, both of which CIOC is in no position to provide given the expropriation of its investment, the persecution of its majority owner and employees, the freezing of its accounts, and the criminal proceeding against it and its director. CIOC\u2019s presence and activities in the Contract Area, through no fault of its own, render it and those connected with it a target for harassment and a source of aggravation of the present dispute. The measures requested would assist the parties to avoid actions that might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult. The measures requested would also ensure that CIOC is not deprived of the documents and materials which may form evidence relevant to its claim against Kazakhstan, including the quantification of its loss. CIOC considers these documents to be at risk of loss or destruction if left in the possession of the Kazakh authorities.*\n\n*55. More specifically, there is support in ICSID arbitral practice for the recommendations requested. There is an established principle:*\n\n*\"...according to which both parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult\".*\n\n*56. Applying this principle, the Tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina invited the parties*\"to abstain from adopting measures of any character that could aggravate or extend the controversy submitted to this arbitration\"*. In Pey Casado v. Chile, the Tribunal invited the parties to \"prevent any act, of whatever nature, which could aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal\".*\n\n*57. CIOC requests the requested measures, including in particular in relation to (e) above, as a matter of urgency. These measures are also necessary to ensure CIOC\u2019s ability to furnish evidence of its claim. Necessity and urgency are recognised in ICSID practice as being present where a respondent fails to take steps to preserve or to provide documentation relevant to the claimant\u2019s case, or in circumstances where there is a risk of loss or destruction of such documentation.*\n\n*58. Authority exists also for the provisional measure requested in (f), above. The Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine Tribunal held that in ICSID proceedings parties*\"must refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID\"*. It added that:*\n\n*\"The Ukrainian authorities - whether judicial or other - are, therefore, under the legal obligation to abstain from, and to suspend and discontinue, any proceedings before any domestic body, whether judicial or other, which might in any way jeopardize the principle of the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute before it\".*\n\n*59. The Tribunal therefore recommended that:*\n\n*\"Pending the resolution of the dispute now before the Tribunal, both parties shall refrain from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic proceedings, judicial or other, concerning Tokios Tokel\u00e9s or its investment in Ukraine, [\u2026] which might prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award of this Tribunal or aggravate the existing dispute\".*\n\n*60. To anticipate a question that might be in the minds of the members of the Tribunal, the provisional measures requested do not seek to prejudge the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the merits or to achieve an outcome at odds with the parties\u2019 expectations. On either party\u2019s case, the result is that CIOC cannot continue in occupation of the Contract Area. If CIOC is successful in its claim that Kazakhstan has expropriated its investment, implicit in such a finding is that title to the investment has passed and the appropriate remedy is compensation. In the event of other violations of the Treaty, including a finding that the expropriation is unlawful, CIOC acknowledges that restitution is not practicable and the appropriate remedy is damages. On Kazakhstan\u2019s case, it may be successful if it can show that the Contract was validly terminated and for good cause, in which case CIOC would be obliged to relinquish the field.*\n\n*61. Monetary damages would not be practicable to resolve the circumstances outlined in paragraph 54 and provisional measures are therefore necessary. Furthermore, the rights outlined in paragraph 51 cannot be protected by the possibility of monetary compensation or damages alone.\"*\n\n59.\n\nIn the Hearing of 30 June 2009 Claimant further argued (Tr., pp. 38-49):\n\n*\"The second topic is jurisdiction, which I can take very briefly indeed, because, essentially, there is, I think, no dispute between the parties on jurisdiction. It is article 47 of the convention, rule 39. Those are the only jurisdictional requirements, as opposed to matters going to discretion. The rights to be preserved have to be identified, the measures requested have to be identified, and the circumstances said to require them.*\n\n*The rights to be protected are set out in the request at paragraph 51, and the Republic do not dispute the existence of any of those rights. If one looks at their submission, there is no issue taken that any of the rights asserted do not exist.*\n\n*So, essentially, the measures are set out in paragraph 53, the rights are set out in paragraph 51, and the submission sets out the circumstances which we say require them. So jurisdiction is established, which brings the Tribunal to the issue of whether it should grant the measures requested.*\n\n*The case law is not, of course, binding.*\n\n*It is helpful, and there is a considerable degree of consensus, but it is not a situation where we have to point to a previous tribunal giving an equivalent order. Again, I will just give you the references, but in Tokios order 3 that we were just looking at, at tab 39, paragraph 11 makes that clear. As does the Maffezini case that the Respondents rely on at exhibit RA-3 at paragraph 5.*\n\n*The generally accepted requirements are threefold: necessity, urgency, and that it must not prejudge the issues in the arbitration, and we accept all of those. The Republic seeks to introduce further requirements, as it were, which we do not accept. First of all, they say it must not be too broad. We accept that the circumstances must justify the measure in order for it to be appropriate under rule 39, but we do not see that there is a separate too broad requirement, because, obviously, what is or is not too broad will depend on the particular circumstances.*\n\n*Respondent rely on the SGS v Pakistan case, where the scope of what was requested was patently far broader. It was much more in the nature of a general antisuit injunction, rather than what is sought here, which is no further action on a specific set of proceedings which relate to this Arbitration.*\n\n*They also seek to impose a requirement of irreparable harm, which we do not accept. We do accept that some tribunals have discussed that concept, or whether damages are an adequate remedy, depending on how one looks at it, but it can also equally be a question of preserving the status quo, and the cases make that clear. Again, I will not take you to them, but let me give you the references: the Plama case relied on by the Respondents at RA-6, paragraph 38, makes that very clear.*\n\n*So the measures are perfectly capable of not necessarily being irreparable harm, but essentially preserving the status quo, and that is what we say in this case is primarily the motivation.*\n\n*That is why, in part at least, the argument that is put forward by the Respondent that, actually, you do not need any of these provisional measures, because your claim is damages claim, and you can simply be awarded damages instead, that is simply not right. The measures that we are seeking are primarily geared to maintaining the status quo and to ensuring the fair, equitable resolution of this Arbitration, and if my clients are prevented, for example, from seizure of their documents from advancing their case in the Arbitration, that cannot be compensated by a damages award. So it is just not right to say that an award of damages deals with all of this.*\n\n*It is also said somehow that it has to be extraordinary for these measures to be awarded. We would say that the circumstances here are extraordinary. So, even if the Tribunal thinks is a requirement, we would say it is met.*\n\n*Let me just finally go back to the three areas that we accept, and I think both sides accept are relevant. First, the question of urgency: the point that is taken against us there is that the actions complained of began in 2007, and have continued. There is nothing in that.*\n\n*This application was brought on promptly after the Tribunal was constituted. This sort of application will always go to the Tribunal. It is clear from arbitration rule 39(5) that, even if an application goes in beforehand, essentially, it awaits the constitution of the Tribunal. So the objections that are made are simply not valid. It is perfectly reasonable to wait until that happens.*\n\n*Also, the Tribunal will recall that the amended application went in very promptly after the hearing on 16 April, and the raids which took place, which gave rise to certain of the measures requested.*\n\n*So that is urgency. As far as necessity is concerned, it is suggested somehow that the need for protection here is hypothetical. That is suggested in the response at paragraph 21. We do not accept that. The handover of the field is necessary to resolve what is an impossible situation. The documents are necessary. On that, the point taken against us is, you have not said in your memorial that you cannot make out your case because you do not have this, that or the other document. That, we say, completely misses the point. This is a case which is due to be conducted leading up to a final hearing in February 2011. We know that we are going to have contractual issues put on the table*\n\n*by the Respondents. We should have access to our documentary records to enable us properly to resist those allegations that will be made.*\n\n*It is also clear, and this is where I would refer to the Biwater order number 3 that has been produced -- I think it may be simplest just to put that at the back of your volume 2, from the back of the authorities bundle. It will be tab 46 in the bundle, and it is authority C-77. We rely upon this. It is somehow suggested against us, you have not shown that you have actually suffered harm in relation to these documents, and we rely on this case as showing that one does not need to have had actual harm already suffered before tribunals will grant preliminary measures.*\n\n*If one looks at paragraphs 144 and 145 on page 37 of this decision:*\n\n*\"It is true that the risk to the integrity of these proceedings, and the danger of an aggravation or exacerbation of this dispute, have yet to manifest themselves in concrete terms. Neither party has demonstrated that it has yet been inhibited, in fact, from participating fully in these proceedings... In truth, BGT\u2019s complaint amounts to a concern about the risk of future prejudice, or the potential risk to the arbitral process as it unfolds hereafter. The Tribunal disagrees, however, with the suggestion that the actual harm must be manifested before any measures may be taken. Its mandate and responsibility includes ensuring that the proceedings will be conducted in the future in a regular, fair and orderly manner...\"*\n\n*So actual harm need not have been suffered.*\n\n*Just to save time, while you have that decision open, may I just take you to two other paragraphs I would just draw your attention to.*\n\n*One is paragraph 135, on page 34:*\n\n*\"It is now settled in both treaty and international commercial arbitration that an arbitral tribunal is entitled to direct the parties not to take any step that might harm or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings or aggravate or exacerbate the dispute. Both may be seen as a particular type of provisional measure or simply as a facet of the tribunal\u2019s overall procedural powers...\"*\n\n*Then it talks about: \"... can be articulated in various ways, such as the need to\", and it gives various examples, including over the page:*\n\n*\"Preserve and promote a relationship of trust and confidence between the parties; ensure the orderly unfolding of the arbitration process; ensure a level playing field; minimise the scope for any external pressure on any party, witness, expert or other participant in the process.\"*\n\n*We say that is precisely what we are seeking here, and, again, I just draw your attention to paragraph 139, which is the quote from Schreuer, which talks about generally keeping the peace, and that is what we suggest you should be doing here.*\n\n*We rely upon that, because it is suggested by the Respondent that aggravation of itself is not sufficient, and does not fulfil the necessity requirement, and we say that it certainly does. It is a somewhat remarkable proposition that is made by the other side that somehow general aggravation is okay. We say it is not, and we say it is clear from the rulings in Biwater that it is not.*\n\n*So, really, I have dealt with necessity there. We say it is necessary. We say that, in the circumstances of this case, ultimately, one just has to read those official reports of what has happened to realise that it is necessary for this Tribunal to step in, and regain control of the evidence-gathering in the Arbitration, and ensure that CIOC\u2019s rights are protected, and, in that context, we would simply say that Inspector Tusov\u2019s evidence is most telling for what it does not say. He gives two statements dealing with specific issues, but we would say he does not take issue with much of what is in the reports, and he gives no explanation for why he was conducting these raids, and helping himself to documents.*\n\n*Finally, prejudging the issues, and, again, I think I can take this very generally. There is a general keeping of the peace ability for this Tribunal to issue provisional measures.*\n\n*You are not being asked to decide the rights and wrongs, but you are being asked to reinforce the ground rules going forward, and to give provisional measures which will regulate the parties\u2019 conduct going forward.*\n\n*There was the use of the word \"any\" in our paragraph 53, any harassment, rather than the harassment, and that was quite deliberate, in that we accept that you cannot rule on it at this stage, although it will be a matter in the final hearing.*\n\n*What we would also say is that it cannot be right, as appears to be suggested by the Respondent, that simply because harassment allegations, which would infringe the duty of good faith and the duty not to aggravate the proceedings -merely because there are allegations of harassment which would contradict those duties, that cannot of itself be a reason for you not to grant the provisional measures sought, and there seems to be some suggestion to that effect, which we do not accept.*\n\n*So, gentlemen, I think it is suggested that what we are asking you for is sweeping. What we say, actually, is much of what we are asking for is simply that the Tribunal order that the Republic complies with its duties to this Tribunal and to this process, in circumstances where, on the undisputed facts, the Tribunal might rightly conclude that things have not been dealt with as they should have been to date. Thank you.\"*\n\n60.\n\nIn its Closing Statement of the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Claimant clarified its position as follows: (Tr., pp. 106-108):\n\n*\"First of all, the point on irreparable harm, and the need to show that. This is not a change of position; yes, we refer to the Occidental decision, but the point we are making is simply that provisional measures of this nature are appropriate, not just in cases of irreparable harm, but also to preserve the status quo. That is clear from the Plama decision which was introduced by the Respondent at their authorities tab 6, paragraph 38, where it is said:*\n\n*The need for provisional measures must be urgent and necessary to preserve the status quo or avoid the occurrence of irreparable harm or damage.\"*\n\n*The point is simply that we say, in this case, that we wish to preserve the status quo.*\n\n*Irreparable harm is not therefore a necessary requirement without which no measures can be ordered.*\n\n*The question of whether the measures are extraordinary was also touched on; again, we simply say that is not a separate test, but we do not really think it is an issue in this point.*\n\n*As far as prejudging the merits are concerned, I have made the point to you already, we are not asking you to determine either the fact of or the consequences of the alleged harassment, as regards the merits of this dispute. There is sufficient in the undisputed record, we say, for you to have the factual basis on which to grant the measures we are seeking.*\n\n*But there is an important philosophical issue here: it cannot be right that a party who is facing allegations of harassment can then say to the Tribunal, \"Well, you cannot grant any preliminary measures, and effectively, I have a licence to harass for the next two and a half years until you give your arbitration award, because it is part of the substantive case\". That cannot be right. You must be able, during the pendency of the proceedings, particularly where they are over an extended period, to require the parties to comply with their duties, and to refrain from action, even if that action arguably is also encompassed within the merits.*\n\n*We are not asking you to determine it, we are asking you to lay the ground rules, and the fact that it is part of the substantive case cannot be effectively a licence to harass the Claimants for the next two and a half years. \"*\n\n**G.II. Short Summary of Contentions by Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nRespondent brings forward the following arguments why the provisional measures as requested by Claimant should not be granted (R-II, paras. 3-4):\n\n*\"3. These seven requests* [C-III, para. 53 (a) to (g)] *fall into three categories:*\n\n*1) requests relating to the hand-over of the Contract Area to the Republic (items a) to b)); 2) a series of broad and overlapping requests that this Tribunal recommend that in the future the Republic not engage in various alleged types of conduct (items d) through g)); and*\n\n*3) requests relating to documents and other materials seized by the competent authorities of the Republic (item c)).*\n\n*4. In this Response, the Republic will address each of the three aforementioned categories in turn. First, the Republic will explain why the requests relating to the hand-over of the Contract Area are now moot. Next, the Republic will address the two remaining categories of requests by setting out the applicable criteria for granting provisional measures and then by showing why the requests in those two categories do not meet the requisite criteria. It will become apparent, as a result of the above, that this Tribunal should not grant the provisional measures requested by CIOC.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*33. In conclusion, the Republic respectfully requests that this Tribunal reject CIOC\u2019s requests for provisional measures. It has been shown that the requests concerning the hand-over of the Contract Area have been rendered moot by the Republic\u2019s letter to CIOC dated June 10, 2009 in which the Republic agrees to meet with CIOC representatives and proceed with the taking over of the Contract Area subject to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions for the hand-over. It has also been shown that the two remaining categories of CIOC\u2019s requests fail to meet the criteria to be applied in determining whether to grant provisional measures.*\n\n*34. The Republic respectfully submits that it would be wise to let the parties proceed with the hand-over in the absence of pro-active measures by the Tribunal, which may well be more counterproductive than helpful. \"*\n\n62.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Respondent further argued (Tr., pp. 50-53, 116-120):\n\n*\"The only matter before us today is whether the Claimant is entitled or not to the specific provisional measures that they are requesting. Before going through those specific requests, and giving our views on them one by one, I would like to say a few words about the basic criteria for granting a provisional measure.*\n\n*It is true, and all the cases say this, that provisional measures are extraordinary measures, and should not be recommended lightly. This is a key concept with respect to provisional measures. They are not ordinary measures that you sort of do like that. They are extraordinary. So I would request that you keep that in mind as a basic test that you should apply, as all the other tribunals have done.*\n\n*Secondly, we submit that there must be circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid an irreparable harm. I have heard that counsel on the other side agree with the necessity and urgency, but they are now saying, maybe not irreparable harm. That rather surprised me when I heard it, because, if I look at their recent amended request for provisional measures, of April 29, 2009, and I point to paragraph 49 thereof, they summarise their position on this requirement, and they say:*\n\n*'In sum, as the Tribunal in Occidental v Ecuador stated, 'In order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm'.*\n\n*So that was their position then. Whether it is their position or not, we would submit that that is what the cases say, that the necessity and urgency are not isolated concepts operating out there in the abstract. It is necessity to avoid an irreparable harm, it is urgency to avoid an irreparable harm, and that is what the cases say.*\n\n*So, as we go through their requests, we submit that we should be focusing on whether there is an irreparable harm here that requires an extraordinary measure to deal with it.*\n\n*I think both sides are agreed that the provisional measures must not prejudge the Claimant\u2019s case. That was agreed to now, as it is a criterion. The cases say that, they have said it in their request, and they say it now, so there is no dispute about that. It is an important point. One must be careful in any provisional measure decision not to prejudge the merits, not to say anything that presupposes a decision on the merits. We maintain that that should be applied.*\n\n*As to the notion that the provisional measure should not be too broad, the cases say that. We believe that is a sensible idea that should be followed. A provisional measure that is too broad and not specific enough is making a strong, extraordinary measure that would have too great a scope. Of course, that is in your discretion to determine whether it is too broad or not, but we would still maintain that that is something you ought to look to.\"*\n\n(Tr., pp. 50-53)\n\n*\"First of all, there was a reference to the Plama decision again, what I would point out to you is regardless of what they say in their discussion, in the end, in paragraph 50 of Plama, it is stated very clearly:*\n\n*\"The arbitral tribunal rejects claimant\u2019s requests for urgent provisional measures in its entirety.\"*\n\n*So the bottom line was that they did not grant the provisional measures, regardless of what language they used in their discussions before they rejected the requests. So I think that is worth pointing out to you.*\n\n*Then the second point that was raised was concerning right to avoid, they should not have a right to allow harassment for years, and this sort of thing, but it seems to me that if, as we have said today, we start now with an agreement of good faith by both parties, this in my view should be more effective and more efficient than the Tribunal coming down on a state and making some sort of recommendation in the form of an order.*\n\n*Again, as I say, you are not going to disappear. You are here. If something happens, there is always a possibility then to do something about it, but I can assure you that we as counsel will be advising our clients very clearly to be acting in good faith with respect to this Arbitration, because that is what we also believe is the right way to go. So I think that that should be sufficient.*\n\n*Now as to the criminal proceedings, well again, regardless of what the Tokios Tokeles tribunal said in order number 1, where they did make a recommendation, when push came to shove, and they were asked to enjoin a state from proceeding with criminal prosecutions, they refused to do it. They did not enjoin it. So again, you know, sometimes there is language to establish principles of a right to do something, but then the bottom line, they did not do it, and I suspect they did not do it because in the back of their minds, there was the SGS concept that you cannot enjoin a state from engaging in criminal prosecution or investigations within its own sovereign territory. So the Tokios Tokeles tribunal took no action on that.*\n\n*Now again, the question of urgency here, and the reference to rule 39(5) should be dealt with promptly by the Tribunal, yes, that is true, it would actually come before the Tribunal immediately upon the constitution of the Tribunal, but in my view, if I felt that I was being harassed to a point where there was urgent necessity to avoid an irreparable harm or something as bad as they are saying it is, I certainly would have made a request for provisional measures at the earliest possible moment.*\n\n*I would not have waited months to do it, and I certainly would not have done it in a way that looks rather tactical perhaps, 36 hours before the first session of the Tribunal. That is not the way I would have done it, if I were really concerned about an urgent necessity to avoid an irreparable harm.*\n\n*So again, with respect to the Biwater case, well, it is what it is; in the Biwater case, the tribunal refused, in similar situation, similar enough, nothing is on all fours, we know that, you are never going to find exactly the same case twice, but this was a case where documents had been seized, they were the documents of the other side, they had been seized by the state, and the Biwater tribunal simply refused to order the return, considering that preservation and the inventory, and they did not even mention access that much, would be sufficient. So we still believe that the Biwater case supports what we have been saying.*\n\n*So the last point is that it seems to me that once this handover process has been completed, CIOC will no longer have any active presence with respect to the contract in Kazakhstan, and that also I think will change the situation of possible animosity between the parties, each one with their own theories as to what this is really all about, and that is for the merits, and should not be prejudged here. So those are my few comments in response to remarks of counsel for the other side.\"* (Tr., pp. 116-120)\n\n**H. Considerations of the Tribunal Regarding Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal has given consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties in their written and oral submissions, all of which the Tribunal has found helpful. In this Decision, the Tribunal discusses the arguments of the Parties most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal\u2019s reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal itself considers to be the determinative factors required to decide the issues of provisional measures requested by Claimant in this case.\n\n**H.I. Preliminary Considerations**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n64.\n\nRegarding the applicable procedural law, as recorded in \u00a7 5 of the Minutes of the 1st Session, the ICSID Arbitration Rules as amended and effective on 10 April, 2006, shall apply to the proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nRegarding the applicable substantive law, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and primarily the BIT between Kazakhstan and the United States of America are applicable. Further, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) may be relied upon, and it is generally accepted and in line with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention that the Tribunal may refer to customary international law where the treaty is silent.\n\n**2. General Considerations regarding Provisional Measures in ICSID Proceedings.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nFor the decision on provisional measures, particularly Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules are applicable.\n\n67.\n\nIn that context it should be noted that, according to Rule 39, the Tribunal cannot order, but can only recommend provisional measures in ICSID proceedings.\n\n68.\n\nIf, as in the present case, a party requests provisional measures, the request must specify the three aspects mentioned in the last sentence of Rule 39 \u00a7 (1). As can be seen from the summaries of the Parties\u2019 contentions in this Decision, the Parties have dealt with these three aspects in detail.\n\n**3. The Relevance of the Decisions of other Tribunals**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIn the legal arguments made in their written and oral submissions, the Parties rely on a number of decisions of courts and tribunals. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to make certain general preliminary observations in this regard.\n\n70.\n\nFirst of all, the Tribunal considers it useful to make clear from the outset that it regards its task in these proceedings as a very specific one of applying the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and of arriving at the proper meaning to be given to the particular provisions in the context of the present dispute on provisional measures.\n\n71.\n\nOn the other hand, Article 32 VCLT permits recourse, as supplementary means of interpretation, not only to a treaty\u2019s \"preparatory work\" and the \"circumstances of its conclusion\", but indicates by the word \"including\" that, beyond the two means expressly mentioned, other supplementary means of interpretation may be applied in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 VCLT. Article 38(1)(d) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice provides that judicial decisions and awards are applicable for the interpretation of public international law as \"subsidiary means\". Therefore, these legal materials can also be understood to constitute \"supplementary means of interpretation\" in the sense of Article 32 VCLT.\n\n72.\n\nThat being so, it is not evident how far arbitral awards are of determinative relevance to the Tribunal\u2019s task. It is at all events clear that the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal. The references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n73.\n\nHowever, this does not preclude the Tribunal from considering arbitral decisions and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that it may find that they throw any useful light on the issues that arise for decision in this case.\n\n74.\n\nSuch an examination will be conducted by the Tribunal later in this Decision, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 contentions and arguments regarding the various issues argued and relevant for the interpretation of the applicable ICSID provisions.\n\n**4. Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n75.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has a certain discretion whether it considers that it should recommend provisional measures, the party requesting provisional measures must be considered to have the burden of proof regarding its request.\n\n**H.II. Request (a) to meet and discuss an agreement on orderly handover of the Contract Area within 30 days of the Tribunal\u2019s Order**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n76.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (a)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(a) that within 30 days of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order, representatives of Kazakhstan meet with representatives of CIOC at the Contract Area in order to discuss and agree upon the orderly hand-over of the Contract Area;\"*\n\n77.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position and arguments regarding a meeting to discuss the handover of the Contract Area are also dealt with in para. 47 of the Amended Request for Provisional Measures of 28 April 2009 (C-III, para. 47):\n\n*\"47. In these circumstances, CIOC\u2019s continued custody of the Contract Area exposes it to considerable risk and expense. Kazakhstan has made demands that CIOC relinquish the field yet, when CIOC has realised that it has no choice but to accept this outcome and has taken steps to effect an orderly handover, there has been no indication of any cooperation on the part of the MEMR in order to implement the relinquishment demanded in an economically and ecologically correct and responsible manner. Zapkaznedra officials failed to attend a meeting at an agreed time in order to coordinate the orderly handover of the Contract Area and failed to respond to CIOC\u2019s letter in which it proposed principles that would govern such a handover. KNB officers have since demanded that the wells be shut down. This order is in contravention of the recommendations and suggestions that CIOC has made to Kazakhstan as to the safe handover of the site. In particular, CIOC has emphasised that it would not be reasonable for CIOC simply to abandon the wells without proper maintenance and supervision since this would risk substantial economic and ecological damage. Any shut-down of the oil wells without following the appropriate oil field practices would also risk damage to the technical condition of the field and wells, as well as damage to the surrounding environment. Yet CIOC remains exposed to financial and legal risk by its continued occupation of the Contract Area, albeit as a custodian only, with no effective contractual rights.\"*\n\n78.\n\nIn its letter of 22 June 2009 Claimant\u2019s counsel referred to the letter by Mr. Safinov, Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, of 10 June 2009, in which the latter replies to Claimant\u2019s letter of 9 December 2008 and expresses his interest and readiness to meet with Claimant\u2019s representative to discuss the hand-over of the Contract Area. In the letter dated 22 June 2009 Claimant\u2019s counsel states as follows:\n\n*\"Notwithstanding this delay of over six months, our client remains willing to meet with representatives of the Ministry to discuss an orderly handover of the Contract Area. However, we propose that such a meeting should take place at the Contract Area on 24, 25, or 26 June 2009. Please note that any terms and conditions discussed at that meeting will be subject to review by Allen & Overy LLP, and the agreement recording such terms and conditions can only be signed by CIOC\u2019s competent management, who are currently not able to enter Kazakhstan due to the actions of the Kazakhstan Government. If the parties are not able to reach agreement as a result of that meeting, the Tribunal will still be able to consider CIOC\u2019s request for provisional measures as to the orderly handover of the Contract Area at the hearing in London on 30 June 2009.*\n\n*So far as the Ministry\u2019s proposed terms of the handover are concerned, please indicate in detail the terms and conditions it is proposed should be recorded in an agreement as per Condition A in Mr. Safinov\u2019s letter. So far as Condition B is concerned, subject to agreement on all other terms and conditions, our client is willing to accept in principle that the handover of the Field is irrevocable and permanent and that neither party shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the Contract (as defined in the Request for Arbitration) but shall be limited to claims in compensation or damages, and declaratory and injunctive relief in relation to any breaches of its terms.*\n\n*As for the Ministry\u2019s Condition C, the Tribunal is aware of this exchange of correspondence and the basis on which the handover is proposed. Accordingly either party should be at liberty to make such submissions in the arbitration as it sees fit as to the circumstances leading to the proposed handover.*\n\n*Kindly confirm your client\u2019s agreement to the proposed meeting, and the names of the Ministry\u2019s representatives who will attend. [...] \"*\n\n79.\n\nFurther, during the Hearing on 30 June 2009, Claimant argued (Tr., pp. 3032):\n\n*\"The Respondents categorise it as essentially falling into three different heads, and we are content to accept their categorisation, and we say that the duty of good faith and the duty not to aggravate are distinct duties, but, in broad terms, we are happy to deal with them together.*\n\n*The first issue is the handover of the field, and the Tribunal will appreciate that the background to this request was that the Claimant was put in the impossible position of effectively continuing operation, continuing a very limited production on the field, for safety reasons, and authorised by the relevant authorities, but, at the same time, it was being made the subject of criminal prosecutions. Both the company and its director, Hussam Hourani, were made the subject of criminal proceedings, and pursuant on the criminal proceedings, all the company\u2019s bank accounts were then frozen. I will not take you to it, but that is at tab 16, which is exhibit C-34 in your bundle. That was the Catch 22 that the company faced, and since then, the KNB have gone into the field at the time of the April hearing, and they have since sought effectively to close the wells, but the field has not been handed back, there has not been a formal handover, despite the fact, and, again, the correspondence is in the bundle and the submissions have referred to this -- the fact that last November and December, there were various communications between the parties which essentially ended with Caratube making clear that, effectively, they were stood up for one meeting in November. A meeting was suggested by the Republic; it was accepted by Caratube; the Republic did not show up. Caratube then wrote back and said, on 9 December, that they were willing to meet and to reschedule the meeting. No answer was ever received to that letter. We then have the request for provisional measures, which seek to address this question of handover. That went in on 14 April. The first we get a response to that is with the formal response that comes in to the application on 15 June, which has with it a 10 June letter saying, \"Yes, we will meet, but we will meet at a date after today\u2019s date\", so after this hearing. We say the rather cynical view of that is that it is nicely choreographed to ensure that this Tribunal can be told, \"Do not worry, it is all in hand, you do not need to have any role in this\". We say agreeing to an initial meeting really is not sufficiently concrete, and, whilst we would accept that the request for relief concerning the setting up of the meeting is now redundant, the second element of our relief [...] \".*\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n80.\n\nRespondent presented the following position as to the Request to the Hand-Over of the Contract Area to the Republic (R-II, paras. 5-6):\n\n*\"5. As indicated in our letter to the Tribunal dated April 29, 2009, the Republic has been studying CIOC\u2019s hand-over requests in a constructive manner and, following the completion of such study, has sent a letter to CIOC dated June 10, 2009, agreeing to meet with CIOC \"to discuss an orderly handover by CIOC of the Contract Area within a reasonable and practicable time period following our meetings, subject to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions for the relinquishment (FN: Ex. R-1, Letter from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic to CIOC dated June 10, 2009). In this letter, the Republic proposes an initial meeting between representatives of the Republic and CIOC at the Contract Area, as proposed by CIOC, on July 8 and 9, 2009. In light of the Republic\u2019s agreement as set forth in the letter, there is no need for the Tribunal to grant CIOC\u2019s requests for provisional measures relating to the hand-over of the Contract Area, since those requests are rendered moot by the Republic\u2019s letter.*\n\n*6. In sum, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal let the parties meet together and work out the hand-over of the Contract Area without granting any provisional measures in that regard. Indeed, we would suggest that any such provisional measures would be counterproductive.\"*\n\n81.\n\nIn the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Respondent further argued (Tr., pp. 53-58):\n\n*\"The handover of the contract area: by its letter to the Claimant, dated June 10, 2009, and this was the Ministry itself writing directly to the Claimant, reflecting the Ministry, the Republic\u2019s position and point of view and intentions, the Republic responded to Claimant\u2019s handover proposal, which was made in their documents, and agreed to meet with the Claimant in order to organise the handover.*\n\n*I would suggest that you look at the letter itself, which is in our hearing binder. It is tab number 1 of the hearing binder. If you turn to tab number 1 and look at the first page, at (a) and (b), there are two separate points that the Republic is saying here. First, they are agreeing to meet with representatives of CIOC on Wednesday, July 8 and Thursday, July 9 -- those were the proposed dates, we will come back to that -- at the contract area, which was requested by Claimant, in order to discuss an orderly handover of the contract area, and proceed with the taking over of the contract area within a reasonable and practicable time period following our meetings, subject to mutual agreement on the terms and conditions of the relinquishment.*\n\n*This mainly mirrors Claimant\u2019s own request. They themselves, in their letter back to us, also recognise that, so far as condition (b) is concerned, subject to agreement on all of the terms and conditions, 'our client is willing to accept the principle of the handover would be irrevocable...' and so on. That is their letter dated June 22, 2009, addressed to myself and Geoffroy Lyonnet.*\n\n*They also state in their letter, and we were pleased to see that, because we feel there is agreement here, that they are prepared to meet and proceed with this handover.*\n\n*With respect to that, I would like to make an assurance to this Tribunal, and also to Claimant here: the Republic is totally serious about doing this. We, as counsel, have advised them that they should do it, that this was the proper thing to do. They agreed with that, and sent their own letter, signed by the Ministry, stating their intention to do this.*\n\n*So I would just like to assure you that this is something that will go ahead, because, clearly, the parties want to do this. Both parties want to do this. As we stated in the letter that we sent, the Ministry has asked that a representative of our firm, in this case Geoffroy Lyonnet, would be present at the time, so that he could advise the Republic on making this thing go smoothly. That is our intention, and that is the Republic\u2019s intention, and I want to say that to all of you very clearly.*\n\n*As to the timing, let us just say a brief word about that. The timing that was proposed by the Ministry was both consistent with the Claimant\u2019s requested provisional measures, and also was a time when they could get all of the necessary people together to be able to go to the contract area, because that is quite a trip. You have to fly from Astana or Almaty to Aktobe, and then there is something like a ten hour car trip to the field, and many people will need to be present.*\n\n*So what had been requested in the provisional measures request was that the first meeting be within 30 days of the recommendation of the Tribunal. We are proposing that the meeting will be held next week, and I am surprised not to hear from you, and I hope maybe later on in the day we will hear from you, because our people are there, and they are ready to go for the 8th and the 9th and meet with you and move this forward, and I say that very sincerely and very seriously, and I would like to hear from you whether you are going to be there on the 8th or the 9th, because, if not, we are going to have to call the whole thing off, and tell people that they should not keep their time slots open, and all the rest of that. So we want to know, are you going to come to this meeting, having requested a meeting, and having agreed to the principle of going through with this process?*\n\n*So, in view of the above, in view of the obvious agreement of the parties, that this should be done, and in view of the willingness of Kazakhstan to move forward with this, I point out that, in their own requests, they provide for a period of 120 days from the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order to make this work. That is because there are some technical issues that have to be gone through. The parties need to sit down with technical people and talk this through and get it done. It does not happen in one meeting, it does not happen overnight, there are details that have to be worked out, but these details will be worked out constructively, with a positive view of making this handover happen, and that is what we have in mind, absolutely. So I wanted to reassure you on that.*\n\n*So, in view of all of what I have said, we would simply submit that there is no urgent necessity for any provisional measure at this time with respect to the handover, and that there is no or necessity or irreparable harm to be avoided.*\n\n*Beyond that, we genuinely believe that it would be best to let the parties work this process out together, without any pro-active measures by the Tribunal, which, given the willingness of the parties to go forward, we believe would not be helpful, under the circumstances.*\n\n*So those are the points that I wanted to raise with you, with respect to the issue of the handover.\"*\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n82.\n\nAt the outset, the following discussion during the Hearing on 30 June 2009 may be recalled (Tr., pp. 75-77):\n\n*\"THE CHAIRMAN: Regarding (a) and (b), which is the handover issue, we take it that the meeting will take place on 8 and 9 July?*\n\n*MS GILL: Yes, sir.*\n\n*THE CHAIRMAN: Claimant will be there, that question was raised.*\n\n*MS GILL: Yes, we have been asking for a long time, we will be there. We are arranging for representatives -- CIOC\u2019s management obviously cannot be there, Mr Antar would be the most obvious person, but we are arranging for someone else to be there.*\n\n*THE CHAIRMAN: Very good. (b), of course, is the follow-up on that, and our hope would be that when you meet, you also agree on whatever is necessary regarding (b). Claimant has given a certain period for that, you have made some reservations about the period, but that is a matter that the parties can discuss when they meet on the field.*\n\n*Regarding (a) and (b) therefore, we would feel that for the time being, subject to what we hear from you, we would feel that the Tribunal, which obviously cannot issue an order anyway within a day or so, would wait, hoping that the parties can agree, not only on (a) but also on (b), and obviously, a party may come back to the Tribunal if that expectation is not fulfilled, and if there is any difficulty which is met in that process.\"*\n\n83.\n\nSince the hearing in London, the contacts regarding the 1st meeting for a handover have continued. The last information the Tribunal received in this regard is the e-mail of 6 July 2009 from Respondent\u2019s Counsel Lyonnet who was travelling to the meeting. No further information regarding the meeting has been received thereafter to the time this Decision is issued..\n\n84.\n\nIn view of these further developments, the Tribunal considers that the objective of Claimant\u2019s 1st Request has been reached and therefore the Request is moot and thus there is no need any more for any recommendations in this regard.\n\n**H.III. Request (b) that Respondent accepts Claimant\u2019s relinquishment of the field at Respondent\u2019s own expense and risk, within 120 days of the Tribunal\u2019s order or within such other period Parties agree**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n85.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (b)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(b) that within 120 days of the date of the Tribunal\u2019s order, or within such other period as the parties may agree, and without prejudice to the parties\u2019 claims in this arbitration, Kazakhstan accepts CIOC\u2019s relinquishment of the field at Kazakhstan\u2019s own expense and risk;\"*\n\n86.\n\nClaimant described the circumstances leading to this request in para. 47 of its Amended Request for Provisional Measures of 29 April 2009. (see quote above H.II., para. 78).\n\n87.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Claimant argued (Tr., pp. 3233):\n\n*\"Whilst we would accept that the request for relief concerning the setting up of the meeting is now redundant, the second element of our relief in paragraph 53(b) of our request for provisional measures is still very much live, because the Claimant needs to be sure that this handover properly happens. I am talking about paragraph 53(b) of Claimant\u2019s relief. So that is still, we say, very much live. We need an end date, and we need the Tribunal involved in this process, because the history of it is such that one has concerns that this agreement to a meeting, even if it is fulfilled, is not an end of itself. It needs actually to achieve that handover.\"*\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n88.\n\nSee above (H.II., paras 81 and 82)\n\n89.\n\nFurther, in the course of the Hearing on 30 June 2009, Respondent argued (Tr., p. 58):\n\n*\"They mention something about an end date, you know. What they requested was it should be 120 days, as otherwise agreed by the parties. We will make every effort to do this as quickly as possible, but to put an artificial end date will not change anything here, because the parties will go through and do it to the best of their ability as quickly as they can.\"*\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n90.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal recalls the discussion during the London hearing quoted above in H.II.3. In this context, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to point out that the meeting which was subject to Claimant\u2019s Request (a) considered in the above section of this Decision cannot be the end of the process and that, within a period agreed by the parties or, if no agreement can be reached, within a reasonable period after the meeting, Kazakhstan has an obligation to accept CIOC\u2019s relinquishment of the field at Kazakhstan\u2019s own expense and risk. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the 120 days suggested by Claimant would be a reasonable time period for this process, unless specific circumstances make a longer duration unavoidable.\n\n91.\n\nAnd as noted above regarding Request (a), again the Tribunal notes further that, according to the latest information it has received from the Parties, since the hearing in London the further discussions between the Parties regarding the procedure until the handover are continuing.\n\n92.\n\nIn view of these developments, the Tribunal considers that presently there is no need to recommend provisional measures in this regard.\n\n93.\n\nHowever, if the Parties cannot agree on and complete the handover within a reasonable period, taking into account the various steps necessary in that context, a Party may submit a new and updated request for a provisional measure in this regard.\n\n**H.IV. Request (c) to order Respondent to take measures to ensure the preservation of all documents, files, computer disks and all other materials taken from Claimant\u2019s offices and the Caratube oilfield since April 16, 2009 and to return all such materials within 5 days of the Tribunal\u2019s Order**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n94.\n\nClaimant makes the following request (C-III, para. 53 (c)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(c) that Kazakhstan takes measures to ensure the preservation of all documents, files, computer disks and all other materials taken from CIOC\u2019s offices in Aktobe and Almaty and from the Caratube oilfield since 16 April 2009 and that all such materials, including the corporate seals, are returned to CIOC care of its solicitors, Allen & Overy LLP, within 5 days of the Tribunal\u2019s order;\"*\n\n95.\n\nFurther details concerning this request are provided in paras. 44-45 of the Amended Request for Provisional Measures (C-III, paras. 44, 45) which read as follows:\n\n*\"44. The details of the raids on the 16 and 17 April 2009 are contained within the 24 April 2009 Letter and in the official reports prepared by the Kazakh authorities (**Exhibits C-51 and C-52)**. Whilst CIOC does not agree with every detail recorded, the reports confirm the fact of the pertinent raid and those present (although the report of the raid at the Almaty office fails to mention that there were approximately 30 officers in total present). We have been instructed that although the reports confirm that a large number of documents and files were seized, they materially understate the volume of documents, files and other materials taken.*\n\n*45. The seizure of substantially all of CIOC\u2019s documents and materials (including its corporate seals) reinforces the need for this Amended Application, having put in doubt CIOC\u2019s ability to present its case fully in this arbitration. The documents and materials seized form evidence upon which CIOC might otherwise rely to argue and prove its case, including to quantify the loss it has suffered. The KNB officers carrying out the recent raids also made no attempts to conceal that the purpose of such raids was to find documents to suggest that Devincci Hourani is not the owner of CIOC in an attempt to support potential objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In the raid on 26 April 2006 we are instructed that CIOC staff were even pressured to sign false documents that assert that it was not Devincci Hourani who, in 2002, acquired the rights under the Contract. CIOC staff refused to do so as the allegation is not true.\"*\n\n96.\n\nFurther, during the Hearing on 30 June 2009, Claimant presented additional arguments in this regard (Tr., pp. 33, 113-116).\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n97.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position on this and the remaining requests for provisional measures is contained in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures (R-II, paras. 7-32):\n\n***\"III. Requests Relating to Future Conduct of the Republic and Requests Relating to Documents***\n\n*7. The Republic will first review the applicable criteria for granting provisional measures and then will apply them to each of the remaining two categories of CIOC\u2019s requests for provisional measures.*\n\n*A. Applicable Criteria for Granting Provisional Measures*\n\n*8. While Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant tribunals the power to issue provisional measures, such measures are nevertheless considered extraordinary and as such cannot be treated lightly. The Tribunals in both Phoenix Action and Occidental Petroleum, using the exact same language, explicitly stated: \"[i]t is not contested that provisional measures are extraordinary measures which should not recommended lightly.\" (FN: Ex. **RL-1.** Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Decision on Provisional Measures dated April 6, 2007, 33 (\"Phoenix\"); Ex. **CA-3.** Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures dated August 17, 2007, 59\u00a0\"Occidental\"). In addition, as stated in ICSID\u2019s Note D to Rule 39: \"[t]he measures recommended must be 'provisional' in character and be appropriate in nature, extent and duration to the risk existing for the rights to be preserved.\" (FN: Ex. **RL-2.** Notes to Rule 39, Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), January 1, 1968, Note D)*\n\n*9. Taking the above into account, tribunals have applied the following criteria in order to determine whether to grant a provisional measure:*\n\n*(i) A right to be preserved must exist at the time of the request, must not be hypothetical, and must not concern future rights; (ii) The provisional measure must not be too broad; (iii) There must be circumstances of necessity and urgency in order to avoid irreparable harm; and (iv) The provisional measure must not pre-judge the Claimant\u2019s case.*\n\n*Each of these criteria will be discussed in more detail below.*\n\n*(i) A Right to Be Preserved Must Exist at the Time of the Request, Must not Be Hypothetical, and Must not Concern Future Rights*\n\n*10. Tribunals may exercise their authority to issue provisional measures only to protect rights which actually exist at the time of the request. In addition, the right to be preserved must not be hypothetical or must not be a future right. This follows from Arbitration Rule 39 which provides that \"a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal.\" As summarized by the Maffezini Tribunal:*\n\n*12. Rule 39(1) specifies that a party may request '... provisional measures for the preservation of its rights....'*\n\n*13. The use of the present tense implies that such rights must exist at the time of the request, must not be hypothetical, nor are ones to be created in the future. (English translation of Spanish original; Ex. RL-3. Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2 dated October 28, 1999, UK 12-13 (\"Maffezini\").*\n\n*(ii) The Provisional Measure Must not Be too Broad*\n\n*11. A requested measure must be specific in its object and scope and must not be too broad. A clear example of the application of this criterion can be found in the SGS case, where the Tribunal refused to grant a provisional measure that was too broad and also concerned possible future actions. (FN: Ex. RL-4. SGS Societe Generate de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 dated October 16, 2002 (\"SGS\"). As stated by the Tribunal:*\n\n*Sub-item (4) of Request No. 1 seeks a recommendation that the Respondent refrain from commencing or participating in 'all proceedings in the courts of Pakistan relating in any way to this arbitration' in the future. This is too broad a request. The Tribunal is aware of Pakistan\u2019s concerns about the circumstances in which the PSI Agreement was allegedly procured. We have taken careful note of the fact that there have been legal proceedings in Pakistan relating to the PSI Agreement. The Supreme Court\u2019s Reasons for Judgment record the fact of the investigation into the origins of the PSI Agreement and its granting by a former government of Pakistan. There may be further proceedings in that connection in the future. We cannot enjoin a State from conducting the normal processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice within its own territory. We cannot, therefore, purport to restrain the ordinary exercise of these processes, (underlining added) (footnotes omitted)*\n\n*(iii) There Must Be Circumstances of Necessity and Urgency in order to Avoid Irreparable Harm*\n\n*12. This criterion includes three conditions, all of which must be met. The request for provisional measures must be based upon circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid an irreparable harm. As fully laid out in Occidental Petroleum :*\n\n*59. It is also well established that provisional measures should only be granted in situations of necessity and urgency in order to protect rights that could, absent such measures, be definitely lost.... In other words, the circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party\u2019s rights and where the need is urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm.*\n\n*61. In other words, in order for an international tribunal to grant provisional measures, there must exist both a right to be preserved and circumstances of necessity and urgency to avoid irreparable harm.(emphasis in original; FN: Ex.**CA-3.** Occidental, 1ffl 59, 61.)*\n\n*(iv) The Provisional Measure Must not Pre-judge the Claimant\u2019s Case*\n\n*13. Provisional measures are measures of protection and not measures of enforcement (FN: Ex. **RL-5.** Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited and Independent Power Tanzania Limited, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8, Appendix A to Final Award dated June 22, 2001, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures dated December 20, 1999,1J13 (\"[T]here is in our view a distinction to be drawn between the protection of rights and the enforcement of rights.\") (emphasis in original) (\" Tanzania\")). This criterion makes it clear that a tribunal must not recommend provisional measures that pre-judge a party\u2019s case on the merits. This has been repeatedly set out by tribunals. As stated by the Maffezini Tribunal:*\n\n*20. Expectations of success or failure in an arbitration or judicial case are conjectures. Until this Arbitral Tribunal hands down an award, no one can state with any certainty what its outcome will be. The meritoriousness of the Claimant\u2019s case will be decided by the Tribunal based on the law and the evidence presented to it.*\n\n*21. A determination at this time which may cast a shadow on either party\u2019s ability to present its case is not acceptable. It would be improper for the Tribunal to pre-judge the Claimant\u2019s case by recommending provisional measures of this nature.10 (English translation of Spanish original; FN: Ex. **RL-3.** Maffezini, Iff 20-21.)*\n\n*As also stated by the Pey Casado Tribunal:*\n\n*45. It is clearly out of the question for the Arbitral Tribunal to prejudge in any manner (if it were to find that it has jurisdiction on the merits) what its decision may be regarding the substance of the dispute....*\n\n*46.... For its part, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot and does not want to pre-judge anything, or even, strictly speaking, 'to presume anything in an anticipatory manner. (English translation of French original; FN: Ex. CA-7. Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. The Republic of Chile, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on Request for Provisional Measures dated September 25, 1983, Tffl 45-46.)*\n\n*14. Having reviewed the relevant criteria for granting provisional measures, we will now examine the two remaining categories of CIOC\u2019s requests in light of those criteria.*\n\n*B. Application of these Criteria to the Requests Relating to Future Conduct of the Republic*\n\n*15. In its Request, CIOC presents items d) through g), as quoted in paragraph 2 above, as four separate requests for provisional measures. In fact, those requests are really different formulations of what is essentially one request: i.e. that this Tribunal should recommend to the Republic that it stop engaging in certain alleged conduct in the future. Item d) refers to stopping harassment; item e) refers to desisting from conduct that violates the parties\u2019 duties of good faith and equality; item f) refers to refraining from any other measures that would aggravate the dispute; and item g) refers to refraining from pursuing any criminal complaints against CIOC arising out of CIOC\u2019s continued occupation of the field and activities after February 1, 2008. All of those items presuppose that the Republic has engaged and will engage in certain conduct, as characterized by CIOC, and seek to have this Tribunal recommend that the Republic cease such conduct in the future. These items seek to protect the same alleged rights, arise from the same alleged facts, complain about the same alleged conduct, and, as will be shown below, are in fact defective for essentially the same reasons. As a result, the Republic will deal with all four together in this section.*\n\n*16. Before proceeding further with this analysis, the Republic wishes to state to the Tribunal that it firmly denies that it has engaged in harassment, violations of good faith and equality or improper criminal investigations. CIOC no doubt makes these allegations in an attempt to disparage the Republic, to solicit sympathy from the Tribunal and to create a basis for certain of its treaty claims in this arbitration. Indeed, CIOC has made a specific monetary damage claim for alleged moral, non-material damage caused to CIOC and allegedly arising out of conduct of the Republic as characterized by CIOC. These matters will be dealt with, as appropriate, in the Republic\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the merits where that discussion belongs and after the Republic has had the requisite time to set out its defenses. For the time being, the Republic will point out some examples of incorrect or misleading statements that have been made by CIOC with respect to the Republic\u2019s conduct.*\n\n*17. First, CIOC alleges that two employees of CIOC, Rashid Badran and Nader Hourani, have been put under house arrest (FN: Letter from CIOC\u2019s counsel to the Tribunal dated May 19, 2009.) Attached as an exhibit hereto is a report from Inspector B. Tusov to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic which states that \"no measures were taken to arrest Mr. Badran Rashid Mahmud and Nader Hourani Zib or to place them under home arrest by the operational investigative group of the KNB.\" (FN: Ex. R-2. First Report from B. Tusov, Inspector of the Operational Investigative Group of the National Security Committee, to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic (\"First Tusov Report\"). In addition, CIOC alleges that travel and identity documents of those two employees were \"confiscated without any justification. \"(FN: Letter from CIOC\u2019s counsel to the Tribunal dated May 19, 2009) Inspector Tusov\u2019s report explains that the documents of these two employees, who are not citizens of Kazakhstan, were taken in order to determine their legal status in Kazakhstan (FN: Ex- R-2. First Tusov Report). The report indicates that Mr. Hourani does not have a valid work permit and that Mr. Badran obtained a residency permit through a fictitious marriage. In addition, Inspector Tusov states that the documents will be returned to their owners at the end of the verification procedure. Inspector Tusov concludes by stating that \"[t]he specialists of the operational investigative group of the KNB treat Badran R.M. and Hourani N.Z. respectfully; all contacts with them are only of procedural character, no moral and especially no physical pressure is put on them. Withdrawal and checking of their documents is being done in accordance with the Legislation of RK.\"*\n\n*18. Next, CIOC implies that it does not have access to documents and to the CIOC corporate seals seized by the competent authorities of the Republic in connection with criminal investigations. As discussed in paragraph 32 below, to which we refer the Tribunal, CIOC representatives have in fact asked for and were granted access to seized documents as well as to the CIOC corporate seals, which they actually used to stamp documents.*\n\n*19. Finally, CIOC has made numerous allegations of improper conduct by the Republic concerning the operation of the oil field. The Republic reserves its right to discuss these matters fully on the merits in its CounterMemorial. At this early stage, the Republic vigorously contests that it acted without regard to best oil field practices or necessary safety precautions, as alleged by CIOC.*\n\n*20. The Republic now turns to its analysis of the requests for provisional measures made by CIOC in items d) through g). CIOC is asking the Tribunal to presume at this early stage of the arbitration that the Republic has in fact engaged in conduct that constitutes harassment, aggravation of the dispute, or the absence of good faith and recommend that the Republic not continue such conduct into the future. The Republic submits that those requests presume a hypothetical need for protection, are too broad, are not necessary or urgent in order to avoid irreparable harm and would require the Tribunal to pre-judge CIOC\u2019s case. As such, those criteria for granting provisional measures, as detailed in section A above, are not met.*\n\n*21. First, the Republic submits that the Tribunal is not presently in a position to determine whether CIOC\u2019s characterization of the Republic\u2019s conduct is correct. The request is thus based upon a hypothetical need for protection.*\n\n*22. Second, CIOC\u2019s requests are clearly too broad. They contain sweeping recommendations that the Republic desist from any conduct which violates the parties\u2019 duties of good faith, refrain from taking any other measures in relation to CIOC that would aggravate the dispute and stop any harassment.*\n\n*23. With respect specifically to the criminal investigations, no tribunal has found that merely preventing general aggravation of the dispute without a threat to the tribunal\u2019s own jurisdiction is sufficient to interfere in anything more than a de minimis manner with a state\u2019s sovereign powers. In the few cases where tribunals have found that a provisional measure calling for interference with state functions was warranted and enforceable, either the interference was minimal or the state action enjoined was directly related to the rights at issue in the arbitration to a degree such that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was threatened or the Claimant\u2019s ability to obtain the relief sought was severely compromised. (FN: See, e.g., Ex. CA-2. Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 3 dated January 18, 2005 (\"Tokios Order No. 3\") (granting a broad measure, but refusing to enforce that measure on grounds of lack of urgency)). Similar circumstances are simply not present in this case.*\n\n*24. In fact, in Tokios, the case so heavily relied on by Claimant in its argument that \"authority exists\" for a tribunal to issue broad provisional measures interfering with state action (FN: Request, 58-59.), the Tribunal, though it did issue a measure prohibiting any state action \"which might in any way jeopardize the principle of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute,\" refused to enjoin state action analogous to that taken by the Republic (FN: Ex. **CA-8.** Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1 dated July 1, 2003, H 3.). In a subsequent order, the Tokios Tribunal found that its provisional measure was not violated either by an administrative investigation or the criminal prosecution of one of the principals of the claimant (FN: See Ex. **CA-2**. Tokios Order No. 3). The Tokios Tribunal found that these state actions simply do not amount to actions which might aggravate a dispute such that claimant\u2019s rights (whatever those rights may be) are in urgent need of protection from irreparable harm.*\n\n*25. Other tribunals have also refused to exercise their power to issue sweeping provisional measures in cases such as this one. For example, in SGS the Tribunal found that a request for provisional measures, similar in scope to the ones CIOC now requests, seeking to restrain all future state action, was overly broad and could not be justified (FN: Ex. **RL-4**, SGS, p. 301). Noting an arbitral tribunal\u2019s lack of authority to issue such broad provisional orders, the SGS Tribunal stated: \"[w]e cannot enjoin a State from conducting the normal processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice within its own territory. We cannot, therefore, purport to restrain the ordinary exercise of these processes.\"*\n\n*26. CIOC, like SGS, has failed to meet its burden to show that provisional measures which would severely impinge on the Republic\u2019s right to exercise its legitimate sovereign powers are warranted. Assuming arguendo that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain all of the claims that CIOC has pled, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is not threatened. Rather, CIOC\u2019s request that the Tribunal issue a provisional measure to the effect that it should cease any existing or future criminal investigations against CIOC amounts to an improper request for immunity from prosecution.*\n\n*27. Third, CIOC\u2019s requests are not based upon circumstances of necessity and urgency in order to avoid irreparable harm. With respect to urgency and necessity, it should be pointed out that the conduct that CIOC refers to allegedly began as early as 2007 and continued through 2008 and 2009. CIOC filed its Request for Arbitration on June 16, 2008, yet it only filed its first Request for Provisional Measures on April 14, 2009, just two days before the First Session of the Tribunal. This seems more motivated by tactics than by urgency and necessity. Surely, if any such urgency and necessity existed, CIOC would have taken action long before it did. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 39(1) a party may request provisional measures within the ICSID proceedings at any time after the institution of the proceedings, which, pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the Institution Rules, is the date of the registration of the Request for Arbitration. In this case the date of the registration of CIOC\u2019s Request for Arbitration was August 26, 2008. As stated by the Tokios Tribunal, \"Claimant cannot credibly claim that circumstances it did not consider urgent 18 months ago are urgent now.\" (FN: Ex. CA-2. Tokios Order No. 3, 13).*\n\n*28. Moreover, CIOC is simply not currently exposed to any irreparable harm. In its Memorial, dated May 14, 2009, CIOC states claims for money damages and does not seek specific performance. There is therefore no threat that CIOC will not be able to obtain the relief it seeks in the absence of provisional measures. Even if the Tribunal were to find CIOC\u2019s claims to be warranted, any damages caused to CIOC by any aggravation could be compensated with money damages. In that regard, tribunals have repeatedly held that provisional measures are not justified when their effect is to mitigate damages (FN: See Ex. RL-1. Phoenix 1 39 (denying request for provisional measures where the relief sought was equivalent to the relief sought in the final award); see also Ex. RL-6. Plama Consortium Limited and Republic of Bulgaria, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Order dated September 6, 2005, J 41 (rejecting request to stop local court bankruptcy proceedings because harm was limited by scope of relief granted and scope of relief is limited to money damages); Ex. RL-5. Tanzania K 16 (finding that where what claimant asks for is in effect enforcement of the agreement, Tribunal has no power to grant provisional measures. As stated by the Occidental Tribunal: Provisional measures are not designed to merely mitigate the final amount of damages. Indeed, if they were so intended, provisional measures would be available to a claimant in almost every case. In any situation resulting from an illegal act, the mere passage of time aggravates the damages that can be ultimately granted and it is well known that this is not a sufficient basis for ordering provisional measures. (FN: Ex. CA-3. Occidental, H 97.)*\n\n*In making this conclusion, tribunals have consistently relied on the dual facts that a claimant has no \"existing right\" to the object of the prayer for relief in its Request for Arbitration until it has proven its case on the merits and also, that where harm can be later compensated for with money damages, there is no urgency to protect against that harm. This is so because, there is \"a distinction to be drawn between the protection of rights and the enforcement of rights.\" (emphasis in original)*\n\n*29. Fourth, the provisional measures requested by CIOC would prejudge CIOC\u2019s case. In its Memorial dated May 14, 2009, CIOC claims money damages associated with the Republic\u2019s alleged harassment, aggravation, etc. and also alleges that such conduct of the Republic forms the basis for certain of its treaty claims in this arbitration. The Tribunal must thus decide in its final award on the merits whether or not such harassment existed, whether or not CIOC is entitled to money damages with respect thereto and whether any such alleged harassment can form a basis for CIOC\u2019s treaty claims. The provisional measures requested by CIOC would thus require the Tribunal to pre-judge CIOC\u2019s case by presuming now that the Republic has engaged in such harassment, well before it must make that determination in its final award and at a time when, as stated in the Maffezini case, \"no one can state with any certainty what its outcome will be.\" In such a situation, as again stated in Maffezini: \"[i]t would be improper for the Tribunal to pre-judge the Claimant\u2019s case by recommending provisional measures of this nature.\" It is not an uncommon tactic for a party to use a request for provisional measures to incite the tribunal to take a position early in the arbitration with respect to matters that must be decided in the final award on the merits. Such tactics should not succeed.*\n\n*C. Application of these Criteria to the Request Relating to Documents*\n\n*30. This request for provisional measures is set out as item c), quoted in paragraph 2 above. In its Request, CIOC\u2019s states the goal of having \"access to its documents and materials, including its corporate seals, so that it can present its case in these proceedings to the fullest extent possible.\" In item c) CIOC refers to the need for \"preservation\" of documents as well as having documents returned to them. The Republic will examine these issues below. By the statement quoted just above, CIOC implies that without access it is unable to \"present its case in these proceedings to the fullest extent possible.\" However, CIOC has not specified any documents or categories of documents which it is lacking in order to present its case. Indeed, CIOC\u2019s Memorial of May 14, 2009 includes many documents and contains no indication of any inability to present its case due to lack of access to seized documents. There is thus no showing of urgency or necessity to avoid an irreparable harm.*\n\n*The Republic fully recognizes that it has a duty to preserve seized materials. The Republic is in fact discharging this duty. The Reports of Search dated April 16 and 17, 2009 which were duly provided to CIOC by the competent authorities of the Republic and were produced by CIOC itself, state that upon seizure the materials were placed in boxes and packages and receipts were provided to employees of CIOC (FN: Ex. C-51**.** Report of Search dated April 16,2009; Ex. C-52. Report of Search dated April 17, 2009.)*\n\n*31. Thus, there is no imminent threat that the materials will be destroyed and consequently no urgent need for provisional measures ordering their preservation. CIOC\u2019s representatives have in fact asked for and were granted access to the seized materials, including the CIOC corporate seals. This is clearly stated in the attached report from Investigator B. Tusov to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic (FN: Ex. R-3. Second Report from B. Tusov, Inspector of the Operational Investigative Group of the National Security Committee, to the Ministry of Justice of the Republic). In that report, Mr. Tusov states that \"employees of the representative office of 'CIOC LLP in Aktobe city have full access to the documents seized from the offices located in Aktobe and at Caratube field.\"*\n\n*32. The report goes on to name the CIOC employees who were given access to documents and who used the corporate seals. Once again, there is no showing of any urgent necessity or risk of irreparable harm to CIOC. Given that the documents are being preserved during the criminal investigations and that CIOC has access to them, there is also no showing of any urgent necessity or risk of irreparable harm requiring a provisional measure recommending the return of those documents.\"*\n\n98.\n\nIn the Hearing of 30 June 2009 Respondent presented additional arguments in this regard (Tr., pp. 67-74).\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n99.\n\nFirst of all, Tribunal recalls the comments by the Parties regarding this Request during the hearing in response to the Tribunal\u2019s questions (Tr., pp. 49, 77-78, 81-97, 119-121).\n\n100.\n\nRegarding this Request, in view of the particular importance of procedural equality between the parties in an arbitration proceeding and that all parties can use and rely on the same evidence, the Tribunal notes with pleasure that, during the hearing, considerable progress and agreement could be reached in the discussion between the Parties and the Tribunal.\n\n101.\n\nIn particular, as recorded in the Transcript on pages 77, 81 and 82, in response to the respective questions by the Tribunal, Respondent has agreed that\n\n\u2022 all documents taken by Respondent shall be preserved by Respondent,\n\n\u2022 Respondent will grant to representatives of Claimant access to all documents of to which Claimant requests access,\n\n\u2022 the Representatives of Claimant may copy any such documents,\n\n\u2022 Representatives of Claimant may take such copies out of Kazakhstan to London.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the term \"documents\" used during this discussion at the hearing of the Request numbered (c) includes files, computer disks and other material taken from Claimant\u2019s offices by representatives of Respondent so that the undertakings by Respondent summarized above also refer to these other materials.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms these undertakings by Respondent, and in view of them, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to issue any further recommendations for provisional measures in this regard.\n\n104.\n\nIn so far as a Party wishes to have access to further documents, it may use the procedure provided in \u00a7\u00a7 14.7 to 14.11 of the Minutes of the 1st Session for document production requests according to the timetable given in those provisions.\n\n**H.V. Request (d) to order Respondent and all its agencies to stop harassment of Claimant\u2019s employees, directors and owners, including their families**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n105.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (d)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(d) that, in order to avoid an unnecessary aggravation of the dispute, Kazakhstan and all departments, agencies, emanations and other persons for which it is legally responsible stop immediately any harassment of the employees, directors and owners of CIOC, including their families;\"*\n\n106.\n\nThe alleged harassment of Claimant\u2019s employees, directors and owners is further presented in paras. 41-42 of Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Arbitration (C-III, paras. 41-42):\n\n*\"41. Yet at the same time, CIOC is subject to criminal investigations linked to the alleged unlicensed oilfield operations. As already mentioned in paragraph 42 of the Request for Arbitration and will be described further in evidence to be served with the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the majority owner of CIOC, Mr Devincci Hourani, his family, and CIOC\u2019s employees have been subjected to a sustained and protracted campaign of harassment and intimidation by Kazakhstan\u2019s organs and agencies including the Kazakhstan national security agents. Devincci Hourani was, on one occasion, dragged from his bed in the middle of the night and taken to an undisclosed location to be subjected to interrogation by armed Government agents. Devincci Hourani and his brothers have also been threatened that they would face criminal charges, in at least one case expressly on the basis that this would happen if they did not assist the Government in its dispute with the President\u2019s former son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev.*\n\n*42. All of Devincci Hourani\u2019s business assets in Kazakhstan, including a number of companies besides CIOC, have been taken from him. He finally fled Kazakhstan in March 2008, fearing for his safety, and has not returned since. However members of his family remain, as do CIOC employees who since mid-2007 and to this day continue to be subject to harassment and intimidation. CIOC staff have been subjected to repeated interrogations that have led to a number of employees resigning without notice and had a significant negative impact on the morale of those who remain. Some individuals appear to have suffered health issues caused by the stress of working in such a tense and intimidating environment. The sum of Kazakhstan\u2019s conduct, including the wrongful repudiation of the Contract, as well as the harassment and persecution briefly mentioned above, have destroyed CIOC\u2019s investment such that there is no longer any realistic possibility of resurrecting it.\"*\n\n107.\n\nIn the hearing on 30 June 2009 Claimant presented further arguments in this regard (Tr., pp. 48-49, 107-108).\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n108.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position on this and the remaining requests for provisional measures is contained in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures (R-II, paras. 7-32): See above, H.IV.2.\n\n109.\n\nIn the hearing on 30 June 2009 Respndent presented further arguments in this regard (Tr., pp. 62-67).\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n110.\n\nIn view of the common discussion at the London Hearing between the Parties and the Tribunal regarding the group of Claimant\u2019s Requests numbered (d), (e) and (f), the Tribunal will deal with Request (d) below in section H.VI.of this Decision.\n\n**H.VI. Request to order Respondent to desist from any conduct which violates the Parties\u2019 duties of good faith and equality in this arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n111.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (e)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(e) that Kazakhstan desists from any conduct which violates the parties\u2019 duties of good faith and equality in this arbitration; \"*\n\n112.\n\nClaimant stresses the urgency factor which applies in particular to this request (C-III, para. 57):\n\n***\"3.3 Circumstances requiring the recommendation of provisional measures***\n\n*57. CIOC requests the requested measures, including in particular in relation to (e) above, as a matter of urgency. These measures are also necessary to ensure CIOC\u2019s ability to furnish evidence of its claim. Necessity and urgency are recognised in ICSID practice as being present where a respondent fails to take steps to preserve or to provide documentation relevant to the claimant\u2019s case, or in circumstances where there is a risk of loss or destruction of such documentation.* [FN: Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, para. 86 (**Authority C-4**).] \"\n\n113.\n\nIn the hearing on 30 June 2009 Claimant presented further arguments in this regard (Tr., pp. 30, 33-38).\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n114.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position on this and the remaining requests for provisional measures is contained in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures (R-II, paras. 7-32): See above, H.IV.2.\n\n115.\n\nIn its Closing Statement in the course of the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Respondent added the following comment (Tr., p. 117):\n\n*\"If something happens, there is always a possibility then to do something about it, but I can assure you that we as counsel will be advising our clients very clearly to be acting in good faith with respect to this Arbitration, because that is what we also believe is the right way to go. So I think that that should be sufficient.\"*\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n116.\n\nIn this section of its Decision, the Tribunal will deal with Claimant\u2019s Requests numbered (d), (e) and (f), since, in response to the respective questions raised by the Tribunal, they were discussed together and major agreement reached on most aspects. In this regard, reference is made to the discussion between the Tribunal and the Parties recorded in the Transcript of the London Hearing pp. 78, 98 - 100.\n\n117.\n\nFirst of all, regarding **Claimant\u2019s Request numbered (d),** this discussion records that the Parties and the Tribunal agree to the effect that the Parties indeed have an obligation to conduct the procedure in good faith.\n\n118.\n\nWhile this is now agreed and on the record of the hearing, the Tribunal considers it nevertheless necessary to formally record this duty of the Parties in the present Decision. In this context, the Tribunal sees a particular need to remind Respondent of this duty in view of certain measures taken by various of its authorities after this arbitral procedure has started which are identified by Claimant in its Amended Request of 29 April 2009. In particular, the Tribunal reiterates the \"surprise\" its Chairman expressed during the hearing (Tr p. 95) that, on 16 April 2009, the same day the Parties and the Tribunal had their 1st Session in Frankfurt to discuss and decide on the further procedure including the exchange and production of documents, the Respondent raided Claimant\u2019s offices and seized a great volume of documents and other evidence. This was done without any notice at the Frankfurt session. While the Tribunal appreciates the assurance of Respondent\u2019s Counsel that he did not know of these measures of Respondent at the time of the Session, this conduct and the further similar measures taken by Respondent after that date make it necessary in the view of the Tribunal to clearly put on record the basic procedural duties of the Parties to an international arbitration procedure and particularly an ICSID procedure. This is without prejudice to the sovereign right of states to apply and enforce their national law inside their territories. But in that context, the undisputed obligation of a state should also be recalled that under international law no state may rely on its national law as a justification to breach its duties under public international law and that a state is responsible under international law for the acts of all of its organs and institutions. The procedural duties stemming from the ICSID Convention and the reference thereto in the relevant BIT are such - procedural - obligations as part of international law.\n\n119.\n\nRegarding the Claimant\u2019s **requests numbered (e) and (f),** the Tribunal agrees with the essence and result of the discussion at the hearing referred to above to the effect that the accepted duty of a party in an arbitration to act in good faith includes and covers a duty to avoid any unnecessary aggravation of the dispute and harassment of the other party. And again, in view of the measures taken by Respondent and for the reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal considers it necessary to formally record this in this Decision.\n\n120.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, the Tribunal confirms that the Parties have an obligation to conduct the procedure in good faith and that this obligation includes a duty to avoid any unnecessary aggravation of the dispute and harassment of the other party.\n\n**H.VII. Request (f) to order Respondent to refrain from taking any other measures in relation to Claimant that would aggravate the present dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n121.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (f)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(f) that Kazakhstan refrain from taking any other measures in relation to CIOC that would aggravate the present dispute;\"*\n\n122.\n\nClaimant cites the following authority for this request (C-III, para. 58):\n\n*\"58. Authority exists also for the provisional measure requested in (f), above. The Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine Tribunal held that in ICSID proceedings parties \"must refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID\"* [FN: Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine, Procedural Order No. 1, 1 July 2003, para. 1 (**Authority C-8**)]. *It added that: \"The Ukrainian authorities - whether judicial or other - are, therefore, under the legal obligation to abstain from, and to suspend and discontinue, any proceedings before any domestic body, whether judicial or other, which might in any way jeopardize the principle of the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute before it\"* [FN: ibid., para. 3.]\n\n*59. The Tribunal therefore recommended that:*\n\n*'Pending the resolution of the dispute now before the Tribunal, both parties shall refrain from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic proceedings, judicial or other, concerning Tokios Tokel\u00e9s or its investment in Ukraine, [...] which might prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award of this Tribunal or aggravate the existing dispute'* [FN: ibid., para. 7.].\n\n*60. To anticipate a question that might be in the minds of the members of the Tribunal, the provisional measures requested do not seek to prejudge the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the merits or to achieve an outcome at odds with the parties\u2019 expectations. On either party\u2019s case, the result is that CIOC cannot continue in occupation of the Contract Area. If CIOC is successful in its claim that Kazakhstan has expropriated its investment, implicit in such a finding is that title to the investment has passed and the appropriate remedy is compensation. In the event of other violations of the Treaty, including a finding that the expropriation is unlawful, CIOC acknowledges that restitution is not practicable and the appropriate remedy is damages. On Kazakhstan\u2019s case, it may be successful if it can show that the Contract was validly terminated and for good cause, in which case CIOC would be obliged to relinquish the field.\"*\n\n123.\n\nIn the Hearing on 30 June 2009 Claimant presented further arguments in this respect (Tr., pp. 23, 30, 103-104).\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n124.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position on this and the related requests for provisional measures is contained in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures (R-II, paras. 7-32) and is quoted under H.IV.2.\n\n125.\n\nFurther reference is made to Respondent\u2019s statement in the Hearing of 30 June 2009 as to the aggravation of the dispute (Tr. P. 62 to 67).\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n126.\n\nIn this context, reference is made to the discussion between the Partuies and the Tribunal during the Hearing on 30 June 2009 (Tr., pp. 100-102).\n\n127.\n\nRegarding this Request numbered (f), this Tribunal agrees with the Tribunal in *Burlington*, which, in its Procedural Order No.1 (submitted by Claimant), considered the right to the preservation of the status quo and the nonaggravation of the dispute as \"well established since the case of the *Electricity Company of Sofia* and *Bulgaria* (\u00a7 62 of the Order).\n\n128.\n\nHowever, the present Tribunal does not have to enter into a more detailed discussion of the matter in view of its considerations and conclusions in the preceding chapter of this Decision which also dealt with this Request.\n\n**H.VIII. Request (g) to order Respondent\u2019s authorities not to act upon any existing criminal complaints against Claimant or file any new complaints arising out of Claimant\u2019s continued occupation of the field and activities after February 1, 2008**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant**\n---------------\n\n129.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request reads as follows (C-III, para. 53 (g)):\n\n*\"53. CIOC respectfully requests the Tribunal to recommend the following provisional measures:*\n\n*(g) that for the duration of these arbitration proceedings, the Kazakh authorities do not act upon any existing criminal complaints against CIOC or file any new complaints arising out of CIOC\u2019s continued occupation of the field and activities after 1 February 2008.\"*\n\n130.\n\nIn its Amended Request for Arbitration Claimant pleads as follows (C-III, para. 55-59):\n\n*55. More specifically, there is support in ICSID arbitral practice for the recommendations requested. There is an established principle:*\n\n*\"...according to which both parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult\".[FN: Amco Asia v. Indonesia, Decision on Provisional Measures, 9 December 1983, para. 5 (**Authority C-5**); also e.g. Azurix v. Argentina, Decision on Provisional Measures, 6 August 2003, paras. 38, 46-7 (unpublished) summarised in Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, para. 14 (**Authority C-6**)]*\n\n*56. Applying this principle, the Tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina invited the parties \"to abstain from adopting measures of any character that could aggravate or extend the controversy submitted to this arbitration\". In Pey Casado v. Chile, the Tribunal invited the parties to \"prevent any act, of whatever nature, which could aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal\". [FN: Pey Casado v. Chile, Decision on Provisional Measures, 25 September 2001, dispositif, (4) (**Authority C-7**).]*\n\n*57. CIOC requests the requested measures, including in particular in relation to (e) above, as a matter of urgency. These measures are also necessary to ensure CIOC\u2019s ability to furnish evidence of its claim. Necessity and urgency are recognised in ICSID practice as being present where a respondent fails to take steps to preserve or to provide documentation relevant to the claimant\u2019s case, or in circumstances where there is a risk of loss or destruction of such documentation. [FN: Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, para. 86 (**Authority C-4**).]*\n\n*58. Authority exists also for the provisional measure requested in (f), above. The Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine Tribunal held that in ICSID proceedings parties \"must refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID\".(FN: Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine, Procedural Order No. 1, 1 July 2003, para. 1 (**Authority C-8**)] It added that:*\n\n*\"The Ukrainian authorities - whether judicial or other - are, therefore, under the legal obligation to abstain from, and to suspend and discontinue, any proceedings before any domestic body, whether judicial or other, which might in any way jeopardize the principle of the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute before it\".*\n\n*59. The Tribunal therefore recommended that:*\n\n*\"Pending the resolution of the dispute now before the Tribunal, both parties shall refrain from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic proceedings, judicial or other, concerning Tokios Tokel\u00e9s or its investment in Ukraine, [\u2026] which might prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award of this Tribunal or aggravate the existing dispute\".*\n\n131.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing on 30 June 2009, additional arguments were brought forward by Claimant (Tr., pp. 23-24, 34-38, 104-105, 110-111).\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n132.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position on this and the remaining requests for provisional measures is contained in its Response to Claimant\u2019s Amended Request for Provisional Measures (R-II, paras. 7-32): See above, H.IV.2.\n\n133.\n\nRespondent presented further arguments in the Hearing on 30 June 2009 (Tr., pp. 58-62, 67, 118).\n\n**3. Tribunal**\n---------------\n\n134.\n\nAt the outset of its examination of this Request numbered (g), the Tribunal points out that, while some of its considerations regarding the Requests numbered (d), (e) and (f) also apply here, criminal investigations and measures taken by a state in that context require special considerations.\n\n135.\n\nThey are a most obvious and undisputed part of the sovereign right of a state to implement and enforce its national law on its territory.\n\n136.\n\nOn the other hand, the language authorizing ICSID Tribunals in Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39 is very broad and does not give any indication that any specific state action must be excluded from the scope of possible provisional measures. Therefore, this Tribunal does not agree with the strict approach which seems to have been taken by the Tribunal in the SGS decision (page 301) quoted by Respondent. Rather this broad language can be interpreted to the effect that, in principle, criminal investigations may not be totally excluded from the scope of provisional measures in ICSID proceedings. The present Tribunal, in this regard, agrees with the approach taken by the ICSID Tribunal in the Tokios case in its Orders 1 and 3 to which both Parties in the present case have referred.\n\n137.\n\nBut, similarly to the considerations of the Tokios Tribunal in \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 13 of its Order No.3, this Tribunal feels that a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.\n\n138.\n\nThis threshold and the respective burden of proof cannot be overcome by Claimant\u2019s Request (f) in the present case in order for this Tribunal to issue provisional measures.\n\n139.\n\nFirst of all, applying Rule 39(1), the Tribunal does not find that the right to be preserved is threatened. Claimant has not shown that its procedural right to continue with this ICSID arbitration is precluded by the criminal investigation, if one takes into account the conclusions reached above regarding the other Requests. Regarding Claimant\u2019s substantive rights involved, it may well be that further damage is caused by the criminal proceedings, if Claimant can show that they were an abuse of the sovereign right of the State in breach of the BIT. However, such damage may be claimed, examined and decided later in this case in the procedure on the merits. Since, in the present case, Claimant is not claiming specific performance, but money damages, this Tribunal does not have to deal with the question whether other considerations have to be applied in specific performance claims as in the *Burlington* case (see Procedural Order No.1 \u00a7 69). In the present case, regarding Claimant\u2019s damage claim, no provisional measure is required to protect that right, and indeed the Tribunal might be prejudging that issue if it would recommend provisional measures trying to stop the criminal proceedings. For the same reason, there is no urgency requiring provisional measures in this regard.\n\n140.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that no provisional measures are appropriate regarding the criminal proceedings.\n\n141.\n\nHowever, to avoid any misunderstanding, the Tribunal points out that this is without prejudice to the question whether, in the proceedings on the merits, Claimant can claim that Respondent\u2019s criminal investigation and the measures enforced in that context were an abuse of that sovereign right of the State in breach of the BIT and may lead to damages to which Claimant is entitled.\n\n**I. Decisions of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Regarding the individual Requests:**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nI.1.\n\n**Regarding Claimant\u2019s Request (a), the requested meeting has been held and therefore the Request is moot and thus there is no need any more for any recommendations in this regard.**\n\nI.2.\n\n**Regarding Claimant\u2019s Request (b), the Tribunal considers that presently there is no need to recommend provisional measures in this regard.**\n\nI.3.\n\n**Regarding Claimant\u2019s Requests (c), the Tribunal takes note of and confirms Respondent\u2019s undertaking that**\n\n\u2022 **all documents taken by Respondent shall be preserved by Respondent,**\n\n\u2022 **Respondent will grant to representatives of Claimant access to all documents to which Claimant requests access,**\n\n\u2022 **the Representatives of Claimant may copy any such documents,**\n\n\u2022 **the Representatives of Claimant may take such copies out of Kazakhstan to London.**\n\n**In this context, the Tribunal understands that the term \"documents\" includes files, computer disks and other material taken from Claimant\u2019s offices by representatives of Respondent so that the undertakings by Respondent above also refer to these other materials.**\n\n**The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to issue any further recommendations for provisional measures in this regard.**\n\nI.4.\n\n**Regarding Claimant\u2019s Requests (d), (e) and (f), the Tribunal confirms that the Parties have an obligation to conduct the procedure in good faith and that this obligation includes a duty to avoid any unnecessary aggravation of the dispute and harassment of the other party.**\n\nI.5.\n\n**Regarding Claimant\u2019s Request (g), the Tribunal decides not to recommend any provisional measures concerning the criminal investigation conducted by Respondent, but points out that this is without prejudice to any claims for damages in this regard that the Claimant may raise in the procedure on the merits.**\n\n**B.

Short Identification of the Case**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nA short identification of the case is set out below. It is made without prejudice to the full presentation of the factual and legal details of the case by the Parties and the Tribunal's considerations and conclusions.\n\n**C.I. Claimant's Perspective**\n-------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe following quotation from Claimant's Memorial of 14 May 2009 summarises the main aspects of the dispute as follows (C-IV, paras. 7-12):\n\n*\"7. In this Memorial, CIOC sets out what is a substantial claim against Kazakhstan, currently estimated in the Quantum Report to be*  ***USD 1,121.4 million*** *, for damages and compensation (including interest) arising out of the* *expropriation of its investment, a significant oil field in an oil rich area of the country.* [Note by the Tribunal: the reference to the quantum of allegedly sustained damages in \u2018millions' was corrected by Claimant in later submissions to \u2018billions'.]\n\n*8. Not only had CIOC invested millions of dollars in the exploration of the oil field and its development, it was also entitled to an exclusive 25-year commercial production licence since it had a commercial discovery. These rights, of which CIOC has been deprived, underpin CIOC's claim for damages and compensation, but CIOC also claims non-material damages in respect of the moral harm that CIOC, its majority owner, senior management and employees have suffered at the hands of Kazakhstan.*\n\n*9. For five years CIOC had successfully, and without any serious controversy, pursued its investment. New oil wells were drilled and Soviet-era ones were reopened, extensive geological testing and exploration work was carried out, infrastructure was installed at the field and pilot production commenced. Suddenly in mid 2007, the political landscape changed. A political rivalry that had developed between President Nazarbayev and his powerful son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev flared into open hostility. In Kazakhstan's campaign to persecute Rakhat Aliyev that followed, it seems it became no longer politically convenient for Kazakhstan to allow CIOC to continue its business since the brother of Devincci Hourani, CIOC's majority owner, is Rakhat Aliyev's brother-in-law. A reasonable person might have thought that CIOC was* *sufficiently far removed from the dispute between the President and Rakhat Aliyev however, in Kazakhstan, \"politics is a family affair\"* [emphasis in original and footnote omitted] *. Family, business partners and associates of* *Rakhat Aliyev have all been victimised in the course of the fall out between the President and Mr Aliyev.*\n\n*10. As a result, CIOC, its majority owner, senior management and employees have been subjected to a campaign of harassment, intimidation and persecution at the hands of the Kazakh authorities. As at the date of this Memorial the victimisation continues. Armed guards remain at the site of CIOC's oilfield and its offices in Aktobe. Kazakh authorities have seized and still retain (amongst other items) large numbers of CIOC's documents and files, as well as corporate seals and computer hard drives from CIOC's head office in Almaty, its branch office in Aktobe and from the oil field itself. Devincci Hourani, his brothers and his senior manager Omar Antar feel unable to return to Kazakhstan. CIOC is not the only investment that Devincci Hourani has lost as a result of the abusive exercise of Kazakh sovereign power. He and his brothers have lost all their substantial business interests in Kazakhstan.*\n\n*11. Kazakh officials concocted unsubstantiated allegations that CIOC was in breach of its contractual obligations as a pretext for what was no more than a politically-motivated campaign against the company and its owner. CIOC's answers to these allegations went unheard and unanswered. In its haste to purport to terminate the Contract, Kazakhstan also failed to follow the stipulated legal procedures.*\n\n*12. The Tribunal is likely to read and hear a great deal about CIOC's performance of its obligations under the Contract during the course of this proceeding, but this case is not about CIOC's contractual performance, which in any event provided no reason for complaint let alone termination. In the normal course, a contractual counterpart does not substantiate its grounds for termination by seizing the other party's majority owner from his bed in the middle of the night and subject him to hours of questioning at its interior Ministry. In the normal course, the focus of such questioning would not be on the owner's family relationship with the President's sworn political enemy. In the normal course, it would also be highly unlikely that parties would mutually agree to extend a contract by a further two years, for one party later to allege that all along the other had been in material breach. But this is not a normal* *case, and the dispute at its heart is not at all about contractual termination.\"* (C-IV, paras. 7-12)\n\n**C.II. Respondent's Perspective**\n----------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nIn its Summary Reply to Claimant's Request for Arbitration Respondent states (R-I, para. 6):\n\n*\"[...] Respondent will show that all of the claims currently brought by Claimant relate to lawful actions the Republic took in an effort to obtain that to which it was rightfully entitled, namely Claimant's proper performance of the Contract. Despite Claimant's contention to the contrary, Respondent will demonstrate that the termination notices issued by the Republic were justified.\"*\n\n4.\n\nThe following quotations from Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and the Merits further summarise the main aspects of the dispute (R-III, paras. 2, 5, 18):\n\n*\"[...] The Contract was awarded to Consolidated Contractors (Oil and Gas) Company S.A.L. (\"CCC\") on May 27, 2002. CCC assigned it to CIOC for USD 9.4 million on August 8, 2002, less than three months later. CIOC had come into existence on July 29, 2002, a week before the assignment.\"* (R-III, para. 2)\n\n*\"[\u2026] [A]s will be explained and fully documented in that Section, CIOC never came close in any year to fulfilling its obligations as set out in the Contract, the contractual Minimum Work Program and the Annual Work Programs. In particular, CIOC never even began drilling the required exploratory wells in the deeper subsalt region. CIOC was notified by the Republic of its non-performance and was threatened with termination on numerous occasions beginning in 2003. [\u2026] These facts belie what CIOC alleges in its Memorial: namely, that CIOC was performing perfectly well and that the Termination was caused by political motivations arising in mid-2007 and not by CIOC's material breaches of the Contract. In fact, the Termination occurred as part of the Republic's ongoing review of the contractual performance of sub-soil users in Kazakhstan. During the relevant period between late 2007 and early 2008, eighty-seven contracts were terminated for material breach, including CIOC's. Moreover, the record clearly shows that CIOC's material breaches and the Republic's repeated notices regarding those breaches occurred beginning in 2003, long before the unrelated political events referred to by CIOC.\"* (R-III, para. 5)\n\n*\"From the beginning and continuously throughout the life of the Contract, CIOC systematically and significantly failed to meet its annual investment obligations. This is indeed one of the reasons that led to the Termination of CIOC's Contract. In addition, there is no evidence that CIOC itself or its apparent owner and purported investor, Devincci Hourani, had the ability to finance or mobilize the financing necessary to sustain the future development of the Caratube project that CIOC predicts in its damage claim.\"* (R-III, para. 18)\n\n**D. Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 June 2008 Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Kazakhstan with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment of 19 May 1992 (the \"BIT\"). The Centre registered the Request for Arbitration on 26 August 2008\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 4 November 2008 Claimant appointed Dr. Gavan Griffith QC as an arbitrator. By letter of 22 December 2008 Respondent appointed Dr. Kamal Hossain as an arbitrator. The Parties agreed to have the party-appointed arbitrators select the President of the Tribunal. The co-arbitrators were unable to reach such an agreement. On 18 February 2009, on the request of the Claimant and pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel as presiding arbitrator in the case at hand. All three arbitrators accepted their appointments.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 23 February 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Tribunal and the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to having been constituted and the proceedings to having begun on that date. Furthermore, the Acting Secretary-General advised that ICSID Counsel Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 25 February 2009 the Tribunal proposed to hold the First Session in Frankfurt, Germany on 16 April 2009, to which both Parties agreed.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 26 February 2009 the Tribunal asked Respondent to file a Summary Reply to Claimant's Request for Arbitration by 31 March 2009.\n\n10.\n\nOn 31 March 2009, Respondent submitted its Summary Reply to Claimant's Request for Arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 3 April 2009, the Parties submitted a joint advice on any points of the provisional agenda on which they were able to reach agreement.\n\n12.\n\nOn 14 April 2009, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n13.\n\nThe First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held at the Frankfurt International Arbitration Centre (FIAC) at the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, Germany on 16 April 2009.\n\n14.\n\nThe Minutes of the First Session contained the following sections which are relevant for the later procedure:\n\n***\"(...)***\n\n***6. Place of Proceeding (Convention Articles 62 and 63; Administrative and Financial Regulation 26; Arbitration Rule 13(3))***\n\n*The Parties agreed that the place of the proceeding shall be Frankfurt, Germany, although individual hearings may take place elsewhere if the Parties and the Tribunal so agree.*\n\n*(...)*\n\n***13. Written and Oral Procedures (Arbitration Rules 20(1)(e) and 29)***\n\n*13.1. The proceedings shall consist of a written procedure and an oral procedure.*\n\n*13.2. The length of time allocated to each Party during the oral procedure(s) shall in principle be equal, subject to the Tribunal's determination, based on all relevant factors, including the number of witnesses for each Party, that one Party should be afforded a greater share of the available time.*\n\n*13.3. The oral procedure(s) may include oral closing arguments if so decided by the Tribunal. The oral procedure(s) may be followed by written post-hearing submissions if so decided by the Tribunal, limited by page number and including specific issues as may be identified by the Tribunal, unless the Parties otherwise agree.*\n\n***14. Number and Sequence of Pleadings, Time Limits, Supporting*** ***Documentation (Arbitration Rules 20(1)(c) and 31)***\n\n*14.1. By 14 May 2009:*\n\n*Claimant's Principal Memorial on all aspects of the case including jurisdiction and the merits including quantum, together with witness statements, documents, and expert reports (if any). The Tribunal made reference to Exhibit 5 to the request for arbitration and invited the Claimant to comment in its Memorial on the assignment of the Contract.*\n\n*14.2. By 14 July 2009:*\n\n*The Respondent shall indicate whether or not it will request bifurcation of the proceeding.*\n\n*14.3. By 14 September, 2009:*\n\n*Respondent may submit a Brief with reasoned objections to jurisdiction and a request for bifurcation of the proceeding.*\n\n*14.3. [sic] If such a Brief is submitted, by 16 November 2009:*\n\n*The Claimant may submit a reasoned Reply-Brief.*\n\n*14.4. Thereafter, the Tribunal will take appropriate steps to deal with this matter in consultation with the Parties, and, if it decides to bifurcate the proceedings, decide on a new timetable.

By 19 February 2010:*\n\n*In so far as they have not reached agreement, the Parties may submit reasoned applications to Tribunal in the form of \"Redfern Schedules\", to order the production of documents.*\n\n*14.10.

After consultation with the Parties during the Hearing, the Tribunal may, if it considers that necessary, extend the Hearing from 21 to 22 February, 2011. The Parties and the members of the Tribunal will block all these days and book accommodation for the full period.*\n\n*14.20[\u2026] By dates set at the end of the Hearing after consultation with the Parties, Parties may submit Post-Hearing Briefs (no new documents allowed).*\n\n*(...)*\n\n***20. Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures***\n\n*The Tribunal noted that the Claimant submitted on 14 April, 2009 a request for provisional measures.*\n\n*The Respondent shall submit its response to the Claimant's request for provisional measures on 15 June 2009 (within two months from the first session). The Respondent noted that, if necessary, it may request an extension of this deadline.*\n\n*A hearing on provisional measures is provisionally fixed by 30 June 2009 in* *London, if considered necessary by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n*If the need arises, the Tribunal shall request from the parties additional information prior to issuing its decision on the Claimant's request.*\n\n***21. Assistant to the President of the Tribunal***\n\n*The Parties agreed to the possibility of the President of the Tribunal hiring an assistant of the Tribunal for logistical assistance on the file in this case. In due time, the Parties will be informed of the costs involved and invited to submit any comments they might have.*\n\n*(\u2026)\"*\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of 24 April 2009, Claimant notified the Tribunal about purported violations of the integrity of the arbitral process by Respondent, namely that the Republic of Kazakhstan's Committee of National Security (KNB) had raided several of Claimant's offices in Kazakhstan on 16 and 17 April 2009. With this letter, Claimant requested relief against these purported measures by seeking a letter from the Tribunal to the Parties recommending to refrain from taking steps which aggravate the dispute or violate the Parties' duties of good faith and equality pending the hearing on the Request for Provisional Measures; further by requesting the Tribunal to accelerate the schedule for dealing with the Request for Provisional Measures and by urging the Tribunal to issue any other relief as it sees fit.\n\n16.\n\nBy a letter of 4 May 2009, the Tribunal set the date for the Hearing on Provisional Measures for 30 June 2009 at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London, United Kingdom.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of 11 May 2009, ICSID notified the Parties that in accordance with the arrangements of the First Session the President of the Tribunal had appointed Mr Dmitry Marenkov as assistant. The Parties did not raise any objections to this appointment.\n\n18.\n\nOn 14 May 2009 Claimant filed its Memorial.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 19 May 2009, Claimant notified the Tribunal of the alleged house arrest of two of Claimant's overseas workers at Claimant's office in Aktobe by Kazakh authorities. Claimant urged Respondent to release the two employees and return their purportedly confiscated travel and identity documents to them.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of 2 June 2009, the Tribunal sent a draft Procedural Order No. 1 (PO-1) to the Parties regarding the details of the Hearing on Provisional Measures in London on 30 June 2009. The Parties were given the opportunity to comment on draft PO-1 by 17 June 2009\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 June 2009, Respondent submitted its Response to CIOC's Amended Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n22.\n\nOn 17 June 2009, the Parties affirmed that after reviewing draft PO-1 they had no comments thereon.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 June 2009 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 regarding the details of the hearing on provisional measures on 30 June 2009.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 22 June 2009, Claimant responded to a letter dated 10 June 2009 by Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) Mr K. Safinov addressed to CIOC, a copy of which was sent to the Tribunal by ICSID. Claimant regarded this letter as reply to its letter dated 9 December 2008 where Claimant purportedly expressed its willingness to cooperate with the Kazakhstan government regarding the orderly handover of the Contract Area without prejudice to Claimant's legal rights and defences. In view of the upcoming Hearing on Provisional Measures on 30 June 2009, Claimant proposed a meeting on 24, 25, or 26 June 2009.\n\n25.\n\nRespondent by letter of 24 June 2009 communicated that it was logistically not feasible to organise a handover meeting on the dates proposed by Claimant in its letter of 22 June 2009, however, Respondent confirmed its willingness to hold constructive meetings in the Contract Area.\n\n26.\n\nA hearing on Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures was held on 30 June 2009 in London, UK.\n\n27.\n\nOn 2 July 2009, ICSID forwarded to the Tribunal a letter from Claimant dated 1 July 2009 addressed to Respondent regarding the handover meeting of the Contract Area on 8 and 9 July 2009. The letter contained logistical details as well as a draft handover agreement.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 6 July 2009, counsel for Claimant notified the Tribunal of further alleged measures of harassment of CIOC and its Director in the offices of Hourani family companies in Kazakhstan. Claimant requested the Tribunal to take these purported actions into account when considering Claimant's Amended Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n29.\n\nAlso on 6 July 2009, ICSID forwarded a letter from Respondent dated 3 July 2009 to Claimant regarding the handover of the Contract Area. On the same day, ICSID forwarded to the Tribunal a reply letter from Claimant addressed to Respondent dated 6 July 2009. In it, Claimant addressed *inter alia* terms and conditions for the handover meeting of the Contract Area and expressed its discontent with the representations made by opposing counsel in its letter of 3 July 2009.\n\n30.\n\nIn its letter to the Tribunal of 9 July 2009, **Respondent notified ICSID that it would not request a bifurcation of the proceedings**, but would reserve its right to submit objections to jurisdiction in its Counter-Memorial on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1). This declaration by Respondent was later amended in footnote 7 to the Counter-Memorial (p. 11):\n\n*\"The Republic did not request the bifurcation of these proceedings, since it concluded that the Tribunal needed factual information in order to assess these objections* [to jurisdiction] *and such information was best presented with the merits of the case. This however does not mean that the Republic considers these objections to be less serious, and*  ***the Republic therefore asks the Tribunal to uphold the objections and to refrain from considering the merits of the case*** *.\"* (emphasis added)\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its **Decision Regarding Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures** on 31 July 2009. After a detailed reasoning, the decisions were as follows:\n\n\" ***I. Decisions of the Tribunal***\n\n***A. Regarding the individual Requests:***\n\n*I.1. Regarding Claimant's Request (a), the requested meeting has been held and therefore the Request is moot and thus there is no need any more for any recommendations in this regard.*\n\n*I.2. Regarding Claimant's Request (b), the Tribunal considers that presently there is no need to recommend provisional measures in this regard.*\n\n*I.3. Regarding Claimant's Requests (c), the Tribunal takes note of and confirms Respondent's undertaking that*\n\n*\u2022 all documents taken by Respondent shall be preserved by Respondent,*\n\n*\u2022 Respondent will grant to representatives of Claimant access to all documents to which Claimant requests access,*\n\n*\u2022 the Representatives of Claimant may copy any such documents,*\n\n*\u2022 the Representatives of Claimant may take such copies out of Kazakhstan to London.*\n\n*In this context, the Tribunal understands that the term \"documents\" includes files, computer disks and other material taken from Claimant's offices by representatives of Respondent so that the undertakings by Respondent above also refer to these other materials.*\n\n*The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to issue any further recommendations for provisional measures in this regard.*\n\n*I.4. Regarding Claimant's Requests (d), (e) and (f), the Tribunal confirms that the Parties have an obligation to conduct the procedure in good faith and that this obligation includes a duty to avoid any unnecessary aggravation of the dispute and harassment of the other party.*\n\n*I.5. Regarding Claimant's Request (g), the Tribunal decides not to recommend any provisional measures concerning the criminal investigation conducted by Respondent, but points out that this is without prejudice to any claims for damages in this regard that the Claimant may raise in the procedure on the merits.*\n\n***B. Concluding Decision:***\n\n*I.6. Without prejudice to the rights of the Parties under the ICSID Convention to make renewed applications for provisional measures, for the reasons stated the Tribunal declines Claimant's requests for provisional measures.\"*\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 19 August 2009 to counsel for Respondent, Claimant addressed issues regarding the handover of the Contract Area as well as the alleged continuing harassment of its employees by Respondent's officials and agents. Also attached was a draft Handover Agreement for the Caratube oil field.\n\n33.\n\nOn 3 September 2009, ICSID forwarded a letter from counsel for Respondent of 2 September 2009 addressed to counsel for Claimant regarding the draft Handover Agreement and geological documents concerning the Contract Area. Also attached were a copy of the Minutes of the meeting of 8 and 9 July 2009 and a letter from the MEMR to CIOC of 2 September 2009 regarding the transmission of the above-mentioned geological documents.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of 16 October 2009, ICSID forwarded a letter to the Tribunal directed from counsel for Claimant to counsel for Respondent regarding the proposal for the Handover Agreement and related issues thereto.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 30 November 2009, Respondent replied to Claimant's letter from 16 October 2009 referring to the Handover Agreement and related matters thereto.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and the Merits on 22 December 2009.\n\n37.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, ICSID notified the Tribunal and the Parties that Mr Marat Umerov has been appointed Secretary of the Tribunal to replace Mr Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds.\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of 12 February 2010, the Parties requested two amendments to the timetable for the production of documents on which they had reached agreement beforehand. The Tribunal by letter of 13 February 2010 notified the Parties that it did not object to the proposed extensions.\n\n39.\n\nBy letters of 26 February 2010, the Parties each submitted a document production request as specified in accompanying Redfern Schedules.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of 1 March 2010, ICSID on behalf of the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit within one week from the date of the letter, any comments they might have on the other Party's submission of 26 February 2010 and within one further week, any comments in reply to the other Party's comments submitted the week before.\n\n41.\n\nOn 4 March 2010, Respondent referring to its letter of 30 November 2009 to Claimant, requested Claimant to advise as to Claimant's intentions regarding the handover of the Contract Area.\n\n42.\n\nBy letters of 8 March 2010, the Parties submitted their comments on the other Party's submission of 26 February 2010. Further, the respective Parties replied to these comments regarding the other Party's submission of 8 March 2010 in letters of 15 March 2010.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 20 April 2010, Respondent reiterated its request to Claimant concerning the orderly handover of the Contract Area and asked for a response within two weeks.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of 21 April 2010, ICSID notified the Tribunal that Ms Milanka Kostadinova had been appointed Secretary of the Tribunal to replace Mr Marat Umerov.\n\n45.\n\nBy letter of 29 April 2010, Claimant notified the Tribunal of a change in counsel. Claimant also informed the Tribunal of a petition it filed under U.S. Code, Title 28, Part V, Chapter 117, \u00a7 1782 (Section 1782) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to compel the production of documents and requested an extension of six months to the procedural schedule.\n\n46.\n\nOn 3 May 2010, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2 (PO-2)** concerning its decision on the Parties' document production requests. The Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit written observations on Claimant's Applications of 29 April 2010 by 10 May 2010. Claimant was granted the right to file a reply thereto by 17 May 2010 to which Respondent could file further comments by 24 May 2010.\n\n47.\n\nIn view of its later relevance for decisions taken in this Award, sections 1.5., 2.1, and 4 of PO-2 are hereafter quoted:\n\n\" ***1. Introduction***\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*1.5. Finally the Tribunal notes that, insofar as a Party has the*  ***burden of proof*** *, it is sufficient for the other Party to deny what the respective Party has alleged and then respond to and rebut the evidence provided by that respective Party to comply with its burden of proof.*\n\n***2. Documents to be produced***\n\n*2.1 Having considered the related arguments by the Parties regarding the outstanding Requests of Claimant, the Tribunal invites the Parties to produce the documents and information so identified in the right hand column of the Redfern Schedules attached to this PO and also to conduct the investigations specified in the right hand column of the*  ***annexed Redfern Schedules***  *and produce such documents if the investigations confirm that these documents are in Respondent's possession.*\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n***4. Adverse Inference***\n\n*Insofar as documents ordered are not produced or not produced as ruled in this Order, the Tribunal may take this into account in its evaluation of the respective factual allegations and evidence including an inference against the Party refusing production.\"*\n\n48.\n\nPO-2 was accompanied by two annexes containing both Claimant's and Respondent's Redfern Schedules with respective Decisions by the Tribunal. Some of the decisions dealt with documents allegedly seized by Respondent as follows:\n\n*\"In so far as the documents were seized, they are to be produced if Respondent has the documents with TU Zapkaznedra. Otherwise, Respondent has to admit access to Claimant according to section I.A.I.3. of the Tribunal's Decision of 31 July 2009.\"*\n\n49.\n\nOn 10 May 2010, Respondent provided their observations on Claimant's Applications of 29 April 2010, requesting the Tribunal to order Claimant to cease and desist from its action in the U.S. District Court and to reject Claimant's request for an extension of time.\n\n50.\n\nOn 17 May 2010, Claimant submitted their reply to Respondent's letter of 10 May 2010. In its letter, Claimant requested the Tribunal to confirm that no supportive order from the Tribunal was needed for Claimant's petition under Section 1782 and that the petition was not inconsistent with the rules guiding and governing the Tribunal. Claimant also reiterated its request to obtain a six-month extension.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter of 19 May 2010, Respondent commented on PO-2 requesting the Tribunal to decide that translations of documents need not be produced by the providing party.\n\n52.\n\nClaimant disagreed with Respondent's request of 19 May 2010 by letter dated 21 May 2010, requesting the Tribunal that the paragraph at issue remain unchanged.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3 (PO-3)** on 26 May 2010 of which sections still relevant at this stage are quoted hereafter:\n\n*\"(\u2026)*\n\n***2. Claimant's Request for a Minimum 6-Month Extension and Respondent's Requests regarding the Section 1782 Petition***\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*2.5. First, change of counsel, in the view of the Tribunal, is a procedural choice of a party which in itself cannot form a basis for a substantial change in the agreed timetable. This particularly is the case where the application for a long extension is made late in the procedure, in this case four months after the last Memorial by Respondent and more than two months before the Claimant's Reply Memorial is due.*\n\n*2.6. Second, whilst the Tribunal might have been minded to find that its prior consent should have been sought by Claimant before the presentation of its Section 1782 petition, the Tribunal concludes that it is not necessary for it to order Claimant to cease and desist from the US action. A party starting a Section 1782 procedure before the US courts does so and chooses the time for such a petition at its own risk.* *But the existence of such a petition to domestic courts cannot interfere with the Tribunal's maintenance of its authority over the arbitral procedure and with the timetable established with the consent of the Parties.*\n\n*2.7. Regarding the additional request submitted by Respondent in its letter of 24 May 2010, the Tribunal considers that this is a matter for a later decision. Reference is made to section 2.3. of PO-2. Should Claimant, at a later stage of this arbitral procedure apply to admit any document produced in the Section 1782 procedure, this Tribunal will have to decide on such an application having regard to its obligation to accord procedural fairness to the Parties and particularly to Respondent's right to object and to reply to such a document.*\n\n***3. Respondent's Request to change section 5.1. of Procedural Order No. 2 regarding the translation of documents***\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*3.3. For the reasons mentioned in section 5.1 of PO-2, and as this provision equally applies to the production of documents by both parties, the Tribunal concludes that section 5.1 should be maintained.\"*\n\n54.\n\nBy letter of 28 May 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it is intervening in the petition under Section 1782 brought by Claimant in the U.S. District Court.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter of 12 July 2010 to the Parties, the Tribunal granted Claimant an extension to 30 July 2010 and Respondent a period of four months plus the extension used by Claimant. The Tribunal reminded the Parties that the date for submission of the lists of witnesses and experts of 17 December 2010 would be maintained.\n\n56.\n\nClaimant submitted its Reply Memorial on 30 July 2010.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter of 12 August 2010, Claimant withdrew the witness statement of Mr Harvey Jackson due to a recent request by his employer.\n\n58.\n\nBy letter of 13 August 2010, Respondent advised the Tribunal that the court had rejected Claimant's petition under Section 1782 in a decision of 11 August 2010. Claimant's petition to reconsider was rejected on 22 September 2010.\n\n59.\n\nBy letter of 13 September 2010, Claimant requested the Tribunal to issue an order immunising Claimant's participants, witnesses, and experts from legal process. Claimant further asked the Tribunal to condemn asserted breaches by Respondent of Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n60.\n\nBy letter of 22 September 2010, Respondent filed its observations regarding Claimant's Request for Immunity from Legal Process requesting the Tribunal to reject Claimant's request. The Parties exchanged further correspondence on the issue.\n\n61.\n\nIn its letter of 1 October 2010, Respondent objected to Claimant's request for witness immunity.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 4 (PO-4)** regarding Claimant's Request for an Order on Immunity on 19 October 2010, sections of which are still relevant and are quoted hereafter:\n\n*\"(...)*\n\n*4. Regarding the alleged risks of Claimant's witness Dr. Rakhat Shoraz, born Aliyev, the Tribunal considers the following:*\n\n*4.1. The article in the newspaper FALTER only reports on suspicions and allegations without confirming or proving their validity.*\n\n*4.2. The \"Memorandum\" of the Austrian Federal Interior Ministry first reports on a letter received from Mr. Aliyev's attorneys KWR without confirming the authenticity or the correctness of the contents of the letter. However, the memorandum goes on to state:*\n\n*\"Regarding the facts at issue - after an exhaustive analysis of the letter - the order was given to inform Attorney Prof. Dr. Brandstetter of the current, actually existing danger situation regarding Dr. Soraz.\"*\n\n*From this wording, it is not clear which information was given by whom to Prof. Brandstetter. But the wording does indicate that the Austrian authority accepted that there was indeed some information regarding a current, actually existing danger situation regarding Dr. Soraz. Finally, the Memorandum records a statement of Prof. Brandstetter, the attorney of Mr. Aliyev, but does not confirm the contents of the statement.*\n\n*5. While the Tribunal considers that the two documents of evidence submitted by* *Claimant in this context are not sufficient proof of the alleged threatening activity of Respondent, under the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to state the following.*\n\n*5.1. The immunity granted by Art. 21 and 22 is applicable without a specific order of an ICSID Tribunal. This Tribunal confirms that the immunity granted by Art. 21 and 22 is also applicable to the persons participating in the present ICSID proceedings and particularly that Art. 22 is also applicable to Mr. Aliyev in his capacity as a witness in these proceedings. The tribunal notes with pleasure that Respondent, in its most recent letter of 15 October 2010, expressly states that it welcomes and has no objection to Mr. Aliyev appearing as a witness in the forthcoming hearing.*\n\n*5.2. Beyond these provisions of Art. 21 and 22, the Tribunal agrees with the Tribunal in the Libananco Case (http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/Libanco-Decision.pdf) that every ICSID tribunal has an inherent power required to preserve the integrity of its own process and assure that the parties can advance their respective cases freely without interference, and as well that the parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, and that this duty also applies to States as parties to ICSID proceedings, even if in the exercise of their sovereign powers and including criminal proceedings, though the State's right to exercise such sovereign powers and criminal jurisdiction is not questioned.*\n\n*5.3. This obligation includes the duty of parties not to intimidate, harass, retaliate against, or physically harm parties, witnesses and other participants in ICSID proceedings or prevent them from fulfilling their functions.*\n\n*5.4. For the present case, this is recalled in view of concern expressed by the Austrian authorities in the Memorandum and also in view of the criminal proceedings of the Respondent against participants in the present case as parties or witnesses from Claimant's side, and particularly in view of the measures taken in Kazakhstan on the same date as the 1st Session of the present proceeding on 16 April 2009 during which many documents were taken from the Claimant's offices. In this regard, reference is made to the respective rulings in the Tribunal's Decision of 31 July 2009 regarding provisional measures and in Procedural Order No.2 regarding document production.*\n\n*6. In so far as Claimant's Requests go beyond the Tribunal's Statements in section 4 above, they are dismissed.\"*\n\n63.\n\nBy letter of 2 December 2010, the Tribunal urged the Parties to adhere to the time limits for their respective filings due before the Christmas holidays and reminded them to send these particular submissions not only to ICSID but also directly to the Members of the Tribunal as well as to the new Assistant of the Tribunal Ms Yun-I Kim.\n\n64.\n\nBy a letter of 13 December 2010, Claimant informed about asserted inacceptable conduct of Respondent which was purported to run counter to the arbitral process.\n\n65.\n\nRespondent filed its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction and the Merits dated 14 December 2010, accompanied by witness statements, expert reports, and exhibits. Due to technical difficulties there was a delay of seven days in transmission of the documents to the Tribunal and to Claimant.\n\n66.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimant's Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent.\n\n67.\n\nBy email of 17 December 2010, Claimant requested an extension for the filing of the notifications of the witnesses and experts each party wished to examine at the hearing due to the tardy submission of Respondent's Rejoinder. Respondent commented on Claimant's request also on 17 December 2010, noting that Claimant's request was disproportionate.\n\n68.\n\nBy email of 18 December 2010, the President on behalf of the Tribunal granted an extension. The Parties were thus given time until 22 December 2010 to submit their notifications of the witnesses and experts from each side respectively who they wished to examine at the hearing. The Tribunal further reminded the Parties that they should send any comments they might have regarding draft Procedural Order No. 5 by 22 December 2010 also. Furthermore, Respondent was invited to submit a reply to Claimant's Application of 13 December 2010.\n\n69.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, ICSID transmitted hard copies of Respondent's Rejoinder and Respondent's Response to CIOC's Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent to the Tribunal.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter of 22 December 2010, the Parties submitted their respective lists of witnesses and experts whom they wished to examine at the hearing in Paris. By letter of that same date, Respondent submitted its comments on draft PO-5. In a further letter of that day, Respondent provided comments to Claimant's request of 13 December 2010.\n\n71.\n\nBy letter of 23 December 2010, Claimant provided its response to Respondent's letter of 22 December 2010 regarding Claimant's request of 13 December 2010.\n\n72.\n\nBy email of 29 December 2010, **Procedural Order No. 5** and **Procedural Order No. 6** were issued to the Parties. As the preparation of the hearing was highly disputed between the Parties, relevant sections are quoted hereafter:\n\n***\"Procedural Order (PO) No. 5 Regarding further details of the Hearing in Paris***\n\n*In order to allow the Parties an early and efficient preparation of the hearing in Paris scheduled to start on 7 February 2011 and without prejudice to the option for a prehearing conference provided in section 14.16. of the Minutes of the 1st Session, a draft of this PO has been communicated to the Parties who were invited to submit any comments they may have by 22 December 2010.*\n\n*Now, taking into account:*\n\n*\u2022 the comments on the draft received from the Parties,*\n\n*\u2022 the Respondent's Rejoinder,*\n\n*\u2022 the Parties witness notifications[,]*\n\n*\u2022 the further submissions received from the Parties,*\n\n*the Tribunal decides that in view of the extensive written submissions received from the Parties, a telephone conference is not necessary, and hereby issues the PO in its final form.*\n\n*1. Introduction*\n\n*1.1. This Order recalls the*  ***earlier agreements and rulings***  *of the Tribunal and particularly takes into account the recent submissions and letters of the Parties.*\n\n*1.2. In particular, sections 8 and 15 of the Minutes of the 1st Session are recalled and hereby confirmed. The Parties are invited to assure that these provisions are complied with.*\n\n*1.3. By 17 January 2011, the Parties:*\n\n*\u2022 may submit further documents, but only in rebuttal of the recent submissions by the other Party; thereafter, no further documents may be submitted before or at the hearing unless expressly authorized by the Tribunal;*\n\n*\u2022 shall submit notifications of the persons who will be attending the hearing on their respective sides;*\n\n*\u2022 may submit a notification if they do not intend to examine any of the witnesses so far notified. If a Party does not call a witness for crossexamination at the hearing, this will not be considered as an acceptance of that witness' testimony;*\n\n*\u2022 shall notify which of its witnesses and experts, if any, require interpretation from and to English;*\n\n*\u2022 may submit a notification on any agreement they have reached regarding the order for the examination of witnesses and experts during the hearing;*\n\n*\u2022 shall submit either agreed or separate lists suggesting which experts should be examined together by Expert Conferencing;*\n\n*\u2022 shall submit either agreed or separate short lists of issues which they suggest for each group of experts to be raised by Expert Conferencing, taking into account that no repetition of the contents of the written expert reports is necessary and that the Conferencing should focus on the clarification of major issues on which the experts disagree.*\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*2.2. As agreed, ten working days are blocked from 7 to 18 February 2011, and the hearing may be extended to include 21 and 22 February 2011, if considered necessary by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.*\n\n*2.3. To give sufficient time to the Parties and the Arbitrators to prepare for and evaluate each part of the Hearings, the daily sessions shall not go beyond the period between 9:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. However, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, may change the timing during the course of the Hearings.*\n\n*3. Conduct of the Hearing*\n\n*3.1. In addition to the provisions of*  ***the Minutes of the 1st Session*** *, the following shall apply:*\n\n*3.2. The following*  ***Agenda*** *is established for the Hearing:*\n\n*1. Introduction by the Chairman of the Tribunal.*\n\n*2. Opening Statements of not more than 1.5 hours each for the*\n\n*a) Claimant,*\n\n*b) Respondent.*\n\n*3. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties: Examination of Claimant's fact witnesses. For each:*\n\n*a) Affirmation of witness to tell the truth.*\n\n*b) Short introduction by Claimant (This may be up to 10 minutes and may be longer to include a short direct examination on new developments after the last written statement of the witness or expert.).*\n\n*c) Cross-examination by Respondent.*\n\n*d) Re-direct examination by Claimant, but only on issues raised in cross-examination.*\n\n*e) Re-cross examination by Respondent but only on issues raised in re-direct examination.*\n\n*f) Remaining questions by members of the Tribunal, but they may raise questions at any time.*\n\n*4. Examination of Respondent's fact witnesses. For each:*\n\n*vice versa as under 3.a) to f) above.*\n\n*5. Examination of Claimant's and Respondent's industry experts, if any, by the method of Expert Conferencing. For each: as under 3.a) to f) above. The Tribunal intends to start the Conferencing by questions of its own taking into account the above lists of issues received from the Parties, and thereafter, the Parties may raise further questions.*\n\n*6. Examination of Claimant's and Respondent's experts on quantum, if any, by the method of Expert Conferencing. For each: as under 3.a) to f) above. The Tribunal intends to start the Conferencing by questions of its own taking into account the above lists of issues received from the Parties, and thereafter, the Parties may raise further questions.*\n\n*7. Any witness or expert may only be recalled for rebuttal examination by a Party or the members of the Tribunal, if such intention is announced in time to assure the availability of the witness or expert during the time of the Hearing.*\n\n*8. At an appropriate time during the hearing, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal will decide, how much time of a break shall be allotted to the Parties for preparation of their Closing Statements.*\n\n*9. Closing arguments of up to 2 hours each for the*\n\n*a) Claimant,*\n\n*b) Respondent.*\n\n*10. Remaining questions by the members of the Tribunal, if any.*\n\n*11. Discussion regarding the timing and details of post-hearing submissions and other procedural issues.*\n\n*(...)*\n\n*3.6. No documents may be presented at the Hearing, unless authorized by the Tribunal. According to section 15.1. second paragraph of the Minutes of the 1st Session, this also applies to documents impeaching the credibility of a witness or expert. But demonstrative exhibits may be shown using documents submitted earlier in accordance with the Timetable.*\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*4.3. The Tribunal may change any of the rulings in this order Order[sic], after consultation with the Parties, if considered appropriate under the circumstances.\"*\n\n73.\n\nAttached to PO-5 was a timetable with a calculation of hearing time.\n\n74.\n\nFor the same reasons, hereafter PO-6 is quoted which was as well issued on 29 December 2010:\n\n\" ***Procedural Order (PO) No. 6 regarding outstanding applications by Claimant***\n\n*A.*  ***Claimant's Request to Examine Witnesses under the Control of Respondent***\n\n*1. The Tribunal has taken note of the Claimant's Request dated 10 November 2010, of Respondent's undated Response received on 22 December 2010, and of the Parties' further submissions with further references to issues in that context. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to repeat or summarize the factual and legal arguments submitted by the Parties which it has carefully evaluated and taken into account in coming to the following conclusions.*\n\n*2. Regarding the Tribunal's authority to order the presence of persons for examination at the hearing, the Parties agree, and the Tribunal also agrees, that Art. 43 ICSID Convention provides for such an authority and that Art. 4.11 of the IBA Rules of Evidence (1999) provides guidance in this context.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal recalls the agreement recorded in section 15.2 of the Minutes of the 1st Meeting.*\n\n*4. In that context, the Tribunal clarifies that if a witness or expert whose statement has been submitted by a Party and whose examination at the Hearing has been requested by the other Party does not appear at the Hearing, his or her statement will not be taken into account by the Tribunal. A Party may apply with reasons for an exception from that rule and in such a case the Tribunal may take the arguments of both Parties into account in its decision regarding the evaluation of the evidence provided by such testimony including the option to draw inferences from the non-appearance.*\n\n*5. If the presence is requested by a Party of persons who have not submitted written statements, but on whose statements, letters or behaviour the Parties have relied in their submissions, guided by Art. 4.11 IBA Rules of Evidence, the Tribunal invites both Parties to use their best efforts to provide their appearance at the hearing. If such a person does not appear, the Tribunal will take into account the relevancy and materiality, if any, that could have been expected from an oral examination of that person in view of the existing submissions of the Parties, the reasons put forward for the non-appearance, as well as the respective arguments of both Parties, in its decision regarding the evaluation of the evidence of the case including the option to draw inferences from the non-appearance of such persons.*\n\n*6. Particularly regarding any persons referred to by the Parties in connection with the allegedly forged documents, the Tribunal would consider it helpful if these persons could be available for oral examination at the hearing. In so far as they do not attend, the Tribunal will apply the approach described above in section 5.*\n\n*7. The Parties are invited to submit by 17 January 2011 a list of the persons whose presence they will provide for at the hearing in view of the above rulings.*\n\n*B.*  ***Claimant's Request dated 13 December 2010 for an Additional Order***\n\n*1. The Tribunal has taken note of Claimant's Request of 13 December* *2010, of Respondent's Reply letter of 22 December 2010, as well as of the other submissions by the Parties relevant in this context. Again, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to repeat or summarize the factual and legal arguments submitted by the Parties which it has carefully evaluated and taken into account in coming to the following conclusions.*\n\n*2. The Tribunal recalls its Procedural Order No.4.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal considers that its following adapted rulings from section* *5 of PO No. 4 shall also apply to all persons referred to above in section A of the present PO:*\n\n*3.1. The immunity granted by Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention is applicable without a specific order of an ICSID Tribunal. This Tribunal confirms that the immunity granted by Articles 21 and 22 is also applicable to the persons participating in the present ICSID proceedings and, particularly, that Article 22 is also applicable to the persons participating according to section A above.*\n\n*3.2. Beyond the provisions of Articles 21 and 22, the Tribunal agrees with the Tribunal in the Libananco Case* *(http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/Libanco-Decision.pdf) that every ICSID tribunal has an inherent power required to preserve the integrity of its own process and assure that the parties can advance their respective cases freely without interference, and as well that the parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith, and that this duty also applies to States as parties to ICSID proceedings, even if in the exercise of their sovereign powers and including criminal proceedings, though the State's right to exercise such sovereign powers and criminal jurisdiction is not questioned.*\n\n*3.3. This obligation includes the duty of parties not to intimidate, harass, retaliate against, or physically harm parties, witnesses and other participants in ICSID proceedings or prevent them from fulfilling their functions.*\n\n*3.4. For the present case, this obligation is recalled in view of the criminal proceedings of the Respondent against participants in the present case as parties or witnesses from Claimant's side, or as persons whose presence at the hearing Claimant now requests, in view of the measures taken in Kazakhstan on the same date as the 1st Session of the present proceeding on 16 April 2009 during which many documents were taken from the Claimant's offices, and also in view of the further actions which Claimant alleges Respondent* [has] *taken thereafter but without prejudice to the correctness or relevance of such allegations. In this regard, reference is also made to the respective rulings in* *the Tribunal's Decision of 31 July 2009 regarding provisional measures and in Procedural Order No. 2 regarding document production.*\n\n*4. The Tribunal recalls section 15.1 of the Minutes of the 1st Session and, in order to have all relevant evidence available at the time of the final hearing in this case, hereby admits the evidence submitted by the Parties so far. In accordance with the last sentence of the 3rd paragraph of that section, the Tribunal, in section 1.3 of PO-5, has granted the Parties the opportunity to submit evidence in rebuttal by 17 January 2011.*\n\n*C. In so far as Claimant's Requests go beyond the Tribunal's rulings in sections* *A and B above, they are dismissed.\"*\n\n75.\n\nBy letter of 29 December 2010, Respondent objected to Claimant's purported intention to file new exhibits in response to Respondent's Rejoinder without prior authorisation of the Tribunal.\n\n76.\n\nBy email of 4 January 2011, ICSID wrote to the Parties as instructed by the President of the Tribunal noting that Respondent's letter of 29 December 2010 seemed to have crossed with the issuance of PO-5 and PO-6 and informing them of clarifications and amendments regarding the filing of further exhibits. Claimant was thus required to submit any further exhibits in rebuttal to Respondent's Rejoinder by 12 January 2011 to which Respondent might submit evidence with its filings of 17 January 2011.\n\n77.\n\nBy email of 12 January 2011, Claimant submitted further exhibits in rebuttal to Respondent's Rejoinder of 14 December 2010.\n\n78.\n\nBy email of 13 January 2011, Claimant provided an additional exhibit it had just received that day in rebuttal to Respondent's allegation of forgery in Respondent's Rejoinder.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of 14 January 2011 to the Parties, ICSID confirmed the hearing dates, time and location and invited them to advise ICSID of any logistical or other requirements by 19 January 2011.\n\n80.\n\nBy letter of 14 January 2011, Claimant submitted three further exhibits.\n\n81.\n\nBy letter of 17 January 2011, Respondent provided a list of witnesses and experts whom it wished to examine at the Paris hearing together with information on the persons who would be attending the hearing on their side, the witnesses Respondent did not intend to examine, the witnesses and experts who would require interpretation to and from English, the experts that Respondent suggested to be examined by Expert Conferencing, and issues that should be raised by each group of experts during Expert Conferencing.\n\n82.\n\nBy further letter of 17 January 2011, Respondent provided comments on Claimant's submissions of 13 and 14 January 2011 as well as Claimant's submissions of December 2010. The letter was accompanied by exhibits and expert opinions.\n\n83.\n\nAlso by letter of 17 January 2011, Claimant submitted a list of persons attending the hearing on its behalf, a list of those witnesses it did no longer intend to examine at the hearing, a list of witnesses requiring interpretation to and from English, a list of experts to be examined together by Expert Conferencing, and further issues regarding the preparation of the hearing.\n\n84.\n\nIn a letter of 18 January 2011, Claimant sought authorisation by the Tribunal to submit further exhibits as rebuttal evidence in the proceedings. The exhibits at issue were attached to the letter.\n\n85.\n\nBy letter of 19 January 2011, Claimant responded to Respondent's letter of 17 January 2011 in which Respondent had requested the Tribunal to exclude certain exhibits submitted by Claimant between 12 and 14 January 2011. Claimant further addressed procedural issues with regard to the hearing.\n\n86.\n\nBy email of 19 January 2011, ICSID transmitted two letters from Mr Rashid Farah of the Lebanese law firm Abouhamad, Marheb, Nohra, Chamoun, Chedid to the Tribunal.\n\n87.\n\nBy email of 21 January 2011, ICSID transmitted a letter from one of Claimant's witnesses, Mr Fadi Hussein, who declined to testify at the hearing to the Tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nBy letter of 23 January 2011, Respondent provided comments on Claimant's letters of 17, 18, and 19 January 2011 as well as on issues regarding the hearing and recent filings of Claimant.\n\n89.\n\nAfter many further submissions of the Parties, by **letter of 24 January 2011**, ICSID notified the Parties as instructed by the Tribunal of its decisions regarding the admissibility of certain party submissions, witnesses and experts, and further outstanding matters. In view of its relevance later in the proceedings, the letter is quoted hereafter:\n\n*\"1. The Tribunal has carefully considered the many recent submissions by the Parties regarding the preparation and conduct of the Hearing in Paris. In view of the many issues addressed and in order to give the Parties guidance for their preparation of the Hearing without further delay within the very short time available up to the Hearing, and in order to avoid longer time that would be needed for the members of the Tribunal, who also have mandatory commitments in other cases during that period, to elaborate and agree on a longer text defining in detail the considerations and reasons of the Tribunal, the Tribunal has decided to hereby inform the Parties of its following preliminary rulings.*\n\n*2. Documents Submitted by the Parties*\n\n*2.1. The Tribunal appreciates the submissions of the Parties indicating that and why certain documents recently submitted by the Parties should or should not be admitted. However, the Tribunal considers it as important that, at the final hearing of this case, all documents that the Parties consider as relevant, can be considered and discussed.*\n\n*2.2. Therefore, the Tribunal provisionally admits all documents submitted [by] the Parties up to now, and the two letters submitted by Mr. Rashid Farah forwarded to the Parties by the Tribunal's Secretary at ICSID by e-mail of 19 January 2011.*\n\n*2.3. At the Hearing, the Parties should be prepared to comment on all new documents, may refer to and rely on these documents (provided they are in English or translated into English), may explain why they consider them admissible or inadmissible beyond what they have already argued in their written submissions, and may request to further discuss these documents in their post-hearing submissions.*\n\n*2.4. Any further submissions by the Parties have to be made, as is the general rule in ICSID proceedings, to ICSID without any copies sent directly to members of the Tribunal.*\n\n*2.5. Taking all these presentations of the Parties into account, the Tribunal will then decide on the final admissibility of documents it considers it[sic] relevant for its decisions and whether it can rely on such document for its decision.*\n\n*3. Witnesses and Experts*\n\n*3.1. Again, the Tribunal appreciates the submissions of the Parties indicating that and why certain witnesses and experts should or should not be admitted and examined at the Hearing. However again, the Tribunal considers it as important that, at the final hearing of this case, all evidence that the Parties consider as relevant, can be considered and discussed.*\n\n*3.2. The Tribunal recalls and confirms its Procedural Order No. 6.*\n\n*3.3. The Tribunal has taken note of and accepts the Parties' submissions regarding the witnesses and experts that will and will not be present at the Hearing and regarding the witnesses they do not intend to examine at the Hearing. The rulings of PO6 will be applied in this regard and their examination will be conducted in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5.*\n\n*3.4. Since the Parties have not agreed on any changes, the examination will be conducted in the order given by the Agenda given in sections*\n\n*3.2 and 3.3 of PO5.*\n\n*3.5. In so far as certain witnesses or experts cannot be present for the entire period of the Hearing, the Parties are invited to agree on certain time frames in this regard and inform the Tribunal at the beginning of the Hearing.*\n\n*3.6. The Tribunal has taken note that the Parties' suggestions regarding the groups of experts for the expert conferencing are not identical. The Parties are invited to agree in this regard and inform the Tribunal at the beginning of the Hearing.*\n\n*4. Outstanding Matters*\n\n*4.1. The Tribunal will deliberate in the morning before the hearing whether it considers any further rulings as necessary and inform the Parties at the beginning of the Hearing.*\n\n*4.2. Any further outstanding matters will be discussed with the Parties at the beginning or at an appropriate time of the Hearing.\"*\n\n90.\n\nAlso by letter of 24 January 2011, Claimant commented on Respondent's letter of 23 January 2011, in particular on Respondent's objection to the attendance of three persons at the hearing on Claimant's behalf.\n\n91.\n\nBy letter of 26 January 2011, the Tribunal proposed changes in the logistical arrangements of the upcoming hearing.\n\n92.\n\nBy letter of 31 January 2011, the ICSID Secretariat provided the Parties with further logistical information about the hearing.\n\n93.\n\nAlso on 31 January 2011, Respondent provided comments on ICSID's letter of 24 January 2011 concerning Claimant's filing of 13 December 2011 and Claimant's filing of voluminous documents shortly before the hearing. Respondent further commented on matters of procedure regarding witness and expert testimony as well as the proposed attendance of certain persons at the hearing.\n\n94.\n\nOn 1 February 2011, Claimant provided the Arabic transcription and the English translation of exhibit C-288.\n\n95.\n\nOn 2 February 2011, Claimant submitted several exhibits relating to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan \"On Subsoil and Subsoil Use\" No. 2828 of 27 January 1996 as requested by ICSID on 11 January 2011.\n\n96.\n\nBy letter of 2 February 2011, ICSID provided further information regarding the logistical arrangements for the upcoming hearing to the Parties.\n\n97.\n\nBy letter of 4 February 2011, Claimant introduced further exhibits with respect to allegations regarding the transfer of the Caratube Contract from CCC to CIOC (C-313 to C-317) for which it sought authorisation for submission in the proceedings.\n\n98.\n\nWith letter of 5 February 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal of changes in the availability of one of its witnesses. Furthermore, Respondent modified its list of attendants for the hearing.\n\n99.\n\nBy letter of the same day, Respondent replied to Claimant's letter of 4 February 2011 and requested the authorisation to submit further exhibits in return should the Tribunal approve Claimant's request of 4 February 2011.\n\n100.\n\nFrom 7 to 17 February 2011, the **Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits** was held in Paris, France. It was attended by:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal:*\n\n*Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel, President Dr. Kamal Hossain, Arbitrator*\n\n*Dr. Gavan Griffith QC, Arbitrator For the Tribunal:*\n\n*Milanka Kostadinova, Secretary to the Tribunal Yun-I Kim, Assistant to the Tribunal*\n\n*Tanha Zarrin Ahmed, Assistant Accompanying Dr. Kamal Hossain*\n\n*On behalf of the Claimant:*\n\n*Stuart H.

Regarding possible objections of the Parties to the procedure by the Tribunal, the following passage from the Transcript of the Hearing is quoted (Tr, day 10, p. 73-74):\n\n*\"THE PRESIDENT: [\u2026] This then brings us to the real end of our procedure, and I would like to thank both counsel for being so helpful in finely focusing again [on] things in such a short time. Of course, we will get much more focusing and longer* *focusing in the post-hearing briefs, and that's indeed what we need, but this has been helpful, let me say that.*\n\n*As we all know, this has not been an easy case. I think we have all had easier procedures in the past. There were many reasons for that, and I don't think we should go into that. We are also aware that at various stages a party put an objection on the record. That happens, and again that is nothing so unusual.*\n\n*Nevertheless let me at this final stage also raise the usual question: do the parties have any objection of the way this Tribunal has conducted the procedure?*\n\n*MR VASANI: Claimant has no objection.*\n\n*THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Respondent?*\n\n*MR WOLRICH: Mr Chairman, respondent certainly has no objection to the manner in which the Tribunal has conducted this procedure. We just maintain whatever objections we made on the record for the record, and those we maintain. But they don't really go to the way the Tribunal conducted this hearing, which I think is exemplary.*\n\n*THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much indeed. [\u2026]\"*\n\n102.\n\nTaking into account the discussion and agreement with the Parties at the end of the hearing, on 22 February 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7** regarding the post-hearing procedure. In view of their relevance for the final procedure in this case, the following excerpts are quoted hereafter:\n\n*\" (\u2026)*\n\n*1.7. With regard to the withdrawal of the documents C162, C175, C238, C239, C240 and \"ALIYEV 25\" communicated by Claimant during the hearing, the Tribunal accepts such withdrawal. But the Parties may refer to the filing and withdrawal of these documents.*\n\n*(\u2026)*\n\n*2. Questions of the Tribunal*\n\n*Without prejudice to the final relevance the Tribunal may attribute to them for its decisions, the Parties are particularly requested to address the following questions and issues in separate sections of the Post-Hearing Briefs:*\n\n*2.1. Which considerations do the Parties have regarding jurisdiction at this stage?*\n\n*2.2. Which Party has the burden of proof for which aspects of the case?*\n\n*2.3. To which extent may alleged breaches of the contract be relevant for alleged breaches of the BIT, either by application of the Umbrella-Clause or otherwise?*\n\n*2.4. After receiving the Post-Hearing Briefs of the Parties, and in the course of its deliberations thereafter, the Tribunal may invite comments from the Parties regarding further issues.*\n\n*(\u2026)\"*\n\n103.\n\nOn 12 April 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 regarding the Parties' applications to submit further documents. It read as follows:\n\n\" ***Procedural Order (PO) No. 8***\n\n***Regarding the Parties' Applications to Submit Further Documents***\n\n*The Tribunal has reviewed the Parties' letters of 4 April 2011 and the enclosed applications for the exceptional admission to submit further documents according to \u00a7 1.3 of Procedural Order No. 7.*\n\n*Taking into account the respective discussions during the hearing with regard to the criteria for the admission of new documents, in the view of the Tribunal the applications in the form of Redfern Schedules contain all relevant further arguments. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it necessary to repeat the arguments with regard to the individual applications in the Schedules.*\n\n*Rather, after its evaluation of the respective arguments, the Tribunal herewith attaches the two Redfern Schedules in which, in the right hand column, the Tribunal has inserted its respective decisions regarding each individual application. The two Redfern Schedules form an integral part of this Procedural Order.\"*\n\n104.\n\nBy letter of 3 May 2011, Claimant informed the Tribunal of alleged bankruptcy proceedings at the request of Kazakh authorities and requested the Tribunal to elicit Respondent to cease and desist, and instruct its organs to cease and desist, to declare Claimant bankrupt or seek its liquidation or change its legal status and require the Tribunal's permission before any other measure against Claimant of any nature is taken which could affect these proceedings.\n\n105.\n\nOn 17 May 2011, Respondent informed that the bankruptcy proceedings are being discontinued.\n\n106.\n\nBy letter of 3 June 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties of a submission made by a non-disputing party. The Parties filed their observations in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n107.\n\nBy letter of 22 June 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties and Counsel for the nondisputing party that the submission of the non-disputing party shall not be admitted.\n\n108.\n\nOn 27 June 2011 the Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs.\n\n109.\n\nBy separate letters of 11 July 2011, Respondent submitted an application for rebuttal submissions. Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would not submit an application for rebuttal submissions.\n\n110.\n\nOn 2 August 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 9** (PO-9) regarding the Parties' applications to submit rebuttal arguments, inviting the Parties to submit additional arguments simultaneously by 10 August 2011, in memorials not exceeding 10 pages.\n\n111.\n\nBy 10 August 2011, the Parties submitted short memorials in accordance with PO-9.\n\n112.\n\nBy letter of 12 October 2011, the Tribunal asked the Parties to submit their respective statements of costs no later than 31 October 2011 and to submit comments on each other's cost statements by 11 November 2011.\n\n113.\n\nBy letter of 26 October 2011, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had mutually agreed to an extension for the submission of statements of costs to 7 November 2011 and an extension to submit comments on each other's statements of costs by 18 November 2011.\n\n114.\n\nBy letter of 7 November 2011, the Parties simultaneously submitted their statements of costs and corresponding documentation.\n\n115.\n\nOn 18 November 2011, the Parties submitted comments on each other's statement of costs.\n\n116.\n\nOn 9 May 2012 the Tribunal closed the proceedings. The arbitrators are satisfied that both Parties had ample opportunities to present their case in written and oral form.\n\n**E. The Principal Relevant Legal Provisions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**E.I. The Kazakhstan-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe principal relevant legal provisions for this arbitration in the BIT are as follows:\n\n*\"Article I*\n\n*1.

Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.\"*\n\n*\"Article VI*\n\n*1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.*\n\n*2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:*\n\n*(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that in[sic] a Party to the dispute; or*\n\n*(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or*\n\n*(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.*\n\n*3.

Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:*\n\n*(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and*\n\n*(b) an \"agreement in writing,\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").*\n\n*5.

For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention.\"*\n\n**E.II.

Procedure for Dispute Resolution*\n\n*27.1 The Parties shall take all measures to resolve all disputes arising from the Contract by negotiations.*\n\n*27.2 Referral to Arbitration. In the event that any dispute cannot be resolved by amicable settlement within sixty (60) days after notice in writing of such by one Party to the other Party, the Parties agree that their exclusive means of dispute resolution shall be (a) to submit the matter to arbitration for final settlement in accordance with the then current Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") if the Competent Authority has become a party to the ICSID Convention at the time a proceeding is instituted, or (b) to submit the dispute for resolution according to the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules of ICSID if the Competent Authority has not become a party to the ICSID Convention at the time when any proceeding is instituted. Any arbitral tribunal constituted pursuant to this Contract shall consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by the Contractor and one appointed by the Competent Authority, and a third arbitrator, who shall be president of the Tribunal and shall not be a resident of Kazakhstan, appointed by agreement of the Parties, or failing such agreement, by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID. In the event that the Contractor or the Competent Authority fails to appoint an arbitrator within ninety (90) calendar days after the notice of registration of a request for arbitration has been sent, the remaining arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with the Rules under ICSID.*\n\n*27.3 If for any reason the request for the arbitration proceeding is not registered by ICSID or if ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction over any matter submitted by the Parties under this Section 27, such matter shall be referred to and resolved by arbitration in accordance with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL\") Arbitration Rules in effect at the date of submission of the matter. The seat of Arbitration shall be London, England. In such event the Parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the London Court of International Arbitration and all the provisions of this Article 27 shall equally apply to such arbitration.*\n\n*27.4 Proceedings. The English language shall be used throughout the arbitral proceedings and the proceedings shall be held in London, England unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. The Parties shall be entitled to be legally represented at the arbitration proceedings, however the absence or default of a Party shall not prevent or hinder the arbitration proceedings at any stage. All notices given by one Party to the other in connection with the arbitration shall be given in accordance with this Contract.*\n\n*27.5 Arbitral Award. Any arbitral award made in respect of any matter submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 27.2 shall be final and binding upon the Parties. Any award of a monetary sum shall be rendered in hard currency, free of any tax or any other deduction. The award shall include interest from a date determined by the arbitrators, at a commercial fate to be fixed by the arbitrators. Within three (3) months from the date determined by the arbitrators, full payment of any arbitral award shall be made. The arbitral award may provide for specific performance or any other remedy awarded by the arbitral tribunal.*\n\n*27.6 Costs. The costs of the arbitration, including legal costs, shall be borne by the unsuccessful Party or, if neither Party is wholly successful, shall be borne by the Parties in such proportions as may be specified in the arbitral award or, if no such specification is made, shall be borne by the Parties in equal shares. Any costs, fees or Competent Authority charges incidental to enforcing the arbitral award shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, be borne by the Party against whom such enforcement is made.*\n\n*27.7 Enforcement and Consent. Each of the Parties hereby consents to submit to 1CSID any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Contact[sic]. Each of the Parties agrees that any judgement rendered by the arbitrators against it and entered in any court of record in London, England or any other competent court, may be executed against its assets in any jurisdiction. The Parties consent to being sued for enforcement of the award and any costs, fees or other charges for which they may be liable under this Article. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that all of the transactions contemplated by this Contract shall constitute and shall be deemed to constitute an investment within the jurisdiction of ICSID. The Competent Authority warrants that it is a structural subdivision and agent of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.*\n\n*27.8 Furthermore, it is hereby agreed that the Contractor is a resident of Lebanon, or in the event of assignment as a national of the resident country of the assignee, and therefore the Contractor shall be treated as a resident of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, for purposes of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*27.9 Waiver of Immunity. Each of the Parties expressly and irrevocably waives any claim to immunity (including, but not limited to, sovereign immunity, immunity from service of process, immunity of property from award) from suit, execution, set-off, attachment or other legal process under any applicable law or in respect of any arbitral award rendered.*\n\n*27.10 Continued Performance. If a matter is submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 27.3 of this Contract the Parties shall, during the period of such arbitral proceedings and pending the resolution of such matter or the making of the arbitral award, continue to perform their respective obligations under this Contract so far as circumstances will allow and such performance shall be without prejudice to any final agreement, judgement or award made in respect of that matter. To the extent that the circumstances do not allow the* *performance of obligations under this Contract then the period for the performance of those obligations and any obligations relevant thereon shall be extended by the period between the date of the notice of arbitration to the date of compliance with the award.\"*\n\n**E.III. Relevant ICSID Convention Provisions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe principal legal provision of the ICSID Convention relevant for the present dispute is as follows:\n\n*\"Article 25*\n\n*(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n*(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and*\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.*\n\n*(3) Consent by a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State shall require the approval of that State unless that State notifies the Centre that no such approval is required.*\n\n*(4) Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Secretary-General shall forthwith transmit such notification to all Contracting States. Such notification shall not constitute the consent required by paragraph (1).\"*\n\n**E.IV. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Parties in their submissions referred the Tribunal to the VCLT, the terms of which are also considered declaratory of customary international law. The principal relevant provisions are:\n\n*\"Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in* *addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4.

Relief Sought by the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**F.I. Relief Sought by Claimant**\n----------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nAs identified in Claimant's Request for Arbitration of 16 June 2008, Claimant asks the Tribunal to award as follows (C-I, para. 86):\n\n*\"Accordingly the Claimant requests the following relief:*\n\n*(i) an order declaring that Kazakhstan has violated Articles II(2)(a), (b) and (c) as well as Article III of the BIT, as well as its obligations under international law, Kazakh law and the Contract;*\n\n*(ii) an order directing Kazakhstan to pay damages equivalent to the financial loss and damage, including lost profit, which CIOC has suffered as a result of Kazakhstan's breaches of the BIT as well as its obligations under international law, Kazakh law and the Contract;*\n\n*(iii) an order directing Kazakhstan to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of ICSID, as well as legal and other expenses incurred by CIOC including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants and those of CIOC's own employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment;

Summary of Facts**\n-----------------------\n\n128.\n\nWithout prejudice to their relevance for the considerations and conclusions of the Tribunal, the following section briefly summarises the facts of the case as presented by Claimant and Respondent in chronological order. A more comprehensive coverage of the facts can be found in Claimant's Memorial of 14 May 2009 (C-IV, paras. 46-155), Claimant's Reply Memorial of 30 July 2010 (C-V, paras. 16-114), Respondent's Counter-Memorial of 22 December 2009 (R-III, paras. 93-245) and Respondent's Rejoinder of 14 December 2009 (R-IV, paras. 87-345).\n\n**G.I. The Caratube Project**\n-----------------------------\n\n129.\n\nKazakhstan is a former Soviet Republic that declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It is a country rich in natural resources, which are an important part of the country's economic success.\n\n130.\n\nIn December 2000, Consolidated Contractors (Oil & Gas) Company S.A.L. (\"CCC\") responded to Kazakhstan's open tender for exploration and development of an area of the Caratube oil field. The area was previously explored during the Soviet era. Some oil deposits were discovered, but no production was ever commenced. CCC is a large construction company owned by a Lebanese family - the Khourys.1\n\nThe domicile of CCC is unclear. Claimant refers to CCC as a Greek company. (C-V, para. 193) The Tribunal notes that the Transfer Agreement refers to CCC as \"duly registered in Lebanon\" (C-53), and that in the Contract the parties \"agreed that [CCC] is a resident of Lebanon\". (C-4, para. 27.8) The issue whether CCC is domiciled in Greece or Lebanon was discussed but not decided before the English courts (C-292, *Masri v. Consolidated Contractors International Company SAL & Anor* [2007] EWHC 3010 (Comm) (20 December 2007). The issue of CCC's domicile is not relevant in the case at hand and therefore does need to be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n131.\n\nOn 27 May 2002 the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (\"MEMR\"), acting on behalf of Kazakhstan, and CCC, signed the \"Contract for Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons within Blocks XXIV-20-C (partially); XXIV-21-A (partially), including the Caratube Field (oversalt) in the Baiganin District of the Aktobe Oblast of the Republic of Kazakhstan\", also called \"Contract No. 954\" (C-4).\n\n132.\n\nThe Contract gave CCC the exclusive right to carry out exploration and production of hydrocarbons within the Contract area (Clauses 4.1 and 7.1). The exploration period under the Contract was five years (up to 2007), later extended by the Parties for another two years. The production period, commencing from the date of commercial production for each deposit, was 25 years (up to 2032) (Clauses 3.2 and 9.1). A Minimum Work Programme, subdivided into annual work programmes, was attached to the Contract (\"Five-Year Work Programme\"). The key elements of the Five-Year Work Programme were:\n\na) to re-enter existing old wells and to drill new wells in the shallower, supra-salt formations;\n\nb) to carry out pilot testing (trial production) in the supra-salt zone;\n\nc) to carry out a 3D seismic survey (a geophysical study) by the end of the second year; and to prepare a report as to the available reserves; and\n\nd) to drill two wells in the deeper sub-salt formation (one by the end of year four, another by the end of year five).\n\nIn case of a commercial discovery, the contractor had an exclusive right to proceed to the production stage. In case of a commercial discovery the contractor was entitled to reimbursement of its expenses in connection with exploration (Clause 10.5-10.6). If no commercial discovery was made by the end of the exploration period, the Contract terminated (Clause 9.6).\n\n133.\n\nWestern Kazakhstan Territorial Administration of Geology and Subsoil Use (\"TU Zapkaznedra\") is the competent regional branch of the MEMR's Geological Committee that was the body for the reporting and performance connected with the Contract. The main high-level supervisory body was a Monitoring Division of MEMR.\n\n**G.II. CIOC and Contract Assignment**\n--------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nOn 8 August 2002, CCC and CIOC signed a \" *Transfer Agreement Regarding the Right of Subsoil Use* \". (C-53) (\"Transfer Agreement\") The Transfer Agreement contained no price. According to Claimant, and not contested by Respondent, CCC was paid approximately USD 9.4 million for transferring the Contract. The Transfer Agreement stated that it \" *comes into effect from the date of registration at the [MEMR] of all* *amendments and addenda to the Contract which reflect the change of the Contractor's name (...).* \" (C-53, Clause 3) MEMR approved the assignment on 7 November 2002. On 26 December 2002, MEMR approved Amendment 1 to the Contract reflecting the assignment. The motivation and circumstances of the decision to assign the Contract are disputed between the Parties.\n\n135.\n\nCIOC is a Kazakh entity, registered on 29 July 2002. (C-54) Its founder was Fadi Hussein, a Danish citizen and a distant cousin of Devincci Hourani and his brothers: Issam Hourani and Hussam Hourani. It is not clear at what point a 7 % share in CIOC was acquired by Waheeb Antakly (a U.S. citizen). The Parties are disputing the role of Fadi Hussein in CIOC.\n\n136.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 Fadi Hussein and Devincci Hourani signed a share purchase agreement on the basis of which Devincci Hourani was to acquire an 85 % share in CIOC representing 850,000 tenge and sold for this amount. Ownership to the share was supposed to pass to Devincci Hourani upon payment of the full price for the share within three days and introduction of appropriate amendments to the founding documents of CIOC. (C-55)\n\n137.\n\nOn 8 April 2005 Waheeb Antakly and Devincci Hourani signed a share purchase agreement on the basis of which Devincci Hourani was to acquire a 7 % share in CIOC representing 70,000 tenge and sold for this amount. Ownership to the share was supposed to pass upon payment of the full price for the share within three days and introduction of appropriate amendments to the founding documents of CIOC. (C-56)\n\n138.\n\nOn 18 May 2006 Devincci Hourani, acting on behalf of Fadi Hussein, signed a share purchase agreement with Kassem Omar. On the basis of that agreement Kassem Omar was to acquire an 8 % share in CIOC with a nominal value of 80,000 tenge and sold for this amount. The price was to be paid \" *in a manner agreed to by the parties.* \" (WS Kassem Omar, Exhibit 1) There is no mention in that agreement when and under what conditions the ownership to the share was supposed to pass to Kassem Omar.\n\n139.\n\nDevincci Hourani is a U.S. citizen. He received his U.S. citizenship on 16 July 2001. Before that he did not hold the nationality of any country. He was a stateless Palestinian refugee born in Lebanon. His business interests in Kazakhstan started in the early 1990s, when he became a partner in his brother Issam's medical equipment business. His U.S. in-laws participated in an oil and gas business with Issam Hourani (Kulandy Energy Corporation) since the late 1990s. Devincci Hourani purchased 100 % of the shares in that company from Issam Hourani in 2002. He was also involved in a media (TV) business, in which Issam Hourani and Gulshat Aliyev had a majority stake. He advised his brother-in-law Kassem Omar in a poultry business and advised in other family businesses in Kazakstan (airline and airport operations).\n\n**G.III. Performance of the Contract by CIOC (2002-2007) and Contract Termination in 2008**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe following facts are highlighted by the Parties in relation to the Contract performance and termination.\n\n141.\n\nBy letter of 8 December 2003, TU Zapkaznedra called CIOC's attention to its \" *actual geological survey performance on exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons on the Caratube field for 9 months of 2003* [which] *is 44.1 % of the planned* \" and requested it to \" *take appropriate measures to complete the geological survey* \" and provide \" *written explanation of the reasons for non-fulfillment of approved amounts.* \" (R-9)\n\n142.\n\nOn 29 December 2003 TU Zapkaznedra and CIOC met to discuss the performance results of the approved work programme for the reporting year 2003 and review the work programme for 2004. The minutes of the meeting record that, among other things, \" *[t]he 3D seismic field survey was not fulfilled* \" and that \" *[a]ll outstanding obligations are carried over to 2004, and their fulfillment shall be guaranteed.* \" The 2004 work programme included \" *the outstanding unfulfilled obligations of the[sic] 2003 related to drilling and 3-D Seismic works.* \" The 2004 work programme was approved. (R-17)\n\n143.\n\nOn 21 December 2004 TU Zapkaznedra and CIOC met to discuss the performance results of the approved work programme for the reporting year 2004 and review the work programme for 2005. The minutes of the meeting, according to Respondent's translation (R-9) record that, among other things, \" *CDP Seismic 3D field surveys were not performed and therefore, the construction of a deep subsalt well was not performed* \" and that \" *[a]ll outstanding obligations are carried forward to 2005, and their fulfillment shall be guaranteed considering financial obligations for 2005*.\" (R-18) The 2005 work programme was approved. The translation submitted by Claimant (C-105) differs slightly : \" *Seismic field CDP 3D works were not performed and construction of a deep subsalt well.* \"\n\n144.\n\nOn 17 January 2005 MEMR issued a \" *Notice of Breach of Contract No. 954 of 27 May 2002* \" to CIOC. The document notified CIOC that it is in breach of the Contract *,* in particular of \" *the Work Program* [which] *has not been performed in full (clause 8.1)* \" *.* The notice called CIOC to \" *eliminate the above-stated breaches, provide all necessary documents confirming the elimination of such breaches, and report on measures taken to eliminate and prevent further breach of contractual obligations (...).* \" (R-10)\n\n145.\n\nOn 9 March 2005 CIOC replied to the MEMR's Notice of Breach informing that \" *[a]t present we are conducting an expedited implementation of the 2005 Work Program approved by \"TU Zapkaznedra\", which provides for the correction of deficiencies with regards to the obligations* \" and providing details of the works. CIOC informed that the 3D seismic study will be conducted in the first half of 2005 and the deep wells in the subsalt deposits will be constructed afterwards, also in 2005. (R-19)\n\n146.\n\nOn 21 December 2005 TU Zapkaznedra and CIOC met to discuss the performance results of the approved work programme for the reporting year 2005 and review the work programme for 2006. The minutes of the meeting record that \" *it appears that production prevails over exploration, despite the fact that during the period of trial production (2002-2006) the company should have focused on geological exploration to create a basis for final evaluation and estimation of field reserves.* \" The minutes also record that, among other things, \" *CDP Seismic 3D field works were not performed and consequently construction of a deep subsalt well was not performed, due to the difficulty of developing methodology (...)* \" and that \" *[a]ll outstanding obligations are carried forward to 2006, and their fulfillment shall be guaranteed considering financial obligations for 2006*.\" (R-20; Claimant's translation reads \" *it appeared* \" but is otherwise identical, C-102) The 2006 work programme was approved.\n\n147.\n\nOn 28 February 2006, TU Zapkaznedra issued a Notice to CIOC calling its attention to \" *the non-fulfillment of the approved 2005 Annual Work Program* \" and delay in filing their fourth quarter report. TU Zapkaznedra informed CIOC that it must take appropriate action to eliminate the non-performance and explain the reasons for delay by 10 March 2006. TU Zapkaznedra further pointed out that failure to do so would require it to \" *take appropriate actions according to the legislation of* [the] *R* [epublic of ] *K* [azakhstan] *.* \" (R-21)\n\n148.\n\nOn 11 July 2006, the Parties concluded Amendment 2 to the Contract which reduced the value added tax and at the same time increased the royalty rate.\n\n149.\n\nOn 18 August 2006 TU Zapkaznedra issued a Notice to CIOC calling its attention that from CIOC's report for the second quarter of 2006 it follows that CIOC's financial performance amounted to 12.7 % under the Annual Work Program of 2006 and asked CIOC to take appropriate measures to fulfil its obligations.\n\n150.\n\nOn 27 November 2006 CIOC sent a letter to MEMR requesting \" *prolongation of the exploration period for 2 years (27.05.20087[sic])* \". (R-36; C-83)\n\n151.\n\nOn 29 November 2006 TU Zapkaznedra and CIOC met to discuss the performance results of the approved work programme for the reporting year 2006 and review the work programme for 2007. The minutes of the meeting record, among other things, that the 3D survey was not completed and that \" *[c]onstruction of the deep subsalt well has not been performed*.\" (R-23) The outstanding obligations under the Work Program with regard to drilling works were carried over to 2007.\n\n152.\n\nBy letter dated 11 December 2006, TU Zapkaznedra informed CIOC that \" *based on the* *results from 9 months of the current year (...) [CIOC] was put on the list of companies* *whose performance of financial obligations, percentage-wise, amounted to less that 30 % (i.e. 20.9 %), which constitutes a breach of Contract (...).* \" (R-11)\n\n153.\n\nIn a letter of 21 February 2007 MEMR informed CIOC that it decided to \" *extend the* *period for hydrocarbon prospecting within the licensed blocks, including the Caratube* *field (suprasalt) (...) for two more years till 27.05.09 with the minimum working program for the amount of US$ 18 million during the extension period (...).* \" (C-7)\n\n154.\n\nOn 25 March 2007 MEMR issued a \" *Notice of Breach of Obligations under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002.* \" The notice informed CIOC that it breached certain terms and conditions of the Contract. The list of breaches included that \" *the Work Program has not been performed* [in Claimant's translation: \" *fulfilled* \"] *(clause 8.1)* \". It requested that those breaches be eliminated within one month. The notice stated that in case of CIOC's failure to remedy the breaches MEMR \" *may unilaterally dissolve the Contract* \". No response from CIOC was received. Claimant claims that it received this notice only in September 2007. (R-24; C-109)\n\n155.\n\nOn 27 July 2007 MEMR and CIOC signed Appendix No. 3 to the Contract, extending the term for prospecting until 27 May 2009. The amendment also included the work program for the extended period.\n\n156.\n\nOn 7 September 2007, the Prosecutor's Office in Aktobe issued a \" *Recommendation on elimination of disregard of the rule of law* \" for MEMR, stating that \" *despite the continued* *nonperformance of the terms of the Contract and of the work programs (...) [TU \"Zapkaznedra\"] annually approves work programs and, moreover, carries over part of the unfulfilled obligations of the current year to the following year. This shows (...)* *[MEMR's] lack of appropriate monitoring of the activities of the subsoil user and failure to take measures to rectify noncompliance with the terms of the Contract.* \" (R-27)\n\n157.\n\nAccording to Respondent, from 11 to 30 September 2007, TU Zapkaznedra conducted an on-site audit at the Caratube field and subsequently issued a Prescriptive Order pointing out breaches and deficits that had to be remedied. According to Claimant it received the Prescriptive Order on 28 September 2007 (see C-IV, para. 127). (R-28; C-70)\n\n158.\n\nIn September 2007 (the date is disputed) MEMR resent its notice of 25 March 2007 to CIOC.\n\n159.\n\nOn 1 October 2007 MEMR sent a \" *Notice of termination of operations under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002* \" to CIOC. The notice reminded CIOC of MEMR's Notice of 25 March 2007 and informed CIOC that it had received it on 28 March 2007. However, during the hearing, Claimant alleged that it had not received the notice in March 2007. (Tr, day 6, pp. 134 and 135) MEMR further informed CIOC that documents requested in the March notice have not been submitted within deadlines and \" *[f]or this reason, in accordance with Article 45-2, clause 2 of the Law, [MEMR] is hereby requesting immediate termination of operations under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002, pending a decision on the unilateral termination of the contract.* \" (R-26; C-10)\n\n160.\n\nIn a letter to MEMR of 1 or 3 October 2007 (Respondent states the letter was \u2018dated' 1 October, Claimant holds the letter was \u2018sent' 3 October, cf. C-IV, para. 130, R-III, para. 144) CIOC requested MEMR to re-examine its decision of the same day.\n\n161.\n\nOn 27 November 2007 MEMR responded with a \" *Notice of Resumed Operations Under Contract No. 954 (...) and of Breach of Contract No. 954 (...)* \" *.* (R-32) (Claimant's translation (C-14) reads: \" *Notification for Resumed Operations Under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002 and On the Failure to Exercise Provisions under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002* \".) The notice allowed CIOC to resume operations but listed breaches of Contract. MEMR requested that the ongoing breaches be cured within one month.\n\n162.\n\nOn 3 December 2007 MEMR issued a \" *Notification for Resumed Operations Under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002 and On the Failure to Exercise Provisions under Contract No. 954 of May 27, 2002* \" (C-14; Respondent's translation is \" *Notice of breach of obligations Under Contract No. 954 dated May 27, 2002* \") in which it informed CIOC that, according to the 3rd quarter report data, CIOC was in breach of its obligations under the Contract. It requested that the breach be remedied within one month. The notice also informed that, in the event its requirements are not fulfilled MEMR \" *will take the steps to terminate the Contract as provided for by the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan* \". (R-15; C-15)\n\n163.\n\nCIOC responded with a letter of 13 December 2007.\n\n164.\n\nAccording to Claimant, on 29 December 2007, TU Zapkaznedra considered and approved CIOC's 2008 Annual Work Programme.\n\n165.\n\nBy an Order of 30 January 2008 MEMR ordered to terminate the Contract \" *due to failure to fulfill the requirements of the Notice within the specified period.* \" (R-33; Claimant's translation in C-17 is: \" *due to failure of completion of notice requirements within the specified period.* \") On 1 February 2008 MEMR issued a \" *Notice of termination of the Contract No. 954 dated May 27, 2002* \", requesting CIOC, among others, to hand over the Contract territory, return geological information and the Contract and fulfil the outstanding obligations and to rehabilitate the contract area. (C-18; R-34)\n\n166.\n\nOn 12 February 2008 CIOC sent a letter to MEMR requesting it to allow CIOC to complete the works under the Contract. In its letter of 6 March 2008 CIOC requested MEMR for a meeting to explore the possibility of resolving the dispute by way of negotiations under Article 27 of the Contract.\n\n167.\n\nOn 13-14 March 2008 MEMR and CIOC representatives met for discussion. In conclusion of the meeting \" *[r]epresentatives of MEMR assured CIOC that they would notify the management of MEMR no later than by March 21, 2008,* [of] *the standpoint of CIOC, and shall respond on their position in writing, until March 29, 2008.* \" (C-22)\n\n168.\n\nIn a letter of 14 May 2008, in response to CIOC's letters, MEMR reiterated its decision on termination.\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Claimant, in June 2008, Claimant\u2019s bank accounts were frozen.\n\n**G.IV. Alleged Intimidation by the Authorities**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe following facts are, among others, highlighted by Claimant in relation to its claims of alleged harassment and intimidation of CIOC, its employees and other individuals by Kazakh authorities.\n\n171.\n\nOn 27 June 2007 the building housing offices of many businesses belonging to the Hourani family, including CIOC, was raided by police, the premises were searched and computers, documents, and details of bank accounts were seized. Following the raid CIOC employees were interrogated at the company\u2019s office or at the Ministry of Interior, and further documents were seized.\n\n172.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, Devincci Hourani was questioned at the police station.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to Claimant, in a meeting with the President\u2019s daughter Dariga Nazarbayeva in early July 2007, Devincci Hourani was informed that the nature of these attacks was of a political nature. At the same time, the Hourani family and CIOC\u2019s senior management were placed under surveillance by Kazakh authorities.\n\n174.\n\nClaimant further held that until mid-July 2007 the offices raided on 27 June 2007 were inspected on a daily basis by a Kazakh police officer.\n\n175.\n\nDevincci Hourani described being stopped and his car searched, extortion attempts, and receiving anonymous calls with threats. On 1 September 2007 the private homes of CIOC\u2019s Director Hussam Hourani, to which Devincci Hourani moved, was raided. Devincci Hourani was taken for interrogation. He left Kazakhstan on 4 September 2007 for London and came back in January 2008 and left again in March 2008. After that the harassment of CIOC\u2019s employees and Devincci Hourani continued.\n\n176.\n\nIn 2007 various criminal investigations were commenced by Kazakh authorities against Issam Hourani; an arrest warrant against him was issued by Interpol Astana and he was stripped of his Kazakh citizenship and his civil and diplomatic passports.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Issam Hourani and Devincci Hourani were deceived or coerced to assign shares in their various companies to Dariga Nazarbayeva. One of their companies was forced into an unjustified bankruptcy.\n\n178.\n\nFrom June to November 2007 CIOC was subject to many investigations, audits and complaints, including:\n\n\u2022 an audit by the Customs Control Committee of the Ministry of Finance,\n\n\u2022 an environmental audit by the Ministry of Environmental Protection,\n\n\u2022 the imposition of a penalty by MEMR\u2019s Committee of State Emergency Situations and Industrial Safety Control for breach of safety rules in the petroleum industry,\n\n\u2022 the imposition of a penalty by a state inspector of land use and protection for illegal use of state land,\n\n\u2022 an inspection of arrangements on civil defense and rescue operations, finding the non-fulfilment of a previously issued prescriptive order and resulting in a new prescriptive order,\n\n\u2022 an audit by the prosecutor for environmental protection resulting in the initiation of proceedings concerning the violation of the law against CIOC and CIOC's Director, Hussam Hourani,\n\n\u2022 an inspection of legality of the financial and economic activities by public prosecutors,\n\n\u2022 an audit of compliance with labour regulations by state labour inspection.\n\n179.\n\nOn 12 October 2007 the Investigations Unit of the Almaty City Department of Internal Affairs ordered seizure of CIOC's legal and accounting documents in connection with criminal investigations of a company (Ruby Roz Agricol) belonging to Issam Hourani.\n\n180.\n\nClaimant links the alleged intimidation and harassment with political events in Kazakhstan, in particular with the fact that Issam Hourani had since 1996 been married to Gulshat Aliyev. She is a sister of Rakhat Aliyev. Rakhat Aliyev was married to Dariga Nazarbayeva, daughter of the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and belonged to the close circle of the President. In May 2007 a conflict arose between Rakhat Aliyev and the President, as the former opposed the idea of the constitutional changes granting Nursultan Nazarbayev presidency for life. As a result, Claimant alleges the resulting campaign of the Kazakh authorities against Rakhat Aliyev included also the Hourani family.\n\n**H. Short Summary of Contentions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe following summary of the Parties' contentions is subject to more details as set out in the submissions of the Parties and reflected in the Tribunal's considerations in later sections of this Award.\n\n182.\n\nTo provide a better understanding of the full dispute, the summaries include those on aspects of the case which, in view of later considerations and conclusions of the Tribunal regarding jurisdiction, need not be examined by the Tribunal later in this Award.\n\n**H.I. Contentions Regarding the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Parties' contentions regarding jurisdiction will be taken up below in this Award together with the Tribunal's Considerations and Conclusions regarding jurisdiction.\n\n**H.II. Contentions Regarding the Admissibility of the Claims Presented**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe matter of admissibility of claims was heavily disputed between the Parties as set out below.\n\n**H.II.1. Summary of Contentions by Claimant**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nA more comprehensive coverage of Claimant's contentions on admissibility can be found in Claimant's Reply Memorial of 30 July 2010 (C-V, paras. 149-202).\n\n186.\n\nClaimant asserts that its claims are admissible and that CIOC has not waived its right to ICSID arbitration with regard to its claims under the BIT.\n\n187.\n\nClaimant clarifies that its claims are properly identified as treaty claims, which cannot be waived by a forum selection clause in the Contract. Even if this were possible, no such waiver was ever declared. Also, according to Claimant the forum selection clause in the Contract was never intended as a waiver of ICSID jurisdiction and thus, should not be interpreted as one. Even if the forum selection clause applied to some of the claims at hand, Claimant assures that this Tribunal would be the proper forum to entertain those claims.\n\n**H.II.2. Summary of Contentions by Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nA more detailed presentation of Respondent's contentions regarding the admissibility of the claims can be found in Respondent's Counter-Memorial of 22 December 2009 (R-III, paras. 47-78) and Respondent's Rejoinder of 14 December 2010 (R-IV, paras. 55-69).\n\n189.\n\nRespondent holds that CIOC's claims are inadmissible since the Contract contained a waiver by means of which CIOC had disposed of any right to jurisdiction it might have had before this Tribunal. As a consequence, all of CIOC's claims are rendered inadmissible before this Tribunal and the exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in the Contract has to be executed. Respondent points out that all of CIOC's claims are contractual in nature and as such a waiver is enforceable as a matter of international law.\n\n190.\n\nRespondent strongly denies that Claimant has any rights under the BIT in this dispute. However, even if CIOC had brought claims under the BIT, these can no longer be entertained by this Tribunal.\n\n**H.III. Contentions Regarding Liability**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**H.III.1. Summary of Contentions by Claimant**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nA more detailed presentation of Claimant's contentions regarding liability can be found in Claimant's Request for Arbitration (C-I, paras. 43-53), Claimant's Memorial of 14 May 2009 (C-IV, paras. 156-238), and Claimant's Reply Memorial of 30 July 2010 (C-V, paras. 203-291).\n\n192.\n\nClaimant holds that Respondent breached numerous obligations both under the Contract as well as under the BIT. With regard to the Contract, Claimant purports that Respondent violated the terms of Contract through the unilateral termination without cause, contrary to the provisions of the Contract. In addition, Respondent allegedly violated several obligations under the BIT.\n\n193.\n\nClaimant affirms that Respondent failed to accord at all times fair and equitable treatment to its investment. In particular, Claimant upholds that Respondent failed to provide a stable legal and business framework. Further, Claimant asserts that Respondent did not act in good faith respecting the legitimate expectations of CIOC. Moreover, Respondent did not act in accordance with due process and procedural propriety nor did it act in a consistent, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.\n\n194.\n\nMoreover, Respondent allegedly violated its obligation to grant full protection and security to CIOC's investment by failing to protect CIOC and its owners, senior management and employees from harassment and legal and physical abuse such as illegal detentions, interrogations, raids, searches, false allegations of criminal conduct, attempted extortions, and threats to personal safety.\n\n195.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent further impaired CIOC's investment by unlawfully terminating Contract No. 954. Claimant purports that this constitutes an unreasonable or discriminatory measure for the purposes of the BIT.\n\n196.\n\nIn Claimant's view, Respondent expropriated CIOC of all or substantially all of its investments without complying with any conditions that would render such an expropriation lawful. Respondent neither acted for a legitimate public purpose, nor did it act on a non-discriminatory basis or pay a prompt, adequate and effective compensation. In particular, CIOC was deprived of its long-term rights under the Contract to further explore and commercially develop hydrocarbons.\n\n197.\n\nClaimant further alleges that Respondent failed to comply with obligations it has entered into with regard to Claimant's investment, especially with its obligations assumed under the Contract. According to Claimant, these breaches of the Contract are transformed into violations of the BIT and thus constitute direct breaches of the BIT's so called umbrella clause.\n\n198.\n\nIn addition, Claimant argues that Respondent accorded CIOC's investment treatment less than that required by international law and thus also violated the minimum standard of treatment in international law.\n\n199.\n\nAt the Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Claimant withdrew all documents which were challenged by Respondent (C-162, C-175, C-238, C-239, C-240, Aliyev 25) to avoid any controversy even though in Claimant's view \" *no real record was developed to allow issues of authenticity and provenance to be resolved* \", also in light of the fact that Respondent did not interrogate Dr Aliyev on the subject and likewise did not present witnesses which were asserted to have provided some of the documents. Claimant therefore holds that it will not, does not, and need not rely on these documents to make its case and that they should have no bearing on its credibility or the outcome of the Award. (C-VI, paras. 144-145)\n\n**H.III.2. Summary of Contentions by Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nRespondent's contentions on liability issues are covered in more detail in Respondent's Counter-Memorial of 22 December 2009 (R-III, paras. 79-347) and Respondent's Rejoinder of 14 December 2010 (R-IV, paras. 70-409).\n\n201.\n\nWith regard to a breach of the so-called umbrella clause which obliges Respondent to observe the obligations it has entered into with regard to investments, Respondent emphasises that at no point it has breached Contract No. 954 by any means.\n\n202.\n\nEven if this were the case, Respondent observes that the umbrella clause cannot cure deficits with regard to jurisdiction and admissibility. In particular, Respondent points out that this clause does not transform CIOC's contract claims into treaty claims and that Claimant thus cannot circumvent its contractual obligations by invoking the umbrella clause. Moreover, Respondent affirms that even if the umbrella clause could transform some of Claimant's contract claims into treaty claims, they would be inadmissible.\n\n203.\n\nIn addition, Respondent notes that it has not expropriated any property from CIOC and CIOC has failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to its alleged expropriation. In particular, in Respondent's opinion Claimant has failed to show that it owned production rights under the Contract of which it could have been expropriated. Respondent further asserts that it exercised its rights under the Contract like any other party would have done in a similar situation and thus did nothing more than what it was legitimately entitled to.\n\n204.\n\nRespondent also purports that it accorded CIOC fair and equitable treatment by providing a stable legal framework, fulfilling CIOC's legitimate expectations and adhering to the standards of transparency, due process and non-discrimination. Respondent argues that all it did was to exercise its rights under the Contract and enforce its regulations. In Respondent's opinion, Claimant has failed to prove otherwise and thus CIOC has not met its burden of proof concerning a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n205.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent holds that it fulfilled its duty to provide full protection and security to CIOC at all times. Acts taken in the exercise of legitimate state powers cannot form the basis for a claim to having violated the standard of full protection and security. Also, Respondent purports that this obligation does not include a duty to provide legal protection. Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimant once again failed to meet its burden of proof regarding a breach of full protection and security.\n\n206.\n\nLastly, Respondent contests that it acted in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner. On the contrary, Respondent claims that the measures taken were based on a rational policy, addressing a matter of public interest and were supported by logic and good sense.\n\n207.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent further sets out that no harassment of CIOC took place at any time. Moreover, Respondent purports that certain documents (C-162, C-175, C-238, C-239, C-240, Aliyev 25) brought forward by Claimant in the attempt to prove the allegations of harassment are \" *almost certainly forged* \". (R-IV, para. 332)\n\n**H.IV.Contentions Regarding Damages and Quantum**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**H.IV.1. Summary of Contentions by Claimant**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nA more comprehensive coverage of Claimant's contentions regarding damages and quantum can be found in Claimant\u2019s Memorial of 14 May 2009 (C-IV, paras. 239-284) and Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial of 30 July 2010 (C-V, paras. 292-376).\n\n209.\n\nClaimant holds that Respondent is internationally responsible for the violations of the Treaty as has been codified in the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n210.\n\nWith regard to the asserted expropriation, Claimant opines that should the Tribunal fail to conclude that the expropriation was unlawful, CIOC should be entitled to compensation for a lawful compensation. The standard for compensation is to be taken from the BIT which specifies that the compensation should be equivalent to the fair market value.\n\n211.\n\nIf, however, the Tribunal determines that the expropriation was in fact unlawful, Claimant is purportedly entitled to damages. Claimant points out that the measure for damages can be higher than compensation in a case of a lawful expropriation.\n\n212.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant asserts that it is entitled to moral damages due to the internationally wrongful acts caused by Respondent. Moreover, Claimant underscores that this entitlement is not affected by the fact that the claim is brought by a juridical person, namely CIOC. Claimant observes that moral damages can be awarded to both juridical and natural persons.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant also affirms that Respondent is liable for breaches of the Contract, especially for the wrongful termination. Accordingly, Claimant is entitled to compensation for damages under Kazakh law which suffered as a result of the wrongful termination. Claimant notices that the alternative remedy of restoration of the Contract is not possible in the present case.\n\n214.\n\nWith regard to the appropriate valuation methodology, Claimant affirms that all compensation and damages should be calculated using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis. Claimant purports that this method is the most reliable to value the investment that had been expropriated by Respondent.\n\n215.\n\nClaimant further requests relief for moral damages as the Tribunal considers reasonable in the circumstances, taking into account the damage done to CIOC, its management, its majority owner and its employees as well as the malicious nature of Respondent's conduct.\n\n216.\n\nLastly, Claimant substantiates its entitlement to compound interest.\n\n**H.IV.2. Summary of Contentions by Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nA more detailed presentation of Respondent's contentions regarding damages and quantum can be found in Respondent's Counter-Memorial of 22 December 2009 (R-III, paras. 348-467) and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder of 14 December 2010 (R-IV, paras. 410647).\n\n218.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimant is not entitled to lost profits. This would only have been the case if CIOC had made and declared a commercial discovery in the first place. Claimant\u2019s entitlement to commercial production was conditioned upon making a commercial discovery. However, Claimant only brought a certificate of reserves. Respondent opines that this does not constitute a declaration of a commercial discovery, especially in view of the fact that the certificate was not obtained from the competent authority.\n\n219.\n\nFurthermore, any allegedly lost profits would have been highly speculative and uncertain and thus lack reasonable certainty; Respondent also points out that Claimant would not be entitled to future lost profits when applying the so-called Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method on which Claimant based all its calculations regarding damages.\n\n220.\n\nRespondent asserts that the appropriate valuation methodology is to apply the Updated Investment Value rather than the DCF method preferred by Claimant which, on top of being the inappropriate method as such, is also erroneous as applied by Claimant.\n\n221.\n\nRespondent denies that CIOC has suffered any moral damages and is thus not entitled to the latter. Respondent claims that such extraordinary relief can only be granted for substantial harm and injury which amounts to egregious conduct. However, in Respondent\u2019s opinion such acts did not occur.\n\n222.\n\nWith regard to interest, Respondent emphasises that merely simple interest should be paid, the measure being a commercially reasonable interest rate. Also, interest payment should be calculated not earlier as of 31 January 2008.\n\n**I. Analysis by the Tribunal - Preliminary Matters**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.I. Applicable Law**\n-----------------------\n\n**I.I.1. Positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nClaimant holds that the law applicable to its claims for breaches of the BIT is public international law since Claimant accepted Respondent's offer to arbitrate disputes arising under the BIT. Claimant further purports that this is necessarily so because its claims relate to the interpretation and application of provisions in a treaty. (C-IV, para. 157)\n\n224.\n\nWith regard to the substantive law applicable to the investment agreement and related agreements concluded on its basis, both Parties refer to Clause 26.1 of the Contract which reads (C-IV, para. 158; R-III, para. 61, note 57):\n\n*\"This Contract and other agreements signed on the basis of this Contract, shall be governed by the law of the State unless stated otherwise by the international treaties to which the State is a party.\"*\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, Claimant asserts that to the extent that its claims require the interpretation of the Contract, said Contract would be interpreted in accordance with the applicable contract law without prejudice to the pertaining BIT claim. (C-V, para. 201) Respondent asserts that in the case at hand, breaches of contract remain an issue of private law since Respondent acted in its capacity as a private party. Therefore public international law is not applicable to the Contract. (R-V, para. 144) Claimant stresses in particular that Article 70 of the Subsoil Law is applicable in its version before December 2004, in accordance with the stability clause as provided by Clause 28 of the Contract. (cf. e.g. C-V, para. 110, note 212) Respondent counters that Article 70 of the Subsoil Law in either version is irrelevant since Respondent merely exercised its right of termination under Clause 29.6 of the Contract.\n\n226.\n\nOverall, Claimant thus argues that international law, including customary international law and the BIT itself, and Kazakh law are applicable to the dispute. (cf. C-I, para. 83; CIV, para. 180) Without elaborating on its applicability, Respondent concedes that international law is applicable to the dispute, e.g. by relying on principles of public international law in its argument, such as the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and the Draft Articles on State Responsibility of the International Law Commission. (cf. e.g. R-IV, paras. 7 *et seq.*)\n\n**I.I.2. The Tribunal**\n-----------------------\n\n227.\n\nThere does not seem to be a dispute between the Parties regarding the applicable procedural and substantive law.\n\n228.\n\nRegarding the procedural rules to be applied by the Tribunal, the Parties have agreed that the ICSID Arbitration Rules as amended and effective on 10 April 2006, shall apply to the proceedings as has been recorded in paragraph I.5. of the Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n229.\n\nFurthermore, the Parties have agreed on Frankfurt, Germany, as the place of proceeding according to paragraph I.6. of the Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n230.\n\nRegarding substantive law, according to Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law of Kazakhstan and of such rules of international law as may be applicable. The latter particularly include the BIT, the VCLT, and rules of customary international law.\n\n**I.II. Treaty Interpretation and Relevance of Decisions of other Courts and Tribunals**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions, the Parties rely on numerous decisions of other courts and tribunals. Accordingly, it is appropriate for the Tribunal to make certain general preliminary observations in this regard.\n\n232.\n\nFirst of all, the Tribunal considers it useful to make clear from the outset that it regards its task in these proceedings as the very specific one of applying the relevant provisions of the BIT as far as necessary in order to decide on the relief sought by the Parties. In order to do so, the Tribunal must, as required by the \"General rule of interpretation\" of Article 31 of the VCLT, interpret the BIT's provisions in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to them in their context and in light of the BIT's object and purpose. The \"context\" referred to in the first paragraph of Article 31 is given a specific definition in the second paragraph of Article 31 and comprises three elements: (i) the BIT's text, including its preamble; (ii) any agreement between the parties to the BIT in connection with its conclusion; and (iii) any instrument which was made by one of the parties to the BIT in connection with its conclusion and accepted by the other party to the BIT. The \"ordinary meaning\" as defined above applies unless a special meaning is to be given to a term if it is established that the parties to the BIT so intended, as it is stated in the fourth paragraph of Article 31.\n\n233.\n\nAs provided in the \"Supplementary means of interpretation\" of Article 32 of the VCLT, the Tribunal may have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation (i) in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the VCLT, or (ii) when the interpretation according to Article 31 of the VCLT either leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Those supplementary means of interpretation include the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion. Thus, recourse to the supplementary means of interpretation of Article 32 may only be had if the situations mentioned at (i) and (ii) above occur.\n\n234.\n\nIt is not evident whether and if so to what extent arbitral awards are of relevance to the Tribunal's task. It is in any event clear that the decisions of other tribunals are not binding on this Tribunal. The many references by the Parties to certain arbitral decisions in their pleadings do not contradict this conclusion.\n\n235.\n\nHowever, this does not preclude the Tribunal from considering arbitral decisions, and the arguments of the Parties based upon them, to the extent that it may find that they shed any useful light on the issues that arise for decision in this case.\n\n236.\n\nSuch an examination is conducted by the Tribunal later in this Award, after the Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 contentions and arguments regarding the various issues argued and relevant for the interpretation of the applicable BIT provisions, while taking into account the above-mentioned specificity of the BIT to be applied in the present case.\n\n**I.III. Procedural Issues regarding Late Submissions of Documents**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nCertain issues regarding the late submission of documents were highly disputed between the Parties before and during the hearing.\n\n**I.III.1. Claimant's Perspective**\n-----------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nBy letter of 12 January 2011, Claimant submitted exhibits C-180 to C-298 in rebuttal to Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder of 14 December 2010. Claimant stated that some of the exhibits had only been provided to Claimant\u2019s counsel \" *in the last few days* \" and that therefore, some exhibits had not been translated yet. However, Claimant noted that since most of these documents were in Respondent\u2019s official language Russian, this would not cause any undue inconvenience.\n\n239.\n\nClaimant submitted an additional exhibit (C-299) on 13 January 2011 asserting that this exhibit had just been received and was filed in rebuttal to the allegation of forgery as set out in Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n240.\n\nClaimant provided three more partly untranslated exhibits to the Tribunal on 14 January 2011 (C-300 to C-302), purportedly rebutting allegations concerning the relationship between JOR and CIOC. Claimant further conceded that these exhibits had inadvertently not been produced due to a production error in Claimant\u2019s office. However, Claimant also observed that since these exhibits were official documents of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the submission of these exhibits should not be of any inconvenience to Respondent seeing that they should already be in Respondent\u2019s possession.\n\n241.\n\nIn a further letter dated 18 January 2011, Claimant sought the Tribunal\u2019s authorisation to submit four more exhibits (C-303 to C-306) which were attached to the letter. In support of its case, Claimant argued that the documents were \" *offered solely in the nature of rebuttal evidence* \" to Respondent\u2019s allegations of forgery and that Mr Aliyev, Claimant\u2019s witness, had made an effort to obtain these documents before the expiration of the 12 January 2011 deadline. However, Claimant pointed out that due to the sensitive nature of the exhibits at issue it had not been easy to access these documents \" *by someone who is under constant threat of physical harm, and must regularly move his residence (and keep his whereabouts confidential)* \" for protection. Lastly, Claimant underscored that it had tried to obtain Respondent\u2019s consent to submit these documents at this point of the proceedings which however, had been declined.\n\n242.\n\nBy letter of 19 January 2011, Claimant addressed Respondent's request of 17 January 2011 to the Tribunal to exclude the exhibits submitted by Claimant between 12 and 14 January 2011 and requested that Respondent's motion should be rejected.\n\n243.\n\nClaimant purported that Respondent complained about the number of documents, the language they were in, their date, the date on which the exhibits were physically received and the fact that they were not accompanied by a written submission. Assertedly for these reasons the only way to protect Respondent's right of defence was to strike Claimant's new exhibits from the record. However, Claimant emphasised that out of the 123 new exhibits only 27 were such that Respondent could not have seen or noticed them previously.\n\n244.\n\nWith regard to the language of the submitted documents, Claimant pointed out that it did not receive Respondent's exhibits to its Rejoinder until 21 December 2010, thus seven days after the deadline for the Rejoinder and that Claimant then had a mere fourteen business days to submit exhibits in rebuttal of the rejoinder. Claimant thus held that it was to be excused for not providing translations of the submitted exhibits immediately. Claimant further drew support for its argument from the fact that translations were to be provided as soon as \" *practicable* \" and moreover, from the fact that virtually all untranslated exhibits were in Russian, an official language of Respondent which was also spoken by Respondent's counsel and Respondent's governmental representatives. Finally, Claimant put forward that nothing in Paragraph 7.1 of the Minutes of the First Session suggested that a timely submission of exhibits was prevented by not providing a corresponding English translation instantaneously.\n\n245.\n\nIn addition, Claimant expressed its astonishment with regard to Respondent's allegations of forgery of certain documents produced by Claimant and especially the fact that Respondent waited for almost five months before making its allegations while it had purportedly been in possession of said documents since early August 2010.\n\n246.\n\nRegarding the date of the documents submitted, Claimant held that it was \" *simply absurd* \" that no documents could be produced that pre-dated its Reply Memorial. Rather, Claimant contended that documents could be brought forward regardless of their date as long as they were in rebuttal of issues discussed in Respondent's Rejoinder. Claimant further noted that Respondent itself on 17 January 2011 had produced exhibits in rebuttal which dated e.g. from 2002 and that it was thereby contradicting its own argument.\n\n247.\n\nWith regard to the physical receipt of the rebuttal exhibits, Claimant asserted that it had offered Respondent shipping options in order for Respondent to receive the exhibits \" *as soon as can be arranged* \" and that out of these options Respondent had accepted to pick up a flash drive at 10.30 a.m. on 13 January 2011 from Claimant's counsel's London office without contradiction. Therefore, Respondent could not legitimately hold this against Claimant now.\n\n248.\n\nIn its letter, Claimant further confirmed that all exhibits filed from 12 January 2011 were in rebuttal to matters raised in Respondent's Rejoinder and that when Claimant did not provide a written submission accompanying these exhibits, it acted in strict compliance with the Minutes of the First Session as well as with the Tribunal's Procedural Orders No. 5 and No. 6. Claimant further mentioned several examples of exhibits which were in direct rebuttal to matters raised in Respondent's Rejoinder.\n\n249.\n\nLastly, Claimant purported that \" *Respondent's theory that it will not have a sufficient opportunity to respond to Claimant's rebuttal exhibits is flawed*.\" Claimant underscored that Respondent had been aware for some time that it would have five days to make submissions in rebuttal to Claimant\u2019s exhibits, that it could submit further exhibits if it showed the Tribunal \" *good cause* \" and that Respondent had weeks and months to comment on Claimant\u2019s exhibits at the hearing in Paris as well as in post-hearing briefs.\n\n250.\n\nIn its letter of 19 January 2011, Claimant also requested that the exhibits submitted on 18 January 2011 as well as exhibits C-307 and C-308 should be admitted into the record.\n\n**I.III.2. Respondent's Perspective**\n-------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn a letter of 29 December 2010, Respondent objected to Claimant\u2019s intent to file new exhibits in response to Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder of 14 December 2011. Respondent relied on paragraphs 14.14 and 15.1 of the Minutes of the First Session to emphasise that new evidence can only be submitted upon consent of the Parties or express authorisation of the Tribunal and moreover, that any new and material evidence or new facts come to the knowledge of a Party or arisen since the date of a witness\u2019s or expert\u2019s last signed statement, may be addressed in writing to the Tribunal with a subsequent opportunity for the other Party to provide comments. Further, should such evidence be admitted, the other Party will be granted an opportunity to submit evidence, witness statements and expert statements in rebuttal. According to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s \" *unilateral and unauthorized filing of new exhibits* \" was thus seeking to bypass the procedural rules agreed upon previously.\n\n252.\n\nRespondent further held that Claimant had already breached these rules when filing the witness statement of Mr Fadi Hussein on 13 December 2010 \" *along with many other exhibits* \" without obtaining prior authorisation of the Tribunal, and Respondent had requested to exclude and reject these exhibits from the record by letter of 22 December 2010. Respondent also contended that it was impossible to reply in rebuttal to these exhibits within the time available.\n\n253.\n\nBy letter of 17 January 2011, Respondent requested the Tribunal to exclude the exhibits submitted by Claimant on 13-14 January 2011 (C-299 to C-302). Alternatively, should these exhibits not be stricken from the record, Respondent noted it \" *must regretfully state that it has no choice but to reserve all of its rights* \". Respondent reiterated its request to strike Claimants exhibits from the record in its letter of 23 January 2011, claiming that their admissibility would violate the basic principles of fundamental fairness and due process.\n\n254.\n\nRespondent complained that Claimant had not met its 12 January 2011 deadline for submission of new documents and that, on top of that Claimant\u2019s exhibits were not accompanied by Claimant\u2019s letter, but rather that Respondent had been invited to pick up the exhibits at issue itself at the London office of Counsel for Claimant on 13 January 2011\n\n255.\n\nIn further support of its argument, Respondent emphasised that 102 of the 119 exhibits (C-180 to C-298) had never been submitted before. Furthermore, Claimant filed another four exhibits on 13 and 14 January 2011 (C-299 to C-302), which Respondent could not adequately rebut, given that Claimant had filed 575 pages of new documents, more than 150 pages of which were not in English and had come untranslated. This, Respondent alleged, was in violation of Paragraph 7.1 of the Minutes of the First Session. This was particularly true, in Respondent's view, given the short amount of time. Respondent pointed out that it only had five days until 17 January 2011, including two non-working days in Kazakhstan, to produce documents in rebuttal of Claimant's exhibits. Respondent contended that this constituted a violation of fundamental fairness and due process.\n\n256.\n\nMoreover, Respondent purported that Claimant had infringed the spirit of Paragraph 15.1 of the Minutes of the First Session that all evidence is to be submitted together with the written submissions. However, according to Respondent, Claimant did not indicate which arguments the exhibits were trying to rebut and by doing so Claimant had robbed Respondent of a proper opportunity to reply to Claimant's arguments. Respondent gave several examples of documents which could easily have been submitted with Claimant's Reply Memorial and asserted that Claimant had failed to explain why it had not done so.\n\n257.\n\nRespondent's position can best be summarised by citing the following passage from its letter of 17 January 2011 (p. 2):\n\n*\"In light of the quantity of new documents and untranslated documents, it is physically impossible for Counsel for the Republic to translate, study, guess which of the Republic's arguments CIOC's new exhibits are supposed to rebut, discuss them with representatives of the Republic and then search for, translate, if necessary, and submit by January 17 a full set of new exhibits in response to CIOC's January 13-14 filings.\"*\n\n258.\n\nRespondent alleged that Claimant had filed certain documents which purportedly contained a large number of unsubstantiated allegations, on the day before the filing date of Respondent's Rejoinder to ensure that these documents could not be replied to in the Rejoinder.\n\n259.\n\nRespondent also commented on the asserted inadmissibility of Mr Harvey Jackson's witness statement. As Mr Jackson's witness statement had been withdrawn on 12 August 2010 at the request of Mr Jackson's employer at the time, Merrill Lynch, Respondent \" *did* *not look for a corresponding witness to reply to him and did not deal with his withdrawn witness statement in the Rejoinder* \". By submitting Mr Jackson's witness statement back on the record, Claimant had thus eliminated Respondent's possibility to reply adequately to the witness statement. Consequently, Respondent requested that Mr Jackson's witness statement be stricken from the record and that additionally, Mr Jackson be excluded from testifying at the hearing. Respondent reiterated its objections concerning Mr Jackson's witness statement in its letter to the Tribunal of 23 January 2011.\n\n260.\n\nRespondent further noted in its letter of 23 January 2011 that to this date it had not received the English translations of the newly filed exhibits on 13 January and thereafter. In addition, Respondent pointed out that according to Section 5.1 of Procedural Order No. 2 the Parties were invited to produce documents which were not in English to the other Party together with an unofficial English translation and that Section 7.1 of the Minutes of the First Session provided that the procedural language shall be English.\n\n261.\n\nWith regard to the date on which Claimant had received the Rejoinder, Respondent pointed out that the 12 January 2011 deadline for Claimant's new exhibits had been set after the receipt of the Rejoinder and that the delays in December had been caused by Claimant\u2019s submission of 13 December 2010, which had disrupted Respondent in finalising its Rejoinder.\n\n262.\n\nRespondent further held that it was perfectly entitled to raise the allegations of forgery made in two of its exhibits for the first time together with its Rejoinder, as it constituted a written submission under Section 15.1 of the Minutes of the First Session.\n\n263.\n\nMoreover, Respondent reproached that Claimant had still failed to fully explain or indicate which of Respondent\u2019s arguments it was trying to rebut in submitting Claimant\u2019s exhibits and thus continued \" *to deprive the Republic of its right to know the underlying explanations* \" (p. 11, para. 6) and by doing so violated the principles of fairness and due process. In Respondent\u2019s view, this also held true for recent exhibits filed on 18 January 2011 (C-303 to C-306) and thus Respondent requested that all of Claimant\u2019s exhibits should be stricken from the record, in particular the exhibits submitted by Claimant on 18 January 2011.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent also noted that Claimant had requested to be provided with a \" *live internet connection, including to Caratube International Oil Company 's website* \". As Claimant had not provided any explanation as to why it required such a connection, Respondent objected to the request in so far as the connection should serve to present new documents or to make the hearing available through the website (Respondent\u2019s letter of 23 January 2011, p. 10).\n\n**I.III.3. The Tribunal**\n-------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe relevant passage from the letter of 24 January 2011 by the Tribunal as conveyed to the Parties by ICSID is recalled:\n\n*\"1. The Tribunal has carefully considered the many recent submissions by the Parties regarding the preparation and conduct of the Hearing in Paris. In view of the many issues addressed and in order to give the Parties guidance for their preparation of the Hearing without further delay within the very short time available up to the Hearing, and in order to avoid longer time that would be needed for the members of the Tribunal, who also have mandatory commitments in other cases during that period, to elaborate and agree on a longer text defining in detail the considerations and reasons of the Tribunal, the Tribunal has decided to hereby inform the Parties of its following preliminary rulings.*\n\n*2. Documents Submitted by the Parties*\n\n*2.1. The Tribunal appreciates the submissions of the Parties indicating that and why certain documents recently submitted by the Parties should or should not be admitted. However, the Tribunal considers it as important that, at the final hearing of this case, all documents that the Parties consider as relevant, can be considered and discussed.*\n\n*2.2. Therefore, the Tribunal provisionally admits all documents submitted [by] the Parties up to now, and the two letters submitted by Mr. Rashid Farah forwarded to the Parties by the Tribunal's Secretary at ICSID by e-mail of 19 January 2011.*\n\n*2.3. At the Hearing, the Parties should be prepared to comment on all new documents, may refer to and rely on these documents (provided they are in English or translated into English), may explain why they consider them admissible or inadmissible beyond what they have already argued in their written submissions, and may request to further discuss these documents in their post-hearing submissions.*\n\n*2.4. Any further submissions by the Parties have to be made, as is the general rule in ICSID proceedings, to ICSID without any copies sent directly to members of the Tribunal.*\n\n*2.5. Taking all these presentations of the Parties into account, the Tribunal will then decide on the final admissibility of documents it considers it[sic] relevant for its decisions and whether it can rely on such document for its decision.\"*\n\n266.\n\nRegarding the admission of new documents, the Tribunal recalls the following passage from the Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 9 February 2011 (Tr, day 3, p. 6-7):\n\n*\"THE PRESIDENT: [...] Perhaps I should first define what we call new documents.*\n\n*New documents from our side are all documents submitted on 13th December or later, except the documents submitted with the rejoinder. [\u2026]*\n\n*Now regarding these new documents, our ruling is the following:*\n\n*1. The Tribunal recalls its rulings in the minutes of the first session, paragraph 14.14, in Procedural Order No. 5, paragraph 3.6, in Procedural Order No. 6, paragraph B4, and in our letter of 24th January, section 2.*\n\n*2. On that basis, the further procedure during this hearing shall be as follows:*\n\n*(a) If a party wishes to rely on a new document, in the definition that I gave you, it shall identify the document and give the reasons why the Tribunal should admit the document.*\n\n*(b) The other party will be heard in this regard.*\n\n*(c) Then the Tribunal will decide on a document by document basis on the request.\"*\n\n**I.IV. Procedural Issues regarding the Attendance of Persons andExamination of Witnesses at the Hearing**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nCertain issues regarding the attendance of persons and the examination of witnesses at the hearing were highly disputed between the Parties before and during the hearing.\n\n**I.IV.1. Claimant's Perspective**\n----------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nBy letter dated 10 November 2010, Claimant submitted its Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent, petitioning that Respondent make available five individuals for the hearing in Paris in February 2011. Claimant asserted that none of these witnesses would appear voluntarily at Claimant's request. Claimant further explained that each of these persons could provide relevant and material testimony to the dispute.\n\n269.\n\nClaimant also noted that the Tribunal had the authority to require the production of witnesses under the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and according to the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration. Furthermore, Claimant argued that its request was supported by the practice of ICSID Tribunals.\n\n270.\n\nClaimant then substantiated why the testimonies of Ms Dariga Nursultanovna Nazarbayeva, Mr Aglan Espullayevich Musin, Mr Kanat Saudabayev, Mr Alexander Mirtchev, and Mr Timur Kulibayev were crucial to the proceedings and acknowledged that these persons would be subject to immunity as granted under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention as stated in a previous Procedural Order of the Tribunal.\n\n271.\n\nBy letter of 22 December 2010, Claimant submitted its list of witnesses it wished to examine at the hearing in February 2011, a total of 14 witnesses for direct and 17 witnesses for cross-examination. With its submission, Claimant filed the witness statement of Mr Harvey Jackson, who was no longer employed by Merrill Lynch and was now ready to testify at the hearing.\n\n272.\n\nClaimant also explained why in its opinion the testimony of certain persons under the control of Respondent as stated in its request of 10 November 2010, was crucial to the dispute. Moreover, Claimant added Ambassador Yerzhan Kazykhanov to its pending request of 10 November 2010.\n\n273.\n\nOn 23 December 2010, Claimant requested two more witnesses for cross-examination, Ambassador Idrisov and Mr Kasymbekov, to testify at the hearing in February 2011, on account of Respondent relying on letters of these persons rather than witness statements in trying to prove its allegations of forgery.\n\n274.\n\nOn 17 January 2011, Claimant submitted its list of attendees for the hearing in Paris. Claimant furthermore informed the Tribunal that in view of Respondent's abbreviated witness list, Claimant no longer intended to call six of the witnesses from the list submitted on 22 December 2010, among them Mr Harvey Jackson.\n\n275.\n\nIn its letter of 19 January 2011, Claimant notified the Tribunal that Mr Fadi Hussein and his family had purportedly been threatened by agents of Respondent and that Mr Hussein thus refused to testify at the hearing. Claimant requested that in light of the circumstances that led to Mr Hussein's non-appearance at the hearing, his witness statement remain on the record.\n\n276.\n\nWith regard to Mr Kassem Omar, Claimant pointed out that according to Paragraph 1.3 of PO-5 the Parties were permitted to notify the Tribunal by 17 January 2011 if they did not intend to examine any of the witnesses so far notified. Claimant emphasised that this provision only allowed for the dropping of a witness that had originally been required for examination, however, that it did not entail that a witness could be added who had previously not been notified for examination. As Mr Omar had not been on Respondent\u2019s list of witnesses of 22 December 2010, and Claimant had subsequently decided not to call him either, Mr Omar upon notification of this decision, had made other plans and was thus no longer available. Claimant requested the Tribunal to confirm that no witnesses could be added to the original list of 22 December 2010.\n\n277.\n\nRegarding the witness statement of Mr Harvey Jackson, Claimant contended that it had been admitted to the record in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 4 January 2011 according to Section B.4 of PO-6.\n\n278.\n\nClaimant further notified the Tribunal of its decision not to call Mr Mangat Thapar, the reason being that his interpretation of Claimant\u2019s 3D survey was \" *utterly irrelevant* \" to the decisive matters in dispute. Also, Claimant noted that it would be obviously unfair to pair its industry expert Mr Tiefenthal with two experts for Expert Conferencing as had been suggested by Respondent (Claimant\u2019s Letter of 19 January 2011, p. 10). Moreover, Claimant asserted that Mr Thapar\u2019s expertise as geophysicist was different from the expertise of its own expert witnesses and not conducive to Expert Conferencing. Claimant thus requested Mr Thapar to be limited to ten minutes of direct examination by Respondent.\n\n279.\n\nWith regard to Expert Conferencing, Claimant further requested the Tribunal to grant its experts a period on rebuttal only before starting Expert Conferencing. In addition, Claimant provided the order in which it would conduct direct examination of its witnesses and presented its proposal for Expert Conferencing.\n\n280.\n\nFinally, Claimant added Dr Otto Dietrich, Counsel to Dr Rakhat Aliyev, to the list of attendees for the days on which Dr Aliyev would testify.\n\n281.\n\nBy letter of 24 January 2011, Claimant replied to Respondent\u2019s letter of 23 January 2011. In particular, Claimant underscored that neither Rule 32(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules nor any other rule entitled a party to require evidence from the opposing party to justify its selection of hearing attendees on its behalf. This held true even more so as none of the three individuals to which Respondent had objected were witnesses in the proceedings. \" *Rather, they have been designated as agents of Claimant solely for the purpose of attending the hearing.* \" (p. 1, section 1). Thus, in Claimant\u2019s opinion, Respondent had failed to provide any reason that would prevent these persons from attending the hearing, and had also failed to explain why these persons would have to be \" *true corporate representatives* \" (Respondent\u2019s letter of 23 January 2011, p. 10).\n\n282.\n\nClaimant further explained that Dr Dietrich\u2019s presence at the hearing was important in light of proceedings brought by Respondent in Austrian courts against Dr Aliyev in which Respondent seeks Dr Aliyev\u2019s extradition to Kazakhstan. Dr Dietrich serves as counsel for Dr Aliyev\u2019s in these proceedings.\n\n283.\n\nMr Didier Bollecker and Ms Eve-Marine Bollecker of CAAvocats represent Dr Aliyev advising him on matters of safety, including immunity protection under the ICSID Convention, Dr Aliyev\u2019s travels to France as well as handling INTERPOL red bulletins and procedural and substantial matters arising under French law in this regard. Claimant thus held that their presence was crucial for Dr Aliyev\u2019s personal safety.\n\n284.\n\nLastly, Claimant added Mr Benjamin Folkinshteyn of Crowell and Moring LLP to the list of hearing attendees.\n\n**I.IV.2. Respondent's Perspective**\n------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nIn its Response to CIOC's Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent of December 15, 2010, Respondent requested that Claimant's petition be denied.\n\n286.\n\nAlthough Respondent conceded that the Tribunal would have the authority to request the production of certain witnesses, Respondent emphasised that this was only the case if the testimony at issue was relevant and material for the outcome of the dispute. In Respondent's opinion, the witnesses in question would neither serve to clarify the facts of the case as Claimant itself had stated that it had already \" *submitted numerous witness statements by individuals with first-hand knowledge* \" of the relationships fundamental to the dispute and how it affected Claimant's investment (Claimant's Request, para. 20), nor would their testimonies be relevant and material to the dispute since the request for their examination was based on forged or almost certainly forged documents which would in consequence be inadmissible.\n\n287.\n\nRelying on Article 9.2(g) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, Respondent also pointed out that a Tribunal may decline to consider evidence in view of fairness or equality (Respondent's Response, para. 22).\n\n288.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent submitted that Claimant's Request was to be rejected also on the ground of having been made in an untimely manner. In support of its argument, Respondent drew upon Claimant's late submission of the Oligarchs Report which had been available to Claimant for several months and its late request of individuals to appear as witnesses, whose purported involvement in the dispute had been known for some time, in case of Ms Dariga Nazerbaeva from the beginning of these proceedings and in case of Mr Kanat Saudabaev from at least January 2010.\n\n289.\n\nOn 22 December 2010, Respondent filed a list of the witnesses and experts whom Respondent wished to examine at the hearing in direct or cross-examination.\n\n290.\n\nBy letter of 17 January 2010, Respondent provided the Tribunal with a list of the witnesses and experts whose presence they would provide for at the hearing, the order in which they intended to conduct their examination, the persons attending the hearing on their side, notifications on the witnesses they did not intend to examine, the witnesses and experts who would require interpretation from and to English, the experts that should be examined together by Expert Conferencing and issues that should be raised by each group of experts during Expert Conferencing.\n\n291.\n\nRespondent had added three additional witnesses, namely Ambassador Erlan Idrissov, Ambassador Yerzhan Kazykhanov, and Mr Sanat Isayev. Respondent further pointed out that it would not make available any of the five witnesses requested by Claimant in its motion of 10 November 2010 for the reasons stated in Respondent's Response to CIOC's Request to Examine Witnesses Under the Control of Respondent. In addition, Respondent explained that it would not present Major General Sergey Kuzmenko, Mr Adil Abenov, Mr Serik Burkitbayev, and Mr Murat Musabekov as these persons were currently serving in prison and could not be released. Moreover, Respondent held that Claimant had failed to prove that any of these persons were in any way related to the documents in dispute. Further, Respondent noted that Mr Makhmud Bazarkulovich Kasymbekov would not serve as witness at the hearing due to his unavailability.\n\n292.\n\nIn another letter of 17 January 2011 dealing mainly with Claimant's submissions of exhibits on 13-14 January 2011, Respondent also commented on the inadmissibility of Mr Harvey Jackson as witness in the upcoming hearing. Since Respondent did not have an opportunity to deal with and reply adequately to Mr Jackson's witness statement, Respondent requested that Mr Jackson's witness statement be stricken from the record and that additionally, Mr Jackson be excluded from testifying at the hearing.\n\n293.\n\nBy letter of 23 January 2011, Respondent submitted comments on Claimant's letters of 17-19 January 2011, *inter alia* on issues regarding witnesses, experts and Expert Conferencing as well as on the hearing attendees and logistical requirements.\n\n294.\n\nWith regard to Dr Mangat Thapar, Respondent strongly objected to Claimant's request to limit Dr Thapar's testimony to ten minutes of direct examination. This would not only be in breach of the Party agreement to conduct Expert Conferencing for industry experts (cf. Respondent's letter of 22 December 2010 providing comments on PO-5, including agreed points between the Parties), but also run counter to Section 3.2.5 of PO-5 which provided for the examination of industry experts by the method of Expert Conferencing. Respondent thus held that it was entitled to Dr Thapar being examined by Expert Conferencing and that otherwise Respondent would be deprived of its right to be heard on crucial subjects in dispute.\n\n295.\n\nMoreover, according to Respondent, Claimant's reasons why Expert Conferencing should be avoided were invalid. Respondent contended that Dr Thapar's expert report had been in direct rebuttal of Claimant's expert Mr Tiefenthal's statements covering compliance, discovery and reserves as far as 3D seismic was concerned. In fact, according to Respondent, Mr Thapar had conducted a review of Mr Tiefenthal's reinterpretation of Claimant's 3D survey rather than interpreting the 3D survey himself. In Respondent's view, Claimant cannot on the one hand regard Mr Tiefenthal as competent to express his views and conclusions on 3D seismic and on the other hand not regard him as competent to discuss these views and conclusions with Mr Thapar.\n\n296.\n\nRespondent further argued that Claimant's assumption of Mr Thapar's interpretation of Claimant's 3D seismic being utterly irrelevant to the matters at dispute was erroneous. Rather, Respondent alleged that Claimant had either misunderstood the matter in dispute or was seeking to avoid a review of one of its purportedly most striking material breaches under the Contract as well as a recalculation of reserves and quantum.\n\n297.\n\nRespondent also objected to Claimant's assertion in its letter of 19 January 2011 that Respondent had approved Claimant's 3D survey. Respondent pointed out that Claimant's 3D survey had been prepared for Claimant by SaratovNefteGeofysika, had been presented to TU Zapkaznedra and had been subjected to correction by the Scientific and Technical Council. Respondent noted that Claimant had neither produced this report in these proceedings nor given Mr Tiefenthal access to it.\n\n298.\n\nAlthough Respondent was convinced that it would be more efficient to examine both Mr Chugh and Dr Thapar on the one side and Mr Tiefenthal on the other side through the method of Expert Conferencing, Respondent would not be opposed to pair Mr Tiefenthal with Dr Thapar alone \" *regarding the aspects of those areas that concern 3D seismic* \" (Respondent\u2019s letter of 23 January 2011, p. 6).\n\n299.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s witness Mr Fadi Hussein, Respondent asserted that the allegations of threats and bribery were not true and that Respondent had had no knowledge about Mr Hussein\u2019s former wife or a son with her. Respondent also purported that caution should be exercised while examining Hussein\u2019s allegations, considering that he was related to the Houranis, obviously a member of their clan and due to the fact that his witness statement had been introduced late in the proceedings and that he had immediately thereafter been removed from examination as witness which \" *raises very serious suspicions regarding his statements* \" (p. 7). Respondent further indicated that Mr Hussein had made additional false allegations of coercion and bribery in July 2007 in his witness statement.\n\n300.\n\nRespondent also purported that Claimant had withdrawn Mr Hussein as witness to avoid cross-examination. In addition, Respondent strongly emphasised that it welcomed Mr Hussein\u2019s appearance as witness at the hearing and in fact requested the Tribunal to order Claimant to produce Mr Hussein as witness at the hearing (p. 8).\n\n301.\n\nWith regard to Mr Harvey Jackson\u2019s witness statement, Respondent reiterated its objections of 17 January 2011 to strike it from the record (p. 9).\n\n302.\n\nRespondent objected to Claimant\u2019s request to grant a period of direct examination with regard to rebuttal only before Expert Conferencing commences. Respondent held that this was not provided for in the rules. Paragraph 15.1 of the Minutes of the First Session and Paragraph 1.2 of PO-5 stipulated that expert reports constitute the direct testimony of each factual or expert witness and that there would be no direct examination at the oral procedure by the Party presenting the witness or expert, save an introduction to the witness. Paragraph 3.5 of PO-5 further provided that the direct examination of an expert or a fact witness shall be limited to a confirmation of their written testimony, a short introduction and questions on new developments that occurred after their last report or statement. Consequently, Respondent was opposed to Claimant\u2019s request for a direct examination of experts.\n\n303.\n\nRespondent further objected to the presence of three individuals (Mr Waarie, Mr Hawari, and Mr Mashru) designated as Claimant\u2019s representatives as well as to the presence of Mr Didier Bollecker and Ms Eve-Marine Bollecker as human rights counsel for Dr Aliyev and Dr Otto Dietrich as Austrian counsel to Dr Aliyev. To support its argument, Respondent drew upon Rule 32 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules stating that none of the latter three were agents, advocates or counsel to Claimant, but only related to Dr Aliyev and should thus not be permitted to attend the hearing.\n\n304.\n\nWith regard to Mr Waarie, Mr Hawari and Mr Mashru, Respondent demanded that Claimant provide evidence to show that these persons were \" *true corporate representatives* \" of CIOC; otherwise Respondent would persist to object to the attendance of the hearing by these individuals (p. 10).\n\n305.\n\nLastly, Respondent added two representatives of IFM Resources, Inc., one attorney, three paralegals, and one IT specialist from Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP to their list of hearing attendees.\n\n**I.IV.3. The Tribunal**\n------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe following excerpt from the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 24 January 2011 to the Parties concerning witnesses and experts is recalled:\n\n*\"3. Witnesses and Experts*\n\n*3.1. Again, the Tribunal appreciates the submissions of the Parties indicating that and why certain witnesses and experts should or should not be admitted and examined at the Hearing. However again, the Tribunal considers it as important that, at the final hearing of this case, all evidence that the Parties consider as relevant, can be considered and discussed.*\n\n*3.2. The Tribunal recalls and confirms its Procedural Order No. 6.*\n\n*3.3. The Tribunal has taken note of and accepts the Parties' submissions regarding the witnesses and experts that will and will not be present at the Hearing and regarding the witnesses they do not intend to examine at the Hearing. The rulings of PO6 will be applied in this regard and their examination will be conducted in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5.*\n\n*3.4. Since the Parties have not agreed on any changes, the examination will be conducted in the order given by the Agenda given in sections 3.2 and 3.3 of PO5.*\n\n*3.5. In so far as certain witnesses or experts cannot be present for the entire period of the Hearing, the Parties are invited to agree on certain time frames in this regard and inform the Tribunal at the beginning of the Hearing.*\n\n*3.6. The Tribunal has taken note that the Parties' suggestions regarding the groups of experts for the expert conferencing are not identical. The Parties are invited to agree in this regard and inform the Tribunal at the beginning of the Hearing.\"*\n\n307.\n\nThe following ruling made during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits on 8 February 2011 concerning the attendance of persons and confidentiality of the proceedings is recalled (Tr, day 2, p. 36-37):\n\n*\"The Tribunal has agreed on the following three rulings.*\n\n*1. Mr Waarie, Mr Hawari and Mr Mashru may not be present in the hearing room. Mr Omar Antar is accepted as the designated agent of the claimant and may be in the hearing room continuously.*\n\n*2. Mr Bollecker, Ms Bollecker, Dr Dietrich may only be present in the hearing room during the testimony of Dr Aliyev, but the claimant may request permission to show them designated parts of the transcript of the parties' opening statements.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal orders that the proceedings of this hearing shall remain confidential, that neither the transcript of this hearing nor the audio recording of it shall be communicated to any third parties, and that all the individuals present in the hearing shall keep confidential the contents of these proceedings and not communicate them to third parties.\"*\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal furthermore recalls the following excerpt from the Transcript of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 8 February 2011 (Tr, day 2, p. 101-104):\n\n*\"THE PRESIDENT: Now, as far as witnesses are concerned, we maintain the ruling of paragraph 3.5 of Procedural Order No. 5 which in fact means -- you can read it yourself -- but which in fact means ten minutes' introduction, direct examination, plus a short further introduction on new developments.*\n\n*We stick with the \"short\". Now, short does not mean two minutes; it's related to the subject obviously. But we feel we should stick with this \"short\". And I should also say -- it was raised later in your discussion, but it should be mentioned here -- that this examination, both the ten minutes and anything on new developments, should only be possible relating to the substance of the statement submitted by the witness and not any new subjects.*\n\n*Okay, that's number 1.*\n\n*Number 2, expert conferencing. We are not quite sure whether we only confirm something that you agreed to but let us make it clear. Each expert has ten minutes of introduction, that is what the parties agreed as well, and then conferencing starts right away. Later in the week, and perhaps not consistently for the two groups we have, we will discuss in the Tribunal whether we feel we should start with some questions or whether we would invite the parties first to raise questions. Of course we do have lists of issues that you have submitted in that regard.*\n\n*But anyway, there will be ten minutes plus any new development, if there is, related to the substance of the witness statement, and then conferencing starts right away.*\n\n*As far as the industry experts are concerned, we took note and accept what the parties agreed: that these ten minutes will come up three times for the three topics that you have: compliance, reserves and 3D, I think it is. So this is witness-conferencing.*\n\n*Number 3, witness statement of Fadi Hussain[sic]. The statement we noted is dated 6th November. It was submitted by claimant's letter of 13th December, where we have a reference to that on page 3. The Tribunal does not find in this letter of 13th December sufficient reasoning why the statement was, after having been available from 6th November, only filed at that particular date, 13th December.*\n\n*Therefore, for the time being it is not admitted, unless claimant can show that it submitted a reasoned application according to paragraph A4 of Procedural Order No. 6, because we didn't want to overlook anything that perhaps we have overlooked in that short period. But for the time being it is not admitted.*\n\n*The same applies basically to the witness testimony of Mr Jackson, which was submitted again by a letter of 22nd December as far as we can see. Again, we do not find either in that letter or otherwise from the claimant's side a reasoned application according to paragraph A4 of PO6 why it was submitted so late, even though -- well, we know the procedure; it had been submitted before and so on. Let me exemplify that. If, for instance, we were told that the employment stopped two days before 22nd December, that may perhaps be a consideration to be taken into account. But we don't see that.*\n\n*Finally, number 5, just as a clarification -- again, we are not quite sure whether that is needed or whether the parties agreed on that -- the rule on no new documents is quite clear, we think. We maintain the ruling in paragraph 3.6 of Procedural Order No. 5, which means no new documents. Demonstrative exhibits may, of course, be shown.\"*\n\n**J. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**J.I. Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n309.\n\nRespondent requested the Tribunal to reject CIOC\u2019s claims in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction or for inadmissibility. (R-III, para. 468; R-IV, para. 648; R-V, para. 191) In this context, the Tribunal notes that, Article 41 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.*\n\n*(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\"*\n\nFurther, the Tribunal notes that Rule 41(2) of the Arbitration Rules provides that:\n\n*\"The Tribunal may at its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\"*\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *Aguas del Tunari* tribunal that the Tribunal\u2019s authority also includes \" *the power to consider ways in which an ambiguous or unclear objection may bear on jurisdiction and to restate such objections, as appropriate, so as to allow a full examination of jurisdiction.* \"2 The Tribunal will therefore first turn to the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S. A. v. Republic of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction of October 11, 2005, para. 78 (\" **Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia** \").\n\n**J.II. The Requirements of the ICSID Convention for CIOC to Claim U.S. Nationality - Article 25(2)(b)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nRespondent\u2019s principal objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is that Claimant is not a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, inasmuch as Claimant contends it is a U.S. national by virtue of the BIT, and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which allow locally incorporated companies to bring claims against States of their incorporation, \"because of foreign control\".\n\n311.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Kazakhstan are Contracting States of the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention entered into force in the United States of America on 14 October 1966 and for Kazakhstan on 21 October 2000.\n\n312.\n\nClaimant is an entity incorporated in Kazakhstan and the key question for the Tribunal is whether Claimant satisfies the conditions pursuant to which a juridical person incorporated in the State which is a party to the dispute can be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of ICSID arbitration. The provision addressing this issue in the ICSID Convention is Article 25(2)(b).\n\n313.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the content and application of the legal test required by Article 25(2)(b). Crucially, they disagree as to whether the test requires evidence that CIOC is an investment of Devincci Hourani. Further, if such a requirement indeed exists, the next question is what is meant by \u2018investment' in this context and what evidence should be presented.\n\n314.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) provides that\n\n*\"(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:*\n\n*(...)*\n\n*(b) (...) any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting* *State party to the dispute on [the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to arbitration] and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"*\n\n315.\n\nIn presenting their arguments the Parties use the notions of jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae*. These concepts are related to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the jurisdiction proper of the Tribunal. The issue whether, under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, a juridical person incorporated in the host State can bring a claim against that host State is a *threshold jurisdictional question*.3 The threshold question is whether a juridical person can be regarded as a national of another Contracting State \u2018because of foreign control', in particular, whether \u2018because of foreign control' the parties have agreed to treat Claimant as national of another Contracting State. Only after this threshold is cleared may the Tribunal move to analysing whether the conditions of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are satisfied.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees here with the *Vacuum Salt* tribunal: \" *The parties diverge, however, on the threshold jurisdictional issue (...) regarding whether \u2018because of foreign control, the parties agreed [that Vacuum Salt] should be treated as a national of another Contracting State [Greece] for the purposes of [the] Convention', specifically Article 25(2)(b). It is crucial to ICSID jurisdiction in this case and it is to this issue that the Tribunal first must turn.* \" See *Vacuum Salt Products Limited v. Government of the Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1, Award of 1 February 1994, para. 27 (\" **Vacuum Salt v. Ghana** \").\n\n**J.II.1. Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nClaimant holds that it is majority owned and controlled by the U.S. national Mr Devincci Hourani and is therefore a national of the other party as required under Article VI(8) of the BIT as well as a \"national of another Contracting State\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. (C-I, paras. 61, 76; C-IV, paras. 25-45) By Claimant\u2019s interpretation, Article 25(2)(b) requires the elements of:\n\na) control,\n\nb) by a foreign national, and\n\nc) the parties\u2019 agreement to treat CIOC as a \u2018national of another Contracting State\u2019 because it is foreign controlled. (C-IV, para. 26)\n\n317.\n\nThe requirement of \u2018control\u2019 stems from the wording of Article 25(2)(b). Since \u2018control\u2019 is undefined in the Convention, Claimant relied on decisions of ICSID tribunals to establish the meaning of control, including consideration of various factors as evidence of such control, such as shareholding, domination in the company\u2019s decision-making, legal capacity to control.4\n\nClaimant relied here mainly on: *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* ; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Award of 5 June 1990 (\" **Amco v. Indonesia** \"); *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Award of 21 October 1983 (\" **Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon** \"); *Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation v. Republic of Liberia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2, Award of 31 March 1986 (\" **LETCO v. Liberia** \") and *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*.\n\n318.\n\nHence, to satisfy this part of the test it suffices to show Devincci Hourani\u2019s 92 % participation in CIOC and his responsibilities at CIOC establish the required element of control of the company. (C-IV, para. 27; C-V, paras. 121-129)\n\n319.\n\nThe requirement of foreign nationality is met by proof that Devincci Hourani is a U.S. national in accordance with U.S. law. (C-IV, paras. 28-39)\n\n320.\n\nThe third requirement is met since CIOC, as a company controlled by a U.S. national, concluded an agreement with Kazakhstan to treat CIOC as a national of another Contracting State. Kazakhstan\u2019s offer to submit disputes to arbitration in Article VI of the BIT included Article VI(8) of the BIT, which constitutes an offer to conclude an agreement required by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. CIOC accepted this offer by filing its Request for Arbitration and thus concluded an agreement with Kazakhstan to treat CIOC as a national of another Contracting State. (C-IV, paras. 25-26, 40-42)\n\n321.\n\nClaimant also fulfils the requirements of Article VI(8) of the BIT. CIOC is a company legally constituted under the laws and regulations of Kazakhstan. (C-IV, paras. 5-6, 61) Immediately before the occurrence of the events giving rise to the present dispute, CIOC was an investment of Devincci Hourani, who was a majority shareholder of CIOC and controlled that company. (C-I, para. 61; C-IV, para. 27; C-V, paras. 121-129) Lastly, Devincci Hourani is a national of the U.S. as he falls within the definition of a \u2018national' contained in Article I(1)(c) of the BIT. (C-I, paras. 6, 61; C-IV, paras. 28-39)\n\n**J.II.2. Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal must *first* discern whether the case falls within the jurisdictional requirements set out in the Convention. (R-III, para. 22) As a result Respondent bases its argumentation on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.5\n\nThis follows from Respondent's reliance on the *TSA Spectrum* award, where the tribunal stated that \" *the provisions of the BIT cannot provide ICSID jurisdiction unless the conditions of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention are satisfied.* \" *TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award of 19 December 2009, para. 156.\n\n323.\n\nRespondent does not question Claimant's argument that the arbitration agreement between CIOC and Kazakhstan, which incorporates Article VI(8) of the BIT, constitutes an agreement required by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and thus, at least formally, confers on CIOC a status of a \u2018national of another Contracting State' under Article 25(1). Respondent argues, however, that the Tribunal must not limit itself to such formalities but investigate the existence of *actual* control arising from all of the facts and circumstances. The enquiry arises because protection granted by the ICSID Convention does not and cannot include an agreement to recognise sham transactions lacking *bona fides*. (R-IV, para. 34-37)\n\n324.\n\nRespondent points out that Article 25(2)(b) was introduced to recognise \" *the business model commonly employed by international investors, who often make their investments through a local investment vehicle.* \" Its purpose is to include within the scope of the ICSID Convention all investors that operate through locally incorporated companies. To rely on Article 25(2)(b), CIOC has to be a local investment vehicle of a foreign investor. Inasmuch as Claimant asserts that this foreign investor is Devincci Hourani due to his purported ownership and control of CIOC, Respondent contends that the requirements for the materiality and existence of control need to be objectively proven and not limited to a mere semblance or formality. (R-III, paras. 27-29)\n\n325.\n\nRespondent further contends that the decisive criterion for the existence of a foreign investment is the nationality of the investor; if Devincci Hourani made no investment in CIOC, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. (R-III, para. 29) This inference may at first glance appear illogical.6 However, the proposition is clear when read in conjunction with the passage from *Dolzer* and *Schreuer* relied upon by Respondent.7 It follows from it that the requirement of nationality of ownership or control informs only the *foreignness* of an investment. It does not inform whether it is *an investment.* Thus, to rely on Article 25(2)(b) and the BIT, CIOC must be a foreign investment *of* Devincci Hourani. Claimant must show that it is *a foreign investment* but also that it is *an investment* of the U.S. national. (R-III, paras. 29-30)\n\nIt prompted the Claimant to observe that Respondent is \"misstating the relevant test\" (C-V, para. 118).\n\n\" *The decisive criterion for the existence of a foreign investment is the nationality of the investor. An investment is a foreign investment if it is owned or controlled by a foreign investor. There is no additional requirement of foreignness for the investment in terms of its origin.* \" [footnotes omitted] (R. Dolzer and C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law*, Oxford University Press (2008), pp. 67-68).\n\n**J.II.3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nRespondent's jurisdictional objection is built around Article 25(1) and 25(2)(b) and their interpretation. The Tribunal therefore starts its analysis from the Convention.\n\n327.\n\nClaimant interprets Article 25(2)(b) as requiring that a local company is controlled by a national of another Contracting State. Respondent contends that Article 25(2)(b) also requires that CIOC must be an investment of Devincci Hourani.\n\n328.\n\nOn this issue of construction of Article 25(2)(b) the Tribunal first turns to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT).\n\n**(a) Interpretation of Article 25(2)(b)**\n------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT requires the Tribunal to interpret Article 25(2)(b) in good faith, by discerning the ordinary meaning of its terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. It is clear from the wording of Article 25(2)(b) that its application depends on the existence of an agreement of the parties. The Tribunal must therefore first identify such agreement and the first question for the Tribunal is: who are the parties to that agreement? The ICSID Convention consequently uses the word \u2018parties' to describe the parties to the dispute. Claimant argues, and Respondent does not deny, that the agreement between the disputing parties was concluded by Claimant's acceptance, in its Request for Arbitration, of Respondent's offer to submit to ICSID arbitration disputes contained in the BIT. While the Tribunal accepts such interpretation, if Claimant's reasoning is to mean that a mere existence of such an agreement gives Claimant standing in the present arbitration,8 the Tribunal disagrees.\n\nClaimant argued that \" *By the offer to submit disputes to arbitration in Article VI of the Treaty, and CIOC's acceptance of that offer in filing its Request for Arbitration, the parties have agreed to treat CIOC as a* \u2018national of another Contracting State' *for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.* \" From this Claimant concludes that \" *CIOC therefore has standing to claim by virtue of Article 25(2)(b) (...).* \" (C-IV, paras. 25 and 40).\n\n330.\n\nIn most of the previous ICSID proceedings concerning Article 25(2)(b), its provisions were applied to an investment contract signed between a locally incorporated company (claimant) and a host State (respondent).9 In such cases the agreement was negotiated directly between the parties to the dispute, with the host State's awareness of the identity of the locally incorporated company. In many of those cases, the agreement to treat the locally incorporated company as a national of another Contracting State was implied from an ICSID arbitration clause contained in the investment contract. In such circumstances, the existence of an express or implied agreement to treat the locally incorporated company as a foreign national gave that company standing in the dispute. In the present dispute the investment contract between the parties (the Contract) contains an ICSID arbitration clause. However, Claimant is relying on the BIT, not the Contract, to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.10\n\nWithout having to rely on specific cases which the Parties have not commented upon, the Tribunal points to e.g. *Holiday Inns S.A. and others v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1 (an investment agreement); *Amco v. Indonesia* (an individual consent to ICSID arbitration); *Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon* (a joint venture agreement); *LETCO v. Liberia* (a concession agreement); *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels* (*SOABI) v. Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1 (an establishment agreement); *Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited v. Independent Power Tanzania Limited,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8 or *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana* (a lease agreement).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it does not follow from the Contract that Claimant can be treated as a national of another Contracting State. The Contract states that the parties \" *agreed that the Contractor is a resident of Lebanon, or in the event of assignment as a national of the resident country of the assignee, and therefore the Contractor shall be treated as a resident of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, for purposes of the ICSID Convention.* \" (C-4, Clause 27.8) This original wording of the Contract, initially concluded between Kazakhstan and CCC, was not addressed in connection with the transfer of the Contract from CCC to CIOC.\n\n331.\n\nIf a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is based on an investment treaty, claimant does not negotiate an individual agreement with the host State but accepts a non-negotiable offer addressed to persons or entities that fulfil its conditions. That offer is contained in an investment treaty and its conditions are agreed between the parties to that investment treaty. Unlike in the context of investment contracts, the acceptance of an offer contained in an investment treaty cannot create an assumption that the claimant fulfils the conditions of that offer.\n\n332.\n\nIf a claimant wants to rely on Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention in the context of an investment treaty arbitration, that investment treaty must allow for the application of Article 25(2)(b). The decision of the parties to the investment treaty to allow application of Article 25(2)(b) in their bilateral relations is an exercise of their ultimate discretion, expressly reserved in the ICSID Convention, to consent to submit disputes to ICSID jurisdiction granted to the Contracting States.11\n\nThe last recital of the ICSID Convention Preamble provides that \" *no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration* \". This is also confirmed in para. 30 of the Report of the Executive Directors: \" *A juridical person which had the nationality of the State party to the dispute would be eligible to be a party to the proceedings under the auspices of the Centre*  ***if that State had agreed***  *to treat is as a national of another Contracting State because of foreign control.* \" (emphasis added).\n\n333.\n\nArticle VI(8) of the BIT contains the decision of Kazakhstan and the United States to allow application of Article 25(2)(b) to disputes arising out of the BIT. However, Article VI(8) contains more than that. It spells out conditions of application of Article 25(2)(b) to disputes based on the BIT. In Article VI(8) of the BIT, Kazakhstan and the United States exercise their discretion, as parties to the ICSID Convention, to agree on the Convention\u2019s interpretation or application in a particular area of their bilateral relations. Such agreements are allowed, as long as they do not contradict the meaning of the treaty to which they pertain. The Tribunal is obliged to take any such subsequent agreement between the parties into account, to the same extent as the treaty\u2019s context. Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT states:\n\n*\"There shall be taken into account, together with the context: [...] any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions [...]\"*\n\n334.\n\nThe discretion of the ICSID Convention Contracting States to agree the details of application of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention also follows from the *rationale* of this provision. ICSID is an institution designed for the resolution of disputes between States and nationals of other States. Only in exceptional circumstances companies are permitted to bring claims against States of their incorporation, and the second half of Article 25(2)(b) sets out the conditions of this exception.\n\n335.\n\nThe wording of Article 25(2)(b) is a result of a compromise. This provision was introduced to prevent the exclusion from the ambit of the Convention of situations of foreign investors carrying out their business through a company organised under the laws of the host State.12 In the drafting process two positions emerged with regard to dealing with this issue. One was to leave it to the discretion of the host State and the other to define the link between the company and a foreign national in the Convention.13 The final wording combines \" *the elements of agreement and foreign control by permitting agreement to treat a corporation of host State nationality as a national of another Contracting State because of foreign control.* \"14\n\nBroches, *The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States,* Recueil des Cours 1972 II, Vol 136, pp. 337-410, at pp. 358-359; C. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press (2009), p. 296, para. 760; see also: *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,* para. 216: \" *(...) the ICSID Convention and the majority of BITs, recognises that the investor of one of the State Parties may incorporate an entity in the other State Party as a vehicle for its investment activity.* \"\n\nBroches, **ibid.**, pp. 359-360; Schreuer et al., **ibid.**, pp. 296-297, paras. 761-762.\n\nSchreuer et al., *ibid.*, p. 297, para. 762.\n\n336.\n\nIt follows from the above, that the ICSID Convention Contracting States can agree on the conditions of their submission to ICSID jurisdiction as long as their agreement does not contradict the meaning of the Convention. Article 25(2)(b) sets \u2018foreign control\u2019 as such \u2018outer limit\u2019, an objective requirement that cannot be replaced by an agreement.15 It is a floor below which the parties\u2019 agreement cannot reach. On the other hand, it gives the parties flexibility within those \u2018outer limits\u2019. As stated by *Broches*, it leaves \" *the greatest possible latitude to the parties to decide under what circumstances a company could be treated as a \u2018national of another Contracting State'* \", which means that \" *any stipulation (...) which is based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted.* \"16 This interpretation is uncontroversial and accepted by ICSID tribunals and commentators.17 Hence, it is correct to say that the term \u2018foreign control\u2019 is \u2018flexible and deferential\u2019 and is meant \" *to* *accommodate a wide range of agreements between parties as to the meaning of \u2018foreign control'* \".18\n\nSchreuer et al., *ibid.*, p. 312, para. 813.\n\nBroches, *ibid.*, pp. 360-361.\n\nSee e.g. *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana*, para. 37; *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, paras. 280-281; *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela v. Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction of 27 September 2001, paras. 109, 113-116; and comments by Schreuer et al., *ibid.*, para. 273, p. 287 (where it is stated that \" *Any reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in (...) a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID (...) tribunal.* \").\n\n*Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, paras. 280-286\n\n337.\n\nThe factual element of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention cannot be examined independently from the agreement on nationality contained in the applicable investment treaty, because it is the investment treaty that would normally contain the test by which such foreign control is established in the circumstances of the case. However, if the agreement plainly contradicts the meaning of the ICSID Convention, e.g. by stipulating that *any* locally incorporated company should be treated as a foreign national, the tribunal cannot go beyond the mandatory limits established by Article 25 of the Convention. Therefore, at least to the extent to which the agreement contradicts the Convention, the Tribunal must find that there is no agreement providing jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b).\n\n338.\n\nFor the above reasons the Tribunal must first turn to Article VI(8) of the BIT.\n\n**(b) Article VI(8) of the BIT**\n--------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nArticle VI(8) provides that:\n\n*\"For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"*\n\n340.\n\nThis provision contains the BIT parties' agreed conditions of application of Article 25(2)(b). The Tribunal thus needs to determine whether Article VI(8) contradicts the ICSID Convention and, if it does not, apply the test to the circumstances of the present case.\n\n341.\n\nBy virtue of its references to Article VI(3) of the BIT, which designates ICSID arbitration as one of the dispute settlement options, and to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Article VI(8) of the BIT limits its application to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. It extends the BIT protection to companies that are registered in one Party to the BIT and constitute \" *investment[s] of nationals or companies of the other Party* \" to the BIT.\n\n342.\n\nIn interpreting the phrase \" *any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party* \" the Tribunal applies the BIT's definition of the term \" *company* \" in Article I(1)(b):\n\n*\"\"company\" of a Party means any kind of corporation, company, association, enterprise, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and* *regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for* *pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled (...)\"*\n\nIn the context of the present dispute, the juridical person can invoke ICSID jurisdiction if it is a Kazakh company, provided that all other jurisdictional requirements are met.\n\n343.\n\nIn interpreting the phrase \" *investment of nationals or companies of the other Party* \" the Tribunal resorts to the above definition of \" *company* \", as well as to the BIT's definitions of the terms \" *investment* \" and \" *national* \":\n\nPursuant to Article I(1)(c) of the BIT,\n\n*\"\"national,[sic]\"of a Party means a natural person who is a national of a Party under its applicable law\"*.\n\nPursuant to Article I(1)(a) of the BIT,\n\n*\"\"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including movable and immovable property, as well as rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to: literary and artistic works, including sound recordings, inventions in all fields of human endeavor, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law\"*.\n\n344.\n\nIn the light of the above definitions, the meaning of the terms \" *national* \" and \" *company* \" is clear enough. However, the meaning of the term \" *investment* \" is not so immediately clear. The phrase\n\n*\"\"investment\" means every kind of investment\"* is problematic.\n\n345.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the two words \u2018investment' used in the above phrase do not mean exactly the same thing. The first word \u2018investment' is defined: the text of Article I(1)(a) after the phrase \u2018 *\"investment\" means* ' and finishing with the word \u2018 *law* ' in subparagraph (v) constitutes a definition of the first word \u2018investment\u2019. However, if we substituted the second word \u2018investment\u2019 used in the above phrase with this definition, the result would be nonsensical.19 Rather, following general rules of interpretation, the second word \u2018investment\u2019 in the above phrase should be treated as an undefined term and interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning in its context and in the light of the BIT\u2019s object and purpose pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT which instructs the interpreter to interpret a treaty \" *in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to*\n\n*be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.* \" There is no evidence that the parties have intended to give that second word \u2018investment\u2019 any special meaning. Pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT \" *a special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.* \"\n\nIt would actually require inserting the definition of Article I(1)(a) into itself *ad infinitum*.\n\n346.\n\nThe definition of investment in Article I.1(a) follows a familiar pattern of investment definitions in bilateral investment treaties. It consists of a general description of the meaning of the term \u2018investment\u2019, followed by a non-exhaustive illustrative enumeration of assets that are included in the definition of investment. However, the BIT defines \u2018investment\u2019 as *\"every kind of*  *investment* This phrase is common in U.S. bilateral investment treaties.20 However, it differs from definitions used in other (non-U.S.) investment treaties, which define \u2018investment\u2019 as *\"every kind of*  *asset*  *(...)\"*21 Thus, the parties to the BIT intended the term \u2018investment\u2019 to mean something different than merely an \u2018asset\u2019.\n\nOf 45 bilateral investment treaties signed by the U.S. and available in the UNCTAD database, only four (with Cameroon, Egypt, Rwanda and Uruguay) do not define \u2018investment\u2019 as \" *every kind of investment (...)* \" or by equivalent wording.\n\nSee e.g. bilateral investment treaties signed by Kazakhstan with: Belgium (Article 1.2: \" *The term \u2018investments' shall mean any kind of assets (...)* \"); Greece (Article 1.1: \" *\u2018Investment' means every kind of asset (...)* \"); Hungary (Article 1.1: \" *The term \u2018investment' shall comprise every kind of asset (...)* \"); the Netherlands (Article 1(a): \" *the term \"investments\" means every kind of asset (...)* \"); Sweden (Article 1(1): \" *The term \u2018investment' shall mean any kind of asset (...)* \"); Switzerland (Article 1(a): \" *The term \u2018investments' shall include every kind of assets[sic] (...)* \"); Turkey (Article 1.2: \" *The term \u2018investment' (...) shall include every kind of asset (...)* \"); United Kingdom (Article 1(a): \" *\u2018investment' means every kind of asset (...)* \").\n\n347.\n\nTurning to the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018investment\u2019, the Tribunal consulted the following dictionaries:\n\nThe Oxford Compact English Dictionary (2nd ed., 2003):\n\n*\u2018investment' 1. The action or process of investing. 2. A thing worth buying because it may be profitable or useful in the future.*\n\n*\u2018invest' 1. To put money into financial schemes, shares or property with the expectation of achieving a profit. 2. Devote (time or energy) to an undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result. 3. (invest in, informal) Buy (something) whose usefulness will repay the cost.*\n\nChambers 21st Century Dictionary (1999):\n\n*\u2018investment' 1. A sum of money, invested. 2. Something, such as business, house, etc in which one invests money, time, effort etc. 3. The act of investing. \u2018invest' 1. To put (money) into a company or business, eg by buying shares in it, in order to make a profit. 2. To devote (time, effort, energy, etc.) to something.*\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary (9th ed., 2009):\n\n*\u2018investment': 1. An expenditure to acquire property or assets to produce revenue; a capital outlay. 2. The asset acquired or the sum invested.*\n\n*\u2018invest' 2. To apply (money) for profit. 3. To make an outlay of money for profit.*\n\nOxford Dictionary of Business (1996):\n\n*\u2018investment' 1. The purchase of capital goods, such as plant and machinery in a factory in order to produce goods for future consumption. This is known as*  ***capital investment*** *; the higher the level of capital investment in an economy, the faster it will grow. 2. The purchase of assets, such as securities, works of art, bank and building-society deposits, etc., with a primary view to their financial return, either as income or capital gain. This form of*  ***financial investment***  *represents a means of saving. The level of financial investment in an economy will be related to such factors as the rate of interest, the extent to which investments are likely to prove profitable, and the general climate of business confidence.* (emphasis in the original)\n\n348.\n\nDictionary definitions, much as they help establish the ordinary meaning of the phrase, are not the end of the Tribunal's analysis.22 It must also look at the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT, as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\n\nC.F. Amerasinghe, *The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes and Development through the Multinational Corporation,* 9 Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law 793 (1976), 815 (\" *[D]ictionary definitions devised for the purpose of economic science or financial analysis may be irrelevant for the purpose of defining investment in connection with the Centre's jurisdiction. So also tax law or investment law definitions in municipal law are intended to relate to special objectives and would be of limited usefulness.* \").\n\n349.\n\nThe preamble of the BIT provides (emphasis added):\n\n*\"Desiring to promote greater*  ***economic cooperation***  *between them, with respect to*  ***investment by nationals***  *and companies*  ***of one Party in the territory of the other*** ***Party*** *;*\n\n*Recognizing that*  ***agreement upon the treatment***  *to be.[sic] accorded such investment*  ***will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development***  *of the Parties;*\n\n*Agreeing that fair and equitable*  ***treatment***  *of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of* ***economic resources*** *;*\n\n*Recognizing that the*  ***development of economic and business ties***  *can contribute to the well-being of workers in both Parties and promote respect for internationally recognized worker rights; and*\n\n*Having resolved to conclude a Treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment*\n\n350.\n\nThe parties clearly refer in the preamble to investment understood as a **flow of private capital** from the U.S. to Kazakhstan and vice versa as a flow of capital stemming from nationals and companies of the respective parties. The primary subject-matter of the BIT is the treatment of *investments*. The BIT is approached as an \" *agreement upon the treatment to be accorded* [to] *(...) investment* [s]\" and one of its main goals was to stimulate the flow of private capital. This follows not only from the preamble but also from the U.S. President's letter of transmittal of the BIT to the Senate, which provides: \" *The Treaty is fully consistent with U.S. policy toward international and domestic investment. A specific tenet, reflected in this Treaty, is that U.S. investment abroad and foreign investment in the United States should receive fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory treatment.* \"\n\n351.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT defines \u2018investment' from the perspective of assets, claims and rights to be protected (or accorded specific treatment, prescribed in the following provisions of the BIT). As one of the goals of the BIT is the stimulation of flow of private capital, BIT protection is not granted simply to any formally held asset, but to an asset which is the result of such a flow of capital. Thus, even though the BIT definition of \u2018investment' does not expressly qualify the contributions by way of which the investment is made, the existence of such a contribution as a prerequisite to the protection of the BIT is implied.\n\n352.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes the recent Decision of the Tribunal in the **Abaclat** case as a confirmation, though this Tribunal does not rely on this decision since the Parties did not have an opportunity to refer to it and comment on it. The **Abaclat** tribunal finds that the definition of investment, which is similar to the one in Article I.1(a) of the BIT applicable in the present case, \" *is drafted in a way describing the rights and values which may be endangered by measures of the Host State, such as expropriation, and therefore deserve protection under the BIT. Thus the focus here is on the rights and the value that potential contributions from investors can generate. Nevertheless, this definition is of course based on the premise of the existence of such contribution*.\"23 This reflects the two aspects which the concept of investment covers: (i) the contribution that constitutes the investment, and (ii) the rights and the value that derive from that contribution.\n\n*Abaclat et al. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 4 August 2011, para. 347.\n\n353.\n\nThe preamble of the BIT also stresses the **economic aspect** of the subject of the treaty protection. The aim of the protections accorded by the BIT is the \" *maximum effective utilization of economic resources* \" stimulated by the flow of private capital from the other party to the BIT. That flow of capital will influence the economic development of the parties and increase their economic cooperation. Thus, in the light of the BIT's preamble, the investment is understood as a flow of capital that is economic in nature. This understanding is also bolstered by the U.S. President's letter of transmittal of the BIT to the Senate, which states that the BIT is \" *designed to encourage economic opportunity (...) in both countries.* \"\n\n354.\n\nThe concern of Kazakhstan and the United States with abuse of the BIT's protections when a claimant does not represent any economic link between the two States is visible in Article I(2) of the BIT. This provision allows each of the parties to deny the benefits of the BIT's protection to a company that is controlled by nationals of a third State and does not have any substantial activities in the other State-party to the BIT. The Tribunal is aware that Article I(2) of the BIT is not applicable to the present case. As a context of the term \u2018investment', however, it elucidates the economic aspects of the subject of the BIT's protection.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, subject to express provisions to the contrary, the origin of capital used to make an investment is immaterial for jurisdiction purposes.24 However, there still needs to be some economic link between that capital and the purported investor that enables the Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor.25\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Annex 2. Claimant relied here on: *Tradex Hellas S. A. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award of 29 April 1999; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republicc of Egypt* ; ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of 8 December 2000; *Eudoro A. Olgu\u00edn v. Republic of Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5, Award of 26 July 2001; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.

Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 April 2007 *.*\n\nThe capital can come from the investor's own funds located in any country, from its subsidiaries or affiliates located in any country, from loan, credit or other arrangements.\n\n356.\n\nThis interpretation which the Tribunal makes is confirmed by the drafting history of U.S. Model BITs. As reported by *Vandevelde* in relation to the definition of the term \u2018investment':\n\n*\"U.S. BIT drafters wanted to ensure that future forms of investment perhaps not anticipated by them would be covered by the agreement. Leaving the term undefined would permit it to evolve along with the changing nature of*  ***economic circumstances*** *. (...)*\n\n*The most common definition of \"investment\" in the European BITs had been \"every kind of asset.\" The purpose of the BITs, however, was to protect investment, not all U.S.-owned property in the territory of the BIT party.*  ***U.S. negotiators thus wished to*** ***make clear that an asset would be covered by the definition only if it had the character of an investment*** *. Accordingly, (...) the 1983 model (...) defines investment as \"every kind of investment.\" In effect, the treaty applies to all investment and to nothing more or nothing less. Despite its circularity, this phrase was thought to convey the flexibility that BIT drafters wanted to incorporate into the definition.*\n\n*(...) The secretary of state's submittal letters have noted that the BIT concept of investment is \"broad and designed to be flexible; although numerous types of*  ***economic interests***  *are enumerated,*  ***the intent is to include all legitimate interests in*** ***the territory of either Party***  *...*  ***having economic value or \u2018associated' with an*** ***investment.*** *\" (footnote omitted) The secretary's language (...) should have emphasized more clearly that*  ***to be protected an economic arrangement must have*** ***the character of an investment.***\n\n*(...)*\n\n*The 2004 modified the tautological definition of investment that had appeared in the U.S. BITs since the inception of the program. It defines investment as \"every asset... that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\" Thus, the 2004 model continues the U.S. practice of limiting investment to those assets that have the character of an investment (...).\"*26\n\nK. J. Vandevelde, *U.S. International Investment Agreements,* Oxford University Press (2009), pp. 114-115 and 121-122.\n\n357.\n\nRespondent argues that finding whether there is an investment requires the application of a comprehensive set of six factors, developed by the *Phoenix Action* tribunal.27 From those six factors Claimant points out three which it regards as particularly important in the present case:\n\na) contribution of money or assets,\n\nb) an element of risk, and\n\nc) assets invested *bona fide.* (R-III, paras. 32-33)\n\n1 - a contribution of money or other assets; 2 - a certain duration; 3 - an element of risk; 4 - an operation made in order to develop economic activity in the host State; 5 - assets invested in accordance with the laws of the host State; 6 - assets invested *bona fide*. (*Phoenix Action Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award of 15 April 2009, para. 114 (\" **Phoenix Action** \").)\n\n358.\n\nClaimant agrees that the term \u2018investment\u2019 has a certain inherent meaning and that there are certain features which are typical of most transactions that have been accepted as investments. However, Claimant disagrees that such features constitute a formal legal test for the purposes of ICSID jurisdiction. (C-IV, paras. 20-24; C-V, paras. 133-148) Describing his investment in CIOC Devincci Hourani explained that he saw the Caratube field as a considerable, interesting and potentially profitable investment with a great potential and that it was his \" *major commitment between 2004 and 2009* \". (WS 2 Devincci Hourani, paras. 27, 31) He testified that his investment in CIOC consisted not only of the purchase price for the share in the company, but also of other liabilities he took on, worth \u2018tens of millions of dollars\u2019. He also explained that he took the risk associated with investment in the Caratube field because he saw it as \u2018the opportunity of my life.\u2019 (Tr, Day 4, pp. 156-157)\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of lists of typical characteristics of an investment identified by ICSID tribunals. It is also mindful that most of them were developed in the context of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The context of \u2018investment\u2019 under Article 25(1) is different from the context of the term used in the BIT. In the present case the term \u2018investment\u2019 is not used to establish whether there is a dispute between the parties (\u2018 *legal dispute arising directly out of an investment* \u2019) but to determine whether the purported Claimant is a \u2018 *national of another Contracting State* \u2019 despite formally being a company registered in Kazakhstan. Thus, if any previous decisions of ICSID tribunals will be considered, this difference of contexts will have to be observed.\n\n360.\n\nThe inherent meaning of the term investment identified by tribunals and commentators includes existence of a contribution over a period of time and requiring some degree of risk.28 Such minimum requirements have been identified not only by ICSID tribunals, but also in investment treaty arbitrations not based on the ICSID Convention.29 Hence, the Tribunal is confirmed in its concluding that the term \u2018investment\u2019 used in the definition of investment in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, in the circumstances of the present case, denotes an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make a profit and thus involving some degree of risk.\n\nThis approach is also followed by the 2004 U.S. Model BIT which defines \"investment\" as \" *every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.* \"\n\nE.g. *Romak S.A. (Switzerland) v. The Republic of Uzbekistan*, PCA Case No. AA280 (UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Award of 26 October 2006, para. 207.\n\n361.\n\nThus, in the circumstances of the present case, the conditions in Article VI(8) for treating CIOC as a U.S. company require that:\n\na) CIOC is a company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of Kazakhstan;\n\nb) it is an investment of a U.S. national, where:\n\ni. \"investment\" is defined in Article I.1(a) and requires evidence of:\n\n1. ownership or control by a U.S. national,\n\n2. being an investment (an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit, and thus involving some degree of risk),\n\nii. the U.S. nationality is determined under the U.S. law;\n\nc) conditions defined in sub-section (b) were present immediately before the occurrence of the events that give rise to the dispute.\n\n362.\n\nThe conditions must be analysed from the particular point of time, referred to in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, namely the date on which the Parties consented to submit their dispute to ICSID arbitration.\n\n**(c) Burden of Proof**\n-----------------------\n\n363.\n\nBefore the Tribunal turns to analyse whether Claimant satisfied the requirements of \u2018foreign control' as stipulated in Article VI(8), it must first make some observations concerning the issue of burden of proof, namely which of the Parties is required to present evidence that the requirements of Article VI(8) of the BIT have or have not been fulfilled.\n\n364.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's question as to which Party bears the burden of proof, the Parties generally agreed that Claimant bears the burden of proof to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute. (PO-7, sec. 2.2; C-V, para. 162; R-V, paras. 2, 8-9)30\n\nRespondent by \"preponderance of evidence\" (R-V, para. 4), Claimant by bearing the \"initial burden to produce evidence\" (C-VI, para. 162).\n\n365.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal here refers to an argument, reported by *Schreuer et al.* in connection with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention that \" *an agreement on nationality would create a strong presumption in favour of foreign control that should be discarded only if it amounts to an unreasonable selection of the facts.* \"31 Such \u2018strong presumption' in the present case would mean that the burden of proof is on Respondent to show that the conditions of Article VI(8) of the BIT have not been met. Such an interpretation of the BIT would be unreasonable and the Tribunal rejects it.\n\nSchreuer et al., p. 313, para. 815.\n\n366.\n\nThe argument of the strong presumption in favour of existence of foreign control was suggested by Amerasinghe in the mid-1970s.32 Later, in light of the early awards, he stressed that the main element to be proven is that the host State was \" *at least (...) aware of the foreign control at the time of the agreement* \"33 and that burden of proof in that respect was on the claimant. This suggestion arose in the circumstances when investment treaty arbitration was not considered by any commentators or tribunals in the context of the \u2018parties' agreement' under Article 25(2)(b).34 It cannot be applied to circumstances when the host State is clearly not aware of the foreign control of the locally incorporated company at the time when that State agrees to treat a juridical person as a foreign national, i.e. when it signs an investment treaty in question. *Schreuer et al.* also do not seem to endorse it.35\n\nAmerasinghe, *Jurisdiction ratione personae under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States*, 47 British Yearbook of International Law (1975), p. 264 (\" *(...) agreement between the parties on a foreign nationality based on foreign control would raise a strong presumption that there was adequate foreign control on which to predicate a foreign nationality.* \"), repeated in Amerasinghe, *Interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention,* in R. Lillich and C. Brower (eds.), *International Arbitration in the 21st Century: Towards \u2018Judicialization' and Uniformity?*, Twelfth Sokol Symposium, Transnational Publishers (1994), p. 240.\n\nAmerasinghe, *Interpretation of Article 25(2)(b)...*, *ibid.*, p. 232.\n\nNeither the drafters of the Convention nor early commentators or tribunals considered investment treaties as a source of the agreement required by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It was assumed that any such agreements on nationality will be concluded between the host State and the locally incorporated companies or in a host State's legislation (see e.g. drafting history referred to by Broches and Schreuer; Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, para. 24; commentaries by: Broches, Szasz, Amerasinghe (both articles); awards: *Amco v. Indonesia, Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon, LETCO v. Liberia*, etc.).\n\nIn another part of their commentary, Schreuer et al *.* observe that: \" *the existence of a consent agreement (...) cannot be taken as an automatic recognition that the investor has met the Convention's nationality requirements. This holds true also for the satisfaction of the nationality conditions to qualify for protection under investment protection treaties.* \" (p. 264, para. 639)\n\n367.\n\nHence, the Tribunal concludes that the burden is on Claimant to show that it fulfils the criteria set out by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article VI(8) of the BIT.\n\n368.\n\nThe burden may shift with regard to issues reflected in documents that have been seized by Respondent from CIOC. The situations when such change of control over documents has occurred are addressed below in connection with the Tribunal's analysis of individual issues.\n\n**J.III. Does Claimant Satisfy the Requirements of Article VI(8) of the BIT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal will now apply the test identified in para. 361:\n\n**J.III.1. Is Claimant a Kazakh Company, as Defined in the BIT?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe first requirement of Article VI(8) of the BIT is for CIOC to show that it is a company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of Kazakhstan (part a) of the test identified in para. 360). To fulfil this criterion CIOC can be \" *any kind of corporation, company, association, enterprise, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled.* \"\n\n371.\n\nClaimant presents a \u2018state registration certificate of a legal entity' issued by the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan and dated 29 July 2002 as evidence that CIOC is a Kazakh company. (C-IV, para. 25; C-54) The certificate states that it\n\n*\"grants the right to perform activities under the foundation documents in compliance with the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\"*\n\n372.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the fact that CIOC is a Kazakh company.\n\n373.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that CIOC is a company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of Kazakhstan. However, it is not clear what kind of corporate entity CIOC is. It is referred to as \"limited liability partnership\" or \"LLP\" (C-54, C-55, C-56, C-173, C-174) as well as \"limited liability company.\" (C-53) From Article 1.10 of its Charter and Section 4.1 of its Incorporation Agreement it follows that the shareholders' liability is limited to the value of their shares. (C-173, C-175) Thus, the tribunal assumes that CIOC's legal form is equivalent to a limited liability company.\n\n**J.III.2. Was Claimant an Investment Owned or Controlled by a U.S. National at the Time Immediately Before the Events which Gave Rise to the Dispute?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the next requirement of Article VI(8), as identified in para. 361, namely, whether immediately before the occurrence of the events that gave rise to the dispute Claimant was an \u2018investment' owned or controlled by a U.S. national. Since the issue of timing permeates the whole requirement, the Tribunal first turns to this issue.\n\n**(a) Events that Gave Rise to the Dispute**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nClaimant points to late 2007 or early 2008 as the time immediately before the occurrence of the relevant events:\n\n*\"(...) 31 January 2008, being the day immediately before the notice of termination which completed the expropriation, or even earlier, in 2007 when Kazakh authorities suddenly made unfounded allegations with regard to CIOC's performance of the Contract and started to harass and intimidate Devincci Hourani and his family, as well as CIOC's senior management and employees.\"* (C-IV, para. 42)\n\n376.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties in relation to this assertion. However, Respondent points out that problems with performance by Claimant of its obligations under the Contract started already in 2003, five months before Devincci Hourani purchased his first share in CIOC. (R-9) This point is made to highlight the timing of acquisition of those shares. Respondent argues that, because the alleged share purchase happened when a dispute between CIOC and the Kazakh authorities over the Contract performance was already easily foreseeable, the transaction lacks *bona fides.* (R-III, para. 44) This issue will be addressed below.\n\n**(b) U.S. Nationality of Devincci Hourani**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n377.\n\nDevincci Hourani is a U.S. national. Claimant submitted a copy of the U.S. passport of Devincci Hourani issued on 14 November 2007 which states \"United States of America\" in the section \u2018nationality'. (C-2) Claimant further submitted Devincci Hourani's certificate of naturalisation, issued on 16 July 2001 by the Attorney General of Detroit, Michigan. (C-59)\n\n**(2) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n378.\n\nRespondent is not contesting Devincci Hourani\u2019s U.S. nationality.\n\n**(3) Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n379.\n\nArticle I(1)(c) of the BIT refers to the U.S. law as the law applicable to the determination of nationality of Devincci Hourani. The documents presented by Claimant, issued by U.S. authorities and confirming Devincci Hourani\u2019s U.S. nationality are sufficient evidence that he has been a U.S. national since 16 July 2001.\n\n**(c) Ownership or Control**\n----------------------------\n\n380.\n\nAs found above, in order to find that this Tribunal has jurisdiction, the Claimant must prove that it satisfies the requirements both of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and of Article VI(8) of the BIT. Regarding the term \u2018investment\u2019 in Article VI(8), the BIT\u2019s definition in Article I(1)(a) uses the phrase \u2018owned or controlled\u2019 not merely \u2018control\u2019 as does Article 25(2)(b). The two words are connected by an \u2018or\u2019. While, thus, this wording of the BIT seems to imply that it is sufficient to prove either ownership *or* control to satisfy this requirement, as seen above, the definition in the BIT cannot go beyond the limits established by Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention which makes no reference to ownership, but expressly requires control.\n\n381.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal is aware of the considerations of the **Plama**36 tribunal (CLA-98) which also had to evaluate evidence regarding ownership and control (paras. 94 and 95). However, that case, though also administrated by ICSID, was a procedure based on the Energy Charter Treaty. The relevant Article 17 of the ECT requires that nationals *\"own or control\"* the entity claimed to be the investment. While that is the wording we also find in the BIT, it is different in scope to Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention where, as seen above, only \u2018control\u2019 can be the basis for jurisdiction. Further, in the **Plama** procedure, the Tribunal had considerably more evidence supporting ownership or control to rely on than Claimant has provided in the present case to comply with its burden of proof.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award of 18 August 2008 (\" **Plama** \")\n\n382.\n\nOn the other hand, if majority ownership is shown, such a finding implies a presumption of control, even though it will have to be examined whether in the present case this presumption is a sufficient indication of control. Therefore, the test of ownership will be separated from the issue of control in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n**(1) Ownership**\n-----------------\n\n***(i) Claimant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n383.\n\nClaimant argues that the requirement of ownership is met because Devincci Hourani \" *holds 92 % ownership share in CIOC.* \" (C-V, para. 126) Devincci Hourani acquired an 85 % share in CIOC on 17 May 2004 from Fadi Hussein. (C-55) He then acquired further 7 % of CIOC\u2019s shareholding on 8 April 2005 from Waheeb Antakly. (C-56)\n\n***(ii) Respondent's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nRespondent points out that, even if payment was made, the purchase price for the share was nominal (it was the equivalent of USD 6,500 in local currency) and thus Devincci Hourani did not make an investment in CIOC.\n\n***(iii) Tribunal's Analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nHere there are some unusual aspects to the determination of whether the Claimant has established ownership to the requisite level of proof.\n\n386.\n\nRespondent requested documentary proof of payment in request No. 5 of Annex 2 to PO-2 (Respondent\u2019s Redfern Schedule, p. 16-17).\n\n387.\n\nClaimant held that such documents had been seized by Respondent.\n\n388.\n\nRespondent replied that such documents should be in the possession, custody or control of Devincci Hourani, as they concern his personal payments to the sellers of the shares, Fadi Hussein and Waheeb Antakly. However, if the Tribunal concluded that this was not the case, Respondent requested authorisation from the Tribunal to consult the seized documents in order to locate the requested document.\n\n389.\n\nClaimant replied that the documents related to his personal bank account in Kazakhstan were kept by Devincci Hourani in his office in 92a Palezhayeva Street in Almaty, which had been raided by Kazakh officials.\n\n390.\n\nTaking note of Claimant\u2019s assurance that the documents were among those seized in criminal investigations, which was not contested by Respondent the Tribunal concluded that said documents were in Respondent\u2019s possession and control. Respondent\u2019s document production request was therefore denied. Furthermore, the Tribunal noted that it did not see a basis for granting the authorisation requested by Respondent, but gave such authorisation should it be needed.\n\n391.\n\nRespondent further requested from Claimant documents evidencing the source of funds used by Devincci Hourani to acquire the shares in CIOC. Claimant argued that the relevant documents were in possession of Respondent who seized them during a raid on Claimant\u2019s premises. The Tribunal denied this request, but authorised Respondent to access the relevant documents. (PO-2, Annex 2, request 6, pp. 16-21) No documents were presented by Respondent.\n\n392.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal is aware of the decision of the ICSID Tribunal in the *Saba Fakes* award37 (CLA-101) which found that no sufficient proof had been provided by the claimant in that case that it acquired legal ownership of the share certificates. Though that case has certain similarities to the present one, particularly in view of the very low purchase price for the shares in both cases, as far as legal ownership is concerned the present case is to be distinguished from the *Saba Fakes* case, because the burden of proof regarding legal ownership turns out to lead to a different conclusion.\n\n*Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award of 12 July 2010 (\" **Saba Fakes** \").\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the share purchase agreements presented by Claimant are conditional. They provide that the buyer acquires the ownership rights to the share in CIOC upon payment of the \" *cost of the Share* \" and introduction of appropriate amendments to the founding documents of CIOC. (C-55, C-56) There is no evidence of payment of the purchase price for the share in CIOC. However, regard has to be had that, as seen above, some of the documents evidencing payment of the purchase price for the shares were controlled by Respondent and not produced. The Claimant also presented no evidence of introduction of amendments to the founding documents of CIOC required by the share purchase agreements (e.g. minutes of the amendments to the previous version of the founding documents on or after the dates of the share purchase agreements, evidence of filing or registration of such amendments in an appropriate public register).\n\n394.\n\nHowever, regarding ownership, payment of the purchase price and accurate company records, the Tribunal notes in particular:\n\nFirst, here, the key evidence was controlled by Respondent. The Tribunal should not draw inferences from this silence in favour of Respondent. The Tribunal found that evidence of payment of the purchase price was controlled by Respondent and Respondent was granted permission to access the seized documents. Thus, the burden of proof was on Respondent, who did not address the issue of the documents later on.\n\nSecond, Respondent did not deny that Devincci Hourani acquired the shares and was an owner of the 92 % share in CIOC.38\n\nThird, Respondent also requested from Claimant any minutes of CIOC\u2019s Board of Directors and/or shareholders concerning the shareholder\u2019s ownership of shares in CIOC and any transfer of shares of CIOC. (PO-2, Annex 2, request 8(iv), pp. 29-30) This request was granted by the Tribunal. No documents were presented by Claimant.\n\nE.g. R-III, para. 41 (\" *(...) he acquired 85 and 7 percent, respectively of the shares of CIOC for the total sum of approximately USD 6,500.* \"); R-IV, paras. 38-39 (\" *(...) Devincci Hourani acquired his interest in CIOC in 2004 for the negligible sum of USD 6,500 (...)* \"); R-V, para. 32 (\" *(...) Devincci obtained a majority stake in CIOC paying only USD 6,500 out of pocket.* \").\n\n395.\n\nAs mentioned above, the nature of the corporate entity of CIOC is not entirely clear. However, based on the text of its founding documents the Tribunal treats CIOC as a proprietary company. Article 3.2 of its Incorporation Agreement of 10 May 2005 lists Devincci Hourani as holder of 92 % \"membership interest\" and Fadi Hussein as holder of 8 % \"membership interest\" in CIOC. (C-173) The Tribunal also notes that the share purchase agreement of 18 May 2006 between Devincci Hourani (representing Fadi Hussein) and Kassem Omar states that 92 % share in CIOC belongs to Devincci Hourani. (WS Kassem Omar, Exhibit 1) Thus, this indirect evidence appears to show that Devincci Hourani was an owner of a 92 % share in CIOC.\n\n396.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that jurisdiction cannot be denied for the mere reason that Claimant has not fully complied with its burden of proof regarding ownership by the U.S. national, Devincci Hourani.\n\n**(2) Control**\n---------------\n\n***(i) Claimant's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n397.\n\nDevincci Hourani owns 92 % of CIOC's shareholding and exercises control over CIOC \" *consistent with that ownership interest* \" (C-IV, para. 27) Claimant argues that Devincci Hourani's responsibilities as a majority shareholder and director at CIOC constitute evidence of his control of the company. As evidence of these responsibilities Claimant points to CIOC's Charter and Incorporation Agreement and the authority granted to CIOC's shareholder by these documents. (C-V, para. 127; C-173, C-174) as well as witness statements of Devincci Hourani, who explained that he was regularly informed by CIOC's Director Omar Antar on matters relating to the company, participated in discussions concerning the project, negotiated certain contracts on behalf of CIOC, visited the Caratube project site three times, corresponded daily in relation to the project, made key decisions concerning the company and, when he himself was CIOC's Director from 15 August 2006 to 18 June 2007, he was \"overseeing the running of CIOC\". (WS 1 Devincci Hourani, paras. 11-13; WS 2 Devincci Hourani, paras. 29-31, 36) (C-V, para. 27)\n\n398.\n\nClaimant relies here on the *Aguas del Tunari* majority decision that evidence of the *actual control* over a company is not required. A capacity to control is sufficient, whether or not the controlling shareholder actually exercises it. (C-V, paras. 124-125; *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, paras. 242-248, 264)\n\n***(ii) Respondent's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nRespondent points out that Devincci Hourani did not exercise actual control, which, it argues, was exercised by JOR Investment, Inc. (\"JOR\") and those who controlled JOR. (R-V, paras. 39-44)\n\n400.\n\nRespondent relies on *Vacuum Salt* to argue that the Tribunal must determine existence of actual control of Devincci Hourani over CIOC and take into consideration all facts and circumstances of the particular context. (R-IV, para. 36) Respondent's main arguments concentrate on whether CIOC was an investment of Devincci Hourani, where it implies that the actual control over CIOC was exercised by Issam Hourani, brother of Devincci Hourani. (R-IV, para. 31)\n\n***(iii) Tribunal's Analysis***\n-------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nAgain, the starting point for the Tribunal's examination is that Claimant has the burden of proof.\n\n402.\n\nIn its request for evidence Respondent asked for minutes of meetings of CIOC's Board of Directors and/or shareholders' meetings concerning any investment in the Caratube project to assess the existence and materiality of Devincci Hourani's control over CIOC. The Tribunal ordered production of such documents. (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 26-27)\n\n403.\n\nRespondent also requested minutes of meetings of CIOC's Board of Directors and/or shareholders' meetings concerning the performance and management of the project. The Tribunal denied that request, as the documents were seized by Respondent and under its control, and granted Respondent authorisation to access the documents for the purposes of the proceedings. (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 27-29)\n\n404.\n\nThe documents requested by Respondent and ordered by the Tribunal have not been produced by Claimant. Even if some of the relevant documents were among those seized by Respondent, it is to be noted that none were produced by Claimant, and it seems also highly unlikely to the Tribunal that none of the relevant documents were held by Claimant or the Hourani family outside Kazakhstan.\n\n405.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that Claimant did submit great numbers of other documents obviously held outside Kazakhstan. And while the allegedly forged documents were withdrawn by Claimant during the hearing (C-162, C-175, C-238, C-239, C-240, Aliyev 25; see Tr, day 6, pp. 228-229), and therefore the Tribunal will not rely on them, and while the Tribunal sees no indication that counsel for Claimant were aware of any doubts regarding these documents, the Tribunal cannot overlook that their submission and later withdrawal throw a doubt on Claimant's credibility. This has a bearing on the Tribunal's evidentiary evaluation of the fact that Claimant did not provide any documents showing the exercise of effective control by Devincci Hourani.\n\n406.\n\nAs a witness, Devincci Hourani admitted that he did not participate in a day to day running of CIOC in times when he was not a director of CIOC. (WS Devincci Hourani, para. 18) His evidence of control is based on a reference to CIOC's Charter and Incorporation Agreement, which give him certain competences. However, no evidence was shown that such competences and control were actually exercised by him.\n\n407.\n\nThus, there is not sufficient evidence of exercise **of actual control over CIOC** by Devincci Hourani. In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has not provided sufficient proof for control as required by Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal is not satisfied that a legal capacity to control a company, without evidence of an actual control, is enough in light of Devincci Hourani's characterisation of his purported investment in CIOC (see para. 358 above). However, as Article I(1)(a) of the BIT requires ownership *or* control of an investment and, based on indirect evidence, Claimant *could* be regarded as owned by Devincci Hourani, a U.S. national, the Tribunal moves now to analyse further conditions for treating CIOC as a U.S. national under the BIT.\n\n**(d) Is CIOC an Investment of Devincci Hourani?**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nEven if control had been shown, as discussed above, existence of an investment denotes an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit, and thus involving some degree of risk.\n\n409.\n\nIn answering the question whether CIOC is an investment of Devincci Hourani the Tribunal must first enquire whether Devincci Hourani made any contribution and took any risk. The elements are usually addressed individually for the sake of reasoning. However, at least in the context of the present case they are interdependent and therefore they will be assessed together hereafter.\n\n**(1) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n410.\n\nRespondent argues that Devincci Hourani made no contribution of money and assets of any significance, took no risk and, to the extent there were any assets invested by him, these assets were not invested in *bona fide.* (R-III, para. 40)\n\n411.\n\nAccording to Respondent, to satisfy the requirement of a contribution, the putative investor should show that it contributed a substantial financial resource or transfer of know-how, equipment and personnel. The price paid and a guarantee put up need to be substantial enough relative to the entire project to be considered an investment. Similarly, a nominal price paid for assets that purportedly amount to an investment raises doubts as to an existence of an investment and requires in-depth inquiry into the circumstances of the transaction. (R-III, para. 34)\n\n412.\n\nRespondent further argues that Devincci Hourani was not a viable **source of operating capital**. There is no evidence that CIOC looked to Devincci Hourani as a source of operating capital and that Devincci Hourani contributed any of his own assets to the operating expenses of the company. (R-III, para. 41)\n\n413.\n\nRespondent argues that the financial arrangements between CIOC, JOR and Devincci Hourani do not reveal the existence of a contribution or risk on the side of Devincci Hourani. Rather, they show that Devincci Hourani provided a front for the real parties in interest, namely JOR and its shareholders, including his brother Issam Hourani. Neither JOR nor Issam Hourani, nor Kassem Omar, another of JOR's shareholders, were of a nationality that could grant them access to ICSID arbitration. According to Respondent, CIOC was financed by JOR from its inception, even before JOR was formally registered. Financing by JOR agreed at the time the majority share in CIOC was owned by Fadi Hussein was secured mainly by a collateral pledge on CIOC's \u2018right to use natural resources under the Contract' and any transaction with respect to that collateral required JOR's written consent. In case of CIOC's default, JOR would gain control over the Contract. Thus, these arrangements gave JOR the actual control over CIOC and the Contract. (R-V, para. 34) Respondent contends that a personal pledge provided by Devincci Hourani has no substance. (R-V, para. 37) Further, the explanation given by Devincci Hourani concerning Kassem Omar's purchase of an 8 % share in CIOC in lieu of interest on the loans to JOR is not credible. (R-V, paras. 38-43)\n\n414.\n\nIn Respondent's opinion, Devincci Hourani had no **expertise** to contribute to CIOC. He could not have acquired valuable expertise working at Kulandy, since he was at the same time managing a Central Asian branch of a medical equipment company and was required to reside in the U.S. awaiting his citizenship. Section 1430 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code of Laws requires a person seeking citizenship to be a permanent resident in the U.S. for at least three years and spend at least one half of the time of the permanent residency physically in the U.S., including all of the three months immediately preceding the application. (R-III, para. 41) At the time when he allegedly was gaining his experience he was living in the U.S. and spending less than three months a year in Kazakhstan. (R-V, para. 30)\n\n415.\n\nRespondent argues that, given the absence of evidence of any other contribution by Devincci Hourani to CIOC, the nominal amount, equivalent to USD 6,500, paid by him for a 92 % share in CIOC calls for an inquiry into the circumstances of the transaction. Respondent purports that all that is known is that Devincci Hourani neither made any substantial contribution nor took any risk. Moreover, in Respondent's opinion, it shows that CIOC did not acquire the Contract in good faith and that other persons and entities, not the nominal CIOC shareholders, are the real investors in the project. It therefore shows that Devincci Hourani's nominal ownership and control over CIOC was created only to gain access to international arbitration.\n\n416.\n\nExistence of risk requires the use of an investor's own financial means at its own financial risk, with the objective of making a profit within a given period of time. For the risk to be present the investor must commit financial resources at the initial phase of the project. (R-III, para. 35)\n\n417.\n\nSince as Respondent maintains Devincci Hourani did not make any financial commitments, invested nothing of significance in the CIOC and paid only nominal amount for his share in the company, he also took no risk. He was not able to personally recoup the profits of CIOC and his participation was more that of an employee. (R-III, para. 42)\n\n418.\n\nAs, according to Respondent, Devincci Hourani did not contribute anything of legitimate value to CIOC and took no risk, there was no legitimate business motive underlying the purchases of his share in CIOC. The only thing of value he had to offer was his U.S. nationality. Thus, Respondent points out the transactions are to be explained only by the motivation to gain access to ICSID arbitration by virtue of Devincci Hourani's U.S. nationality. This is reflected by the **timing** of the transaction, only five months after CIOC was cited for underperformance of the Contract. As CIOC was blacklisted for having low performance rate a year and a half later, it is also obvious in Respondent's view that Devincci Hourani did not purchase his share in the company to turn it around. (R-III, para. 43-44) The only motive for acquisition of his share in CIOC was to transform any emerging dispute as to the project into an international dispute subject to ICSID arbitration under the BIT. Respondent maintains that for this reason his purchase of the share was not a *bona fide* transaction and does not deserve international law protection. (R-III, para. 45)\n\n419.\n\nRespondent further argues that CIOC is a creation of **Issam Hourani**, brother of Devincci Hourani. Issam Hourani cooperated with CCC in the bid for the Contract and according to Respondent later pushed CCC out of the project. Respondent contends that CIOC is a company set up for the purpose of the assignment of the Contract and it allegedly acquired the Contract by corporate raiding of CCC. Its capitalisation was only USD 6,500 and its founder, Fadi Hussein, was a young relative of Issam Hourani with no funds or expertise in the industry. Furthermore, Respondent holds that CIOC received its financing almost entirely from JOR, a Lebanese company owned by Issam Hourani. As a collateral for its financing from JOR, CIOC pledged all of its rights under the Contract. The costs of financing were initially very high (50 % interest) but were later reduced to zero. Issam Hourani is a Kazakh citizen and is thus not eligible for the protection of international law. Respondent asserts that thus Issam Hourani sought to acquire protection of the BIT by transferring the shares to Devincci Hourani. The transaction therefore lacks *bona fides* and does not deserve protection. (R-IV, para. 21)\n\n420.\n\nBecause Issam Hourani was a Kazakh citizen, he thus sought to create an international protection for CIOC by placing its shares first in the hands of his cousin, Fadi Hussein, a Danish citizen, and then his brother, Devincci Hourani, a U.S. citizen. According to Respondent, CIOC was treated as a Hourani family business at the time the Contract was transferred from CCC to CIOC. In Respondent\u2019s view there is no explanation for Devincci Hourani\u2019s purchase of CIOC\u2019 s shares for a low price and obtaining of completely non-commercial financing terms from JOR other than that he was acting on behalf of somebody else and providing them with the benefit of his U.S. nationality. (R-V, paras. 26-28) Shortly after he was granted U.S. citizenship, Devincci Hourani purchased shares in Kulandy Energy from his brother Issam Hourani. He did not remember how much money he paid for a 100 % share in that company, not even whether it was more than a million dollars. He admitted that he had never visited the oil field of Kulandy Energy. (R-V, para. 31)\n\n**(2) Claimant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n421.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position throughout this arbitration was that the issue whether Devincci Hourani made an investment in CIOC is not part of the applicable legal test. This position was based on the assumption that Claimant\u2019s submission of its Request for Arbitration constitutes an agreement by which the parties have agreed to treat a transaction as an investment and to treat Claimant as a national of another Contracting State. Thus, Claimant concentrated on the legal test provided in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the issue whether CIOC made an investment in Kazakhstan. (C-IV, para. 18; C-V, para. 119)\n\n422.\n\nHowever, Claimant agrees that the term investment has some inherent meaning, even though the characteristics of investments recognised by investment tribunals should not be understood as jurisdictional requirements. (C-IV, para. 24)\n\n423.\n\nClaimant submits that it presented documents and witness statements to show that Devincci Hourani invested in CIOC not only by way of payment of the purchase price for his share in CIOC but also by taking up a personal guarantee for loans owed by CIOC to JOR.\n\n**(3) Tribunal's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n***(i) Did Devincci Hourani Make Any Contribution to CIOC?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Parties argued extensively the issue of Devincci Hourani\u2019s contribution to CIOC, discussing his alleged contribution of money, leverage and managerial skills. The main reason for such an extensive discussion was the fact that Devincci Hourani paid only a nominal price for his 92 % share in CIOC.\n\n425.\n\nWith regard to the evidence regarding the existence of contribution, the tribunal notes that in the document production procedure, Respondent requested documentary evidence of:\n\na) the source of funds invested in the project (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 11-12, request 2),\n\nb) any loans made to CIOC and any guarantees related to these loans (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 13-16, requests 3 and 4),\n\nc) payment by Devincci Hourani for the shares in CIOC (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 1620, request 5),\n\nd) the source of funds used by Devincci Hourani to pay for the shares in CIOC (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 20-22, request 6),\n\ne) any minutes of the meetings of CIOC\u2019s board of Directors and/or shareholders (PO-2, Annex 2, pp. 24, 26-27, 30-32) concerning\n\ni. any investment in the project, and\n\nii. any loans to or by CIOC.\n\n426.\n\nThe requests a), b) and e) were granted. No documents were provided by Claimant.\n\n427.\n\nRequests c) and d) were denied. However, given that the documents concerning these issues were seized by Respondent the Tribunal authorised Respondent to access them. No documents were produced.\n\n428.\n\nParticularly regarding the requested documents evidencing the source of funds used by Devincci Hourani to acquire the shares in CIOC in request 6 of Annex 2 to PO-2 (Respondent\u2019s Redfern Schedule, p. 20), the following is recalled.\n\n429.\n\nClaimant maintained that such documents were neither material nor relevant to the proceedings and in any event, that they had been seized by Respondent as they had been kept in Devincci Hourani\u2019s office in 92a Palezhayeva Street in Almaty, which had been raided by Kazakh officials.\n\n430.\n\nRespondent maintained that the requested documents were relevant and material to the proceedings and that these documents should be in the possession, custody or control of Devincci Hourani. However, if the Tribunal concluded that this was not the case, Respondent requested authorisation from the Tribunal to consult the seized documents in order to locate the requested documents.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the documents at issue were in Respondent\u2019s possession and control. Furthermore, it did not see a basis for granting the requested authorisation, but gave such authorisation should it be needed. The document production request was denied.\n\n432.\n\nAnyhow, no documents were produced.\n\n433.\n\nIndeed, the nominal price, if any, paid for the acquisition of the shares raises doubts about the existence of an investment in which at least USD 9.4 million had already been sunk, especially if it is the only element of the transaction. In such situation the Tribunal is required to review closely the circumstances of the transaction.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the above approach has also been taken by other ICSID tribunals including the *Phoenix Action* tribunal (para. 119, RL-20) and the **Saba Fakes** tribunal (para. 121 and 147, CLA-101). Regarding the latter, as noted above, it differs from the present case in so far as that tribunal found there was no legal transfer of ownership while in the present case this Tribunal has found that the jurisdiction does not fail on the lack of proof of ownership. However, the **Saba Fakes** tribunal concluded in its award, an only nominal price of only a few thousand US dollars paid cannot be reconciled with the significance of the underlying business as expressed in Claimant's valuation of the alleged investment and the relief sought in that respect. This Tribunal notes that, while that is not an ICSID case, this approach is also confirmed by the tribunal in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic*39 which is referred to in the *Phoenix* decision submitted by Respondent. In *Toto v. Lebanon*40, at paragraph 84, the tribunal made the following observation: \" *[I]n the absence of specific criteria or definitions in the ICSID Convention, the underlying concept of investment, which is economical in nature, becomes relevant: it implies an economical operation initiated and conducted by an entrepreneur using its own financial means and at its own financial risk, with the objective of making a profit within a given period of time*.\"\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S.A. v. The Dominican Republic*, LCIA Case No. UN 7927 (UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction of 19 September 2008, para. 36.\n\n*Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 September 2009.\n\n435.\n\nIndeed, payment of only a nominal price and lack of any other contribution by the purported investor must be seen as an indication that the investment was not an economic arrangement, is not covered by the term \u2018investment' as used in the BIT, and thus is an arrangement not protected by the BIT.\n\n436.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal recalls from its examination of ownership above that there is no direct evidence that Devincci Hourani actually paid even the nominal amount for the shares, but that Respondent was in control of the relevant documents which may establish payment. Given that Respondent did not present such evidence, and did not dispute that Devincci Hourani was at least formally the majority owner of CIOC, the Tribunal has inferred from that, as well as from indirect evidence, that jurisdiction cannot be denied in the present case simply due to lack of proof that Devincci Hourani paid the purchase price.\n\n437.\n\nHowever, as already mentioned, the purchase price for the 92 % share in CIOC was the nominal price of USD 6,500-equivalent in the local currency, namely 920,000 tenge. The total charter capital of CIOC is 1,000,000 tenge. (C-173, C-174) CIOC claims USD 1,145 billion plus interest in damages in this arbitration in connection with its main economic activity - performance of the Contract. (C-VI, para. 219) When Devincci Hourani allegedly purchased his share in CIOC, CIOC was already a holder of the Contract for which it paid approximately USD 9.4 million. (WS Omar Antar, para. 39; Devincci Hourani, Tr, day 4, pp. 153-155) These facts necessarily raise doubts as to Devincci Hourani's investment in CIOC and require the Tribunal to analyse the circumstances of the transactions. A putative transaction to pay USD 6,500 for 92 % for an enterprise into which over USD 10 million have been invested41 and for which later a relief of over USD 1 billion is sought calls for explanation and justification.\n\nCIOC paid USD 9.4 million for the concession and by May 2004 JOR invested USD 2.6 million into CIOC and was committed to provide further USD 12.4 million.\n\n438.\n\nNo documentation was provided concerning the valuation of CIOC\u2019s share for the purpose of its purchase by Devincci Hourani. Devincci Hourani did not answer questions concerning such valuations.42 Neither Fadi Hussein nor Waheeb Antakly seem to have been interested in selling their participation for a market price. Devincci Hourani testified that only after he bought his share in CIOC he found out about the USD 9.4 million paid by CIOC to CCC for the Contract. (Tr, day 4, pp. 153-154) With regard to the share purchase from Waheeb Antakly, Devincci Hourani answered that he did not know how much Waheeb Antakly paid for his shareholding in CIOC as well when he became shareholder of CIOC. Devincci Hourani stated that \" *[m]aybe I was never really interested in trying to find out.* \" (Tr, day 4, pp. 160-161)\n\nAsked whether, when purchasing a share in CIOC, he had \" *a valuation or an idea in your mind as to what you think the company was worth* \" Devincci Hourani answered, \" *I can't really answer that, because when you are involved in such a big deal, it wasn't just peanuts.* \" (Tr, day 4, p. 158) Similarly, asked about the fair market value of CIOC as of 1 February 2008, at the time the Contract was terminated, Devincci Hourani said, \" *I couldn't put a figure on the fair market value of the company in March of 2008, but I know that we had proven reserves (...). Now, I don't know how many billions it would be (...). That is really a question that would need to be put to experts, to perhaps engineers. I mean, my experts have put figures on paper and they've been very high. But, I mean, it's difficult to be precise*.\" (Tr, day 4, pp. 158-160) Asked whether the amount of the proven reserves as of February 2008 was greater than what was known in the Soviet times, Devincci Hourani answered, \" *I fear that if I were to answer that question I might misinform you. I'm not an engineer. I think it would be more appropriate to put that question to an engineer.* \" (Tr, day 4, p. 160)\n\n***(ii) Personal Guarantee by Devincci Hourani***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nWith reference to the low purchase price, Devincci Hourani explained that \" *all sorts of obligations were associated with that* \" that \" *there was a personal risk involved, a personal obligation vis-a-vis JOR and others.* \" (Tr, day 4, p. 156) He referred to \" *debt I took on* \", \" *tens of millions of dollars that are still a noose around my neck that have to be returned to Fadi Hussein and to JOR Investment.* \" (Tr, day 4, p. 157)\n\n440.\n\nNo evidence was presented of any debt owed by Devincci Hourani to Fadi Hussein.\n\n441.\n\nClaimant further explained the above:\n\n*\"... cash alone did not reflect what he* [i.e. Devincci Hourani] *invested. To acquire his shares, he personally guaranteed the company debt, then held by JOR Investment, a Lebanese company. Kassem Omar, the principal owner of JOR (with his brother) and a Hourani relative, also took 8 % equity interest in CIOC, partly in exchange for cancelling interest on loans to CIOC and providing an additional line of credit on very favourable terms.\"* (C-VI, para. 46)\n\n442.\n\nThe only document presented in relation to Devincci Hourani's \u2018personal guarantee' is a one-page document dated 1 June 2004 and signed between Devincci Hourani and JOR.43 (WS 2 Devincci Hourani, Exhibit 8) The document contains the following obligations:\n\n*\"1. Beginning in the second year of commercial production period at Caratube Oil field the first party* [i.e. JOR] *will pay, from his own personal income gained as net profit from the sale of the mentioned production, to the second party* [i.e. Devincci Hourani] *annual instalments of 20 percent of the loan amount in addition to 14 percent interest rate on the above 20 percent.*\n\n*2. The second party* [i.e. Devincci Hourani] *commits himself to pay all loans with* *the 14 percent annual interest with 10 years from the beginning of the second year of commercial production.\"*\n\nRespondent commented on this document in its Rejoinder (R-IV, para. 41).\n\n443.\n\nIf the agreement is to be seen as evidence of a personal guarantee by Devincci Hourani of debts owed by CIOC to JOR, the first paragraph of the agreement seems to contain an error, mixing up creditor and debtor. Assuming that it is a typographical error, Devincci Hourani's guarantee of the debt does not contain any contribution. He promises to use the profits from the investment to repay the loan. This does not explain how that promise can constitute a contribution to the investment in the first place.\n\n444.\n\nHowever, this is not the only problem with the above document. No explanation has been provided what \" *his own personal income gained as net profit from the sale of the (...) production* \" is. As a shareholder, there is no evidence that he is entitled to anything more than a dividend.\n\n445.\n\nThe agreement refers to a loan agreement no. 2K-02 between JOR and CIOC dated 2 December 2002, i.e. from the first year of CIOC's corporate history, when Fadi Hussein held either 100 % or a majority share in CIOC. On the basis of that loan agreement JOR granted CIOC a loan of USD 15 million at 14 % interest p.a., to be repaid by 5 December 2007. That loan agreement was secured by CIOC's pledge of \" *its rights to use natural resources under the Contract* \" and CIOC's obligation not to perform any transaction with respect to that collateral without the written consent of JOR. Thus, if Devincci Hourani added his \u2018personal guarantee' to the above collateral, the \u2018personal guarantee' would be securing the same amount (loan plus interest) to be repaid from dividends Devincci Hourani would receive after CIOC has already paid the same amount. There is no economic sense in such \u2018personal guarantee'. More importantly, it does not constitute a contribution from the perspective of CIOC or, for that matter, an additional security to JOR. With or without Devincci Hourani's \u2018personal guarantee' the economic undertaking between CIOC and JOR remains unchanged.\n\n446.\n\nMore importantly, in the Financial Assistance Agreement dated 3 November 2004 and signed between CIOC and JOR, JOR granted CIOC a loan of USD 25 million to be repaid by 10 November 2014. (WS 2 Devincci Hourani, Exhibit 9) This time the loan was interest-free. This loan was signed at the time when Devincci Hourani held an 85 % share in CIOC. The Financial Assistance Agreement states (in Section 8.2) that:\n\n*\"All previous written and verbal agreements, pertaining to the subject and conditions of the present Agreement, are no longer valid, after the parties sign the present Agreement.\"*\n\nThus, the Financial Assistance Agreement annulled the agreement of 2 December 2002 and established a new, unsecured, obligation between CIOC and JOR.44 As a result, the agreement of 1 June 2004 refers to and \u2018secures' a loan agreement that was annulled shortly after Devincci Hourani signed the \u2018personal guarantee.'\n\nThe documents do not confirm Devincci Hourani's testimony that the loan of USD 25 million was additional to the previous loan of USD 15 million. (Devincci Hourani, Tr, day 4, pp. 177-178)\n\n447.\n\nThe timing of the \u2018personal guarantee' is also problematic. It is dated 1 June 2004 but refers to a meeting between CIOC and JOR of 25 November 2006, during which CIOC and JOR decided to cancel interest from the agreement no. 2K-02. CIOC and JOR signed an agreement to cancel the interest rate from the USD 15 million loan in an agreement dated 4 December 2006. (WS 2 Devincci Hourani, Exhibit 10) Thus, it seems that the agreement between Devincci Hourani and JOR was signed in 2006 rather than 2004. This also does not clarify the issue of Devincci Hourani's alleged investment in CIOC and does not answer the questions why the share purchase price was so low and what his other contribution to CIOC was.\n\n448.\n\nAnother aspect of Devincci Hourani's \u2018personal guarantee' of CIOC's debts is that no evidence was provided that JOR ever tried to enforce the security against him or against CIOC, once the problems with the Caratube project started.\n\n449.\n\nThere is also no evidence that Kassem Omar acquired the 8 % share in CIOC, on the basis of the share purchase agreement dated 18 May 2006, in return for cancelling the interest rate on the loan between JOR and CIOC. Even assuming that the loan was still in place, there is no evidence that Kassem Omar's purchase of shares was connected with the financial arrangements between Devincci Hourani and JOR. First, Kassem Omar did not purchase the share from Devincci Hourani but from Fadi Hussein, who still owned an 8 % share at the time. Secondly, Kassem Omar treated the purchase as \" *my investment in the company* \". In relation to the fact that JOR's office in Kazakhstan was in the same building as the offices of CIOC, he explained, \" *In addition, as an officer of JOR Investment Inc., the Lebanese company that was providing financing to CIOC for its investment into the field, I was also kept aware of developments in CIOC's monetary expenditure.* \" (WS Kassem Omar, para. 12) Thus, Kassem Omar's statement does not confirm that his shareholding in CIOC was anyhow connected with JOR's financing to CIOC.\n\n450.\n\nFrom the above it follows that the evidence presented does not confirm that Devincci Hourani's alleged contribution to CIOC as his investment included a substantial personal guarantee of CIOC's debt to JOR. His alleged personal guarantee referred to a loan that was annulled by the parties. Even assuming that the loan was still in place, it was already secured on the same assets and revenue stream. Devincci Hourani\u2019s alleged personal guarantee did not contribute anything to the economic arrangement existing between CIOC and JOR.\n\n451.\n\nThere is also no evidence that Devincci Hourani\u2019s contribution constituted of his knowhow or managerial skills. Devincci Hourani admitted himself that:\n\n*\"Other than when I was the Director of CIOC I have not been actively involved in the day to day running of CIOC.\"* (First WS Devincci Hourani, para. 18)\n\n452.\n\nCIOC was not an ordinary business venture. It was set up to operate an oil concession the value of which CIOC now claims to be over USD 1 billion. Yet CIOC\u2019s nominal share capital is 1,000,000 tenge according to Article 4.1 of CIOC\u2019s Charter, i.e. about USD 7,000 (C-174) and it employs a maximum of 50 persons.45 CIOC\u2019s shares were always held by individuals. Nothing is known about any substantial contribution by any of those individuals, neither in terms of money, nor assets or know-how. Fadi Hussein\u2019s total contribution to CIOC was USD 11,000. Both Fadi Hussein and Waheeb Antakly sold their shares for their nominal value and if any valuation was made in connection with those transactions, none was presented. No evidence of payment of even those nominal amounts was presented.\n\nArticle 1.15 of its Charter describes it as \" *small business with an average annual number of employees not exceeding 50 people* \" (C-174).\n\n453.\n\nCIOC purchased its main asset, the Contract, from CCC and allegedly paid USD 9.4 million. No documentary evidence of this purchase price and its payment was provided. From the time of its establishment JOR was the main capital provider to CIOC. It was contributing to CIOC before CIOC finalised the transfer of the Contract from CCC and before JOR itself was formally registered in Lebanon. At the time Devincci Hourani purchased his share in CIOC, JOR provided CIOC with open credit lines of USD 15 million. The loan was granted at 14 % interest p.a. but CIOC never paid any interest under the loan agreements. (Tr, day 4, p. 169) The interest was ultimately cancelled.\n\n454.\n\nChange of shareholding did not have any impact on the relationship between CIOC and JOR. In January and April 2004, shortly before Devincci Hourani acquired 85 % of the shares, JOR transferred USD 6 million to CIOC.46\n\nAccording to a table showing investments in favour of CIOC from 2001 to 2007, on 14 January 2004 JOR transferred almost USD 1.8 million and on 12 April 2004 JOR transferred USD 4.2 million (R-105).\n\n455.\n\nFrom the above considerations it follows that, even if Devincci Hourani acquired formal ownership and nominal control over CIOC, no plausible economic motive was given to explain the negligible purchase price he paid for the shares and any other kind of interest and to explain his investment in CIOC. No evidence was presented of a contribution of any kind or any risk undertaken by Devincci Hourani. There was no capital flow between him and CIOC that contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC.\n\n456.\n\nClaimant insisted that the origin of capital used in investments is immaterial. This is correct, however, the capital must still be linked to the person purporting to have made an investment. In this case there is not even evidence of such a link.\n\n457.\n\nClaimant insisted throughout the proceedings that it presented all necessary evidence to prove that the Tribunal has jurisdiction. The Tribunal disagrees. Claimant failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of U.S. national (Devincci Hourani) as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT. At the least, the Tribunal is not satisfied that Claimant has established the fact of that investment.\n\n***(iii) Bona Fides***\n----------------------\n\n458.\n\nRespondent devoted a substantial part of its submission on jurisdiction to the issue of *bona fides.* It followed the **Phoenix Action** tribunal which included \u2018assets invested *bona fides* \u2019 in its list of elements that have to be taken into account in determining whether an investment can benefit from international protection of ICSID. (**Phoenix Action**, para. 114, RL-20)\n\n459.\n\nIn this context, Claimant, as mentioned above in the respective summary, emphasises with regard to the additional criterion mentioned in *Phoenix Action* that an investment has to be made *bona fide*, that no tribunal has treated this criterion as a mandatory requirement. Claimant substantiates the argument that the so-called *Salini* criteria have not been established as a formal set of requirements that must be met by relying on numerous arbitral decisions and awards as well as several scholarly writings. (C-IV, paras. 17, 21-22, 24; C-V, paras. 130, 133-134, 136-146, 148, notes 256 and 257)\n\n460.\n\nRelying on ICSID awards, Respondent argued that the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention - promotion of private investment in a balanced way - serves the interests of host States and investors. Protection under the Convention is available if an investment qualifies as such and has actually been made by a private party who itself qualifies as an investor under the terms of the Convention. States cannot be deemed to have consented to grant protection to investments not made in good faith. Acquisition of an investment must be a **bona fide** transaction. In the absence of a **bona fide** transaction there can be no ICSID jurisdiction. (R-IV, paras. 8-12)\n\n461.\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments with regard to lack of good faith in the circumstances of the present case concentrated on the following three issues:\n\na) CIOC\u2019s investment in the Contract was not *bona fides* because the Contract had been acquired by corporate raiding.\n\nb) Devincci Hourani\u2019s investment in CIOC was not *bona fides* because he was not the real person in control.\n\nc) Devincci Hourani\u2019s investment in CIOC was not *bona fides* because its only motivation was for CIOC to acquire protection granted by the BIT.\n\n462.\n\nRegarding the first issue, Claimant notes that until this arbitration \" *[t]here was not even a* *whisper from CCC, or anyone else for that matter, that CCC had somehow been \"corporate raided\" out of the project by Issam Hourani* \". (R-V, para. 43) In Claimant\u2019s opinion, it would simply defy common sense that the Hourani family could pressure the multi-national, multi-billion dollar business CCC into refusing to cooperate with Respondent or to retreat from the Caratube concession. Claimant purports that the evidence does not support such a conclusion. The Tribunal agrees that, given the economic strength of the parties involved, a raid has neither been shown nor does it seem probable. However, this does not, by itself, prove *bona fides*. This is not an issue arising under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In the present case it is a question whether CIOC was itself an investment of Devincci Hourani. Since Claimant has not stepped successfully over the threshold jurisdictional question concerning CIOC's nationality, there is no need of addressing the issue of CIOC's investment in Kazakhstan.\n\n463.\n\nThe second issue is directly linked to the issue whether CIOC was an investment of Devincci Hourani and the Tribunal agrees that this is an important point in the present context. If Claimant had presented sufficient evidence to show that it was an investment of Devincci Hourani, the Tribunal would have to address the doubts raised by Respondent with regard to this issue. This is, however, not necessary, given that Claimant's evidence does not support a conclusion that CIOC was an investment of Devincci Hourani.\n\n464.\n\nThe third issue raises an important point, which prompted some previous ICSID tribunals to deny jurisdiction.\n\n465.\n\nIn the present case it could indeed be argued that the acquisition of a share in CIOC by Devincci Hourani for a nominal consideration in 2004 took place at a time when notices were being served to CIOC for underperformance rendering CIOC liable to have the exploration contract terminated. The evidence relating to the circumstances surrounding this acquisition could lead to the inference that the sole rationale for Devincci Hourani's belated involvement in CIOC was to invoke later the ICSID jurisdiction in order to seek BIT protection through ICSID, which would otherwise not have been available to either Lebanese or Kazakh investors, who would appear from the evidence to be the real investors. However, the Tribunal concludes that it does not have to rely on such a speculation and that there is not sufficient proof in the present case that the nationality shelter was the exclusive motivation for the transaction.\n\n466.\n\nRegarding the relevance of the motivation for a transaction, this Tribunal is aware of the decision of the tribunal in *Saluka v. The Czech Republic*47 that the definition of investment in the applicable BIT did not make the investor's motivation part of the definition of investment (CLA-50, cf. para. 209). However, as seen above, Claimant was first required to show the existence of an at least plausible economic motivation in Devincci Hourani's alleged investment in CIOC. Since no plausible economic motivation has been shown by Claimant, and in view of Claimant's burden of proof, the Tribunal is not obliged to enquire what the real motivation behind Devincci Hourani's purchase of the shares in CIOC was.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules/PCA, Partial Award of 17 March 2006.\n\n467.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that no further examination of the issues of *bona fides* and good faith is required in the present case.\n\n**J.IV. Conclusion on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nResulting from the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the facts presented and proved by Claimant do not satisfy Claimant's burden of proof to establish jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n469.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it does not have jurisdiction over the claims raised in this case.\n\n470.\n\nThis conclusion also means that the Tribunal does not have to consider the further arguments of the Parties regarding admissibility and regarding the merits of the dispute because they are moot.\n\n471.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that, while in view of the above conclusion of the Tribunal, in hindsight, it would have been more cost-efficient had the further submissions regarding admissibility and regarding the merits not been made and examined in the hearing, it must be recalled that\n\n\\* according to sections 14.1 to 3. of the Minutes of the 1st Session, the Parties agreed that a bifurcation of the procedure with a first phase only regarding jurisdiction would only take place if Repondent so requested by 14 July 2009,\n\n\\* and that, by its letter of 9 July 2009, Respondent gave notification that it did not request bifurcation;\n\n\\* this declaration by Respondent was later amended in footnote 7 to the Counter-Memorial (p. 11): \" *The Republic did not request the bifurcation of these proceedings, since it concluded that the Tribunal needed factual information in order to assess these objections* [to jurisdiction] *and such information was best presented with the merits of the case. This however does not mean that the Republic considers these objections to be less serious, and the Republic therefore asks the Tribunal to uphold the objections and to refrain from considering the merits of the case.* \"\n\n\\* the result is that a one phase procedure including both the jurisdiction and the merits of the case was conducted on the basis of the agreement of the Parties.\n\n**K. Considerations Regarding Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**K.I. Claimant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n472.\n\nRegarding costs, Claimant seeks an order by the Tribunal directing Kazakhstan to pay all costs incurred in connection with the arbitral proceedings and further all legal and other expenses incurred by Claimant on a full indemnity basis. Furthermore, Claimant seeks interest at a reasonable rate from the date on which the costs are incurred to the date of payment. (C-I, para. 86; C-IV, para. 285; C-V, para. 377)\n\n473.\n\nIn Claimant's Application for Costs of 7 November 2011, Claimant requests a total amount of fees and costs of USD 5,948,908.25. (C-VIII, paras. 2, 15)\n\n474.\n\nClaimant holds that the requested costs have been \" ***significantly reduced***  *from the full value of attorney time devoted to this matter* \" (emphasis in original) as they only comprise amounts that have already been billed and paid under an alternative fee arrangement. (C-VIII, para. 5) Claimant further points out that its initial counsel Allen & Overy LLP had billed Claimant based on reduced hourly rates and additional writedowns. (C-VIII, para. 6)\n\n475.\n\nClaimant submitted its comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs on 18 November 2011 claiming that \" *it contains a number of unsupported accusations, distortions and misstatements* \" which Claimant subsequently addresses in its comments. (C-IX, para. 1)\n\n476.\n\nClaimant invokes Article 27.6 of the Contract to submit that in accordance with the Parties' agreement in the Contract the unsuccessful party should bear the costs of the proceedings. (C-IX, para. 2)\n\n477.\n\nClaimant further contests Respondent's overall costs exceeding USD 15 million and holds that it is evident that Respondent has not conducted the necessary review and evaluation of the time and billings of counsel to ensure that Respondent's costs are reasonable. (C-IX, paras. 4, 6)\n\n478.\n\nClaimant further comments on each of Respondent's specific cost claims one by one and details why, in Claimant's opinion, Respondent's request for an award of costs and fees should be rejected. These specific claims relate *inter alia* to the handover and request for provisional measures, to document production and withdrawal, proceedings in a U.S. Court, requests for witness examination and immunity, and Claimant's request for an extension. (C-IX, paras. 8-24)\n\n**K.II. Respondent's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to order CIOC to reimburse Respondent for all reasonable costs and expenses related to these arbitral proceedings including without limitation legal fees and expert fees. (R-III, para. 468; R-IV, para. 648; R-V, para. 191)\n\n480.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs dated 7 November 2011, Respondent requests to be reimbursed for its costs totalling USD 15,675,206.71. (R-VII, paras. 4, 49) Respondent holds that this is in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as in its opinion no contrary agreement of the Parties exists. (R-VII, para. 4)\n\n481.\n\nRespondent further emphasises that its costs were \" *reasonably incurred (\u2026) in connection with these proceedings and out of necessity to defend its interests* \" in the present case. Moreover, Respondent alleges that Claimant acted \" *improperly* \" and brought \" *extravagant claims* \" before the Tribunal. (R-VII, para. 49)\n\n482.\n\nRespondent comments on Claimant's Application for Costs on 18 November 2011, holding that the alternative fee arrangement between Claimant and its counsel cannot serve as a basis to evaluate whether Respondent's fees and expenses regarding its counsel were reasonable. (R-VIII, para. 3)\n\n483.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent maintains that the costs of the proceedings should be awarded against Claimant, noting that Claimant did not identify any separate procedural action by Respondent resulting in additional time and costs while Respondent attributed almost 20 % of its costs to be the result of Claimant's \" *multiple maneuvers, unsuccessful requests and improper conduct* \". (R-VIII, para. 4)\n\n484.\n\nLastly, Respondent criticises certain specific cost claims by Claimant as unnecessary and unreasonable such as the costs incurred in relation to the attendance of Rakhat Aliyev at the Hearing in Paris and costs incurred for unidentified third-party consultants. (R-VIII, para. 5)\n\n**K.III.The Tribunal's Decision**\n---------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nEach of the Parties' costs submissions claimed full actual costs were that party successful, with Claimant disclosing the existence, but not the terms, of an additional success fee arrangement. Respondent's claim was for professional fees for some 31,000 hours, and expenses, to the total of USD 11,387 million, USD 950,000 ICSID deposits and other witnesses' and experts' fees and reports and expenses to the total of USD 15,675 million.\n\n486.\n\nClaimant's fees and expenses, expressed to be discounted and, apart from the element of success fee, was USD 5,948 million, plus USD 975,000 paid to ICSID (including USD 25,000 representing the case registration fee).\n\n487.\n\nIn the result Claimant has failed on the first hurdle of jurisdiction. With the wisdom of hindsight, the majority of the costs and expenses of each party and of the dispute, both in duration and expense, would have been avoided had Respondent opted for bifurcation and the preliminary determination of its equivalent of Rule 41(1) objections under the Rules.\n\n488.\n\nIn this regard, the savings in costs and expenses would have enured both for the benefit of Respondent, in defeating the claims on the threshold issue had it had the confidence to take that course, and for Claimant, who would have had its claim disposed at this initial level. Indeed, upon analysis, none of the experts' reports, directed to the subjects of technical, valuation, political and even authentication, and also the proceedings in the U.S. Courts for documentary disclosure would need to have been engaged. And the initial (and as we now know, dispositive) hearings on jurisdiction would have been shorter and focussed.\n\n489.\n\nFew of the score or more of counsel and experts on each side would have needed to attend over the extended two weeks of hearings engaging on the merits. In retrospect, apart from short parts of the opening, closing and post-hearing submissions, almost the entire hearings were directed to merits rather than jurisdictional issues, in a proportion of more or less 9:1.\n\n490.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal takes as its reference point for its assessment the level of reasonable rather than actual costs. No doubt Respondent's legal team has committed 31,000 hours to the matter, roughly 3,750 working days or 10 working years. As most of this effort was devoted to issues related to the merits, the advantage of electing for a bifurcated procedure is confirmed by the later events.\n\n491.\n\nFurther, Respondent also contends that in any event Claimant should bear the costs of applications for interim measures, contested disclosures of documents, including Redfern Schedules, U.S. discovery proceedings, hand-over issues and the authentication of documents proffered and later withdrawn by Claimant, and other procedural skirmishes.\n\n492.\n\nAs the Tribunal has determined this dispute short of any findings on the merits, even on cost issues it cannot make any informed allocation of responsibilities for costs.\n\n493.\n\nFurther, although the Tribunal did not order interim issues, on any view the actions of regulatory authorities during the pendency of this matter were aggressive, and even confrontational, as for example, steps being foreshadowed to wind up Claimant whilst the post-hearing procedures were engaged.\n\n494.\n\nDoing the best it can on having regard to these factors, and the entire course of the robust pursuit by each party of it entitlement to contest, and to defend, exhaustively on each issue, the Tribunal regards it as appropriate to abate Respondent's amount of actual costs and expenses to an estimated proportion more obviously related to jurisdictional issues. It is also to take account of an estimate of Claimant's corresponding costs on merits issues which might not have been incurred were jurisdiction first determined.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is that Respondent is to be awarded costs and expenses of USD 3 million, together with recovery of USD 200,000 from amounts paid as ICSID costs, to a total of USD 3.2 million.\n\n(**For convenience, the decisions and signatures of this Award are printed hereafter on a separate page)**\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n**The Tribunal decides and orders that:**\n\n**1.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 2, 2012, Caratube International Oil Company LLP filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID an application requesting the annulment of the Award of the Tribunal rendered on June 5, 2012 in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12 in the arbitration proceeding between CIOC and the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\n2.\n\nCIOC\u2019s Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn October 5, 2012, the Secretary-General registered the Application and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties on the same date. In that Notice, the Secretary-General observed that the Application contained a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings. The Secretary-General informed the parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed, pursuant to Rule 54(2).\n\n4.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the Centre informed the parties of the ensuing recommendation to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the appointment of Mr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (Spain), Tan Sri Dato Cecil W.M. Abraham (Malaysia), and Judge Hans Danelius (Sweden) to the ad hoc Committee, each of whom was designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by his State of nationality.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of November 12, 2012, in accordance with Rule 52(2), the Secretary-General notified the parties that the ad hoc Committee was constituted and was composed of Mr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, as President, Tan Sri Dato Cecil W.M. Abraham and Judge Hans Danelius, as members. The parties were also informed that Ms. Milanka Kostadinova, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary.\n\n6.\n\nOn December 10, 2012, Applicant filed a request to the Committee to continue the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until rendition of the Committee\u2019s decision on the annulment application.\n\n7.\n\nOn December 14, 2012, the Secretary wrote to the parties, on behalf of the Committee, inviting Respondent\u2019s comments on Applicant\u2019s request for continuing stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 10, 2013, Respondent submitted observations on Applicant\u2019s request. Respondent consented to the stay, but requested that the Committee order Applicant to provide a bank guarantee or other equivalent security for the amount due under the Award.\n\n9.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, the Committee held its first session by telephone conference. Procedural Order No. 1 was issued on January 17, 2013. In order to give the parties an opportunity to fully present their observations on the issue of continuing stay of enforcement, the Committee invited Applicant and Respondent to file a further round of written observations by January 21, 2013 and by January 31, 2013, respectively.\n\n10.\n\nOn January 21, 2013, Applicant filed its response to Respondent\u2019s observations of January 10, 2013, concerning the request for continuing stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n11.\n\nOn January 25, 2013, CIOC filed a Memorial on Annulment.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 31, 2013, Kazakhstan filed further observations on the request for continuing stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 14, 2013, the Committee, having duly deliberated and carefully analyzed each party\u2019s position on the stay request, issued its Decision on Applicant\u2019s Request for Continuing Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nThe Committee determined that the stay of enforcement of the Award should continue throughout the annulment proceeding, without a financial security. The Committee reserved its right to revisit at any time, at the request of either party, its decision and order the modification or termination of the stay, and/or amend its decision regarding the posting of a security. None of the parties requested so.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, Kazakhstan filed a Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, CIOC filed a Reply on Annulment.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 23, 2013, Kazakhstan filed a Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n18.\n\nA hearing for CIOC\u2019s Application for annulment of the Award was held on September 12, 2013 at the World Bank Office in Paris.\n\n19.\n\nPresent at the hearing were:\n\nTHE *AD HOC* COMMITTEE\n\nMr. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto, President Tan Sri Dato Cecil W.M.

THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n23.\n\nParties to the underlying arbitration were CIOC, Claimant, a Kazakh company, and Kazakhstan, Respondent.\n\n24.\n\nThe basic rule in the ICSID Convention regarding jurisdiction of the Centre (Article 25(1)) provides that an ICSID tribunal lacks jurisdiction over disputes between a Contracting State - and Kazakhstan is a Contracting State - and a national or company of that same Contracting State. This basic rule is, however, subject to a specific exception: Article 25(2)(b) offers standing to a local company from the Contracting State, provided that\n\n- such company is under foreign control, and\n\n- there is an agreement between the parties to treat the company, because of foreign control, as a national of another Contracting State.\n\n25.\n\nCIOC filed the arbitration against Kazakhstan arguing that it met the requirements set forth in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, because it was 92% owned and controlled by an American citizen, Mr. Hourani. CIOC further argued that its investment, \"a significant oil field in an oil rich area of the country\", had been expropriated by Kazakhstan giving rise to damages and compensation in excess of USD 1.1 billion1.\n\nAward, at 2 (quoting Claimant\u2019s Memorial of May 14, 2009, at 7).\n\n26.\n\nRespondent requested the Tribunal to reject CIOC\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal concurred and concluded\n\n\"that the facts presented and proved by Claimant do not satisfy Claimant\u2019s burden of proof to establish jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it does not have jurisdiction over the claims raised in this case\"2.\n\n*Ibidem,* at 468 and 469.\n\n28.\n\nIn essence, the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Hourani was the formal owner of 92% of the capital of CIOC, but held that mere formal ownership of shares was not sufficient basis for finding jurisdiction under the provisions of the Convention and the BIT. On that basis, the Tribunal issued an Award dismissing Claimant\u2019s claims, without considering the merits of the dispute, and ordered Claimant to pay Respondent USD 3.2 million for its legal costs.\n\n**2. Applicant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Award dismissed jurisdiction because\n\n\"Claimant failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of U.S. national (Devincci Hourani) as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT\"3.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n30.\n\nThis holding was reached - argues Applicant - notwithstanding the undisputed fact that Mr. Hourani is a U.S. citizen since 2001 and the Tribunal\u2019s own findings that \"indirect evidence appears to show that Mr. Hourani was an owner of a 92% share in CIOC\"4\n\n*Ibidem,* at 395, C I, at 5.\n\n31.\n\nApplicant argues that this is a textbook case of annulment, since the Award denied jurisdiction pursuant to an imaginary requirement, not raised by Respondent nor shared with Claimant: the condition that a majority shareholding by a U.S. national in a Kazakh company is not sufficient to qualify the company as a U.S. national5.\n\nC I, at 2.\n\n32.\n\nApplicant is requesting annulment of the Award in its entirety, arguing that the Tribunal violated\n\n- Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention by manifestly exceeding its powers,\n\n- Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention by seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure, and/or\n\n- Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention by failing to state the reasons on which the Award was based6.\n\nC I, at 244.\n\n33.\n\nThese three grounds for annulment must be applied - in CIOC\u2019s submission - to three findings of the Tribunal:\n\n- The first is the Tribunal\u2019s holding that the U.S. national must own or control and invest in CIOC to comply with the foreign nationality test.\n\n- The second is the definition and application by the Tribunal of the \"control\" and \"investment\" requirements set forth in the BIT and the Convention.\n\n- The third is an *obiter dictum* made by the Tribunal, in relation to the contractual submission to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nRespondent argues that there is not a single ground for annulment of the Award. Under the guise of a claim for annulment, Applicant is in fact seeking to obtain an entire de novo review of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over CIOC\u2019s claims. However, annulment is not an appeal and Applicant\u2019s attempt to appeal the Award through annulment proceedings must be rejected7.\n\nR I, at 4.\n\n35.\n\nRespondent adds that the Award clarifies, consistently with the double-keyhole approach of ICSID jurisdiction, that in order for Claimant to benefit from Mr. Hourani\u2019s U.S. nationality and for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, Claimant must have established that the foreign nationality requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT are met. Claimant failed to do so, and consequently the Tribunal declined jurisdiction on two separate and independent grounds:\n\n- (i) Claimant failed to provide sufficient proof that it controlled CIOC, as required by Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n- (ii) Claimant also failed to prove that CIOC is an investment of a U.S. national, as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT8.\n\n*Ibidem,* at 110.\n\n36.\n\nRespondent therefore disagrees with Applicant and requests the Committee to issue a decision dismissing Applicant\u2019s application for annulment.\n\n37.\n\nFinally, both parties ask for reimbursement of costs.\n\n38.\n\nIn order to decide this annulment proceeding, the Committee will\n\n- briefly summarize the Award, including the proven facts and the findings of the Tribunal,\n\n- provide a conceptual overview of the three grounds for annulment invoked by Applicant,\n\n- analyze the application of these grounds for annulment to the three findings of the Tribunal (nationality test, definition of control and investment and *obiter dictum),* and\n\n- consider the issue of costs.\n\n**III. THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n**1. Facts**\n------------\n\n39.\n\nMr. Hourani is a U.S. citizen. He received his U.S. citizenship in 2001. Before that he did not hold the nationality of any country, being a stateless Palestinian refugee born in Lebanon.\n\n40.\n\nIn 2002, after convening a public tender, the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources signed Contract No. 954 with a company called Consolidated Contractors (Oil and Gas) Company S.A.L., incorporated in Lebanon. Under the Contract, which included an ICSID arbitration clause, CCC acquired certain rights for the exploitation of the so-called Caratube oil field situated in Kazakhstan, against the payment of an amount in excess of USD 9 million.\n\n41.\n\nA few months after signing the Contract, CCC transferred the Contract to CIOC, as documented in a Transfer Agreement dated August 8, 2002. At that time, CIOC was controlled by Mr. Fadi Hussein, a Danish citizen and a distant cousin of Mr. Hourani.\n\n42.\n\nIn mid-2004 Mr. Hourani acquired 85% of the shares in CIOC from Mr. Hussein, against payment of a price of 850,000 Tenge. A year later, in April 2005, Mr. Hourani acquired an additional 7% shareholding in CIOC from Mr. Waheeb Antakly for 70,000 Tenge (the total price of 920,000 Tenge being equal to approximately USD 6,500)9.\n\nAward, at 437.\n\n43.\n\nMr. Hourani never made any capital contribution to CIOC. The company was funded through loans and other financings provided by JOR Investments Inc., a Lebanese corporation apparently not related to Mr. Hourani.\n\n44.\n\nIn February 2008 the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued a notice of termination, alleging that CIOC had breached the Contract and requesting that CIOC hand over the Contract territory, return geological information, fulfil the outstanding obligations and rehabilitate the Contract area. Termination was confirmed in a letter from the Ministry dated May 14, 2008.\n\n45.\n\nClaimant commenced ICSID arbitration against Respondent on June 16, 2008. The Award dismissing jurisdiction was issued on June 5, 2012. The application for annulment was filed on October 2, 2012.\n\n46.\n\nSubsequently, CIOC and Mr. Hourani have jointly commenced a new, separate ICSID arbitration against Kazakhstan. This arbitration is still pending.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s Reasoning**\n-------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe essential part of the Award is the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of its own jurisdiction, which led the Tribunal to the conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute10.\n\n*Ibidem,* at 309 et seq\n\n**A. Legal Provisions**\n-----------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Award interpreted the following legal provisions:\n\nProvisions on the Tribunal\u2019s Competence to Decide on Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe starting point of the analysis was Article 41 of the Convention which reads:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute\".\n\n50.\n\nFurther the Tribunal noted that Rule 41(2) of the Arbitration Rules provides that\n\n\"The Tribunal may at its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceedings, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence\".\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal then agreed with the *Aguas del Tunari* decision that a tribunal\u2019s authority also includes\n\n\"the power to consider ways in which an ambiguous or unclear objection may bear on jurisdiction and to restate the objections, as appropriate, so as to allow a full examination of jurisdiction\"11.\n\nAward, at 309, referring to *Aguas del Tunari,* at 78.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the Convention\n----------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimant is an entity incorporated in Kazakhstan and the key question for the Tribunal was whether Claimant satisfied the conditions which allow a local company to be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of ICSID arbitration. The provision addressing this issue in the ICSID Convention is Article 25(2)(b), which provides that \"national of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n\"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\".\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal pointed out that Contracting States to the Convention can agree on the conditions of their submission to ICSID jurisdiction as long as their agreement does not contradict the meaning of the Convention. Article 25(2)(b) sets foreign control as such outer limit, an objective requirement that cannot be replaced by an agreement. It is a floor below which the parties\u2019 agreement cannot reach. The parties\u2019 agreement cannot contradict the meaning of the Convention (e.g., by stipulating that *any* local company should be treated as foreign nationals), and to the extent that any such agreement contradicts the Convention, the Tribunal must find that there is no agreement providing jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b)12\n\nAward, at 336 and 337.\n\nArticle VI(8) of the BIT\n------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to Article VI(8) of the BIT, which is the provision containing the parties\u2019 agreement:\n\n\"For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention\".\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that Article VI(8) of the BIT contains the conditions agreed between Kazakhstan and the United States of America for the application of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The key requirement in Article VI(8) is that the local company be \"an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party\".\n\n56.\n\nThe BIT contains a definition of the term \"investment\" in Article I(1)(a), which provides:\n\n\"1. For the purposes of this Treaty,\n\n(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including movable and immovable property, as well as rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to:   \nliterary and artistic works, including sound recordings, inventions in all fields of human endeavor, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law\".\n\n57.\n\nArticle 1(1)(a) defines investment from the perspective of assets, claims and rights to be protected. But the Tribunal pointed out that BIT protection is not granted simply to any formally held asset, one of the goals of the BIT being the stimulation of capital flows, and consequently protected investments must be assets which result from such a flow of capital. Even though the BIT definition of investment does not expressly qualify the contributions by way of which the investment is made, the existence of such contribution as a requisite to the protection of the BIT is implied13. Consequently, the Tribunal considered that the term \"investment\" denotes an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make a profit and thus involving some degree of risk14.\n\nAward, at 351.\n\nAward, at 360.\n\n58.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the burden is on Claimant to show that it fulfils the criteria set out by Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and Article VI(8) of the BIT.\n\n**B. Application to the Case**\n------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nHaving set the legal framework, the Tribunal then applied it to the case at hand.\n\nFirst Requirement: The U.S. Nationality\n---------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal pointed out that the first requirement set forth in Article VI(8) was the U.S. nationality of Mr. Hourani. This requirement was not contested by Respondent, and the Tribunal concurred and found that Mr. Hourani was indeed a U.S. citizen during the relevant period.\n\nSecond Requirement: Ownership\n-----------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe second requirement was Mr. Hourani\u2019s ownership of 92% of the share capital of CIOC. Here the Tribunal accepted that there was evidence showing that Mr. Hourani was the owner of 92% of the share capital of CIOC and concluded\n\n\"that jurisdiction cannot be denied for the mere reason that Claimant has not fully complied with its burden of proof regarding ownership by the U.S. national, Devincci Hourani\"15.\n\nAward, at 396.\n\nThird Requirement: Control\n--------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe third requirement was control, which the Tribunal interpreted to mean actual control over CIOC. The starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s examination was that Claimant had the burden of proof16. Weighing the available evidence, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that Mr. Hourani had not provided sufficient proof of control. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the legal capacity to control, without evidence of actual control, was enough in light of Mr. Hourani\u2019s characterization of his purported investment in CIOC17.\n\nAward, at 401.\n\nAward, at 407.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that Mr. Hourani had proven ownership but not control of CIOC. However, as Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT requires ownership *or* control, and based on indirect evidence Claimant *could* be regarded as owned by Mr. Hourani, the Tribunal then moved to analyze further conditions for treating CIOC as a U.S. national under the BIT18.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nFourth Requirement: Investment Made by Mr, Hourani\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn answering the question whether CIOC was an investment of Mr. Hourani the Tribunal first enquired whether he had made any contribution and had taken any risk, because, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the existence of an investment requires a contribution to make profit and thus involves some degree of risk19.\n\nAward, at 409.\n\n65.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s enquiry was that Mr. Hourani had only paid a nominal price equivalent to USD 6,500 for his 92% share in CIOC. This nominal price raised doubts about the existence of an investment in which at least USD 9.4 million had already been sunk. Indeed, the Tribunal considered that payment of only a nominal price and lack of any other contribution by the purported investor must be seen as an indication that the investment was not an economic arrangement, was not covered by the term \"investment\" as used in the BIT and thus was an arrangement not protected by the BIT20.\n\nAward, at 435.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed Mr. Hourani\u2019s allegation that he had contributed a personal guarantee for the financing of CIOC and, after weighing the evidence, concluded that the evidence presented did not confirm that Mr. Hourani had contributed a substantial personal guarantee of CIOC\u2019s debt to JOR Investments Inc.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that even if Mr. Hourani had acquired formal ownership and nominal control over CIOC, no plausible economic motive had been given to explain the negligible purchase price. No evidence had been presented of a contribution of any kind made or any risk undertaken by Mr. Hourani. There had been no capital flow between him and CIOC that had contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC21.\n\nAward, at 455.\n\n68.\n\nClaimant insisted that the origin of capital used in investments is immaterial. Although the Tribunal acknowledged this to be correct, the capital must still be linked to the person purporting to have made an investment. In this case the Tribunal found that there was no evidence of such link22.\n\nAward, at 456.\n\n69.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal concluded\n\n- that Claimant had failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of a U.S. national, as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT23,\n\n- that the facts presented and proved by Claimant did not satisfy Claimant\u2019s burden of proof to establish jurisdiction, and\n\n- that the Tribunal therefore did not have jurisdiction over the claims raised in the case24.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\nAward, at 468-469.\n\n**IV. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------\n\n70.\n\nApplicant is invoking three grounds for annulment:\n\n- that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention,\n\n- that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in violation of Article 52 (1)(d) of the Convention, and/or\n\n- that it failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based in violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee will briefly review these standards, in light of the arguments presented by both parties.\n\n72.\n\nThe starting point of such analysis is Article 53(1) of the Convention, which explicitly states that the award \"shall not be subject to any appeal\". The award may however be subject to annulment if an *ad hoc* committee finds that one or more of the five grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) apply. The powers of *ad hoc* committees are limited to annul awards issued by tribunals - not to amend or replace such awards, nor to review the merits of the dispute. Factual findings and weighing of evidence made by tribunals are outside the remit of *ad hoc* committees25, except in those cases where the applicant can prove that the errors of fact or of law committed by the tribunal are so egregious as to give rise to one of the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52(1) of the Convention.\n\n*Malicorp,* at 119.\n\n**1. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nApplicant invokes as a first ground for annulment that by rendering the Award \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\" (Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention).\n\n74.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee notes that the power of any arbitral tribunal derives from the authority vested upon it through the consent of the parties; if arbitrators address disputes not included in the powers granted, or decide issues not subject to their jurisdiction or not capable of being solved by arbitration, their decision cannot stand and must be set aside.\n\n**A. Failure to Exercise Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Committee further points out that excess of power can be committed both by overreach and by defect. Awards can be annulled if tribunals assume powers to which they are not entitled, and also if arbitrators do not use the powers that have been vested upon them by the parties. ICSID annulment committees have at the request of the investor set aside awards in cases where the tribunal, having jurisdiction, failed to exercise its powers. Somewhat paradoxically, a manifest shortfall in the exercise of jurisdiction may also constitute a manifest excess of power and lead to annulment of the award26.\n\n*Vivendi I,* at 115; *Malaysian Historical Salvors,* at 80.\n\n76.\n\nIn the history of ICSID there seem to be only three instances where committees have used their power to annul awards on the ground that the tribunal had failed to exercise jurisdiction27.\n\n- The first case is *Vivendi I,* where the committee partially annulled the award, because the tribunal had dismissed a claim on the ground that such claim could have been dealt with by a national court28.\n\n- The second case is *Helnan,* in which the award was also partially annulled, due to the tribunal\u2019s failure to exercise jurisdiction: the tribunal had imposed the requirement that an administrative decision before being construed as constituting a treaty breach had to be challenged in local courts29.\n\n- In the third case, *Malaysian Historical Salvors,* the committee annulled the award on jurisdiction rendered by the sole arbitrator, on the ground that the arbitrator manifestly exceeded his powers by failing to exercise jurisdiction over a treaty dispute30; the crux of this case was whether the requirement that an investment represent a contribution to the economic development of the host state, was or was not a condition for jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the Convention; the arbitrator found that it was, the majority of the committee found otherwise and annulled the award on jurisdiction31.\n\nR I, at 75; CII, at 27.\n\n*Vivendi I,* at 102.\n\n*Helnan,* at 28-57.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors,* at 56-82.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors,* at 61-81.\n\n**B. Failure to Apply the Proper Law**\n--------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee notes that \u2018excess of power\u2019 is a polysemic concept, which can be argued not only in cases of failure to exercise jurisdiction, but also in the context of tribunals failing to choose the proper law. Powers vested on arbitrators are not unlimited, but restricted. Arbitrators are only authorized by the parties to make their adjudication in accordance with applicable law, not on the basis of a law different from that agreed by the parties. If arbitrators do otherwise, they violate the empowerment received from the parties and their decision merits annulment.\n\n78.\n\nAccepting this principle *ad hoc* committees have concluded that arbitrators manifestly exceed their powers if they\n\n- totally disregard applicable law, or\n\n- ground their award on a law other than the applicable law provided for in Article 42 of the Convention - i.e. the rules of law agreed by the parties, or, subsidiarily, the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute and such rules of international law as may be applicable32.\n\n*Azurix,* at 46 and 136; *CMS,* at 49; *Lucchetti,* at 98; *Soufraki,* at 45; *Enron,* at 67; *Helnan,* at 55; *Sempra,* at 205-207.\n\n79.\n\nIt is important to emphasize here that in order for an award to be annulled, the committee must find that the error committed by the tribunal consisted of applying the wrong law, not of wrongly interpreting the correct law. To understand the contrary would imply transforming the well-settled standard of failure to apply the proper law into an error of law standard, changing the nature of the ICSID annulment procedure, and transforming it into an appeal mechanism. Accepting this principle, *ad hoc* committees have made it clear that an error in the interpretation of the proper law does not constitute a manifest excess of powers33.\n\n*Duke Energy,* at 99; *Sempra,* at 164.\n\n80.\n\nThe parties have discussed whether the concept of manifest excess of power can be stretched to cover errors of law34.\n\nCII, at 47; RII, at 47.\n\n81.\n\nThe Committee finds the correct position to be that misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law, even if serious, does not justify annulment. That being said, in exceptional circumstances, a gross or egregious error of law, acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment35. But the threshold for applying this exceptional rule must be set very high36 - otherwise the annulment mechanism permitted by the Convention would expand into a prohibited appeal system.\n\n*Soufraki,* at 86.\n\nAES', at 33.\n\n**C. The Meaning of \"Manifest\"**\n--------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b) of the Convention only permits annulment if a dual requirement is met: there must be an excess of power, and the excess of power must be \"manifest\".\n\n83.\n\nThe parties have discussed the precise meaning of the term \"manifest\". For Respondent, manifest means self-evident, while for Applicant the term implies that the excess must be serious. Applicant adds that establishing the existence of an excess of power may require a detailed analysis of complex factual and legal questions37.\n\nCII, at 54; RII, at 50.\n\n84.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Respondent that the term \"manifest\" basically corresponds to \"obvious\" or \"evident\". However, this does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that such a manifest excess of power has in fact occurred38.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado,* at 69.\n\n85.\n\nApplicant has argued that any excess of power which relates to jurisdiction would in itself comply with the manifest test. Such a conclusion does not derive from the wording of Article 52(1)(b) and has not been accepted by previous *ad hoc* committees39. Nor does the Committee find any sufficient basis for applying in this respect different rules to jurisdiction and merit.\n\nSchreuer: \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\" (CUP 2ed.), 2010, p. 943, at 149; *Soufraki,* at 118 and 119; *MTD,* at 54.\n\n**2. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe second ground for annulment invoked by Applicant is that the Tribunal has engaged in a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, in violation of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.\n\n87.\n\nThe Committee considers that serious violations of due process, which undermine the principles that each party has a right to be heard on equal terms and to contradict the arguments of the other party, justify annulment of an award; justice cannot be achieved through a deeply flawed procedure. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is a ground frequently invoked by applicants, normally in conjunction with other grounds. But the hurdles for the acceptance of this ground are high: in only a few cases has it led to the annulment of ICSID awards40.\n\n*Amco IT, Fraport; Victor Pey Casado.*\n\n88.\n\nThe hurdles are reflected in the wording of Article 52(1)(d), which involves three requirements:\n\n- The procedural rule must be fundamental.\n\n- The tribunal must have departed from it.\n\n- The departure must be serious.\n\n89.\n\nApplicant has focused its arguments on two rules of procedure, from which the Tribunal allegedly departed: (A.) the right to be heard, and (B.) the burden of proof.\n\n**A. Right to Be Heard** (and *iura novit curia)*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nApplicant identifies the right to be heard as a fundamental procedural rule, and submits that the Tribunal used in its Award legal reasoning which had never been argued by or disclosed to the parties. Applicant avers that by so doing the Tribunal violated its procedural rights41. Respondent disagrees and argues that the parties\u2019 right to be heard does not prevent a tribunal from adopting its own reasoning or even raising new arguments42.\n\nCI, at 116.\n\nHT p. 85,1. 24.\n\n91.\n\nWhat the parties are discussing is, in fact, the relationship between two legal principles:\n\n- the parties\u2019 right to be heard, and\n\n- the tribunal\u2019s right (or even duty - a tribunal confronted with inept pleadings cannot content itself with the less implausible of the parties\u2019 arguments43) to apply the principle *iura novit curia.*\n\nPaulsson: \"International Arbitration and the Generation of Legal Norms\", in ICCA Congress Series No. 13 at 879.\n\n92.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have a number of times been confronted with the issue whether tribunals can *sua sponte* raise legal arguments which had not been pleaded by the parties. Schreuer has summarized the findings by saying that committees\n\n\"have uniformly rejected the idea that the tribunals in drafting their awards are restricted to the arguments presented by the parties\"44.\n\nSchreuer: \"Three Generations of ICSID Annulment Procedures\" in \"Annulment of ICSID Awards\" (Gaillard/Banifatemi eds.), 2004, p. 30.\n\n93.\n\nBut this conclusion is subject to an important *caveat',* a tribunal (and also a committee) is only free to adopt its own solution and reasoning without obligation to submit it to the parties beforehand, if it remains within the legal framework established by the parties. And *vice versa',* if a tribunal prefers to use a distinct legal framework, different from that argued by the parties, it must grant the parties the opportunity to be heard. As the committee in *Klockner I* held45:\n\n\"The real question is whether, by formulating its own theory and argument, the Tribunal goes beyond the \"legal framework\" established by the Claimant and Respondent. This would for example be the case if an arbitral tribunal rendered its decision on the basis of tort while the pleas of the parties were based on contract\".\n\n*Klockner I,* at 91.\n\n94.\n\nConsequently, tribunals do not violate the parties\u2019 right to be heard if they ground their decision on legal reasoning not specifically advanced by the parties, provided that the tribunal\u2019s arguments can be fitted within the legal framework argued during the procedure and therefore concern aspects on which the parties could reasonably be expected to comment, if they wished their views to be taken into account by the tribunal.\n\n95.\n\nThat tribunals are entitled, within certain limits, to proceed without asking for the parties\u2019 views, does not mean that it is always good practice to do so. If *iura novit curia* is exercised, an invitation to the parties to comment on the new legal arguments may reduce the risk of errors or mistakes. And as the arbitrator in *Bogdanov* wrote, tribunals should avoid that parties be\n\n\"surprise [d] by the consideration of legal issues that were not taken into consideration in the proceedings\"46.\n\n*Bogdanov v. Moldova,* SCC case 93/2004, quoted in Bigge: *\"dura Novit Curia* in Investment Treaty Arbitration\", Kluwer Arbitration Blog, December 29, 2011.\n\n96.\n\nBut surprise in itself does not give rise to a ground for annulment. As the committee in *Vivendi I* wrote,\n\n\"[i]t may be true that the particular approach adopted by the Tribunal in attempting to reconcile the various conflicting elements of the case before it came as a surprise to the parties, or at least to some of them. But even if true, this would by no means be unprecedented injudicial decision-making, either international or domestic, and it has nothing to do with the ground for annulment contemplated by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\"47.\n\n*Vivendi I,* at 84.\n\n**B. Burden of Proof**\n----------------------\n\n97.\n\nA breach of the general principles on burden of proof can also lead to an infringement of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention. As the committee in *Klockner II* stated,\n\n\"a reversal of the burden of proof could well lead to a violation of a fundamental rule of procedure. It all depends on the importance, for the decision of the Tribunal, of the subject regarding which the burden has been reversed\"48.\n\n*Klockner II,* at 6.80.\n\n**C. Seriousness**\n------------------\n\n98.\n\nThere is an additional requisite: Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention requires that a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, if it is to provoke the annulment of an award, must also be \"serious\".\n\n99.\n\nA departure is serious if the violation of the fundamental rule of procedure produced a material impact on the award. The applicant however is not required to prove that the violation of the rule of procedure was decisive for the outcome, or that the applicant would have won the case if the rule had been applied. As the *Wena* committee stated, what the applicant must simply demonstrate is\n\n\"the impact that the issue may have had on the Award\"49.\n\n*Wena,* at 61; *Victor Pey Casado,* at 78.\n\n**3. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe third ground for annulment on which Applicant relies is that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based, as required by Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n101.\n\nThe obligation to state reasons stems from Article 48(3) of the Convention, which requires the tribunal to \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal\" and to \"state the reasons upon which it is based\". Unreasoned awards can be annulled, because parties are entitled to be able to ascertain to what extent a tribunal\u2019s findings are sufficiently based on a correct interpretation of the law and on a proper evaluation of the facts50. But as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect or unconvincing, the award cannot be annulled on this ground. Article 52(1)(e) does not permit any inquiry into the quality or persuasiveness of reasons. As was stated in *MINE,*\n\n\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\"51.\n\n*Lucchetti,* at 98.\n\n*MINE,* at 5.09.\n\n102.\n\nNonetheless, *ad hoc* committees have held that contradictory or frivolous reasons are to be equated with a failure to state reasons and can result in annulment52. Contradictory reasons cancel each other and will not enable the reader to understand the tribunal\u2019s motives53. Frivolous reasons are those manifestly irrelevant and knowingly so to the tribunal54. But an examination of the reasons presented by a tribunal cannot be transformed into a re-examination of the correctness of the factual and legal premises on which the award is based. Committees do not have the power to review the adequacy of the reasons set forth by the tribunal in its award. Rather, the role of the committee is limited to analyzing whether a reader can understand how the tribunal arrived at its conclusion. Broadening the scope of Article 52(1)(e) to comprise decisions with inadequate reasons would transform the annulment proceeding into an appeal.\n\n*Amco II,* at 1.18.\n\n*Klockner I,* at 116.\n\nBroches: \"Observations on the finality of ICSID awards\" in ICSID Review, 321 (1991), at 366.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S FOREIGN NATIONALITY TEST**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nApplicant alleges that there are three separate reasons warranting the annulment of the Award on the invoked grounds:\n\n- The first relates to the Tribunal\u2019s holding that the U.S. national must \"own or control\" an investment in CIOC to comply with the foreign nationality test.\n\n- The second is the definition and application by the Tribunal of the \"control\" and \"investment\" requirements set forth in the BIT and in the Convention.\n\n- The third refers to an *obiter dictum* made by the Tribunal with regard to the contractual submission to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n104.\n\nThe first of these allegations will be analyzed in this section, and the other two in subsequent sections (VI and VII).\n\n**1. Applicant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n105.\n\nApplicant submits that the Tribunal dismissed jurisdiction on the ground that\n\n\"Claimant failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of U.S. national (Devincci Hourani) as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT\"55.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n106.\n\nApplicant avers that, in doing so, the Tribunal violated Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention.\n\n**A. Article 52(1)(b): Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nApplicant argues that by failing to exercise jurisdiction, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, in violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention56. In particular, the Tribunal failed to apply or alternatively manifestly erred in applying the provisions of the BIT and of the Vienna Convention to the foreign nationality test under Article VI(8) of the BIT and the associated \"ownership or control\" requirement of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT57.\n\nC I, at 146.\n\nC I, at 147.\n\n108.\n\nApplicant points out that, pursuant to Article VI(8) of the BIT, a local Kazakh company like CIOC must be treated as a \"foreign national\" for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and be given access to ICSID arbitration, if it qualifies as \"investment\" of U.S. \"nationals or companies\". In Applicant\u2019s opinion, the requirement of foreign nationality was satisfied by the mere fact that Mr. Hourani owned 92% of the shares in CIOC58. The Tribunal, however, went on to examine the alternative requirement of \"control\" contained in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, and moreover added to the foreign nationality test the requirements that the person exercising ownership or control should prove that it had made an investment in the local investment vehicle - CIOC - and that a link existed between CIOC\u2019s capital and Mr. Hourani59.\n\nC I, at 152.\n\nC I, at 153; C II, at 109.\n\n109.\n\nApplicant therefore considers that the Tribunal imposed a \"foreign capital\" requirement to the BIT\u2019s notion of \"foreign nationality\", contained in Article VI(8) of the BIT, and thereby altered and exceeded the scope of such rule, as agreed between two sovereign states. It subsequently found, by replacing the foreign nationality test of Article VI(8) by its self-created test, that CIOC did not qualify as an investment of the U.S. national Mr. Hourani and did not qualify as a foreign investment for purposes of ICSID jurisdiction60.\n\nC I, at 154.\n\n110.\n\nIn Applicant\u2019s opinion, the Tribunal reached this conclusion despite the clear wording of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, which does not require that the investment be made by a U.S. national directly in the local company. To the contrary, this provision of the BIT only requires the investment to be \"owned or controlled\" by a U.S. national. Applicant considers that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning and conclusion run counter to the express wording of the BIT61 and that the Letter of Transmittal of the BIT confirms that the assets enumerated in the non-exclusive list of Article 1(1)(a) constitute investments without any further requirements having to be satisfied62.\n\nC I, at 155.\n\nCII, at 112.\n\n111.\n\nApplicant concludes that the Tribunal, although acting under the pretext of Article 1 (1)(a) and Article VI(8) of the BIT, in reality did not apply these provisions and hence failed to apply the applicable law, or misapplied the BIT in such egregious manner that it amounts to effective disregard of the applicable law. In both cases, the error by the Tribunal indisputably amounts to a manifest excess of powers. This error, in Applicant\u2019s view, is both flagrant and incomprehensible63.\n\nC I, at 157.\n\n112.\n\nApplicant points out that the Tribunal thus effectively failed to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and to apply the law agreed by the parties, and this failure constitutes manifest excess of power. Applicant argues that it is settled that an ICSID tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant treaty, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under that instrument64.\n\nC I, at 168, by reference to *Vivendi I,* at 86.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(d): Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nApplicant also argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by depriving CIOC of its right to be heard, in violation of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention. This is because the objection applied by the Tribunal was not raised by Respondent.\n\n114.\n\nThe record shows that Claimant in its Memorial based the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the satisfaction of the foreign nationality test under Article VI(8) of the BIT, while in its Counter-Memorial Respondent based its objections to jurisdiction exclusively on the requirement of a *bona fides* investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention65.\n\nCII, at 137.\n\n115.\n\nAs Applicant sees it, the Tribunal did not merely restate unclear and ambiguous objections raised by Respondent, but rather relied on new legal provisions and arguments which had not been raised by Respondent in the proceedings66.\n\nC I, at 172.\n\n116.\n\nSuch new legal provisions were not shared by the Tribunal during the proceedings and so Claimant was not heard on the objection ultimately applied by the Tribunal and was deprived of the opportunity to correct the misapplication of the law by providing the Tribunal with appropriate arguments67.\n\nC I, at 170.\n\n117.\n\nWhat is more, Applicant points out that the Tribunal was aware of this serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, because in the Award68, it attempts to preemptively justify its behaviour in anticipation of a challenge, relying on its right, under Rule 41(2) of the Arbitration Rules, to raise *ex officio* jurisdictional questions at any time of the proceedings69.\n\nAward, at 309.\n\nCI, at 171.\n\n118.\n\nApplicant emphasizes that any prerogative the Tribunal may have to raise *ex officio* new grounds or arguments, cannot override the principle of due process which implies that \"the parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given opportunity to present his case\"70, and that they must be \"given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal\"71, including the right of a party \"to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it\"72. In *Victor Pey Casado* the *ad hoc* committee held that the tribunal\u2019s right to independently proceed to the evaluation of a category of damages, did not relieve it from its obligation to \"allo[w] each party the right to present its arguments and to contradict those of the other party\"73.\n\n*MINE,* at 5.06.\n\n*Wena,* at 57.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n*Victor Pey Casado,* at 262.\n\n119.\n\nApplicant argues that where a tribunal bases its conclusions on arguments that are beyond the legal framework established by the parties, the tribunal is under the obligation to hear the parties first and to allow them to advance their arguments74. In the present case, the Tribunal failed to hear the parties on issues that proved to be critical for its conclusion on jurisdiction. The Tribunal therefore departed from a fundamental right of procedure, and this departure was \"serious\"75.\n\nCII, at 159.\n\nCII, at 169.\n\n120.\n\nApplicant accordingly concludes that the Tribunal should have - at the very least - afforded CIOC the opportunity to be heard and to present its case on these *ex* *officio* and/or completely reshuffled objections. Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to do so76 and that it acted in violation of the fundamental right to be heard embodied in Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention and reached a result which could have been different from what it would have been had such a rule been observed77.\n\nC I, at 177.\n\nC I, at 178.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nApplicant advances a third argument: the Tribunal also violated Article 51(1)(e) of the Convention, by basing its findings on an incomprehensible reasoning tantamount to a failure to state reasons.\n\n122.\n\nApplicant finds it impossible to see what support the Tribunal mustered to sustain its conclusions, and to follow the little motivation the Tribunal has provided. The Tribunal - it is alleged - jumps from one notion to another, from one treaty to another, from one article to another, in a manner which defies common sense. In Applicant\u2019s view, the Tribunal failed to render an award which at the minimum enables the reader to follow the reasoning on points of fact and law, as required by Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the Convention78.\n\nC I, at 179.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n123.\n\nRespondent rejects Applicant\u2019s contention that the Award should be annulled, on the ground that the Tribunal erred when it applied the foreign nationality test.\n\n**A. Article 52(1)(b): Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers when applying the foreign nationality test79.\n\nRII, at 79.\n\n125.\n\nRespondent finds it obvious that there can be no excess of powers, let alone a manifest excess of powers, on the ground that the Tribunal failed to apply the relevant provisions of the applicable law. The rare instances when committees have annulled awards by reason of the tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the applicable law were extreme cases in which the tribunal simply ignored the relevant provisions, or the applicable law as a whole.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent avers that the Tribunal, in determining whether Claimant met the foreign nationality test under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, applied the relevant provisions of the BIT in accordance with the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal correctly turned to Article VI(8) of the BIT and the definition of investment contained in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT. The Tribunal interpreted \"investment\" in accordance with its ordinary meaning, in its context and in light of the BIT\u2019s objective and purpose, pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal held that the term \"investment\" had an inherent meaning, which included the existence of contribution over a period of time and requiring some degree of risk80. The Tribunal noted that even though the BIT required \"ownership\" *or* \"control\", the BIT could not go beyond the objective outer limits of the Convention, which expressly requires that control be established, as only control can be the basis for jurisdiction81.\n\nR I, at 120.\n\nR I, at 123.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent therefore considers that, in applying Articles VI(8) and I(1)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal did not commit any error, let alone an egregious error wanting annulment. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis thus meets \"reasonable\", \"plausible\" or \"tenable\" standards, which exclude a finding of manifest excess of powers82.\n\nR I, at 137.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(d): Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nRespondent also denies that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, because the question of the foreign nationality of CIOC was actually argued during the proceedings. The parties debated the issues whether there was an investment of Mr. Hourani and whether Mr. Hourani actually controlled such investment. Applicant\u2019s artificial argument that Respondent\u2019s objection was based on the ICSID Convention and not on Article VI(8) of the BIT, while Article VI(8) contains the foreign nationality agreement required under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, must be rejected83.\n\nR I, at 140.\n\n129.\n\nIn any event, even if it were considered that CIOC was not heard on the question of control and/or investment (which Respondent denies), the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning undoubtedly remained within the legal framework established by the parties when they debated foreign nationality for the purposes of ICSID jurisdiction84.\n\nR II, at 93.\n\n130.\n\nFurthermore, Article 41(2) of the Arbitration Rules confers on ICSID tribunals the power to address jurisdictional questions of its own motion. This means that, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, an arbitral tribunal is perfectly free to reformulate or clarify an objection to its jurisdiction made by one of the parties. In accordance with the principle *iura novit curia,* the parties\u2019 right to be heard does not require an ICSID tribunal to submit to the parties every new reason on which it bases its decision85.\n\nR I, at 158.\n\n131.\n\nRespondent avers that the issue of the applicable test for determining CIOC\u2019s nationality was amply debated by the parties. Even if this were not the case, the Tribunal was empowered to reformulate or even raise a new argument or reasoning, without first submitting it to the parties, provided that such argument or reasoning remained within the legal framework established by the parties. Article VI(8) of the BIT was indeed part of the legal framework established by the parties. All relevant provisions of the Convention and the BIT were in the debate, and the Tribunal was not bound to submit its interpretation to the parties beforehand. Therefore, Respondent concludes that the Tribunal did not violate Claimant\u2019s right to be heard or depart from any rule of procedure86.\n\nR I, at 170.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(e): Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nRespondent finally argues that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons.\n\n133.\n\nRespondent avers and explains that the reasoning of the Tribunal on the points of law and fact related to the foreign nationality requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are clear, precise and logically developed87.\n\nR I, at 172.\n\n134.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent argues that the adequacy and sufficiency of reasons are irrelevant for annulment purposes. The applicable standard requires only that the award contain reasons that support the tribunal\u2019s decision, even if the line of reasoning adopted by the tribunal contains errors of law or of fact. Applicant seeks to appeal the Tribunal\u2019s decision, but has not presented a single plausible argument against the Tribunal\u2019s well argued, logical and comprehensible conclusion that CIOC did not meet the foreign nationality test88.\n\nRII at 112.\n\n**3. Decision by the Committee**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe foreign nationality test of Mr. Hourani revolves around three legal provisions: Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention:\n\n\"(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\".\n\nArticle VI(8) of the BIT:\n\n\"For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention\".\n\nArticle 1(1)(a) of the BIT:\n\n\"1. For the purposes of this Treaty,\n\n(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts...\".\n\n136.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal construed these provisions as follows:\n\n- Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention must be interpreted as a floor below which the parties\u2019 agreement cannot reach; the term foreign control is flexible and deferential and is meant to accommodate a wide range of agreements between the parties; however, if the agreement plainly contradicts the meaning of the Convention, e.g. by stipulating that any locally incorporated company should be treated as a foreign national, the tribunal cannot go beyond the mandatory limits established by Article 2589.\n\n- Article VI(8) of the BIT, applied to the circumstances of the present case, permits CIOC to be treated as a U.S. company, provided that it is an investment of a U.S. national90.\n\n- Article 1(1)(a) defines investment as an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit and thus involving some degree of risk.\n\nAward, at 336-337.\n\nAward, at 361.\n\n137.\n\nThe facts which the Tribunal declared as proven are the following:\n\n- In 2002 CIOC purchased its main asset, the Contract, from CCC and paid approximately USD 9.4 million91.\n\n- In 2004-2005 Mr. Hourani, a U.S national, purchased 92% of the share capital of CIOC, a Kazakh company, for a price of approximately USD 6,50092.\n\n- Even though there was evidence which appeared to show that Mr. Hourani was the owner of 92% of the shares in CIOC, Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence that Mr. Hourani exercised actual control over CIOC. The Tribunal, weighing the available evidence, established that (i) no plausible economic motive was given to explain the negligible purchase price he paid for the shares; (ii) no evidence was presented of a contribution of any kind or any risk undertaken by Mr. Hourani; (iii) there was no capital flow between him and CIOC that contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC93.\n\nAward, at 437 and 453.\n\nAward, at 437.\n\nAward, at 455.\n\n138.\n\nOn the basis of these findings, the Tribunal concluded that Claimant had failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment - i.e. an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit and thus involving some degree of risk - of a U.S. national as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT94 with the consequence that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over Claimant\u2019s claims.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n139.\n\nApplicant alleges that in reaching this conclusion the Tribunal committed separate violations of Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention. The Committee will address these allegations in three separate sections (B through D *infra).*\n\n**B. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIn order to justify its request for annulment, Applicant argues\n\n\"that the Tribunal, although acting under the pretext of Article I(1)(a) and Article VI(8) of the BIT, in reality did not apply Article I(1)(a) and Article VI(8) of the BIT and hence failed to apply the applicable law or misapplied the BIT in such a[n] \"egregious\" manner that \"it amounts to effective disregard of the applicable law.\" In both cases, the error by the Tribunal indisputably amounts to a manifest excess of power\"95.\n\nC I, at 156.\n\n141.\n\nThe starting point of Applicant\u2019s line of reasoning is that the Tribunal acknowledged that Mr. Hourani, who undisputedly was a U.S. national, owned 92% of the capital of CIOC. And - in Applicant\u2019s opinion - such ownership should have been sufficient to comply with the foreign nationality test of Articles VI(8) and 1(1)(a) of the BIT (a test which requires that the investment be \"owned or controlled\" by a U.S. national). Since the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Hourani was the owner of 92% of CIOC, the necessary consequence should have been that CIOC met the foreign nationality test. By holding otherwise and by replacing these norms with its own rules, the Tribunal totally disregarded Articles I(1)(a) and VI(8) of the BIT96.\n\nCI, at 167; C II, at 101.\n\n142.\n\nRespondent is of the contrary opinion: it submits that the Tribunal indisputably applied the relevant provisions of both the Convention and the BIT, and consequently there could be no excess of power based on the Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the applicable law97.\n\nR I, at 126.\n\n**b. The Committee\u2019s Construction of the Concept**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nThe Committee has already clarified the standards which an applicant must meet in order to annul an award for manifest excess of powers:\n\n- The arbitrators must have manifestly exceeded their powers by totally disregarding the law, or by grounding their award on a law other than the applicable law98.\n\n- Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law, even if serious, does not justify annulment99.\n\n- In exceptional circumstances, however, a gross or egregious error of law, acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to failure to apply the proper law100.\n\nSee para. 78 *supra.*\n\nSee para. 79 *supra.*\n\nSee para. 81 *supra.*\n\n144.\n\nUnder normal circumstances errors of law do not permit annulment: applicant must prove a gross or egregious error of law, which can be perceived by any reasonable person. If the tribunal\u2019s legal interpretation is reasonable or tenable, even if the committee might have taken a different view on a debatable point of law, the award must stand - otherwise the annulment procedure would expand into an appeal mechanism, in contravention of the clear wording of the Convention101.\n\n*Rumeli,* at 96.\n\n**c. Analysis of the Award**\n----------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal in its Award indicated as applicable law Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention102 as well as Articles VI(8) and I(1)(b) of the BIT103. Additionally it found that the factual element of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention could not be examined independently from the agreement on nationality contained in the applicable investment treaty, because it is the investment treaty that would normally contain the test by which such foreign control is established in the circumstances of the case. Moreover, to the extent that the investment treaty would contradict the Convention, the Tribunal must find that there is no agreement providing jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b). For these reasons, the Tribunal found that it must first turn to Article VI(8) of the BIT104.\n\nAward, at 329-337.\n\nAward, at 339-362.\n\nAward, at 337-338.\n\n146.\n\nAfter examining the case in relation to Article VI(8) of the BIT, the Tribunal concluded that Claimant had failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of the U.S. national Mr. Hourani as required by Article VI(8). At the least, the Tribunal was not satisfied that Claimant had established the fact of that investment105.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n147.\n\nIn summary, under Article 25(2)(b) a local juridical person can only have standing in ICSID arbitration, if two requirements are met:\n\n- The local juridical person must be under \"foreign control\".\n\n- The two Contracting States must have agreed that the juridical person, because of foreign control, shall be treated as a foreign national.\n\n148.\n\nIn investments between the U.S. and Kazakhstan the provision in which such agreement is formalized is Article VI(8) of the BIT (a rule which includes a cross-reference to Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention). When the the BIT Parties drafted Article VI(8) they could have chosen to simply reproduce the wording of Article 25(2)(b), recognizing standing to any U.S. controlled Kazakh juridical person (and *vice versa).* However, the BIT has a wording of its own.\n\n(i) Local juridical person...\n-----------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAccording to Article VI(8), the local juridical person shall be a company, but it appears from Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT that the term \"company\" shall be given a very wide meaning. According to Article 1(1)(b), \"company\" of a Party means any kind of corporation, company, association, enterprise, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for a pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled.\n\n(ii)... under foreign control...\n--------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasized that Article 25(2)(b) sets \"foreign control\" as an outer limit, an objective requirement that cannot be replaced by an agreement: it is a floor below which the parties\u2019 agreement cannot reach106. This implies that all companies which are investments of foreign nationals must also be under foreign control.\n\nAward, at 336.\n\n(iii)... treated as a foreign national\n--------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nOf more importance in the present case is the fact that, according to Article VI(8), the company shall be \"an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party\". Consequently, while Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention refers to juridical persons which the parties, \"because of foreign control\", have agreed should be treated as nationals of another Contracting State, Article VI(8) of the BIT mentions \"any company... that... was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party\". This terminological distinction was given considerable weight by the Tribunal in its Award.\n\n152.\n\nIn a second step, the Tribunal tried to give meaning to the concept \"company which is an investment of nationals of the other Party\"107. Since the term investment is defined in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal decided to use that definition for the purposes of Article VI(8).\n\nAward, at 343.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to examine the wording of Article I(1)(a), which states that \"investment means every kind of investment... such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts\" and adds a non-exhaustive list of assets covered by the general notion of \"investment\".\n\n154.\n\nApplying Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the Tribunal found:\n\n\"Article I(1)(a) of the BIT defines \u2018investment\u2019 from the perspective of assets, claims and rights to be protected (or accorded specific treatment, prescribed in the following provisions of the BIT). As one of the goals of the BIT is the stimulation of flow of private capital, BIT protection is not granted simply to any formally held asset, but to an asset which is the result of such a flow of capital. Thus, even though the BIT definition of \u2018investment\u2019 does not expressly qualify the contributions by way of which the investment is made, the existence of such a contribution as a prerequisite to the protection of the BIT is implied\"108.\n\nAward, at 351.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that the term investment as used in Articles 1(1)(a) and VI(8) of the BIT means \"an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make a profit and thus involving some degree of risk\"109.\n\nAward, at 360\n\n156.\n\nOn this legal basis, the Tribunal analyzed the facts, weighed the evidence marshalled by the Parties and reached these conclusions:\n\n- Indirect evidence appeared to show that Mr. Hourani was the owner of a 92% share in CIOC, and jurisdiction could not be denied for the mere reason that Claimant had not fully complied with its burden of proof regarding ownership by the U.S. citizen Mr. Hourani110.\n\n- Even if Mr. Hourani acquired formal ownership and nominal control over CIOC, no plausible economic motive was given to explain the negligible purchase price he paid for the shares and to explain his investment in CIOC. No evidence was presented of a contribution of any other kind or any risk undertaken by Mr. Hourani. There was no capital flow between him and CIOC that contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC111.\n\nAward, at 395-396.\n\nAward, at 455.\n\n157.\n\nConsequently, Claimant failed to discharge the burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of a U.S. citizen (Mr. Hourani), as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT. At the least, the Tribunal was not satisfied that Claimant had established the fact of that investment112.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n**d. The Committee\u2019s Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nFactual findings and weighing of evidence made by a tribunal are outside the powers of review of an annulment committee, except if the applicant can prove that the errors of fact are so egregious, or the weighing of evidence so irrational, as to constitute an independent cause for annulment. The respect for tribunals\u2019 factual findings is normally justified because it is the tribunal who controlled the marshalling of evidence, and had the opportunity of directly examining witnesses and experts.\n\n159.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal carefully analyzed and weighed the available evidence, and explained in some detail the reasons for its findings113. The Committee sees no reason why the Tribunal\u2019s factual findings with regard to Mr. Hourani\u2019s involvement should not stand.\n\nSee Award, at 424-456.\n\n160.\n\nConfronted with the factual conclusion that it had not been shown that Mr. Hourani, although formal owner of CIOC, had made any contribution, that he was running any risk and exercised actual control over the company, the Tribunal decided to deny jurisdiction, on the basis that CIOC was not \"an investment of [a U.S.] national\" as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT.\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion presents a difficulty, which has been emphasized by Applicant: Article I(1)(a) of the BIT defines investment as every kind of investment \"owned or controlled\" by a national or a company of the other Party. In Applicant\u2019s opinion, since the Tribunal found that Mr. Hourani was the owner of 92% of the share capital of CIOC, the necessary consequence should be that such investment meets the definition of Article I(1)(a) (\"owned *or* controlled\" by a U.S. national) and that CIOC must be deemed to be an investment of a U.S. national for the purposes of Article VI(8).\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal confronted this difficulty by reiterating that the term investment has an inherent meaning identified by tribunals and commentators which includes the existence of a contribution over a period of time and requires some degree of risk. Accordingly, the Tribunal considered that the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT denoted \"an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make a profit and thus involving some degree of risk\"114.\n\nAward, at 360.\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges that the term \"investment\", as used in the Convention and in different BITs, has been the object of much debate, and that there is no unanimous opinion on the precise requirements which an investment must meet. However, the position adopted by the Tribunal - that an investment requires a contribution by the investor and some degree of risk - finds support in many previous awards and in legal doctrine. This position is therefore clearly tenable and the Award cannot on this point be considered to be based on a manifest excess of powers.\n\n164.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Hourani owned an equity participation in CIOC, and that equity is among the categories of assets specifically mentioned as investments in Article I(1)(a), it concluded that Mr. Hourani\u2019s equity stake failed to qualify as an investment for the purposes of the foreign nationality test, because Mr. Hourani\u2019s investment in CIOC did not meet the inherent characteristics of an investment: a contribution over a period of time and the assumption of some degree of risk115.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n165.\n\nSumming up, the Tribunal decided to deny CIOC\u2019s standing, because it had not been shown that Mr. Hourani had made any contribution, that he had assumed any risk and that he exerted actual control. The fact that Mr. Hourani had not paid more than a negligible purchase price for the shares (without plausible economic justification) undoubtedly also influenced the Tribunal\u2019s decision. To deny jurisdiction, the Tribunal thus chose the route of attaching an inherent meaning to the concept of \"investment\", as used in Article VI(8), and of finding that Mr. Hourani had failed to prove the elements which constitute such inherent meaning.\n\n166.\n\nFor annulment purposes a mere divergence of opinion or of interpretation between the committee and the tribunal is irrelevant. An award should not be annulled if the tribunal\u2019s approach is reasonable or tenable, even if the committee\u2019s opinion diverges from that of the tribunal. Bearing this principle in mind, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s findings are tenable, and that the Award does not meet the high threshold required for annulment because of manifest excess of powers.\n\n167.\n\nThe Comitteee also notes that the Tribunal\u2019s findings are not unprecedented. In *Romak,* which also denied jurisdiction, the Tribunal based its finding on the argument that the term investment had an inherent meaning which included the existence of\n\n\"contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk\"116.\n\n*Romak, at 201**.*\n\n168.\n\nThe Committee thus finds no basis for considering that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law or misapplied it in such egregious manner as to amount to disregard of that law. The Committee must therefore reject Applicant\u2019s request for annulment for manifest excess of powers.\n\n**C. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nApplicant also argues that the Award should be annulled because the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee has already summarized its understanding of this ground of annulment: tribunals can *sua sponte* raise legal arguments which had not been pleaded, without having to revert to the parties, and without violating the parties\u2019 right to be heard, provided that the tribunal\u2019s arguments can be fitted within the legal framework argued during the procedure117.\n\nSee para. 94 *supra.*\n\n**a. Applicant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n171.\n\nApplicant points out that the Tribunal based its conclusion not on Article 25 of the Convention, the framework discussed by the parties, but on the notion of \"investment\" contained in Articles I(1)(a) and VI(8) of the BIT. In Applicant\u2019s submission, the Tribunal did so *ex officio,* without giving the parties the opportunity to state their views, and moreover upon grounds that were not advanced by Respondent, nor shared by the Tribunal with Claimant during the proceedings. In so doing, the Tribunal deprived Claimant of its right to be heard118.\n\nC II, at 157.\n\n**b. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n172.\n\nRespondent disagrees: in its opinion the nationality test was in debate and in any event the Tribunal was empowered to reformulate or even raise new jurisdictional arguments, provided they remained within the legal framework119.\n\nRII,at 94.\n\n**c. The Committee\u2019s Findings**\n-------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal declined jurisdiction on the basis that Claimant had not proved that CIOC was an investment of the U.S. citizen Mr. Hourani, as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT. The question is thus whether the Tribunal, in reaching this conclusion, went beyond the framework of the dispute and ruled on a matter on which Claimant had not had a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n(i) The Framework of the Dispute\n--------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe issue of whether CIOC was an investment under Article VI(8) of the BIT was raised by Claimant for the first time. Claimant\u2019s initial contention in the arbitral proceeding was that its claims complied with the conditions in Article 25 of the Convention as well as Article VI(8) of the BIT. In its Memorial, Claimant specifically averred that\n\n\"it is therefore clear that the requirements of Article VI(8) of the Treaty, and thus Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, are satisfied\"120.\n\nMemorial of May 14, 2009, at 42.\n\n175.\n\nIn a subsequent memorial, Claimant stated that it had an investment in Kazakhstan that met the definition of \"investment\" in both the BIT and the ICSID Convention121. Claimant added that, since Respondent did not deny that CIOC had made an investment that met the definition in the BIT and the requirement of the ICSID Convention, Claimant did not have to dwell further on this subject122.\n\nReply Memorial of July 31, 2010, the heading before 130.\n\nReply Memorial, at 147.\n\n176.\n\nRespondent\u2019s comments on the jurisdictional aspects mainly related to the ICSID Convention, arguing that Mr. Hourani had made no contribution of money or assets of any significance and had taken no risk. Moreover he had not made any *bona-fide* investment123. However, Respondent also added124:\n\n\"Such behavior is not of the sort the Convention and the Treaty [i.e. the BIT] were intended to protect and this Tribunal should not condone it by granting jurisdiction in this case\".\n\nCounter-Memorial of December 22, 2009, at 40, and Rejoinder of December 14, 2010, at 44.\n\nRejoinder of December 14, 2010, at 44.\n\n(ii) The Committee\u2019s Decision\n-----------------------------\n\n177.\n\nSince Article VI(8) of the BIT contains the agreement between the United States and Kazakhstan which is necessary to give effect to the nationality exception in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, there is a very close link between both provisions. Whilst it is true that the debate between the parties essentially concerned the issue whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction under Article 25 of the Convention, it is equally accurate that both parties also referred to the BIT.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee thus finds that the basis of Claimant\u2019s claims was the existence of an investment protected under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention in conjunction with Article VI(8) of the BIT. Although Respondent mainly relied on arguments derived from Article 25 of the Convention, it must have been clear to Claimant that the provisions of the Convention and the BIT were closely linked and in reality inseparable as far as the scope of protection of investments was concerned. Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and Article VI(8) of the BIT were therefore both part of the legal framework on the basis of which the jurisdictional issue would be examined and decided by the Tribunal.\n\n179.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Award, which was mainly based on Article VI(8) of the BIT, did not involve any new element extraneous to the parties\u2019 debate in their submissions to the Tribunal. On the contrary, Claimant had every reason to expect that Article VI(8) of the BIT would be part of the relevant legal considerations in the case and Claimant must be considered to have had full opportunity to comment on the repercussions of Article VI(8) in its submissions to the Tribunal.\n\n180.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning never went beyond the legal framework defined by the parties, and that Claimant\u2019s right to be heard remained unaffected.\n\n**D. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n181.\n\nApplicant argues that the Award should also be annulled, because the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its foreign nationality test.\n\n182.\n\nIn Applicant\u2019s view, the Tribunal violated Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention by basing its findings on incomprehensible reasoning, tantamount to a failure to state reasons: in reaching its conclusion the Tribunal jumped from one notion to another, from one treaty to another and from one provision to another, in a manner that defies common sense125.\n\nC I, at 179.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees: in its opinion the reasoning of the Tribunal on foreign nationality is clear, precise and logically developed126.\n\nR I, at 172.\n\n**b. The Committee\u2019s Findings**\n-------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal started its Award with sections devoted to the interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and Article VI(8) of the BIT and to the burden of proof. In a subsequent section, the Tribunal analyzed the question: \"Does Claimant satisfy the requirements of Article VI(8) of the BIT?\" The Tribunal then used separate sub-sections to discuss the nationality of Mr. Hourani, the ownership or control of CIOC and the question whether CIOC was an investment of Mr. Hourani. In each of the sections and sub-sections, the Tribunal summarized the parties\u2019 positions, and explained its own conclusions, quoting precedents and authorities in support.\n\n185.\n\nIt is not the Committee\u2019s task to judge the quality or the persuasiveness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. The Convention requires arbitrators to state reasons for their decisions, but the requirement is satisfied if the reasoning can be followed. Only reasons considered as contradictory or frivolous can be equated to a failure to state reasons and may lead committees to the setting aside of the award127.\n\nSee para. 102 *supra.*\n\n186.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee considers that there would be no difficulty for a normal reader of the Award to understand the Tribunal\u2019s arguments and to follow its line of reasoning leading up to its final conclusions. Nor can the Committee find the reasoning in any way contradictory or frivolous.\n\n187.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the reasoning provided by the Tribunal is adequate, complies with the requirement of Article 52(2)(e) and does not justify annulment of the Award.\n\n**VI. DEFINITION OF CONTROL AND INVESTMENT**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee has analyzed in the previous section Applicant\u2019s first ground for annulment: the foreign nationality test.\n\n189.\n\nThe second ground for annulment alleged by Applicant relates to the definition and application by the Tribunal of the \"control\" and \"investment\" requirements set forth in the BIT and in the Convention. This second ground will be analyzed in this section.\n\n**1. Applicant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n190.\n\nApplicant contends that the Tribunal made two erroneous interpretations, and subsequent applications, of the notions of (A.) \"ownership or control\" and (B.) \"investment\", which constituted separate violations.\n\n**A. Ownership or Control**\n---------------------------\n\n191.\n\nDuring the hearing before the Committee, counsel for Applicant summarized Applicant\u2019s argument as follows128: the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Hourani was owner of 92% of the share capital of CIOC, and that he thus satisfied the nationality test of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention; but then the Tribunal went on to state that Claimant had failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of a U.S. national, as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT. In holding this and in rejecting jurisdiction, the Tribunal, in Applicant\u2019s opinion, committed two independent violations of Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention each of which constitutes an excess of power and warrants annulment:\n\n- The first is that the Tribunal additionally required that control be interpreted as actual control, majority shareholding not being sufficient to comply with this requirement.\n\n- The second is that the Tribunal decided to add a further requirement, that of control, which is not referred to in Article VI(8).\n\nHT p. 11 *et seq.*\n\n192.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal committed independent breaches of these Articles when setting the standard of \"ownership or control\", since from the wording of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT it is clear that this provision requires *either* \"ownership\" *or* \"control\". But the Tribunal came to the conclusion that, by application of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, the ownership requirement could be dispensed with, and disregarded the fact that Mr. Hourani was the undisputed legal owner of a 92% stake in CIOC and could thus control CIOC129.\n\nC I, at 186.\n\n193.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal found the requirement of \"control\" to mean \"actual control\", despite its contrary prior holding that majority ownership implies \"a presumption of control\". This \"actual control\" test finds no basis in the BIT. Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT in fact only requires formal control - conveyed by ownership - by a U.S. national, as opposed to actual control. This self-created criterion of \"actual control\" is contrary to every single case where a similarly worded U.S. BIT has been invoked130.\n\nC I, at 189.\n\n194.\n\nApplicant thus considers that the Tribunal acted in manifest excess of powers by failing to apply both the very text of the BIT and the Vienna Convention and by establishing that \"control\" means \"actual control\", and this, in Applicant\u2019s opinion, warrants in itself the annulment of the Award131.\n\nC I, at 198.\n\n195.\n\nAdditionally the Tribunal did establish the \"actual control\" test without the parties having advanced this argument. The Tribunal did so at its own instigation, without ever giving CIOC the opportunity to comment132.\n\nC I, at 199.\n\n196.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal committed further independent breaches of Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention when applying its flawed \"actual control\" test. Notably, the Tribunal violated Article 52(1)(d) by failing to reverse the burden of proof from Claimant to Respondent and by stating that Claimant had the burden of proof to demonstrate that Mr. Hourani exercised \"actual control\"133.\n\nC Iat 203.\n\n197.\n\nApplicant also considers that the Tribunal failed to explain why the evidence submitted by CIOC was insufficient to establish that Mr. Hourani exercised \"actual control\" over CIOC. The Tribunal drew a general negative inference from the withdrawal of documents previously submitted by CIOC, which affected Claimant\u2019s credibility in the proceedings. In doing so, the Tribunal rendered an Award the reasoning of which the reader cannot follow, but which also constitutes a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure134.\n\nCI at 212.\n\n**B. Investment**\n-----------------\n\n198.\n\nApplicant further considers that the Tribunal, in examining the meaning of the term \"investment\" under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT, failed to apply or alternatively manifestly erred in the application of the definition of \"investment\", in a manner that constitutes multiple independent violations of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The Tribunal, instead of applying the broad and clear definition of \"investment\" provided for in the BIT, as was done in other cases involving a U.S. BIT, manifestly disregarded the BIT\u2019s express provisions and embarked on a mission to redefine the term \"investment\" restrictively135.\n\nC I, at 220.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal came to the conclusion that \"investment\" denotes an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make a profit and thus involving some degree of risk. In doing so, the Tribunal disregarded or alternatively grossly misapplied the BIT and the Vienna Convention, by importing into the definition of the term investment the notions of contribution and risk, as developed by other tribunals, not in relation to the BIT, but to the ICSID Convention. In Applicant\u2019s opinion, these acts of the Tribunal constitute a manifest excess of powers136.\n\nC I, at 229.\n\n200.\n\nMoreover the Tribunal established the meaning of the term investment under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT *ex officio,* without asking the parties for their views -which constitutes an Article 52(1)(d) violation137. Applicant accepts that in the course of the arbitration, the parties debated the notion of investment under the ICSID Convention - but never under the BIT138. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to first approach the parties on the question of the definition of investment in the BIT is a serious departure from the legal framework established by the parties. Applicant regards this failure as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure139.\n\nC I, at 232.\n\nC II, at 239.\n\nC II, at 240.\n\n201.\n\nApplicant finally argues that the Award should be annulled for violation of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, for failure to state reasons in relation to the definition and application of the term investment140.\n\nC I, at 235.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n202.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Applicant\u2019s contentions, both as regards ownership or control and as regards the definition of investment.\n\n**A. Ownership or Control**\n---------------------------\n\n203.\n\nRespondent argues that Applicant\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal could simply have dispensed with an assessment of the control requirement under Article 25(2)(b) is wrong and cannot constitute a basis for annulment: the requirement of control must be considered objectively, independently from the relevant BIT\u2019s agreement on foreign nationality141.\n\nR I, at 181.\n\n204.\n\nThus Applicant\u2019s argument that since the BIT required \"ownership or control\" and \"ownership\" had been established, the Tribunal could have dispensed with an assessment of the alternative control requirement simply ignores the objective outer limit set out in the Convention itself. Even if ownership had been conclusively established, this would not have dispensed the Tribunal from assessing whether the objective, outer limit of control under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention was respected.\n\n205.\n\nRespondent denies Applicant\u2019s contention that the Tribunal did not define actual control on the basis of the arguments advanced by the parties. Actual control, as compared with legal control, had been amply debated by the parties in the context of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention. Consequently, the Tribunal did not violate CIOC\u2019s right to be heard on the interpretation of the requirement of control nor did it manifestly exceed its powers in requiring that actual control be established for this purpose142.\n\nR I, at 201.\n\n206.\n\nRespondent further alleges that the Tribunal did not exceed - let alone manifestly exceed - its powers, nor did the Tribunal violate any rule of procedure by requiring that Claimant establish Mr. Hourani\u2019s control of CIOC in order to benefit from his U.S. nationality for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction143.\n\nR I, at 216.\n\n207.\n\nApplicant also argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when setting the standard of \"ownership or control\". However, what the Tribunal concluded is that the definition of foreign control in the BIT could not go beyond the \"outer limits\" established in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, and thus control needed to be proven144.\n\nRII, at 124.\n\n208.\n\nIn sum, with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation and application of the control requirement under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, Applicant is unable to establish manifest excess of powers, violation of a procedural rule or deficiency in the analysis, reasoning and conclusions of the Tribunal that would warrant annulment.\n\n**B. Investment**\n-----------------\n\n209.\n\nRespondent also denies that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by manifestly disregarding the BIT\u2019s express provisions for interpreting the term investment. The Tribunal held that the inherent meaning of the term investment included the existence of a contribution over a period of time and required some degree of risk. Respondent submits that from the Tribunal\u2019s sequential and reasoned analysis it is clear that it did not disregard Article I(1)(a) of the BIT. Rather, the Tribunal logically and methodically interpreted this provision. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s claim that the Tribunal exceeded its power by failing to apply or by grossly misapplying the definition of investment under Article I(1)(a) must fail145.\n\nR I, at 231.\n\n210.\n\nApplicant\u2019s second argument, that the Tribunal exceeded its power by \"importing\" into the definition of investment under the BIT the notions of contribution and risk must also be rejected146. In addition to the Tribunal in this case, a number of other investment treaty tribunals have, despite broad formulations of the term \"investment\" contained in the respective BITs, found that there is an intrinsic or objective meaning of the term, which is generally linked to the requirements of contribution, risk and duration of the investment, and which must be complied with in order to qualify as a protected investment147.\n\nR I, at 234.\n\nR I, at 250.\n\n211.\n\nRespondent adds that the question of the inherent meaning of investment for the purposes of CIOC\u2019s foreign nationality test was debated by the parties, and the parties\u2019 respective positions were taken into account by the Tribunal in its decision148. In any event, the Tribunal had the power to interpret the BIT definition of investment without first submitting its interpretation to the parties.\n\nR I, at 258.\n\n212.\n\nApplicant\u2019s third argument is that the Award must be annulled on the ground that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in relation to the definition and application of the term investment under the BIT. The Respondent disagrees: the Tribunal provided ample and detailed reasons in 15 paragraphs as to how it reached its conclusion on the definition of investment under the BIT and supported those reasons with numerous cases and commentaries. Under the guise of an alleged failure to state reasons, Applicant is in fact criticizing the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning itself149.\n\nR I, at 261.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal also explained in great detail why it considered that Mr. Hourani had made no \"investment\" in CIOC: the ownership of shares was not in itself sufficient to establish the existence of a protected investment under the BIT and did not dispense CIOC of its burden of establishing the existence of an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit and thus involving some degree of risk150.\n\nR I, at 263.\n\n214.\n\nRespondent finally points out that it is a well-established principle that committees cannot reassess the probative value of the evidence in the record as if they were a court of appeal. In short, Applicant may dislike the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the evidence and subsequent conclusions but is unable to show how the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision. Applicant\u2019s claim for annulment on this ground must be rejected151.\n\nR I, at 265.\n\n**3. The Committee\u2019s Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\nThe Two Alleged Violations\n--------------------------\n\n215.\n\nApplicant alleges that the Tribunal committed two independent violations, when in its Award it analyzed the \"ownership or control\" requirement and then added a self-invented additional requirement that there be an \"investment of Mr. Hourani\":\n\nThe Tribunal violated the \"ownership or control\" requirement established in Article I(1)(a) for two reasons: (i) because it required actual control, when formal control was sufficient, and disregarded that Mr. Hourani was owner of 92% of the share capital of CIOC and did hold formal control; and (ii) because it put the burden of proving actual control on CIOC.\n\nThe Tribunal also failed to apply the definition of \"investment\" set forth in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n216.\n\nIn Applicant\u2019s opinion the Tribunal\u2019s decisions gave rise to a manifest excess of powers, serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure and a failure to state reasons.\n\n217.\n\nRespondent disagrees and denies that any of the alleged violations occurred.\n\nAnalysis of the Tribunal\u2019s Findings\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe starting point for the analysis of CIOC\u2019s allegation must be the factual context established by the Tribunal. After weighing the available evidence it observed that\n\n\"[a] putative transaction to pay USD 6,500 for 92% for an enterprise into which over USD 10 million have been invested and for which later a relief of over USD 1 billion is sought calls for explanation and justification\"152.\n\nAward, at 437.\n\n218.\n\nAnother important element in the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of the evidence, was the withdrawal by CIOC of certain documents previously submitted:\n\n\"... while the allegedly forged documents were withdrawn by Claimant during the hearing (C-162, C-175, C-238, C-239, C-240, Aliyev 25; see Tr, day 6, pp. 228-229), and therefore the Tribunal will not rely on them, and while the Tribunal sees no indication that counsel for Claimant were aware of any doubts regarding these documents, the Tribunal cannot overlook that their submission and later withdrawal throw a doubt on Claimant\u2019s credibility. This has a bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s evidentiary evaluation of the fact that Claimant did not provide any documents showing the exercise of effective control by Devincci Hourani\"153.\n\nAward, at 405.\n\n219.\n\nAgainst this evidentiary and factual background, the Tribunal reviewed CIOC\u2019s standing and came to the following conclusions:\n\n- CIOC, a Kazakh company, is only authorized to institute ICSID arbitration against the Republic of Kazakhstan if it can prove that it is an investment of a U.S. national, as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT.\n\n- For the purposes of the BIT, investments include equity holdings owned or controlled by U.S. nationals [Article I(1)(a)].\n\n- There is evidence which proves that Mr. Hourani was the owner of 92% of the capital of CIOC.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal established that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Claimant\u2019s claims because CIOC did not meet the Article VI(8) test for two independent reasons.\n\n221.\n\nThe first reason is that Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention requires control, and the existence of control of the local company represents an outer limit, which Contracting States cannot disregard. The Tribunal found that \"control\" should be understood in this context as \"actual control\" and considered that CIOC had been unable to prove that it was actually controlled by Mr. Hourani. On this point the Tribunal concluded:\n\n\"Thus, there is not sufficient evidence of exercise **of actual control over CIOC** by Devincci Hourani. In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant has not provided sufficient proof for control as required by Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.... However, as Article I(1)(a) of the BIT requires ownership *or* control of an investment and, based on indirect evidence, Claimant could be regarded as owned by Devincci Hourani, a U.S. national, the Tribunal moves now to analyse further conditions for treating CIOC as a U.S. national under the BIT\"154.\n\nAward, at 407; emphasis in the original.\n\n222.\n\nThe second reason is that Article VI(8) of the BIT refers to an investment of a U.S. national. The Tribunal has found that investment has an inherent meaning, which requires the investor to make a certain contribution and assume a certain risk, and that CIOC has been unable to prove that Mr. Hourani met this test. The conclusion reached with regard to absence of control was as follows:\n\n\"Claimant insisted throughout the proceedings that it presented all necessary evidence to prove that the Tribunal has jurisdiction. The Tribunal disagrees. Claimant failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment of U.S. national (Devincci Hourani) as required by Article VI(8) of the BIT\"155.\n\nAward, at 457.\n\n223.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis the two requirements are cumulative: if CIOC fails to prove that it is controlled by Mr. Hourani *or* that Mr. Hourani has made an investment by way of contribution and assumption of risk, the necessary result will be dismissal of the claim for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n224.\n\nSince the inexistence of an investment by Mr. Hourani is the main reason for the Tribunal\u2019s decision, the Committee will analyze this requirement in first place [B) *infra}.* Thereafter, the Committee will refer to the control requirement [C) *infra}.*\n\n**B. The Requirement That CIOC Be an Investment of Mr. Hourani**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nCIOC claims that the Tribunal, in interpreting the term \"investment\" used in Articles 1(1)(a) and VI(8) of the BIT and concluding that CIOC failed to establish that it was an investment of Mr. Hourani\n\n- manifestly exceeded its powers,\n\n- seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and\n\n- failed to state reasons for its conclusion.\n\n**a. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Findings\n-----------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal based its interpretation of the term \"investment\" on its ordinary meaning, in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal first looked at dictionary definitions of investment to ascertain its ordinary meaning. Then it looked at the preamble of the BIT, in which the parties refer to investment as a \"flow of private capital\" from one contracting state to the other. The Tribunal noted that Article I(1)(a) of the BIT defines investment from the perspective of assets to be protected, but that the protection is not granted to any formally held asset, but only to assets which result from such a flow of capital. From this the Tribunal induced that the existence of a contribution is a prerequisite to the protection of the BIT156.\n\nAward, at 351.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal also indicated that the origin of the capital invested was immaterial for jurisdictional purposes. However, the Tribunal insisted that\n\n\"there still needs to be some economic link between that capital and the purported investor that enables the Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor\"157.\n\nAward, at 355.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed its interpretation of the term \"investment\" with the drafting history of the U.S. model BITs. It cited the 2004 U.S. model BIT, which changed the circular definition of investment to\n\n\"every asset... that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk\"158.\n\nRLA 4, Article 1.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal referred to Kenneth Vandevelde, the leading authority on U.S. BITs, who noted that\n\n\"the 2004 U.S. Model BIT continues the U.S. practice of limiting investment to those assets that have the character of an investment\"159.\n\nK. Vandevelde: \"U.S. International Investment Agreements\", 2009, at 122; RLA 5.\n\n230.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal held that the inherent meaning of the term investment - as used in Articles 1(1)(a) and VI(8) of the BIT - requires the existence of a contribution over a period of time and some degree of risk160.\n\nAward, at 360.\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal then applied this finding to the present case, concluding that Mr. Hourani\u2019s formal ownership of a 92% equity stake in CIOC is insufficient; for Mr. Hourani to hold an investment, he must also prove that he made a contribution to the company and that he assumed some risk (citing the *Romak* decision161).\n\nAward, at 360; *Romak,* at 207.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Disagreement\n------------------------\n\n232.\n\nApplicant disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s argument.\n\n233.\n\nIt alleges that the Tribunal disregarded the fact that the BIT is a *lex specialis-.* instead of establishing the meaning of investment included in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT by examining its proper context, the Tribunal construed its meaning pursuant to the Convention, by importing into the definition of investment under the BIT the notions of contribution and risk developed by tribunals in relation to Article 25 of the Convention162.\n\nC I, at 228.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s Decision\n------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s main finding is that the term \"investment\", as used in Article VI(8) of the BIT, has an inherent meaning, which requires contribution and risk assumption by the investor - two elements which Mr. Hourani was unable to prove.\n\n235.\n\nICSID Tribunals have analyzed the term investment predominantly in the context of Article 25 of the Convention. A number of tribunals have reached the conclusion that the existence of an investment requires some inherent characteristics. While the precise definition of such characteristics has been the object of debate, it is commonly accepted that contribution and risk assumption form part of the core elements which characterize an investment163.\n\nSchreuer: \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\" (CUP 2ed.), 2010, p. 128, at 153.\n\n236.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal decided to extend the inherent meaning of investment, developed in the context of Article 25 of the Convention, to Article VI(8) of the BIT, a provision which is intimately linked with and includes a cross-reference to Article 25(2)(b). The Tribunal\u2019s decision is not unreasonable: if the mere holding of equity, without contribution or risk, is not to be considered an investment for obtaining jurisdiction under Article 25(1), it seems reasonable that the same factual situation, but in the circumstances described in Article VI(8), should produce the same result.\n\n237.\n\nThe Committee has already established\n\n- that an award can be annulled if the arbitrators have manifestly exceeded their powers by totally disregarding the law, or by grounding their award on a law other than the applicable law164;\n\n- that misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law, even if serious, does not justify annulment165; and\n\n- that only in exceptional circumstances a gross or egregious error of law, acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to failure to apply the proper law166.\n\nSee para. 78 *supra.*\n\nSee para. 79 *supra.*\n\nSee para. 81 *supra.*\n\n238.\n\nMeasured against that standard, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the inherent meaning of investment requires a contribution and some assumption of risk, does not justify the annulment of the Award.\n\n**b. Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nApplicant alleges that the Tribunal interpreted and applied the term investment *ex officio,* without asking the parties for their views. Hence, by depriving CIOC of its right to be heard, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure167.\n\nC I, at 232.\n\n240.\n\nApplicant\u2019s allegation cannot succeed, for the same reasons as those already established *supra168*: CIOC argued its standing based on a legal framework which comprised Articles 25(2)(b) of the Convention and VI(8) of the BIT and specifically pointed out that the requirements of both these Articles were satisfied. Respondent also noted that CIOC\u2019s behaviour was not of the sort the Convention and the BIT were intended to protect.\n\nSee paras. 173-180.\n\n241.\n\nIt follows that Article VI(8) of the BIT was part of the relevant legal framework on which Claimant could be expected to comment if it wished its arguments to be taken into account by the Tribunal.\n\n242.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that Claimant was not deprived of its right to be heard and that there was no breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**c. Failure to State Reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nApplicant also seeks annulment of the Award on the ground of the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to state reasons for its definition of investment. Applicant specifically avers that the Tribunal failed to explain why Mr. Hourani, despite his ownership of the shares in CIOC, was not considered to have made an investment in that company169.\n\nCI at 235-236.\n\n244.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Applicant that the question why Mr. Hourani, despite being the owner of a majority stake in CIOC, did not meet the Article VI(8) test, is a crucial question in this case. The Award provides the following reasoning for the finding on this point:\n\n- Para. 361 gives the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the term investment as used in Article VI(8): investment is \"an economic arrangement requiring a contribution to make profit and thus involving some degree of risk\".\n\n- Para. 455 records the factual findings with regard to Mr. Hourani\u2019s investment: although he acquired \"formal ownership\", \"no plausible economic motive was given to explain the negligible purchase price\" and \"no evidence was presented of a contribution of any kind or any risk undertaken\" by him; \"there was no capital flow between him and CIOC that contributed anything to the business venture operated by CIOC\".\n\n- Para. 457 draws the conclusion: \"Claimant failed to discharge its burden of proof with regard to the fact that CIOC was an investment\" of Mr. Hourani.\n\n245.\n\nThe Committee has already established in which cases deficiencies in the reasoning can lead to the setting aside of awards: if the reasoning can be followed and understood by a reader, the award should stand, while contradictory or frivolous reasons will lead to annulment170. On the other hand, it is not the Committee\u2019s role to judge the quality or persuasiveness of the Tribunal\u2019s argumentation.\n\nSee para. 102 *supra.*\n\n246.\n\nApplying this threshold, the Committee finds that the Award has provided sufficient reasoning and cannot be annulled for this cause.\n\n**C. The Requirement That CIOC Be Controlled by Mr. Hourami**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal established a second (and additional) reason why CIOC failed to meet the standing requirements necessary to file an ICSID arbitration: Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention requires foreign control of the local corporation, the existence of such control represents an outer limit and is a requirement that cannot be replaced by an agreement171, and Mr. Hourani was unable to prove that he actually controlled CIOC172.\n\nAward at 336.\n\nAward at 407.\n\n248.\n\nApplicant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s findings with regard to control should lead to annulment, under Article 52(1) of the Convention, for two separate reasons:\n\n- First, because Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT requires *either* \"ownership\" *or* \"control\", and in violation of that rule the Tribunal established an actual control test [(a) *infra\\.*\n\n- Second, because the Tribunal, when applying this test, failed to reverse the burden of proof from CIOC to Respondent and stated that CIOC had the burden of proof [(b) *infra].*\n\n**a. The Actual Control Test**\n------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings with regard to control can be summarized as follows:\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the Convention requires foreign control, and this requirement represents an outer limit to ICSID jurisdiction; although Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT defines investments as those \"owned or controlled\" by nationals or companies of the other Party, Article 25(2)(b) establishes control as a necessary requirement173.\n\n- Control means actual control, and legal capacity to control a company, without evidence of actual control, is therefore not sufficient174.\n\n- There is not sufficient evidence that Mr. Hourani exercised actual control over CIOC175.\n\nAward at 336.\n\nAward at 407.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nFirst Finding\n-------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s first finding, that Article 25(2)(b) creates an outer limit, which the Contracting States must respect, has been accepted by a number of tribunals, starting with *Vacuum Salt'.*\n\n\"The reference in Article 25(2)(b) to \"foreign control\" necessarily sets an objective Convention limit beyond which ICSID jurisdiction cannot exist and parties therefore lack power to invoke same no matter how devoutly they may have desired to do so\"176.\n\nAt 36.\n\nSecond Finding\n--------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s second finding is that control as used in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention means actual control, and that a tribunal may investigate the reality to check whether actual control exists; this also corresponds to a view which is commonly held.\n\n252.\n\nUnder Article 25(2)(b) a local juridical person, to have access to the ICSID adjudication mechanism, must be under \"foreign control\". For these purposes, control is the capacity of a person or a company to decide the main actions to be undertaken by a juridical person. Such juridical persons are usually governed by a corporate body (e.g., the general shareholders meeting), in which decisions are taken by votes. Control is premised on the right to cast a majority of votes in such main corporate body.\n\n253.\n\nControl is normally achieved by ownership of a majority stake in the juridical person, which affords a sufficient number of votes, so that the controller can have a decisive influence on any decisions or resolutions.\n\n254.\n\nBut the owner of the equity may only formally be the owner or can by - tacit or explicit - agreement transfer actual control to a third party (e.g., the owner can enter into a fiduciary arrangement with a third party, holding ownership on behalf of such third party, or he can assign his voting rights to another person). Thus third parties who are not owners of equity stakes can, by contractual arrangements with the formal owners, have actual control over juridical persons177.\n\nControl gives rise to a number of additional issues, like indirect control and joint control by various persons, which are irrelevant for the present discussion.\n\n255.\n\nControl is a factual element. The ownership of a majority of the share capital, granting the capacity to cast a majority of the votes, constitutes circumstantial evidence of control and even creates a presumption of control. But, when applying Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, tribunals may have to establish whether the presumption of control corresponds to the real situation or, in other words, whether the formal majority owners of a company also exercise actual control over the company.\n\nThird Finding\n-------------\n\n256.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal weighed the evidence regarding the actual control of CIOC in the following manner:\n\n- The submission and later withdrawal by Claimant of certain documents threw \"a doubt on Claimant\u2019s credibility\"178.\n\n- Claimant did not provide any documents showing the exercise of effective control by Mr. Hourani179.\n\n- Mr. Hourani, when heard as a witness, based his evidence of control on his competences under CIOC\u2019s Charter and Incorporation Agreement, but the Tribunal found that \"no evidence was shown that such competences and control were actually exercised by him\"180.\n\nAward at 405.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nAward, at 406.\n\n257.\n\nIn view of the above considerations,\n\n\"the Tribunal conclude[d] that Claimant ha[d] not provided sufficient proof for control as required by Art. 25 (2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n258.\n\nThe Committee has already established that manifest excess of powers in the application of the law only leads to annulment of an award if the arbitrators totally disregarded the law, grounded their award on a law other than the applicable law or committed a gross or egregious error of law181. A tribunal\u2019s weighing of evidence and factual findings must stand, except if the errors of fact are so egregious, or the weighing so irrational, as to constitute independent causes of annulment.\n\nSee para. 79 *supra*\n\n259.\n\nMeasured against these standards, the Tribunal\u2019s findings that Article 25(2)(b) refers to actual control, and that Mr. Hourani failed to satisfy this requirement, cannot lead to the annulment of the Award.\n\n260.\n\nApplicant has also argued that in making these findings the Tribunal violated Articles 52(1)(d) and (e) of the Convention, because it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state reasons. These allegations must fail, for the reasons already explained in the previous sections182.\n\nSee paras. 242 and 246 *supra.*\n\n**b. The Failure to Reverse the Burden of Proof**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nApplicant submits that the Tribunal committed a further independent breach, in this case of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention, by failing to reverse the burden of proof from Claimant to Respondent and by stating that Claimant - as opposed to Respondent - had the burden of proof to demonstrate that Mr. Hourani exercised actual control over the Kazakh company183.\n\nCI at 203.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Findings\n-----------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings with regard to the burden of proof can be summarized as follows:\n\n263.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s investigation was that the parties had generally agreed\n\n\"that Claimant bears the burden of proof to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute\"184.\n\nAward, at 364.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal then added that\n\n\"if majority ownership is shown, such a finding implies a presumption of control, even though it will have to be examined whether in the present case this presumption is a sufficient indication of control\"185.\n\nAward, at 382.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed whether Mr. Hourani could be considered as owner of 92% of the equity of CIOC; the Tribunal concluded that certain indirect evidence appeared to show that Mr. Hourani was an owner of a 92% share in CIOC and added:\n\n\"In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that jurisdiction cannot be denied for the mere reason that Claimant has not fully complied with its burden of proof regarding ownership by the U.S. national, Devincci Hourani\"186.\n\nAward, at 396.\n\n266.\n\nAs a next step, the Tribunal analyzed Mr. Hourani\u2019s control of CIOC, stating:\n\n\"Again, the starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s examination is that Claimant has the burden of proof\u2019187.\n\nAward, at 401.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s final conclusion, after weighing the available evidence, was that \"there is not sufficient evidence of exercise of actual control over CIOC by Devincci Hourani\"188.\n\nAward, at 407\n\nThe Committee\u2019s Decision\n------------------------\n\n268.\n\nIn accordance with the general rule of evidence *actori incumbit probatio* it is CIOC who bears the burden of establishing that the requirements of the applicable legal tests have been met, since CIOC is the one seeking to benefit from Mr. Hourani\u2019s U.S. nationality and control. The Committee therefore finds no reason to question the Award\u2019s initial assumption that \"Claimant bears the burden of proof to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute\"189.\n\nAward, at 364.\n\n269.\n\nAs a next step, the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Hourani had met his burden of proving that he was the owner of a 92% stake in CIOC. The Tribunal then added that, as a general rule, the majority owner of a company must be presumed to control it, this being a presumption already established in a number of previous awards.\n\n270.\n\nHaving come to that conclusion, the Tribunal decided that, in the circumstances of the present case, the presumption of control could not be applied in Mr. Hourani\u2019s favour. Doubts on this matter were already expressed when the presumption was established (\"it will have to be examined whether in the present case this presumption is a sufficient indication of control\"190), and the doubts were confirmed when the Tribunal in its subsequent reasoning unequivocally averred that, as regards control, \"Claimant has the burden of proof\u2019191.\n\nAward, at 382.\n\nAward, at 401.\n\n271.\n\nThe Committee finds it appropriate at this juncture to make a few general remarks on the character and scope of the general presumption that a majority owner of a company also controls the company. In the Committee\u2019s opinion, this presumption, which is based on an owner\u2019s normal legal rights under company law, is valid only as long as there are no special elements which create doubts about the owner\u2019s actual control and which therefore justify a closer examination of the facts.\n\n272.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal first found that already the circumstances of Mr. Hourani\u2019s acquisition of 92% of the stock in CIOC created doubts about his role as owner. These doubts were further strengthened by the absence of any convincing evidence that he had in reality exercised control over CIOC.\n\n273.\n\nThe existence of special circumstances justifies in the present case that the Tribunal deviate from the general presumption that majority ownership of a company also entails its control. Consequently, in the absence of the presumption, whether Mr. Hourani controls CIOC is a matter to be proven; and in accordance with the general rule of *actori incumbit probatio* it is for Mr. Hourani to do so.\n\n274.\n\nSumming up, the Committee does not find in this respect any violation of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention which could lead to the annulment of the Award.\n\n**VII. OBITER DICTUM**\n----------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Committee will analyze in this section the third ground for annulment alleged by Applicant, which refers to the Tribunal\u2019s holding in an *obiter dictum.*\n\n**1. Applicant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n276.\n\nApplicant argues that in an *obiter dictum* the Tribunal used a false translation of Clause 27.8 of the Contract (No. 954) regarding CIOC\u2019s investment in Kazakhstan.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal used the following translation:\n\n\"... it is hereby agreed that the Contractor is a resident of Lebanon, or in the event of assignment as a national of the resident country of the assignee, and therefore the Contractor shall be treated as a resident of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, for purposes of the ICSID Convention\"192.\n\nC I, at 239.\n\n278.\n\nThe correct translation, in Applicant\u2019s opinion, should be the following:\n\n\"... it is hereby agreed that the Contractor is a national of Lebanon, or in the event of an assignment, a national of the country of residence of the assignee, and the Contractor will accordingly be considered a national of Lebanon or other relevant country for the purposes of the ICSID Convention\"193.\n\nC I at 241.\n\n279.\n\nApplicant argues that the *obiter dictum* must be annulled for two reasons:\n\n- First, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, because it issued the *obiter dictum* without first hearing the parties, thus depriving CIOC of the opportunity to present its case194. Second, the Tribunal also evidently and manifestly exceeded its powers, because it disregarded the authoritative Russian version of the Contract and applied an incorrect translation, without first verifying whether the English version of this provision was consistent with the authoritative Russian version195. The Tribunal did so in violation of Article 30.2 of the Contract196. In deciding as it did, the Tribunal disregarded the applicable norm or committed a gross error of law, which constitutes in itself a manifest excess of power197.\n\nC II, at 255.\n\nC II, at 257.\n\nC II, at 261.\n\nCII, at 264.\n\n280.\n\nIn the course of the hearing before the Committee, Applicant confirmed that -assuming that the Award was not annulled *in toto -* it was still requesting that the *obiter dictum* itself be annulled198.\n\nHT p. 129,1. 4.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n281.\n\nRespondent argues that Applicant\u2019s contentions must fail for the following reasons199.\n\nR I, at 266.\n\n282.\n\nFirst, the *obiter dictum* character of the observation excludes any possibility of annulment; it has no impact on the decision of the Tribunal and therefore cannot be subject to annulment under Article 52 of the Convention.\n\n283.\n\nSecond, in any event the grounds for annulment are not present in this case, since the Tribunal did not breach a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to give Claimant the opportunity to discuss Clause 27.8, nor did the Tribunal manifestly exceed its powers by relying on the allegedly wrong version of such clause.\n\n284.\n\nThird, Applicant has misrepresented or misunderstood the meaning of the Tribunal\u2019s observation.\n\n285.\n\nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s allegation that there was a translation error, neither party ever questioned or criticized the correctness of the translation of Clause 27.8. Consequently, the Tribunal\u2019s reliance on the correctness of the English version does not constitute an error. Furthermore, the use of the translation now favoured by Applicant does not affect the meaning of the Tribunal\u2019s *obiter dictum.* Any error could not possibly rise to the level of a \"manifest\" excess of powers or a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure200.\n\nRII,at 160.\n\n**3. The Committee\u2019s Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe relevant Section of the Award201 is devoted to the interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, and specifically to the necessity of an agreement between the parties for a local juridical person to be considered national of another Contracting State. In its Award, the Tribunal noted that in most of the previous ICSID proceedings concerning Article 25(2)(b) the agreement was negotiated directly between the parties or was implied from an ICSID arbitration clause contained in an investment contract. The Tribunal added:\n\n\"In such circumstances, the existence of an express or implied agreement to treat the locally incorporated company as a foreign national gave that company standing in the dispute. In the present dispute the investment contract between the parties (the Contract) contains an ICSID arbitration clause. However, Claimant is relying on the BIT, not the Contract, to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction\"202.\n\nSection I.II.3.\n\nAward at 330 *in fine.*\n\n287.\n\nAt the end of the same paragraph, the Tribunal inserted the following footnote:\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that it does not follow from the Contract that Claimant can be treated as a national of another Contracting State. The Contract states that the parties *\"agreed that the Contractor is a resident of Lebanon, or in the event of assignment as a national of the resident country of the assignee, and therefore the Contractor shall be treated as a resident of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, for purposes of the ICSID Convention. \"* (C-4, Clause 27.8) This original wording of the Contract, initially concluded between Kazakhstan and CCC, was not addressed in connection with the transfer of the Contract from CCC to CIOC\"203.\n\nFootnote No. 10.\n\n288.\n\nApplicant submits that in making this observation with regard to Clause 27.8 of the Contract, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Applicant requests the Committee to annul - if not the Award *in toto -* at least the footnote.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nApplicant\u2019s first argument is that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, because it relied on an inaccurate translation of the Contract, and not on the authoritative Russian version.\n\n290.\n\nThe translation used by the Tribunal is this:\n\n\"... it is hereby agreed that the Contractor is a resident of Lebanon, or in the event of assignment as a national of the resident country of the assignee, and therefore the Contractor shall be treated as a resident of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, for purposes of the ICSID Convention [... ]\"204.\n\nC I, at 239.\n\n291.\n\nApplicant avers that the correct translation should be the following:\n\n\"... it is hereby agreed that the Contractor is a national of Lebanon, or in the event of an assignment, a national of the country of residence of the assignee, and the Contractor will accordingly be considered a national of Lebanon or other relevant country for the purposes of the ICSID Convention\"205.\n\nC I, at 241.\n\n292.\n\nThe basic difference between the two versions is that in the translation used by the Tribunal the Contractor is treated as a \"resident\" of Lebanon, or other country if appropriate, and in the other as a \"national\" of Lebanon or other relevant country. Respondent has not agreed to this new translation206 and it is not for this Committee to establish which of the two translations is more accurate.\n\nR I, at 278.\n\n293.\n\nEven apart from the fact that Applicant\u2019s allegation concerns a statement in a footnote without any impact on the outcome of the case, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by relying on a -now allegedly incorrect - translation, which had been submitted by Claimant itself207. Since Claimant never drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the existence of a mistake and never submitted a corrected version, the Tribunal cannot be reproached for having assumed that the translation was accurate.\n\nDoc. CA 16, which was originally submitted as Doe. C 4 in the underlying arbitration.\n\n294.\n\nIt is therefore misplaced for Applicant to accuse the Tribunal of having committed a manifest excess of powers by relying on an English version of the Contract which Claimant itself had submitted and had never corrected.\n\n**B. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nApplicant\u2019s second allegation is that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, because CIOC was never given the opportunity to state its case in relation to the question addressed in the footnote.\n\n296.\n\nThis allegation also fails for two reasons.\n\n297.\n\nFirst, both Parties agree that the footnote inserted in the Award is an *obiter dictum208, i.e.* an incidental comment made in connection with the Award. This means that what is stated in the footnote is unnecessary to support the main decision, and that it therefore has no precedential value and does not have any effect as *res iudicata.* The Tribunal never again referred or alluded to this footnote in the rest of the document, and its drafting shows that it had no conclusive effect for the dispositive section of the Award, nor did it affect the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.\n\nC I, at 243; R I, at 267.\n\n298.\n\nSince *obiter dicta* are purely incidental to a tribunal\u2019s determination, inclusion of any such comment in the text of a decision cannot affect the parties\u2019 right to be heard, which by its very nature only extends to those issues which are actually adjudicated by the tribunal.\n\n299.\n\nSecond, in the present case the *obiter dictum* falls squarely within the legal framework established by Claimant in order to prove standing and jurisdiction209. This framework covers Articles VI(8) of the BIT and 25(2)(b) of the Convention, and the Tribunal made the statement in the footnote in the course of its interpretation of the second of these provisions.\n\nSee para. 274 *supra.*\n\n300.\n\nOn June 5, 2013, CIOC and Mr. Hourani initiated a new ICSID arbitration against the Republic of Kazakhstan, involving the Contract210. A question which may arise in that proceeding is whether, when applying the Contract, CIOC should be considered a national of another ICSID Contracting State for the purposes of access to ICSID jurisdiction. That is a question for the new ICSID tribunal to determine. Any issue on the meaning and interpretation of the Contract is beyond the scope of decision of the original ICSID Tribunal (and of this Committee).\n\nRII,at 162.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n301.\n\nThe parties submitted their statements on costs simultaneously on October 15, 2013. Applicant informed the Committee that its total costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding were EUR 600,000 in legal fees plus USD 282,913 in ICSID costs (lodging fee and advances) (these amounts having been paid in full)211. Subsequently, the Applicant made an advance payment of USD 70,000 on December 24, 2013.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Final Statement of Costs of 15 October 2013.\n\n302.\n\nRespondent declared that its legal fees and expenses in connection with this annulment proceeding were USD 1,758,782 (of which USD 1,158,908 has already been paid)212.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Final Statement of Costs of October 15, 2013.\n\n303.\n\nEach party has asked that its legal and arbitration costs be borne by the other party213.\n\nCII, at 274; RII, at 167.\n\n304.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"... the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\".\n\n305.\n\nArticle 52(4) extends the application of this provision to annulment proceedings.\n\n306.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the parties have the undeniable right to challenge an award. However, it argues that such right should not be misused in order to obtain an appeal on the merits. Respondent argues that Applicant\u2019s purpose in filing the request was to obtain a review on the merits. For this reason, Applicant should bear the entire costs of the annulment proceedings214.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Final Statement of Costs of October 15, 2013.\n\n307.\n\nThe Committee considers that CIOC\u2019s case was not frivolous and that Applicant exercised its right to apply for annulment in accordance with Article 52 of the Convention. In light of the *bona fides* nature of Applicant\u2019s application for annulment, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that Applicant should not bear the entire costs of the proceedings. Therefore the Committee decides\n\n- that the ICSID fees shall be borne by Applicant and\n\n- that each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n308.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n1. The application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP for annulment of the Award issued by the Tribunal on June 5, 2012 is dismissed.\n\n2. Each of the Parties shall bear its own legal fees and expenses, and Caratube International Oil Company LLP shall bear the direct costs of the proceeding, comprising the fees and expenses of the Committee and the costs of using the ICSID facilities, in their entirety.\n\n3. The stay of enforcement of the Award is declared automatically terminated in accordance with Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules."}]}
