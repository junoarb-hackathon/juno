THE ARBITRAL PROCEDURE AND APPLICATION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 October 2013, the Claimant filed a request for arbitration dated 10 October 2013 against the Respondent (the \"Request for Arbitration\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID (\"Secretary-General\") registered the Request for Arbitration, as supplemented by the Claimant\u2019s letters of 8 November, 22 November, and 10 December 2013, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for constitution of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nIn due course, the Tribunal was composed of Mr. Gary Bom, a national of the United States of America, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Dr. Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, appointed by the Claimant; and the Honourable Justice Duncan Kerr, Chev LH, a national of Australia, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Monty Taylor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Valeriya Kirsey was designated to serve as the Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, the Respondent submitted the Application, together with accompanying factual and legal exhibits.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by telephone conference-call on 25 July 2014. The Tribunal subsequently issued its Procedural Order No. 1 on 7 August 2014.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1, on 8 August 2014 the Claimant filed its \"Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5)\" (\"Claimant\u2019s Observations\"), together with accompanying factual exhibits and legal materials.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 August 2014, the Claimant requested a one-day extension to file reply observations with respect to its \"Request for Provisional Measures\" dated 14 July 2014, which were due to be filed that day under the terms of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1. This request was granted by the Tribunal on 12 August 2014, and an equivalent one-day extension was granted to the Respondent to file its \"Reply Observations on Rule 41(5) Preliminary Objections\" (\"Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations\").\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the granted extension, the Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations were filed on 20 August 2014, together with supporting legal exhibits.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural timetable, hearing on the Application took place at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore on 10 October 2014. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal (with Dr. Pryles attending by video-conference), the Secretary of the Tribunal, the Tribunal Assistant (attending by audio-conference) and the court reporter, attending the hearing were:\n\n**For the Claimant:**\n\n*Counsel*\n\nMr. Nish Shetty Clifford Chance\n\nMr. Romesh Weeramantry Clifford Chance\n\nMr. Paul Sandosham Clifford Chance\n\nMr. Sam Luttrell Clifford Chance\n\nMr. Mathew Brown Clifford Chance\n\n*Parties*\n\nMr. Andrew Lind Gadens Lawyers\n\n**For the Respondent:**\n\n*Counsel*\n\nMr. Alvin Yeo SC WongPartnership LLP\n\nMs. Joy Tan WongPartnership LLP\n\nMs. Koh Swee Yen WongPartnership LLP\n\nMs. Wendy Lin WongPartnership LLP\n\nMs. Monica WY Chong WongPartnership LLP\n\n15.\n\nA verbatim transcript of the oral hearing was prepared by professional stenographers.

Without prejudice to the completion of this process, given the time constraints in issuing this ruling (pending the outcome of the Application, a hearing on jurisdiction is currently due to take place at the end of November 2014), the Tribunal in this Order will refer to the transcript as issued on 10 October 2014 *(i.e.,* without corrections by the parties). The references to the draft transcript (\"DT\") will be in the following format: DT. [page]. [line].\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nTo the extent required by the Tribunal to address the Respondent\u2019s Application, and for that limited purpose only, the Tribunal briefly summarises the factual background to the dispute as pleaded in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration. The below summary of the facts does not constitute any finding by the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the Parties, still less any final findings of fact.\n\n17.\n\nThis proceeding concerns the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in an open pit copper and gold mine in the Star Mountains of the Western Province of PNG (the \"Ok Tedi mine\"). As set out in the Request for Arbitration, PNGSDP owns a majority shareholding (i.e., 63.4146%) in Ok Tedi Mining Ltd (\"OTML\"), a PNG-incorporated company.2 OTML\u2019s rights to the Ok Tedi mine are set out in Special Mining Lease No. 1 (the \"Special Mining Lease\"). The Special Mining Lease is the primary asset of OTML.3\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 16.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 25.\n\n18.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration provides details on the history of the Ok Tedi mine and on how the Claimant was incorporated and came to own its shares in OTML.4 These facts are summarised below, to the extent relevant for the consideration of the Respondent\u2019s Application.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Paras. 9-15.\n\n19.\n\nIn 2001, BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd (\"BHP,\" a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Ltd (\"BHP Billiton\") (the former shareholder and operator of OTML)) transferred all of its ordinary shares in OTML to the Claimant.5 This transfer was intended to entrust an independent, foreign-registered company with the management of the development of the Ok Tedi mine (through OTML) and the use of its earnings from the mine to promote sustainable development within PNG and advance the general welfare of the people of PNG, particularly those of the Western Province where the Ok Tedi mine is located.6 In connection with the transfer, a charge was created over the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML (the \"Charge\"), by way of a Security Deed dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Security Deed\") and a Security Trust Deed dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Security Trust Deed\"), and a mortgage was created over the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML (the \"Mortgage\"), by way of an Equitable Mortgage of Shares dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Equitable Mortgage of Shares\")7\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 13.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Paras. 13-14.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 14.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing a selective share buyback conducted in January 2011, the Claimant and the Respondent have respectively held 63.4146% and 36.5853% of issued ordinary shares in OTML.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 15.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant was incorporated in Singapore on 20 October 2001.9 It is a company limited by guarantee (as distinguished from share capital) and governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association (the \"Memorandum and Articles of Association\" or \"M&A\").10 The M&A annex a set of Program Rules (the \"Program Rules\") which primarily deal with how earnings are to be applied for the purposes of fund management, transparency and accountability.11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 18.\n\n22.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Claimant carries significant risk as a shareholder in OTML due to, inter alia, its undertaking to take over BHP\u2019s liabilities in respect of the mining activities (and its broader obligations as a shareholder), and indemnities that the Claimant granted in respect of environmental claims and claims arising out of BHP\u2019s stewardship of OTML.12\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 19.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, since its establishment in 2001, it has financed and overseen at least USD 500 million dollars worth of development and environmental projects. It has financed these projects, and carried out the functions for which it was established, by taking its annual dividends from OTML and (in accordance with the Program Rules) putting them into low-risk investments in international markets to establish two funds: a short-term fund (the \"Development Fund\") and a Long Term Fund (the \"LTF\").13\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 20.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent, through its instrumentalities and entities for which it is responsible, has mounted a concerted campaign against the Claimant and its investments, culminating in the cancellation of the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML.14\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 24.\n\n25.\n\nIn particular, on 13 September 2013, the Respondent adopted the Mining (Ok Tedi Tenth Supplemental Agreement) Act 2013 (the \"Tenth Supplemental Act\"), along with the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Continuation) (Ninth Supplemental Agreement) (Amendment) Act 2013.15 According to the Claimant, among other things, the Tenth Supplemental Act purports to cancel the shares held by the Claimant in OTML. Section 4 provides, in the relevant part, as follows:\n\n*4. Shareholders of OTML*\n\n*(1) On the coming into operation of this Act -*\n\n*(a) all ordinary shares held by PNGSDP in the share capital of OTML shall be cancelled and cease to exist; and*\n\n*(b) 122,200,000 new, fully paid ordinary shares in the share capital of OTML free of any encumbrance, charge or equitable interest shall be issued to the State.16*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 35.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 36.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Subsection 5(1) of the Tenth Supplemental Act purports to empower the Prime Minister of PNG, Mr. Peter O\u2019Neill, to declare whether compensation is payable to any person in respect of the effects of the Tenth Supplemental Act and, if so, the amount of compensation and the terms on which it is payable.17 The Claimant further states that Section 5(4) provides that nothing in the Tenth Supplemental Act imposes any obligation on the Respondent or any other person to pay compensation in respect of the effects of the Tenth Supplemental Act other than pursuant to an order under Section 5(1).18\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 37.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 37.\n\n27.\n\nSections 4(5) and 4(6) of the Tenth Supplemental Act provide:\n\n*(5) All references to PNGSDP in the constitution of OTML and in the Fifth Restated Shareholders Agreement shall, on and from the coming into operation of this Act, be read and construed as a reference to the State.*\n\n*(6) On and from the coming into operation of this Act, the Charge is void and of**no legal effect and shall not create any interest of any nature whatsoever in any share of OTML19*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 39.\n\n28.\n\nSection 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act provides:\n\n*Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act, the State has all necessary powers to restructure PNGSDP and its operations to ensure that PNGSDP applies its funds for the exclusive benefit of the people of the Western Province.20*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 40.\n\n29.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant claims that the enactment of the Tenth Supplemental Act amounts to a breach of the prohibition against unlawful expropriation.21 The Claimant further claims that the conduct of the Respondent has amounted to violations of other guarantees and standards of treatment that must be accorded by the Respondent to foreign investors, including (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard; (ii) guarantee of free repatriation of returns on investments; (iii) specific undertakings given to the Claimant (i.e., the umbrella clause); (iv) the full protection and security standard; (v) the rule against arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable measures; (vi) national treatment guarantee; and (vii) the rule of free entry and sojourn of personnel.22\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 54.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 55.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS ON THE APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*A.* ***The Respondent\u2019s Application***\n---------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent raises two objections in the Application regarding the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration: first, that the jurisdictional requirements set out in the ICSID Convention are not satisfied, and therefore that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims; and second, that certain of the Claimant\u2019s substantive claims are manifestly without legal merit.\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n---------------\n\n31.\n\nIn referring to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent notes that the jurisdiction of the Centre may only be invoked in relation to a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"23 The Respondent claims that it is clear from a review of the Request for Arbitration that the mandatory jurisdictional requirements of Article 25(1) are not satisfied, as there is no \"private foreign investment\" and there is no consent to arbitration by PNG under the ICSID Convention.24\n\nApplication, Para. 17.\n\nApplication, Para. 18.\n\n32.\n\nDealing first with the argument as to \"private foreign investment,\" the Respondent alleges that the Claimant\u2019s objects and the circumstances surrounding the Claimant\u2019s incorporation compel the conclusion that PNGSDP is not a \"foreign investor\" and that there is no \"private foreign investment.\"25\n\nApplication, Para. 19.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in order to determine whether an alleged \"investment\" falls within the auspices of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, one must look at the object and purpose of the Convention.26 In referring to the *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention* and other legal materials for guidance on that object and purpose,27 the Respondent contends that the existence of a private foreign investment is required in order to qualify for protection under the ICSID Convention.28 The Respondent submits that no such private foreign investment is present in this case.29\n\nApplication, Para. 20.\n\nSee Application, Paras. 21-22 in this respect.\n\nApplication, Paras. 21-23.\n\nApplication, Para. 23.\n\n34.\n\nCiting Clauses 5 and 12 of the M&A, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s members30 have no rights to the income and property of the Claimant, as these are to be applied solely towards the promotion of the objects of the Claimant: namely, to promote sustainable development within, and advance the general welfare of the people of, PNG (and in particular the Western Province thereof).31 The Respondent contends that it is undisputed that the assets held by the Claimant, including its shares in OTML, are to be used solely for the benefit of the people of PNG, and are not beneficially owned by the Claimant or its members.32\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant has no shareholders, but rather only members (Application, Para. 25).\n\nApplication, Para. 25.\n\nApplication, Para. 27. In this regard, the Respondent refers to the Request for Arbitration, Paras. 13 and 21-23.\n\n35.\n\nIn light of the above, the Respondent claims that PNGSDP cannot be a \"foreign investor\" with a \"private foreign investment,\" as the company exists to fulfil the sole public purpose of promoting sustainable development and advancing the general welfare of the PNG people.33\n\nApplication, Para. 27.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent also alleges that the Claimant is not a private investor with respect to the OTML shares, as these were simply gifted to the Claimant by BHP for a specified public purpose.34 The Respondent concludes that, as a result, there has been no \"private foreign investment\" to speak of, since the time BHP exited as a shareholder of OTML in 2001.35\n\nApplication, Para. 28.\n\nApplication, Para. 28.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the present dispute is one between PNG and, in substance and effect, its own nationals, and the ICSID Convention is not intended to apply to such disputes.36 The Respondent concludes that any contention by the Claimant that this dispute concerns a \"private foreign investment\" is manifestly without legal or factual merit, and as a consequence, the Tribunal should decline to find jurisdiction.37\n\nApplication, Para. 31.\n\nApplication, Para. 32.\n\n38.\n\nAs to consent, the Respondent notes that the Claimant in this proceeding relies upon provisions of the Respondent\u2019s domestic legislation as constituting the requisite written consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Specifically, the Claimant contends that section 39 of PNG\u2019s *Investment Promotion Act 1992* (\"IPA\"), either on its own or when read in conjunction with section 2 of PNG\u2019s *Investment Disputes Convention Act 1978* (\"IDCA\") (as amended by the *Investment Disputes Convention (Amendment) Act 1982),* constitutes a standing offer by PNG to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID.38 The Respondent submits that this reliance is flawed, and that there is a clear failure to satisfy the Article 25(1) jurisdictional requirements in this case.39\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Para. 67.\n\nApplication, Para. 58.\n\n39.\n\nSection 39 of the IPA provides as follows:\n\n*[The IDCA], implementing the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, applies, according to its terms, to disputes arising out of foreign investment.*\n\n40.\n\nSection 2 of the IDCA provides as follows:\n\n*A dispute shall not be referred to [ICSID] unless the dispute is fundamental to the investment itself.*\n\n41.\n\nBy reference to Principle 7 of the UN International Law Commission\u2019s 2006 Guiding Principles applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States capable of creating Legal Obligations (\"ILC Principle 7\"), the Respondent submits that consent to ICSID arbitration in \"clear and specific terms\" (as required by ILC Principle 7) is conspicuously absent in the two above-excerpted provisions.40\n\nApplication, Para. 40.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent refers to an alleged acknowledgement by the Claimant that neither the IDCA generally, nor section 2 of the IDCA specifically, constitutes consent by PNG *per* se.41 The Respondent argues that this asserted concession was rightly made,42 and raises, in summary, the following arguments as to why section 2 of the IDCA does not constitute written consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(a) The provision is framed in the negative and only precludes the option of arbitration for a certain class of disputes (namely, those which are not fundamental to the investment itself). It does not otherwise deny or grant an option to arbitrate other categories of disputes under ICSID;43\n\n(b) Section 2 merely reflects a notification filed by PNG on 14 September 1978 under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention to inform ICSID and other Contracting States that PNG wished to exclude certain types of disputes from ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.44 Pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention, any such notification shall not constitute the consent required by Article 25(1);45 and\n\n(c) Because the term \"disputes\" in section 2 is defined in the IDCA by reference to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,46 section 2 is subject to (rather than constitutes) the jurisdictional requirement of written consent set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.47\n\nApplication, Paras. 41 and 48, excerpting the Claimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal Secretary dated 8 November 2013.\n\nApplication, Para. 42.\n\nApplication, Para. 43.\n\nApplication, Para. 44.\n\nApplication, Para. 45.\n\nSection 1(1) of the IDCA provides as follows: \"\u2018dispute\u2019 means any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment as referred to in Article 25 of the [ICSID] Convention.\"\n\nApplication, Para. 47.\n\n43.\n\nAs section 2 of the IDCA does not provide for written consent (as allegedly conceded by the Claimant), the Respondent submits that it must follow that no consent resides in section 39 of the IPA because that provision simply refers to the IDCA and states that the IDCA implementing the ICSID Convention \"applies, according to its terms.\"48\n\nApplication, Para. 50.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s argument that section 39 of the IPA must function as a standing offer to ICSID arbitration because otherwise the provision could not be assigned any other useful purpose.49 Rather, the Respondent submits that it is commonly accepted that legislative provisions such as section 39 can serve useful purposes, including: (i) recalling and confirming the State\u2019s commitments under the ICSID Convention; or (ii) to clear the way for the State to conclude specific types of dispute resolution agreements without facing internal *ultra vires* issues, and thereby providing encouragement to investors.50\n\nApplication, Para. 51.\n\nApplication, Para. 51, and the authorities cited therein.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its interpretation of section 39 of the IPA is confirmed by context. In particular, the Respondent refers to two bilateral investment treaties entered into by PNG prior to and around the same time as the 1992 IPA was enacted (respectively, the UK-PNG BIT, signed on 14 May 1981 and entered into force on 22 December 1981, and the PNG-PRC BIT, signed on 12 April 1991 and entered into force on 12 February 1993), which contain clear and unequivocal consent to ICSID arbitration.51 The Respondent contends that, had the State intended to give unilateral consent to ICSID arbitration in section 39 of the IPA, it could have easily inserted into that Act the clear language of consent adopted in its BITs with other States.52 The Respondent posits that it is implausible that a country would consent to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction through treaties in clear and precise terms but, at the same time, seek to express consent to ICSID arbitration by way of an opaque and generalised reference in its national legislation.53\n\nApplication, Para. 52. The Respondent also refers to a more recent example of a BIT entered into by PNG which also provides unambiguous consent to ICSID arbitration (see Articles 16(4) and 16(5) of the Japan-PNG BIT, signed in April 2011: Application, Para. 53).\n\nApplication, Para. 55.\n\nApplication, Para. 55.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that incongruities would arise if the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of section 39 were preferred. The Respondent submits that, if the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of section 39 were accepted, then the State would effectively have extended an offer to arbitrate under ICSID to ineligible investors under the ICSID Convention: *i.e.* the definition of \"foreign investment\" and \"foreign investor\" under the IPA is not limited to investors who are nationals of ICSID Convention Contracting States.54 The Respondent submits that the State could not have intended this outcome.55\n\nApplication, Para. 56.\n\nApplication, Para. 56. The Respondent also notes that the five year limitation period in the Japan-PNG BIT would make no sense if the IPA operated in the manner proposed by the Claimant, as Japanese investors could easily circumvent that limitation period by relying upon the IPA (Application, Para. 56).\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"56 As described in the *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention,* consent is \"the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre,\" and the Respondent concludes that there is an obvious absence of that consent in the IPA and the IDCA.57 As such, the Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s claims should be dismissed in their entirety with costs.58\n\nApplication, Para. 54.\n\nApplication, Para. 58.\n\nApplication, Para. 58.\n\n2. Claims based on alleged MFN clause\n-------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimant\u2019s reliance upon the alleged \"most favoured nation\" clause in section 37(1) of the IPA is manifestly without legal merit.59\n\nApplication, Para. 66.\n\n49.\n\nSection 37(1) of the IPA provides as follows:\n\n*The provisions of this section shall apply to a foreign investor except where treatment**more favourable to the foreign investor is accorded under any bilateral or multilateral agreement to which the State is a party.*\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the wording of this provision is clear: a foreign investor will be entitled to the protections under the IPA, unless that investor is entitled to more favourable treatment under any other bilateral or multilateral agreement to which PNG is also party, in which case the more favourable treatment prevails over the rights under the IPA.60 In this way, the provision does not function as a typical MFN clause, which entitles a foreign investor to avail itself of more favourable treatment offered by the Respondent to investors of other States.61\n\nApplication, Paras. 61 and 68.\n\nApplication, Para. 61.\n\n51.\n\nIn light of the wording of section 37(1), the Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot rely upon the provision to import (for itself) rights which PNG has granted to investors of other States.62 Referencing ILC Principle 7, the Respondent notes that an MFN clause has to be clear and unequivocal as to the obligations that are created; by way of example and also by way of contrast with section 37(1), the Respondent refers to two MFN clauses agreed by PNG in its respective treaties with Germany and Australia.63 The Respondent submits that these clauses, unlike section 37(1), make clear that PNG has promised to give investors of the beneficiary state equal treatment as that enjoyed by any other state.64\n\nApplication, Para. 63.\n\nApplication, Paras. 63-64.\n\nApplication, Para. 64.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, as section 37(1) of the IPA is not an MFN clause, the Claimant is not entitled to the various \"more favourable\" protections which PNG has provided to investors of other States.65 Rather, if the IPA applies in this arbitration (which the Respondent denies), the Claimant is only entitled to those protections specifically enumerated in that statute at sections 37(2) to 37(5) thereof. As such, the Respondent submits that any relief sought by the Claimant that is not provided for under sections 37(2) to 37(5) of the IPA is manifestly without legal merit and should be dismissed or struck out.66\n\nApplication, Para. 67.\n\nApplication, Para. 71.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent requests the following relief from the Tribunal in its Application:67\n\n*(a) Dismiss all of the Claimant\u2019s claims in the [Request for Arbitration] on the basis that they are \"manifestly without legal merit\", as the mandatory jurisdictional requirements in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are not met; and/or*\n\n*(b) Dismiss or strike out paragraphs 73(ii) to 73(x) of the [Request for Arbitration] and the relevant paragraphs of the [Request for Arbitration] that refer to such reliefs as set out in Annex 1, on the basis that these reliefs are \"manifestly without legal merit\", as section 37(1) of the [IPA] (even if applicable, which is denied) is not a MFN Clause and the reliefs fall outside section 37(2) to 37(5) of the [IPA];*\n\n*(c) Order costs in favour of the State; and*\n\n*(d) Order such other and further relief as may be deemed just and appropriate in the circumstances.*\n\nApplication, Para. 72; Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 38.\n\n***B. The Claimant\u2019s Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Application***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s Application must fail for reasons of form (lack of clarity) and substance (failure to demonstrate that any part of the Claimant\u2019s case is \"manifestly without legal merit\").68 The Claimant contends that the Application represents a misuse of the Rule 41(5) procedure.69\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 3.\n\n55.\n\nIn providing its summary of the relevant standard to be applied under Rule 41(5), the Claimant notes that a successful objection under this Rule must show that the relevant claim is \"manifestly without legal merit,\" which is a high standard.70 The Claimant submits that the phrase \"legal merit\" dictates that only the law (and not disputed facts) can be considered at this early stage of the proceeding71 Further, the Claimant notes that the Rule requires that an objection \"shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection,\" and submits that objections which are expressed with insufficient precision should fail for lack of clarity.72\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 9.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that each of the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is satisfied in this case, and that Article 37(1) of the IPA is an MFN clause. That said, the Claimant preliminarily notes that all it must show in order to defeat the Application is that the Respondent is unable to establish, with relative ease and despatch, that the Claimant\u2019s case on jurisdiction is manifestly without legal merit.73\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 11.\n\n1. \"Private Foreign Investment\"\n-------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nFirst, the Claimant observes that the Respondent\u2019s objection on this question requires a factual enquiry, which is outside the scope of Rule 41(5)74 In any event, the Claimant submits that the objection lacks the clarity required under Rule 41(5)75\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 13. The Claimant also notes that the Respondent\u2019s Application only specifically addresses one of the Claimant\u2019s alleged investments, namely the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML. To the extent that the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s other alleged investments \"stem from\" those shares, the Claimant contends that this would not be sufficient for the purposes of a Rule 41(5) objection with respect to those investments (Claimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 14).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 15.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is an investor under both the IPA and the ICSID Convention: with respect to the former, it holds the necessary certification under Part IV of the IPA, and with respect to the latter, the Claimant is a Singapore-incorporated company (Singapore being a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention) and is therefore a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention.76\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 17.\n\n59.\n\nAs to whether there is a \"private foreign investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant notes that this is a highly contested issue and should be fully argued, rather than decided in an expedited Rule 41(5) procedure.77 The Claimant contends that the State\u2019s argument is a factual one which should not be determined summarily at this stage, because the Respondent\u2019s submissions regarding the transactions which underpin the Claimant\u2019s alleged investments and the origin of the investment capital (to the extent the latter is relevant, which the Claimant denies) will require evidence and a closer analysis than the Rule 41(5) procedure can afford78 In any event, the Claimant maintains that its alleged investments are foreign in character.79\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 22. The Claimant notes that there is no requirement under the ICSID Convention that the investment be private.\n\n60.\n\nBeyond the alleged inappropriateness of the enquiry at this stage, the Claimant submits that it has covered investments under the commonly used \"two-step test,\" namely under both section 3 of the IPA and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.80 The Claimant contends that the only question with respect to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for the purpose of Rule 41(5) is whether any of the relevant investments are \"pure commercial transactions\":81 the Claimant submits that they clearly are not, and contends that the Respondent has not suggested otherwise.82\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Paras. 21, 22 and 24.\n\nThe Claimant in this respect relies upon *Global Trading Resource Corp v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11), Award, 1 December 2010, which is the only instance to date where a Rule 41(5) objection based upon the meaning of the term \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention has been successful. There, according to the Claimant, the tribunal found that the short-term poultry sales contracts under consideration were \"pure commercial transactions\" and, as a result, were outside the scope of the ICSID Convention (Claimant\u2019s Observations, Paras. 21 and 23).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Paras. 21 and 23.\n\n2. Consent\n----------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s consent objection requires a factual enquiry, which is outside the scope of Rule 41(5).83 The Claimant also contends that the Respondent\u2019s objection does not establish that the Claimant\u2019s case on consent is manifestly without legal merit.84\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 27. The Claimant submits that this Tribunal, in considering whether the Rule 41(5) test is met, is not prohibited from taking into account the fact of registration of the Request for Arbitration by the Secretary-General of ICSID. In this connection the Claimant notes that the standards are the same (\"manifest\") in both the registration and Rule 41(5) settings (Claimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 29).\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant addresses the Respondent\u2019s objections with respect to both the IDCA and the IPA. As to the IDCA, the Claimant submits that section 2 of that instrument is not the Article 25(4) notification itself, and as such some other purpose must be assigned to the provision.85 The Claimant contends that section 2 expresses a general condition or jurisdiction/admissibility requirement applicable to subsequent agreements to arbitrate entered into by the State, and that the permissive wording of the title of the section (\"Classes of disputes which may be referred to the jurisdiction of the Centre\") is supportive of the Claimant\u2019s case on consent.86\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 30.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 30.\n\n63.\n\nTurning to the IPA, the Claimant argues that ILC Principle 7 should be approached with caution: the ILC Principles offer guidance, rather than a prescriptive reflection of customary international law.87 The Claimant submits that the principles are primarily concerned with diplomatic acts performed by States (as opposed to the interpretation of foreign investment laws), and that the Tribunal should rather take guidance from ICSID cases.88\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\n64.\n\nIn considering ICSID cases, the Claimant contends that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional decision in *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt89 (\u201fSPP* decision\") has not been challenged, but rather followed, by other ICSID tribunals, and notes the tribunal\u2019s statement in that case that \"jurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith.\"90 The Claimant submits that the purpose of section 39 cannot be to recall and confirm the State\u2019s commitments under the ICSID Convention, as this was achieved by the prior enactment of the IDCA.91\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 April 1988.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31 (quoting Para. 63 of the *SPP* decision).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\n65.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent compares the terms of section 39 with the language of other BITs entered into by PNG, the Claimant submits that no firm interpretive conclusion can be drawn from the dates on which PNG entered into other BITs, as some were entered into before the IPA was enacted and others were entered into after.92 In any event, the Claimant submits that the language of section 39 is not \"opaque or generalised\" in comparison with the language used by PNG in its treaties (as contended by the Respondent): the language of section 39 is short, clear and simple, and provides that the IDCA, implementing the ICSID Convention, applies, according to its terms, to foreign investment disputes.93\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant also addresses the Respondent\u2019s argument that, under the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of section 39, PNG would effectively have extended an offer to ICSID arbitration even to investors who are not nationals of ICSID Contracting States. The Claimant submits that this argument is devoid of legal merit, as section 39 provides that the ICSID Convention \"applies, according to its terms,\" which includes the requirement in Article 25(1) that the dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.94\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s reliance upon the Japan-PNG BIT is also misplaced, as an investor covered by the IPA and the Japan-PNG BIT may simply elect which instrument to use to make a claim.95\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 31.\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the key interpretive task for the Tribunal is to determine the meaning and legal effect of the phrase \"applies, according to its terms\" in section 39.96 On this issue, the Claimant notes that statements on the PNG Investment Promotion Authority\u2019s website (the agency responsible for administering the IPA and for promoting PNG as a destination for foreign investors) are lacking in any reference to the need for a subsequent arbitration agreement with the State.97 In reliance upon the *SPP* decision, the Claimant submits that these statements can be taken into account as evidence of the legislative intent behind the unilateral declaration in section 39.98\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Paras. 33-35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 33.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant also notes that all \"Investment Guarantees\" in Part V of the IPA (of which section 39 is one) are extended and effective as soon as the investor receives the requisite certificate under Part IV of the same Act.99 As the Claimant has such a certificate, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to all the benefits and protections it entails, including recourse to ICSID arbitration, without any further formalities.100 Further, to the extent that the IPA is ambiguous (which the Claimant denies), the Claimant observes that it should be construed in a manner that aids rather than impedes its effective operation as a declaration of consent to ICSID arbitration.101\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 37. The Claimant also submits that, as the State drafted the provision in question, doubts over its meaning should be resolved *contra proferentem* against the State and in favour of the Claimant (Claimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 39).\n\n70.\n\nFinally, the Claimant posits that the principle of *effet utile* can be applied in this case and, in reliance upon this principle (and ICSID authority102), submits that the purpose of the IPA *(inter alia,* to \"promote and facilitate investment in [PNG] by citizens and foreign investors\") should be applied in favour of the protection of covered investments where there is uncertainty in the IPA\u2019s interpretation.103\n\nNamely, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004 *(\"SGS v. Philippines'\"),* Para. 116.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 38.\n\n3. MFN clause\n-------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the Respondent had to effectively re-write section 37(1) of the IPA in order to make its objection with respect to that provision.104 According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s argument replaces the term \"the foreign investor\" in section 37(1) with the term \"that foreign investor.\"105 The Claimant submits that this distorts the language of the Act, as \"the foreign investor\" in the context of section 37(1) refers to the foreign investor (as a class) under a more favourable treaty instrument, rather than the foreign investor under the IPA.106 In this sense, the Claimant contends that the provision provides that the investment guarantees given by the Respondent in the IPA apply to a foreign investor (here, PNGSDP) unless standards of treatment more favourable to the foreign investor are available under any BIT to which the Respondent is a party.107\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 42.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 46.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 48.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue a decision under Rule 41(5):\n\n(a) dismissing the Application in full; and\n\n(b) ordering the Respondent to pay the legal costs incurred by the Claimant in relation to the Application.108\n\nClaimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 49.\n\n***C. The Respondent\u2019s Reply to the Claimant\u2019s Observations***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nIn reply, the Respondent claims that the Claimant, in its written submission, offers no credible answers to the Respondent\u2019s various Rule 41(5) objections.109 The Respondent suggests that the Claimant\u2019s Observations both mischaracterise matters and strain legal principles.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 2. With respect to legal principles, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the legal standards are the same under both Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention relating to registration and Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. It notes that the Secretary-General\u2019s decision to register the Request for Arbitration under Article 36(3) does not in any way bind this Tribunal in its consideration of the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Application (Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 2, fn 3, and the authorities cited therein).\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimant\u2019s submission that the State\u2019s Rule 41(5) objections require a factual enquiry.111 The Respondent notes that there are no factual disputes for the purposes of the present application, as the only facts it relies upon are undisputed facts contained in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration.112\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Paras. 4 and 5.\n\n1. Consent\n----------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument with respect to written consent can be summarised briefly: as the Claimant has allegedly conceded that no consent resides in section 2 of the IDCA, and as section 39 of the IPA simply refers back to the IDCA, it follows that section 39 of the IPA does not constitute \"consent in writing\" for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.113\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Paras. 6 and 12.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimant has not sought to retract its asserted concession with respect to the IDCA (namely, that neither the IDCA generally nor section 2 specifically constitutes consent of the State *per se)114* To the extent that the Claimant has relied upon the \"permissive\" heading of section 2 of the IDCA, the Respondent notes that PNG statutory interpretation law provides that section headings do not form a part of the relevant statutory provision.115 As such, the Respondent submits that the heading could not override the clear and express wording of the provision itself, which precludes the option of arbitration for a class of disputes (i.e., disputes that are not fundamental to the investment itself) and makes no pronouncement on the availability of arbitration for other classes of disputes.116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 10, referring to section 26(3) of the PNG *Interpretation Act* (Cap 2, 1975).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 10.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent expresses some confusion with respect to the Claimant\u2019s argument regarding the distinction between section 2 of the IDCA and the actual Article 25(4) notification made by the State to ICSID in 1978.117 The Respondent submits that, as the 1978 notification was incapable of constituting the consent required by Article 25(1), *a fortiori* a domestic statute reflecting that notification must be similarly incapable.118\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 11.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent posits that the Claimant\u2019s arguments are also flawed with respect to section 39 of the IPA.119 It distinguishes the *SPP* decision on the basis that the Egyptian investment law under consideration in that case included mandatory language with respect to the submission of disputes to ICSID *(i.e.* disputes \"shall be settled... within the framework of the [ICSID Convention]\"), whereas such language is absent from section 39 of the IPA.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 14.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent distinguishes the promotional material referred to in the *SPP* decision from the statements on the IPA website, and notes that those statements cannot fulfil the legal requirement of \"consent in writing\" under the ICSID Convention: these statements cannot create rights, and cannot alter the terms of the IPA.121 Further, in oral submissions at the hearing in Singapore on 10 October 2014 the Respondent contended that the *SPP* decision is not reconcilable with the line of ICSID cases which have considered Venezuela\u2019s investment law, and as such the *SPP* decision is \"simply wrong.\"122\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Paras. 16-17. The Respondent also notes that the tribunal in the *SPP* decision only relied upon promotional literature to the extent that it \"merely confirm[ed]\" the conclusion already reached by the tribunal. The Respondent submits that the IPA website statements do no such \u2018confirming\u2019 in this case, as no consent can be located in either the IDCA or the IPA (Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 19).\n\nDT.64-67.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the principle of *effet utile* and the *contra proferentem* rule do not apply in this case: the former does not apply to unilateral declarations made by States,123 and the latter is a principle relating to the interpretation of contracts, not of national legislation.124 The Respondent also contends that, notwithstanding the Claimant\u2019s argument otherwise, the generally accepted view is that the ILC Principles (including ILC Principle 7) are applicable to domestic legislation.125\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 21, citing authority in support at fn 25. The Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s reliance upon *SGS v. Philippines* in this respect is irrelevant (see Claimant\u2019s Observations, Para. 38) because that case concerned a bilateral investment treaty, not a State\u2019s unilateral declaration (Respondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 21).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Paras. 22-24.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 26.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, the Respondent criticises the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of section 39 in the context of the IPA.126 The Respondent submits that the conferment of benefits flowing from the grant of a certificate under Part IV of the IPA cannot *ipso facto* give rise to the requisite \"consent in writing\" where none in fact exists in section 39 of the same Act.127\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Paras. 27-28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 28.\n\n2. \"Private Foreign Investment\"\n-------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent observes that, given the objects of the Claimant (namely, to promote sustainable development within PNG and to advance the general welfare of the PNG people) and the fact that it is obliged to use its assets solely for those objects, it is not the archetypal \"private investor\" contemplated under the ICSID Convention.128 To the extent that the Claimant alleges that there is no requirement that an investment be \"private,\" and that the expression \"private foreign investment\" is not used in the ICSID Convention, the Respondent notes that the Preamble to the Convention refers to \"private international investment.\"129\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 32.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its position that, as the Claimant was gifted the OTML shares, there has been no \"private foreign investor\" to speak of since BHP\u2019s exit in 2001 (the Respondent\u2019s argument is that the Claimant has no standing under the ICSID Convention because it has not contributed to a flow of capital into the economy of PNG).130 The Respondent also notes that none of the contracts executed in connection with the transfer of shares from BHP to the Claimant included ICSID dispute resolution clauses.131\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 33\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 36.\n\n3. MFN clause\n-------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent observes that it does violence to the plain wording of section 37(1) of the IPA to contend (as the Claimant does) that the reference to \"the foreign investor\" in that provision refers to someone other than \"a foreign investor\" referred to in the preceding line of the same section; in this respect, the Respondent submits that the reference to \"the foreign investor\" could not refer to comparators from a third State.132\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Observations, Para. 37.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S REASONS**\n------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal first addresses the scope of the provision in Rule 41(5) and the relevant standard to be applied, before considering the Respondent\u2019s objections.\n\n***A. Rule 41 (5): Scope and Standard***\n----------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides as follows:\n\n*Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.*\n\n87.\n\nPrevious ICSID tribunals have considered Rule 41(5)\u2019s expedited procedure and commented upon the standard to be applied under the provision, namely, \"manifestly without legal merit.\" Like the Parties in this arbitration, the Tribunal regards these interpretations by prior ICSID tribunals as highly relevant and material to its consideration of the Application.133\n\nBoth the Claimant and the Respondent have relied upon previous decisions of ICSID tribunals, including *Trans-Global Petroleum Inc. v. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25), The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008, **Exhibit RL-7** *(\"Trans-Global\"),* *Global Trading Resource Corp. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11), Award, 1 December 2010, **Exhibit CA-7 (\u201f***Global Trading\"),* *Brandes Investment Partners, LR v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 2 February 2009, **Exhibit RL-2 (\"***Brandes Investment\").* The Tribunal refers to these decisions where relevant below.\n\n88.\n\nSeveral ICSID tribunals have found that \"manifest,\" as used in Rule 41(5), is equivalent to \"obvious\" or \"clearly revealed to the eye, mind or judgment.\"134 Under Rule 41(5), the respondent must establish its objection \"clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch.\"135 The Rule is intended to capture cases which are clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious,136 and as such, the standard that a respondent must meet under Rule 41(5) is very demanding and rigorous.137 In the opinion of the Tribunal, a case is not clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious if the Claimant has a tenable arguable case.\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 83; *Global Trading,* Para. 35.\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 88; *Brandes Investment,* Para. 63; *Global Trading,* Para. 35.\n\n*Brandes Investment,* Para. 62.\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 88; *Brandes Investment,* Para. 63; *Global Trading,* Para. 35.\n\n89.\n\nRule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts.\n\n90.\n\nIn considering the scope of a Rule 41(5) objection *(i.e.,* the scope of the phrase \"without legal merit\"), ICSID tribunals have found that objections should be based on legal impediments to claims, rather than factual ones.138 Given the preliminary nature of the proceeding, a tribunal considering a Rule 41(5) application may not be in a position to decide upon disputed facts.139\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 97.\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 97.\n\n91.\n\nFurther, as the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) objections concern both matters of jurisdiction and merits, the Tribunal notes that it agrees with the decisions of other tribunals to the effect that Rule 41(5) allows for objections related both to jurisdiction and the merits of the case.140 Nonetheless, the very demanding standard of proof outlined above applies no less to jurisdictional than other matters.\n\n*Brandes Investment,* Para. 55; *Global Trading,* Para. 30. This is not disputed by the Claimant in this case.\n\n***B. The Respondent\u2019s Objections***\n------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions on the Application, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in respect of its three objections under Rule 41(5) - i.e. that of *\"manifest\"* lack of legal merit. As such, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent\u2019s Application should be dismissed.\n\n93.\n\nAs outlined above, the Respondent\u2019s objections concern, *inter alia,* the interpretation of both PNG\u2019s domestic legislation and the ICSID Convention. Again as outlined above, the Respondent\u2019s objections also call for a factual analysis of the character of the Claimant itself and the circumstances behind its economic activity in PNG. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, none of these matters is appropriate for resolution under Rule 41(5).\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the factual circumstances of this case are relatively unusual, and that the Respondent\u2019s objections raise novel issues of law. Consistent with this, at the hearing conducted on 10 October 2014, the Respondent referred to the \"unique\" nature of both this case and the Claimant itself.141 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would in principle be inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties\u2019 opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal\u2019s opportunity to reflect. That is particularly true where those issues are disputed and potentially complex.\n\nDT.45.2-5, DT.64.6-7, DT. 130.5-9, and DT. 135-136.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the interpretation of the IPA and IDCA is central to the Respondent\u2019s objections with respect to written consent and the alleged MFN clause in the IPA. The Tribunal considers that these interpretations cannot be satisfactorily made in the context of a Rule 41(5) application, which necessarily involves an expedited and summary procedure. The Tribunal notes that there are disputed questions regarding which system (or systems) of law should apply to the interpretation of the IPA and IDCA (in particular, international or domestic rules of interpretation),142 and in addition, which specific interpretive principles should apply *(e.g,* the *effet utile* principle and the rule of *contra proferentem).* Further, the Tribunal notes that the IPA and the IDCA have not yet been the subject of interpretation by an ICSID tribunal, and it will therefore be required to decide issues of first impression. Doing so in a summary Rule 41(5) procedure would be inappropriate.\n\nDT.52-53; DT.103-106. In the event that domestic PNG laws may apply to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the IPA and IDCA, the Tribunal notes that (at this stage) it would be undertaking an intepretive process in a summary fashion without the benefit of secondary legislative materials, such as second reading speeches or explanatory memoranda (see DT. 16-17). Such materials may shed light upon the intended purpose of the sections in issue.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in the context of interpreting section 39 of the IPA, the Respondent has submitted that the *SPP* decision was wrongly decided.143 Insofar as the *SPP* decision is relevant to the interpretive task of the Tribunal in this arbitration (and the Tribunal has not formed any view on this point), this is an issue that must be addressed by the Parties, and considered by the Tribunal, outside of a summary procedure.\n\nDT.64-67.\n\n97.\n\nFinally, the Respondent\u2019s objection with respect to \"private foreign investment\" cannot be satisfactorily dealt with at this stage of the proceeding. The Respondent\u2019s objection does not appear to be based upon an explicit jurisdictional criterion set out in either the ICSID Convention or the relevant PNG legislation. Rather, the Respondent\u2019s objection appears to be based on the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the ICSID Convention\u2019s jurisdictional requirements in light of materials extraneous to the terms of Article 25(1) (in particular, the Convention Preamble and the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States) and a distinction drawn by the Respondent between the Claimant and what the Respondent refers to as \"typical foreign investors\" considered in other ICSID Convention cases.144\n\nIn respect of distinguishing the Claimant from \"typical foreign investors\", see DT.43-44.\n\n98.\n\nAs such, the Respondent\u2019s objection is unsuited for a Rule 41(5) Application. It does not involve application of undisputed or indisputable legal rules, but rather involves novel issues of interpretation and analysis. The Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to undertake such analysis in the context of a Rule 41(5) procedure.\n\n99.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that all of the arguments raised by the Respondent\u2019s objections involve disputed, and often complex, legal and factual issues which cannot properly be resolved within the expedited Rule 41(5) procedure. The Respondent\u2019s Application must therefore be dismissed.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. The Respondent\u2019s Application of 16 July 2014 is rejected;\n\n2. All questions as to the costs of the Respondent\u2019s Application are reserved;\n\n3. The further procedure for this arbitration will be according to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 and the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 11 September 2014."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2015-01-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Mr Nish Shetty, Mr Paul Sandosham, Ms Joan Lim, Mr Matthew Brown and Ms Yvette Anthony of Clifford Chance Pte. Ltd., Mr Audley Sheppard of Clifford Chance LLP, and Dr Romesh Weeramantry and Dr Sam Luttrell of Clifford Chance.1\n\nProfessor James Crawford also appeared as the Claimant\u2019s counsel at the Hearing on Jurisdiction held in Singapore on 29-30 November 2014.\n\n*B.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 October 2013, the Claimant filed a request for arbitration dated 10 October 2013 against the Respondent (the \"Request for Arbitration\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration, as supplemented by the Claimant\u2019s letters of 8 November, 22 November, and 10 December 2013, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the method of constituting the arbitral tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nIn the result, the Tribunal was composed of Mr Gary Born, a national of the United States of the America, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Dr Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, appointed by the Claimant; and the Honourable Justice Duncan Kerr, Chev LH, a national of Australia, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr Monty Taylor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 July 2014, the Claimant submitted its Request for Provisional Measures, together with: (a) a witness statement of Sir Mekere Morauta dated 14 July 2014; and (b) accompanying factual and legal exhibits. By letter dated 16 July 2014, the Respondent provided some comments on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures. The Claimant replied by letter dated 18 July 2014.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by telephone conference-call on 25 July 2014. The Tribunal subsequently issued its Procedural Order No. 1 on 7 August 2014.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1, on 1 August 2014 the Respondent filed its Observations on Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures (\"Respondent\u2019s Observations\") together with a witness statement of Mr Daniel Rolpagarea dated 1 August 2014 and accompanying factual exhibits and legal materials.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 August 2014, the Claimant requested a one-day extension to file its Reply Observations on Provisional Measures (\"Claimant\u2019s Reply\"), which were due to be filed that day under the terms of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1. This request was granted by the Tribunal on 12 August 2014.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural timetable, the Claimant\u2019s Reply was filed on 13 August 2014, together with an unsigned witness statement of Sir Mekere Morauta and accompanying factual and legal exhibits. The Claimant subsequently filed a signed version of Sir Mekere Morauta\u2019s witness statement on 14 August 2014.\n\n14.\n\nBy emails dated 28 August and 1 September 2014, the Claimant and the Respondent respectively confirmed their agreement to have the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures determined on the papers without oral argument.\n\n15.\n\nA hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules dated 16 July 2014 took place at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore on 10 October 2014. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on those objections was issued to the Parties on 28 October 2014.\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal providing additional information (and accompanying documentation) in support of the Request for Provisional Measures. The Respondent responded to the Claimant\u2019s letter on 24 October 2014.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant sent a further letter in support of the Request for Provisional Measures on 6 November 2014, together with accompanying documentation. The Respondent replied to this letter on 27 November 2014.\n\n18.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held in Singapore on 29-30 November 2014.\n\n19.\n\nOn 23 December 2014, the Claimant sent an additional letter to the Tribunal concerning the Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s letter by no later than 30 December 2014.\n\n21.\n\nOn 29 December 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request an extension for filing its response to the Claimant\u2019s 23 December letter in the week of 5 January 2015.\n\n22.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s extension request.\n\n23.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Respondent sent its response to the Claimant\u2019s 23 December letter.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 January 2015, the Claimant sent an unsolicited letter in response to the Respondent\u2019s 9 January letter. On 20 January 2015, the Respondent sent an unsolicited response to the Claimant\u2019s 14 January letter.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n25.\n\nFor the purposes of this Decision on Provisional Measures, and for that limited purpose only, the Tribunal briefly summarises the facts as alleged in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Request for Provisional Measures. The following summary of alleged facts does not constitute a finding by the Tribunal (either provisional or final) on any facts disputed by the Parties, and does not pre-judge any issues in dispute in this case.\n\n26.\n\nThis proceeding concerns the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in an open pit copper and gold mine in the Star Mountains of the Western Province of PNG (the \"Ok Tedi mine\"). As set out in the Request for Arbitration, PNGSDP owns a majority shareholding *(i.e.,* 63.4146%) in Ok Tedi Mining Ltd (\"OTML\"), a PNG-incorporated company.2 OTML\u2019s rights to mine Ok Tedi are set out in Special Mining Lease No. I.3 The Special Mining Lease No. 1 is the primary asset of OTML.4\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 16.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 25.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 25.\n\n27.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration provides details on the history of the Ok Tedi mine and on how the Claimant was incorporated and came to own its shares in OTML.5 These facts are summarised below, to the extent relevant for this Decision on Provisional Measures.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at paras. 9-15.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant was incorporated in Singapore on 20 October 2001.6 It is a company limited by guarantee (as distinguished from share capital) and governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association (the \"Memorandum and Articles of Association\" or \"M&A\").7 The M&A annex a set of Program Rules (the \"Program Rules\") which primarily deal with how earnings are to be applied for the purposes of fund management, transparency and accountability.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\n29.\n\nIn 2001, BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd (\"BHP,\" a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Ltd), the former shareholder and operator of OTML, transferred all of its ordinary shares in OTML to the Claimant.9 This transfer was intended to entrust an independent, foreign-registered company with the management of the development of the Ok Tedi mine (through OTML), and for that company to use the mine\u2019s earnings to promote sustainable development within PNG and advance the general welfare of the people of PNG, particularly those of the Western Province where the Ok Tedi mine is located.10 In connection with the transfer, a charge was created over the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML, by way of a Security Deed dated 7 February 2002 and a Security Trust Deed dated 7 February 2002, and a mortgage was created over the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML, by way of an Equitable Mortgage of Shares dated 7 February 2002.11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 14.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at paras. 13-14.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 14.\n\n30.\n\nFollowing a selective share buyback conducted in January 2011, the Claimant and the Respondent have respectively held 63.4146% and 36.5853% of issued ordinary shares in OTML.12 According to the Claimant, the Claimant carries significant risk as a shareholder in OTML due to, *inter alia,* its undertaking to take over BHP\u2019s liabilities in respect of the mining activities (and its broader obligations as a shareholder), and indemnities that the Claimant granted in respect of environmental claims and claims arising out of BHP\u2019s stewardship of OTML.13\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 15.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 19.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that, since its incorporation in 2001, it has financed and overseen at least USD 500 million dollars worth of development and environmental projects.14 It has financed these projects, and carried out the functions for which it was established, by taking its annual dividends from OTML and (in accordance with the Program Rules) putting them into low-risk investments in international markets to establish two funds: a short-term fund and a long-term fund.15\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 20.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 20.\n\n32.\n\nIn these proceedings, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent, through its instrumentalities and entities for which it is responsible, has mounted a concerted campaign against the Claimant and its investments, culminating in the cancellation of the Claimant\u2019s shares in OTML.16 In particular, on 19 September 2013, the Respondent enacted the Mining (Ok Tedi Tenth Supplemental Agreement) Act 2013 (the \"Tenth Supplemental Act\"), along with the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Continuation) (Ninth Supplemental Agreement) (Amendment) Act 2013.17 According to the Claimant, among other things, the Tenth Supplemental Act \"purported to *\u2018cancel\u2019* [the Claimant\u2019s] shares in OTML and reissue them to the State.\"18\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 24.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 4. *See also* Request for Arbitration, at para. 36.\n\n33.\n\nSection 4 of the Tenth Supplemental Act provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n*4. Shareholders of OTML*\n\n*(1) On the coming into operation of this Act -*\n\n*(a) all ordinary shares held by PNGSDP in the share capital of OTML shall be cancelled and cease to exist; and*\n\n*(b) 122,200,000 new, fully paid ordinary shares in the share capital of OTML free of any encumbrance, charge or equitable interest shall be issued to the State.19*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 36.\n\n34.\n\nSections 4(5) and 4(6) of the Tenth Supplemental Act also provide:\n\n*(5) All references to PNGSDP in the constitution of OTML and in the Fifth**Restated Shareholders Agreement shall, on and from the coming into operation of this Act, be read and construed as a reference to the State.*\n\n*(6) On and from the coming into operation of this Act, the Charge is void and of no legal effect and shall not create any interest of any nature whatsoever in any share of OTML.20*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 39. \"Charge\" is defined in the Tenth Supplemental Act to mean \"the Equitable Mortgage of Shares agreement between PNGSDP and Insinger Trust (Singapore) Limited dated 7 February 2002 as amended from time to time\" (Request for Arbitration, at para. 39 fn. 31).\n\n35.\n\nSection 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act provides:\n\n*Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act, the State has all necessary powers to restructure PNGSDP and its operations to ensure that PNGSDP applies its funds for the exclusive benefit of the people of the Western Province.21*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 40.\n\n36.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant claims that the enactment of the Tenth Supplemental Act amounts to a breach of applicable prohibitions against unlawful expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s property.22 The Claimant further claims that the conduct of the Respondent has amounted to violations of other guarantees and standards of treatment that must be accorded by the Respondent to foreign investors, including (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard; (ii) guarantee of free repatriation of returns on investments; (iii) specific undertakings given to the Claimant (i.e., the umbrella clause); (iv) the full protection and security standard; (v) the rule against arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable measures; (vi) national treatment guarantee; and (vii) the rule of free entry and sojourn of personnel.23\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 54.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 55.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the primary relief that it seeks in this arbitration is \"the reinstatement of its shares in OTML, so that it can continue to use its earnings from the Mine to perform the sustainable development and general welfare functions for which it was established.\"24 However, because \"there exists overwhelming evidence that the State is determined to destroy (or at least paralyse) PNGSDP and prevent it pursuing this claim,\" provisional measures \"are necessary to prevent the State from achieving these objectives.\"25\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 6.\n\n38.\n\nIn its Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant lists a series of actions purportedly taken by the Respondent against the Claimant or its property since the Request for Arbitration was filed. According to the Claimant, the Respondent has:\n\na. \"purported to exercise long-arm powers to terminate all members of the Claimant\u2019s Board of Directors (and appoint a \u2018Transitional Management Team\u2019 of its own choosing);\"26\n\nb. \"taken steps to seize certain of the Claimant\u2019s assets in Western Province and, through the direct actions of its Prime Minister, freeze the Claimant\u2019s bank accounts in PNG;\"27\n\nc. \"used its influence to deprive the Claimant of access to its accounts offshore;\"28\n\nd. \"threatened the Claimant\u2019s officers and employees with arrest and criminal prosecution;\"29 and\n\ne. \"deported the Claimant\u2019s Communications and Media Manager, Mr Mark Davis.\"30\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 7(a), 9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 7(b), 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 7(c), 8. In particular, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent \"instructed the [PNG Internal Revenue Commission] to deny the Claimant tax clearance,\" without which \"the Claimant will not be able to remit monies from its local account (which receives returns on its investments, such as repayments on loans) to its operations account in Hong Kong (which the State lias tried unsuccessfully to freeze).\" Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 7(d), 10. In this regard, the Claimant adds that \"on or around 12 May 2014, the State also announced its intention to set up a \u2018Commission of Inquiry\u2019 to investigate PNGSDP\u2019s asset sales, its company structure and the management of its finances.\" Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 7(e).\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges that there are local court proceedings pending in Singapore that were commenced at the time the constitution of the Tribunal was pending, and that relate to matters of Singapore company law.31 The developments before the Singapore courts are discussed below, to the extent relevant to this Decision.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 9.\n\n40.\n\nThe above facts are discussed in more detail in the Witness Statements of Sir Mekere Morauta32 and Mr Daniel Rolpagarea.33 The Tribunal does not detail these facts here, but discusses certain facts described in these Witness Statements where relevant in its Decision below.\n\n*See* 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at pp. 33-52. In its Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant states that \"Sir Mekere\u2019s Witness Statement provides further background to this dispute, a detailed account of the State\u2019s attacks on PNGSDP and an explanation of what is likely to happen if the provisional measures the Claimant seeks are not granted by the Tribunal\"; and \"details of the relevant facts and measures of the Respondent are set out in Sir Mekere\u2019s Witness Statement.\" Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 2, 26. *See also* 2nd Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at pp. 9-18.\n\n*See* 1st Daniel Rolpagarea WS, at pp. 25-59.\n\n**V. PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n*A. The Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn its Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant states that it \"urgently requires provisional measures to: (a) prevent the continuation of oppressive and unlawful conduct by [the Respondent]; (b) maintain the *status quo;* and (c) avoid further aggravation of this dispute pending its final determination by the Tribunal.\"34\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 1.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"there exists overwhelming evidence that the State is determined to destroy (or at least paralyse) [the Claimant] and prevent it pursuing this claim,\" and \"[p]rovisional measures are necessary to prevent the State from achieving those objectives.\"35 According to the Claimant, the Respondent has recently committed \"act[s] of aggravation,\" including:\n\na. the Respondent\u2019s \"attempts to freeze the Claimant\u2019s accounts;\"36\n\nb. the Respondent \"is *escalating* its attempts to starve the Claimant of the capital it needs to continue operating\" and has recently given instruction to the PNG Internal Revenue Commission to deny the Claimant tax clearance;37\n\nc. \"the Respondent\u2019s long-arm attempts to replace the management of PNGSDP are clearly acts of aggravation as they are exacerbating this dispute and making the just resolution of it significantly more difficult\" and they also \"pose a direct threat to the Claimant\u2019s ability to continue operating and to pursue its claims.\"38 The Claimant contends that it brought the proceedings in the High Court of Singapore \"to try to preserve its ability to manage itself in Singaproe in accordance with its Memorandum and Articles of Association, free from long-arm interference by the State;\"39 and\n\nd. \"there is strong reason to believe that the State directed persons for whom it is responsible to make threats of physical harm to officers, employees and agents of [the Claimant], or at the very least failed to prevent these persons from making such threats,\" which amount to \"acts of aggravation of the most serious kind.\"40\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 8.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 8 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 10.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it has asked the Respondent \"to maintain the *status quo* and not aggravate this dispute pending its resolution in accordance with the ICSID Convention;\" however, the Respondent has instead *\"accelerated* its campaign against [the Claimant] and its investments, taking an array of actions that can only be described as predatory.\"41\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 26 (emphasis in original).\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Tribunal\u2019s \"power to order provisional measures derives from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules,\" and that \"[i]t is generally accepted that these provisions grant wide discretion to the Tribunal.\"42 The Claimant states that, in order to prevail on an application for provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, \"the requesting party bears the burden of establishing that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction..., that there is a *prima facie* basis to its claim..., and that the requested measures are necessary,\" and that party \"must specify the \u2018rights to be preserved\u2019.\"43\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 13\n\n45.\n\nRegarding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimant states that \"when a request for provisional measures is made before jurisdiction is finally determined,\" the party requesting provisional measures \"does not need to establish jurisdiction in any definitive sense\" but must demonstrate that there is \"the *prima facie* existence of jurisdiction, or, to couch this in negative terms, the absence of a clear lack of jurisdiction.\"44\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 16 (citing *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 25 September 2001, 6 *ICSID Reports* (2004), pp. 373-397, at p. 379, **Exhibit CA-5).**\n\n46.\n\nRegarding the standard of harm that is applicable in this context, the Claimant notes that \"ICSID tribunals tend to require a showing of harm that is either \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018irreparable\u2019.\"45 The Claimant suggests that the harm would be \"irreparable\" where \"if it was allowed to materialise, [it would] be incapable of being cured through an award of money damages.\"46 According to the Claimant, irreparable harm would result where the actions in question, \"if not restrained by provisional measures, [would] effectively bring an end to the investor\u2019s business,\" even if \"the loss could (at least in theory) be measured in money.\"47\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25(a).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25(b).\n\n47.\n\nApplying the above test to this case, the Claimant argues that:\n\na. the Claimant\u2019s rights which \"fall for final adjudication in the merits of this case\"48 and which need to be preserved include:\n\ni. \"its right to operate its investments and deal with its assets (including its bank accounts wherever located) in accordance with the Program Rules;\"49\n\nii. \"its right to be treated and dealt with by PNG in accordance with the standards of treatment prescribed by the [PNG Investment Promotion Act 1992 (\"IPA\")] and the BITs to which the Respondent is a party;\"50\n\niii. \"the right of its officers, employees, servants and agents to enter and remain in the State for the purposes of engaging in activities connected with the Claimant\u2019s investments, and to be free from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, prosecution and harassment by the State and its agents;\"51 and\n\niv. \"the Claimant\u2019s procedural rights, including its rights to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute (which are recognised as \u2018self-standing rights\u2019) and the preservation of the effectiveness of a future award.\"52\n\nb. the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction, because:\n\ni. the fact of registration of the Request for Arbitration by ICSID can be taken \"as evidence that jurisdiction is not manifestly lacking in this case;\"53 according to the Claimant, the standard that it must satisfy for its Request for Provisional Measures \"is only fractionally (if at all) higher than the \u2018not manifestly lacking\u2019 standard applicable at the registration stage.\"54\n\nii. as set out in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration,55 the Claimant\u2019s position is that each of the jurisdictional requirements set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is satisfied in this case, including the requirements of \"Contracting State... and a National of another Contracting State,\" \"investment,\" \"legal dispute\" and consent in writing.56 With regard to the latter, the Claimant states that \"through its national law, the Respondent has made a standing offer to arbitrate at ICSID (an offer which was made in the form of an \u2018Investment Guarantee\u2019),\" and the Claimant accepted this offer by letter dated 26 September 2013.57\n\nc. there is a *prima facie* basis to the Claimant\u2019s claims, as set out in the Request for Arbitration;58 according to the Claimant, \"there is at the very least a good arguable case\" for each claim;59\n\nd. the provisional measures sought by the Claimant are \"necessary\" because the actions of the Respondent since the dispute was submitted to arbitration \"leave no doubt that it intends to do as much harm as possible\" to the Claimant, \"or even destroy the company, while it still can,\" and the Respondent\u2019s recent conduct \"shows that it is escalating its campaign against the Claimant and its officers.\"60 According to the Claimant, \"[t]here is therefore a serious danger in waiting until the final award to give the Claimant relief;\"61 and\n\ne. as to the standard of harm, \"either measure *[i.e.,* that the harm is \u2018substantial\u2019 or \u2018irreparable\u2019] is satisfied\" in this case.62 According to the Claimant, if the Tribunal were to prefer the \"irreparable harm\" test, it would be satisfied because:\n\ni. the State\u2019s conduct, as described in Sir Mekere Morauta\u2019s witness statement, \"is such that the physical safety and liberty of the Claimant\u2019s staff is at risk. Such harm would, if it was allowed to materialise, be incapable of being cured through an award of money damages;\"63\n\nii. the State\u2019s conduct \"threatens the very existence of the Claimant and the purposes for which it was established;\" \"where the actions in question would, if not restrained by provisional measures, effectively bring an end to the investor\u2019s business, then the harm feared may well be \u2018irreparable\u2019 notwithstanding the fact that the loss could (at least in theory) be measured in money.\"64\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 15.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 14(a).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 14(b).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 14(c).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 14(d) (citing *Burlington Resources Inc. and others* v. *Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, dated 29 June 2009, at para. 60, **Exhibit CA-4).**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 17.\n\nThe Claimant cites to paragraphs 60 to 69 of its Request for Arbitration. *See* Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 18.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at paras. 18-22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 22.\n\nThe Claimant cites to paragraphs 54-55 of its Request for Arbitration. *See* Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 24.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 24.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25(a) (citing 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at pp. 40-42).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 25(b).\n\n48.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal:\n\n*urgently recommend to the Respondent that, pending final determination of the dispute, the Respondent refrain from:*\n\n*(a) taking (or threatening to take) any further steps under Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, or otherwise interfering with or impeding the Claimant\u2019s lawful operation in PNG in accordance with the Program Rules;*\n\n*(b) harassing, arresting, or commencing any criminal prosecution against any officer, employee, servant or agent of the Claimant in connection with the performance of their responsibilities or functions as officers, employees, servants or agents of the Claimant (or making any further threats to do so); and*\n\n*(c) taking any further steps that may aggravate the dispute, disturb the* status quo *as at the date of this Request, or otherwise impede the orderly resolution of the dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.65*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 27.\n\n*B. The Respondent\u2019s Observations on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional**Measures*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s Observations, the Respondent seeks a dismissal of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures on the basis that it, \"apart from falling short of the threshold requirements,\" \"prays for intrusive interim measures that are unsupported by any showing of urgency, are entirely unnecessary and unrelated to the reliefs sought in the arbitration.\"66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 1.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimant\u2019s Provisional Measure 1 \"is sought in essentially the same terms as the final relief sought\" in paragraph 73(ii) of the Request for Arbitration,67 and that such request \"offends the principle that an arbitral tribunal cannot grant a decision on the merits under the guise of interim relief..., and is alone grounds for the Tribunal to deny\" this request.68 The Respondent adds that the declaration sought in paragraph 73(ii) of the Request for Arbitration \"is also one which the Tribunal does not even have jurisdiction to grant on a final basis... much less on an interim basis\" because, among other things, the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are absent.69\n\nIn paragraph 73 (ii) of the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant sought \"a declaration that Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act is void and of no legal effect on the Claimant, and an order permanently restraining the Respondent from taking any steps to \u2018restructure\u2019 the Claimant or influence its operations in any way other than in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Program Rules.\"\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 1(a) at fn. 1 (emphasis omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 1(a) at fn. 1 (emphasis omitted).\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the burden is on the Claimant to establish why the Tribunal should \"take the extraordinary step of granting\" provisional measures, by \"showing: (a) *prima facie* jurisdiction, (b) a *prima facie* basis to the reliefs sought in the arbitration, (c) urgency, and (d) necessity in order to avoid irreparable harm.\"70 The Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures is \"wholly without merit and must be denied,\"71 because the Request and Sir Mekere Morauta\u2019s witness statement filed in support thereof \"are thin on evidence, contradicted by recent events, and tellingly, do not (presumably because they cannot) address the question of \u2018urgency\u2019 at all.\"72\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 2 (emphasis and footnotes omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 2.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent discusses the Singapore Court proceedings at some length,73 and argues that, \"given the Claimant\u2019s failure (on non-jurisdictional grounds) to obtain the self-same provisional measures in the Singapore Courts, the Singapore Court\u2019s finding that those measures are not urgent/necessary... ought, in the absence of any changed circumstances (and there is none, as the Claimant itself recognises), to preclude the Claimant from seeking a further bite of the \u2018provisional apple\u2019.\"74\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at paras. 14-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 25 (citing Bom, *International Commercial Arbitration.* Kluwer (2nd ed., 2014), at pp. 3787-3790, **Exhibit RL-36).**\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Tribunal should dismiss the Request for Provisional Measures because: (1) \"the threshold requirements of *prima facie* jurisdiction and *prima facie* right to the reliefs sought are manifestly absent;\"75 and (2) \"the prevailing circumstances and preponderance of evidence show that the measures sought in the [Request for Provisional Measures] are neither urgent nor necessary.\"76\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 5.\n\n54.\n\nOn point (1), the Respondent argues that none of the threshold requirements has been established in this case.77\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 27.\n\n55.\n\nFirst, there is \"a manifest lack of jurisdiction, given the non-existence of a \u2018private foreign investment\u2019\" and \"the absence of the State\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration.\"78 The Respondent observes that the Claimant\u2019s reference to the fact of registration as \"evidence that jurisdiction is not manifestly lacking\" is \"misguided, as registration under Article 36(3) simply reflects the ICSID Secretariat\u2019s view that the dispute is not manifestly outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction, and cannot supplant the Tribunal\u2019s own view of its jurisdiction over the matter.\"79\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 28 (emphasis omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 28 (emphasis and footnote omitted).\n\n56.\n\nSecond, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant failed to establish a *prima facie* basis to its claims in the Request for Arbitration.80 The Respondent notes, in particular, that the Claimant is wrong that Section 37(1) of the IPA is a most-favoured nation (or MFN) clause.81\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 29.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 29.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Request for Provisional Measures \"must be dismissed outright\" for the above reasons.82\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 30.\n\n58.\n\nOn point (2), the Respondent states that \"[e]ven assuming that the threshold requirements are cleared, the same outcome would be reached as the substantive criterion [sic] of \u2018urgency\u2019 and \u2018necessity\u2019 have not been shown to exist.\"83\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 31.\n\n59.\n\nIn relation to ***urgency,*** the Respondent argues that \"[t]he timing of the filing of the [Request for Provisional Measures], its content (or lack of) and the prevailing circumstances suggest that there is simply no urgency for the Provisional Measures sought.\"84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 32.\n\n60.\n\nFirst, the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures \"is in fact silent on the question of \u2018urgency\u2019,\" which by definition means that this key requirement \"remains unsatisfied.\"85\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 33 (emphasis and footnote omitted).\n\n61.\n\nSecond, the Claimant is unable to explain the 9-month delay between its Request for Arbitration, in which the Claimant stated that it would \"shortly\" be filing a request for interim relief, and its Request for Provisional Measures; the Respondent submits that this delay calls for an explanation, as \"the bulk of the alleged \u2018predatory... acts and measures of [the State]\u2019 which purportedly triggered the [Request for Provisional Measures] took place in or around end-2013*(i.e.,* those grounds had existed by the time the [Request for Arbitration] was registered in December 2013).\"86 The Respondent points out that the Claimant\u2019s assertion that it \u2018\"was unable to put forward its request for Provisional Measures until the Tribunal was fully constituted on 17 June 2014\u2019... was clearly an afterthought,\" because the Claimant was well aware of the procedure under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5) allowing a party to submit a request for interim relief prior to the constitution of the Tribunal, as is apparent from the Claimant\u2019s statements in its Request for Arbitration.87\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 34 (citing 1st Daniel Rolpagarea WS, at para. 70) (emphasis in original). The Respondent points out that: (a) the appointment of the Transitional Management Team by the Respondent, removal of the Claimant\u2019s directors, and termination of Mr David Sode\u2019s appointment as the Claimant\u2019s Managing Director took place on 24 October 2013; (b) the Respondent\u2019s instructions \"to freeze the Claimant\u2019s bank accounts were given in October to November 2013;\" and (c) the \"alleged harassment and intimidation of Mr Lawrence Stephens and Mr Mark Davis similarly took place in October to November 2013.\" Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 35(a)-(c) (emphasis and footnotes omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 36 (citing the Claimant\u2019s 18 July 2014 letter and the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, at para. 75).\n\n62.\n\nThird, \"far from discharging the \u2018basic evidentiary requirement\u2019 that \u2018the complained-of act is actually in the works and likely to take place during the course of the arbitration\u2019,\"88 the Claimant relies on (a) past events, which \"obviously would not suffice for purposes of establishing \u2018urgency\u2019 at present;\"89 (b) bare allegations unsubstantiated by evidence;90 and (c) \"its own speculative fear that hostile actions may be taken against it\" wheareas interim measures \"are reserved for \u2018situations of real (and not imagined) harm\u2019 and are not meant to protect against \u2018potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions\u2019.\"91\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 37 (citing Mouawad & Silbert, \"A Guide to Interim Measures in Investor-State Arbitration\" (2013) 29(3) *Arbitration International* 381 at p. 388, **Exhibit RL-37)** (emphasis omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 37 (footnote omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 37 (citing the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, paras. 7-11) (emphasis omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 37 (citing, respectively, Mouawad & Silbert, \"A Guide to Interim Measures in Investor-State Arbitration\" (2013) 29(3) *Arbitration International* 381, at p. 388, **Exhibit RL-37,** and *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, at para. 89, **Exhibit RL-29)** (emphasis omitted).\n\n63.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Claimant\u2019s requested Provisional Measure 1, the Respondent notes that it was not mentioned among the intended provisional measures listed in the Claimant\u2019s 25 June 2014 letter to the Tribunal, and the \"conclusion that flows from this is that [the request for Provisional Measure 1] must have arisen from (any alleged) changed circumstances in the days between the Claimant\u2019s 25 June 2014 letter and the date of the filing of the Application (14 July 2014).\"92 Yet, the only post-25 June 2014 event relied upon by the Claimant - *i.e.,* the \"purported denial of tax clearance for the Claimant on the State\u2019s instruction in July 2014\" - \"is irrelevant\" because this allegation is unsubstantiated, and even if it were true, clearance would have been denied because the Claimant \"has failed to comply with the relevant tax laws (or there are grounds to suspect so).\"93 For the Respondent, if such a measure had ben taken in response to the Claimant\u2019s non-compliance with the taxation regime, \"that would have had nothing to do with the present dispute.\"94\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 38.\n\n64.\n\nIn relation to ***necessity,*** the Respondent argues that the criterion of \"necessity\" is also \"absent, given that the Claimant cannot even establish the substratum of facts/events which the [Claimant\u2019s requested] Provisional Measures are meant to address.\"95 The Respondent takes each requested provisional measure in turn.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 39.\n\n65.\n\nFirst, with respect to Provisional Measure 1, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant \"has not explained (much less proven)... how the State has been \u2018interfering with or impeding\u2019 the Claimant\u2019s operations in PNG.\"96 The Respondent states that:\n\na. the Claimant\u2019s \"operations and assets are (and remain) controlled by Sir Mekere and his allies (to the complete exclusion of the State, including the Transitional Management Team);\"97\n\nb. the Claimant \"has little or no presence in PNG\" as a result of its decision to cease its development programs/projects and shift its operations to Australia;98 and\n\nc. \"[g]iven that the Claimant\u2019s Board and its officers remain in complete control of the Claimant and its assets, the State is simply not in a position to affect the operations of the Claimant, whether in PNG or any other country.\"99 The Respondent expands on the facts which it says show that \"the State has no means to influence/hinder the Claimant\u2019s operations (or seize its assets)\" at paragraph 44 of its Observations.100\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 41 (emphasis omitted). According to the Respondent, this enabled Sir Mekere and his allies to (a) unilaterally and wrongfully amend the Claimant\u2019s M&A and wrongfully pass resolutions \"so as to dilute/exclude the State\u2019s oversight of the Claimant\u2019s operations and assets;\" (b) cease/tenninate the development projects/programs which the Claimant liad undertaken in PNG; and (c) \"dissipate its assets in breach of... the Program Rules.\" Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 41.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 42.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 43.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 44 (emphasis omitted). Among the relevant alleged facts, the Respondent notes the following: (a) the Claimant\u2019s use of its assets to finance the litigation in Singapore court; (b) the Transitional Management Team \"never took its position, and it is Sir Mekere (and his allies) who remain in complete control of the Claimant;\" and (c) the State has not succeeded in freezing the Claimant\u2019s assets in Bank South Pacific.\n\n66.\n\nSecond, with respect to Provisional Measure 2, the Respondent states that the Claimant\u2019s assertions that the Respondent \"had sought to threaten, intimidate and harass the Claimant\u2019s officers are similarly unsubstantiated and untrue.\"101 The Respondent argues that, even as at end-March 2014, the Claimant was unable to particularise the alleged incidents of harassment (including the alleged \"harassment\" of Mr Mark Davis and Mr Lawrence Stephens) despite the alleged incidents purportedly occurring in 2013.102 In any event, for the Respondent, the alleged harassment of these two individuals is \"more illusory than real.\"103 According to the Respondent, \"the deportation of Mr Davis arose from Mr Davis\u2019 breach of visa conditions,\" and no action was taken by the UK authorities regarding the alleged threat to Mr Stephens.104 The Respondent argues that it, as a sovereign, has a \"right and obligation to enforce its criminal laws within its own territory, and unless a \u2018strong linkage\u2019 can be shown (and there is none here) between the criminal proceedings and the investment dispute before the ICSID tribunal, which threatens to undermine the integrity of the arbitral process, the State\u2019s domestic criminal proceedings is a domain upon which the Tribunal should not infringe.\"105\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 45.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 46.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 47.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 47 (citing 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 143, Exhibit SMM-42, and 1st Daniel Rolpagarea WS, at paras. 74(a), (c)).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 48 (footnotes omitted).\n\n67.\n\nThird, in respect of Provisional Measure 3, the Respondent argues that this requested measure which relates to \"a \u2018self-standing right\u2019 to the preservation of the *status quo* ignores the weight of authority confirming that the rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party\u2019s claims for reliefs, *i.e.,* there is no \u2018self-standing right\u2019 to the protection of the *status quo* in general.\"106 The Respondent points out that, in any event, *the Respondent itself* also applied to the Singapore Courts for orders preserving the *status quo,107* and was successful in obtaining interim relief from the Singapore Courts \"enjoining the Claimant from affecting the *status quo* and aggravating the dispute.\"108 According to the Respondent, the Claimant should not be allowed to avail itself of Provisional Measure 3 under the principle that a tribunal \"will not issue an injunction where it is found that the petitioner does not have clean hands.\"109 The Respondent adds that it \"simply does not have the ability to disturb the *status quo* of the matter,\" and therefore there is no need for Provisional Measure 3.110\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 50 (emphasis and footnotes omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 52. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at paras. 14-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 51.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 51 (citing Yesilirmak, *Provisional Measures in International Commercial Arbitration,* Kluwer (2005), at para.

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention says nothing about urgency, which was not included in the text when the Convention was drafted, and the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other ICSID tribunals which \"have found that a requirement of \u2018urgency\u2019 is implied in the text of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention;\"131 rather, the Tribunal \"may... give natural priority to the requirement that the drafters did include: the requirement that the measures must be necessary;\"132\n\nc. even if the Respondent is right that there is an implied requirement of \"urgency\" in Article 47, the proper temporal question is \"can the applicant wait until a final award is rendered to receive the relief it seeks now?\" (and not how much time has passed before the Request for Provisional Measures).133 According to the Claimant, the answer to its articulated question is \"no\" in view of the \"undisputed facts\" including events shortly preceding the filing of its Request for Provisional Measures;134\n\nd. in response to the Respondent\u2019s assertions that the Singapore Court \"(allegedly) found that there was no urgency in the Claimant\u2019s application for an interlocutory injunction in that forum,\" and the scholarly opinion of the President of this Tribunal that \"a national court\u2019s finding on urgency should be followed by an arbitral tribunal absent \u2018changed circumstances\u2019,\"135 the Claimant notes that the circumstances have recently changed (for the worse) since the Singapore court\u2019s decision rejecting the Claimant\u2019s *ex parte* application for injunctive relief in October 2013;136\n\ne. in response to the Respondent\u2019s assertions that it is \"unable to intefere with the Claimant\u2019s operations in PNG,\" the Claimant contends that this suggestion is \"absurd,\" *inter alia,* because the Tenth Supplemental Act \"gives the State the (purportedly long-arm) power to \u2018restructure [the Claimant] and its operations\u2019, and the State has - at least within its own borders - already used that power to great effect,\" and has taken other measures that \"are doing real harm\" to the Claimant;137\n\nf. in response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that \"it has a sovereign right to enforce its own laws,\" the Claimant submits that this assertion \"misses the point,\" because the focus of the Claimant\u2019s application is on the Respondent\u2019s \"compliance with its *international* legal obligations;\"138 the Claimant\u2019s officers need to \"enter and exit PNG to prepare for this arbitration and manage the Claimant\u2019s investments and operations,\" and through the most-favoured nation provision of the IPA, they \"have a right to do so freely.\"139 The Claimant adds that there are \"at least 6 staff members of the Claimant [who] are still in PNG,\" including its CEO, Mr David Sode, who need protection;140\n\ng. in response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Commission of Inquiry has not yet been constituted and there is \"no reason for the Claimant to be concerned,\" the Claimant argues that ICSID tribunals have \"shown themselves willing to take steps necessary to protect the investor (and the arbitration process) from this kind of \u2018home town justice\u2019.\"141 In this respect, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in *City Oriente Ltd.* v. *Ecuador* held that threats by a host State to commence criminal proceedings against the claimant\u2019s officials justified the recommendation of provisional measures;142 and\n\nh. the Respondent\u2019s argument that the \"preservation of the *status quo* and nonaggravation of the dispute is not a \u2018free-standing\u2019 right which is worthy of protection via provisional measures\" \"flies in the face of international law and ICSID practice;\"143 they must be ensured for the effectiveness of this arbitration process.144\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 12 (emphasis omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 13 (emphasis omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at paras. 14, 15 (emphasis and footnote omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 15 (citing 2nd Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 17(b)).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 16 (citing Bom, *International Commercial Arbitration*, Kluwer (2nd ed., 2014), at p. 3787, **Exhibit RL-36)**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at paras. 16, 17.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 21 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 21.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 22 (citing Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, at para. 48(viii).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 23 (citing *City Oriente Limited* v. *The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 19 November 2007, at para. 69, **Exhibit CA-13).**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 24 (emphasis and footnotes omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 24.\n\n75.\n\nSecond, with regard to the ***Singapore court proceedings,*** the Claimant contends that:\n\na. The Singapore court proceedings \"relate to wholly different matters and are not duplicative;\"145 those proceedings concern \"domestic Singapore law matters relating to the corporate governance of the Claimant\" which this Tribunal could not decide upon, even if it were requested to do so.146 Under Singapore law, the Court \"has no jurisdiction to impose an injunction on another sovereign state,\" which is why the Claimant seeks this relief before this Tribunal.147 In any event, the Claimant \"is not seeking any injunctive relief against the State\" in the Singapore proceedings.148\n\nb. The Singapore Court\u2019s orders were \"simply holding orders, pending the conclusion of the hearing of the injunction application.\"149\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 26. The Claimant elaborates on this point, stating that the relief it seeks before the Singapore Court includes: (a) \"declarations that the State\u2019s purported removal of the Claimant\u2019s board of directors through legislation enacted in PNG has no effect under Singapore law, and that the duly-appointed members of the Claimant\u2019s board of directors continue to have full authority to manage the business of the Claimant in accordance with its M&A\" and (b) \"injunctions restraining the *individuals* (but not the State) who were purportedly appointed by the State as members of a \u2018Transitional Management Team\u2019 from attempting to interfere with the Claimant\u2019s operations.\" Claimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 27 (emphasis in original). *See also* Claimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 30 (elaborating upon why the Claimant maintains that the relief it sought in the Singapore Court is not duplicative of its requested provisional measures in this proceeding).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 28 (emphasis omitted).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 29 (citing section 15(2) of the Singapore State Immunity Act (Cap. 313), **Exhibit CL-21).**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 30(c).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 31 (emphasis omitted).\n\n76.\n\nThird, with respect to the ***threshold requirements of prima facie jurisdiction and prima facie case on the merits,*** the Claimant states that:\n\na. applying the ICSID Tribunal\u2019s standard articulated in *Pey Casado* v. *Chile,150* what must be demonstrated is \"the prima facie existence of jurisdiction, or, to couch this in negative terms, the absence of a clear lack of jurisdiction;\" this threshold \"is only fractionally (if at all) higher than the standard in the context of the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection\" and the Claimant\u2019s jurisdictional arguments in its Reply Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objections (filed on 8 August 2014 in this proceeding) are \"sufficient for both Rule 41(5) and provisional measures *(\u2018prima facie')* purposes;\"151\n\nb. the Claimant repeats its Reply Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) objections on the issue of the Claimant\u2019s *prima facie* right to the relief it seeks in this arbitration, and notes that: (i) the State does not dispute the Claimant\u2019s *prima facie* right to the reliefs it seeks with respect to expropriation; and (ii) the Claimant\u2019s position is that Section 37(1) of the IPA is an MFN clause, and even if it is wrong on the MFN clause, \"it is still entitled to the reliefs it seeks under either PNG law or international law (or both).\"152 The Claimant concludes that, \"even if the State is right that the Claimant is not entitled to MFN treatment, the Claimant still has a *prima facie* case for the relief it seeks from the Tribunal.\"153\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 25 September 2001, 6 *ICSID Reports* (2004), pp. 373-397, at p. 379, **Exhibit CA-5.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 34.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 36.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 37.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates its request that the Tribunal grant its Request for Provisional Measures because it \"needs and deserves protection.\"154\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 38.\n\n*D.

it is therefore surprising for the Claimant to suggest that these matters \"have only just come to its attention.\"167 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s purported concern about these stated developments is \"an afterthought, which deserves little (if any) weight in the Tribunal\u2019s deliberation on the Request [for Provisional Measures].\"168\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 6.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 7.\n\n82.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argued that these purported developments provide no support for the Request for Provisional Measures, because \"OTML\u2019s operations have always been carried out independently of the Claimant (who previously only nominated/appointed 1 out of the 4 directors on OTML\u2019s Board), and the Claimant is, in any event, no longer involved in OTML.\"169 The Respondent contends that the Claimant \"is seeking a general order \u2018for maintaining the status quo\u2019 to curtail the OTML Board\u2019s ability to make operational decisions in the ordinary course of business... and bring OTML operations to a standstill.\"170 The Respondent contends that there is no basis for such a \"drastic order, bearing in mind that OTML is not even a party to these proceedings, and that the \u2018extraordinary\u2019 step of imposing provisional measures is not, even in the ordinary case, one to be lightly taken.\"171 The Respondent reiterated its request that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, with costs.172\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 8.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 8.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 8 (emphasis in original).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 24 October 2014, at para. 9.\n\n83.\n\nOn 6 November 2014, the Claimant replied to the Respondent\u2019s letter of 24 October, stating that the letter \"has only increased the Claimant\u2019s fear that irreparable harm is being done to OTML\" and that OTML \"is being run into the ground.\"173 The Claimant challenged the Respondent\u2019s explanations for the various developments raised in the Claimant\u2019s 14 October letter174 (explanations which, according to the Claimant, \"pose[] more questions than answers\"175), and pointed out that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, most of the developments in question, \"all of which show a rapid diminution in the profitability of OTML and the quality of its management,\" have \"occurred since September 2013.\"176\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 6 November 2014, at paras. 2, 4.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 6 November 2014, at para. 18.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 6 November 2014, at paras. 6-18.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 6 November 2014, at paras. 3,18.\n\n84.\n\nOn 27 November 2014, the Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s letter of 6 November, inviting the Tribunal to dismiss the Request for Provisional Measures (with costs). The Respondent contended, in particular, that the evidence presented by the Claimant with its recent correspondence \"cannot provide a basis for the Request [for Provisional Measures];\"177 this evidence in any event supports the Respondent\u2019s assertions in its 24 October letter;178 and the Claimant remains unable to explain how some of the developments that it invokes (in particular, the appointment of independent directors to the OTML Board) have caused OTML to be \"run into the ground.\"179 The Respondent argued that \"unsubstantiated speculations cannot justify the imposition of interim measures, which are reserved for situations of real, and not imagined, harm..., let alone measures which will substantially affect OTML\u2019s operations/business, bearing in mind that OTML is not a party to these proceedings.\"180\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 27 November 2014, at para. 3.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 27 November 2014, at para. 4.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 27 November 2014, at para. 4(e).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 27 November 2014, at para. 5.\n\n85.\n\nOn 23 December 2014, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal providing information regarding two recent developments \"which are of great concern to the Claimant.\"181 The Claimant reported, in particular, recent actions by the Respondent which relate to the transfer of OTML shares to third parties, and which may therefore alter the existing *status quo.* According to the Claimant, PNG Prime Minister O\u2019Neill announced on 14 December 2014 that \"a 33% stake in OTML has been given to the people of Western Province, after the State\u2019s National Executive Council \u2018approved the free transfer of equity in OTML following consultation with landowners and provincial government\u2019.\"182\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 2.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 4.\n\n86.\n\nIn its letter, the Claimant argued that if \"the share transfer (or issue) is allowed to be completed, the *status quo -* both generally and as it relates to the ownership and management of OTML - will be profoundly disturbed,\"183 and \"if the State is allowed to transfer (or issue) OTML shares to third parties, the effectiveness of any future order of restitution will be seriously undermined. Thus, the State\u2019s actions directly threaten the integrity of this arbitration.\"184\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 10.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 11.\n\n87.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant alleged that there are indications that \"there has been a \u2018contribution\u2019 of PGK190 million (approximately USD74 million) from OTML to the State,\"185 and that the Claimant is \"entitled to question the basis for such \u2018contribution\u2019, which exacerbates the Claimant\u2019s fear that irreparable harm is being done to the company pending the resolution of this dispute.\"186\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 15.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 17.\n\n88.\n\nIn light of these developments, the Claimant requested that, \"as a measure under paragraph 27(c) of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures,\" the Tribunal \"move as soon as possible to order the State to refrain from transferring or issuing (or completing the transfer or issue of) any OTML shares to any third party, or taking any steps that otherwise change the ownership of OTML, pending determination of this dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\"187\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 20.\n\n89.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s 23 December 2014 letter, arguing that \"the Claimant\u2019s purported reliance on these \u2018recent developments\u2019 do [sic] not, in any way, warrant any Provisional Measures being granted,\" and that the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures \"should be dismissed with costs.\"188 In its letter, the Respondent states that the Claimant\u2019s position \"has dramatically evolved with time\" since its Request for Provisional Measures,189 and that the Claimant \"dramatically changed the premise of its [Request for Provisional Measures] from one of protecting the \u2018very existence of the Claimant and the purposes for which it was established\u2019 to that of purportedly protecting \u2018the ownership and management of OTML\u2019.\"190 The Respondent maintains that \"there remains no basis for the Claimant\u2019s [Request for Provisional Measures],\" and notes that \"it has never been the Claimant\u2019s position that it would not be adequately compensated by damages but only by an order of specific performance;\"191 rather, in this arbitration, the Claimant seeks \"the cancellation of the issuance of the OTML shares to State or alternatively, damages for the OTML shares.\"192 According to the Respondent, \"it is hardly consistent for the Claimant to now claim that it would suffer \u2018irreparable harm\u2019 which cannot be remedied by damages, such that provisional measures are necessitated.\"193\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at paras. 18-19.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at paras. 2-4.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 4.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 5.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 5.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 5.\n\n90.\n\nWith regard to the intended transfer of OTML shares to the people of the Western Province, the Respondent confirms that \"the State\u2019s National Executive Council had approved the free transfer of 33 percent ownership in OTML to the people of Western Province, following consultation with the stakeholders, including the landowners, with the remaining 67 percent of OTML owned by the people of PNG through the State.\"194 The Respondent maintains that the Claimant\u2019s concerns with this transfer \"are entirely unfounded\"195 because the intended share transfer \"is to the people of Western Province\"196 and \"ensures that the OTML shares are applied solely for the benefit of those people, and is entirely in line with the Claimant\u2019s objects *(i.e.,* to use its assets for the sole benefit of the people) and the Claimant\u2019s proclaimed motivations.\"197\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 4 (emphasis omitted).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 7.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 8 (emphasis omitted).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 10. The Respondent notes that \"it is ironic that the Claimant sees the Intended Share Transfer as an act of aggravation, while the Claimant\u2019s purported gifting of a number of its assets to the communities and government of Western Province is not an act of aggravation, but an act to mitigate the impact of the ongoing dispute between the State and the Claimant on the people of PNG.\" Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 9 (referring to paras. 184 and 197 of 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS).\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent further states that the Claimant \"has altered the basis on which its relief is sought,\"198 and \"it is the State that is in actual fact seeking to ensure that the *status quo* remains the same by allowing the people of the Western Province to continue to benefit from the OTML shares, which programs the Claimant has discontinued.\"199 The Respondent argues that \"there is... no necessity for any Provisional Measure to prevent \u2018irreparable [or substantial] harm\u2019 from being caused to the Claimant\" because \"the Claimant has not claimed that it would not be properly compensated by... an award of damages\" for the OTML shares.200 Moreover, the Respondent argues that \"any fears which the Claimant alleges to have regarding the Intended Share Transfer are premature and speculative, to say the least\" because the State\u2019s National Executive Council \"has simply announced that it has approved of the proposed transfer of the shares\" but \"[n]o transfer has taken place,\" and \"the intended manner by which the transfer is to be implemented (not to mention the actual transfer) of the OTML shares has not yet been decided, and would be discussed with various stakeholders, including the people of the Western Province.\"201\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11 (emphasis omitted).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11 (emphasis omitted).\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent \"confirms that the shareholding of OTML remains unchanged and will not be altered until: (a) such further discussions are carried out, (b) a *further* decision is made by the State as to how best to implement the Intended Share Transfer having regard to such discussions, and (c) a transfer is then made pursuant to this *further* decision.\"202 According to the Respondent, \"[t]hat being the case, it is entirely speculative for the Claimant to assert that the Intended Share Transfer may result in economic and reputational harm to OTML...\" and the Claimant\u2019s assertions that \"there will be serious, irreparable harm caused to OTML if the provisional measures are not granted\" are without merit.203\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 12 (emphasis in original).\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 12.\n\n93.\n\nWith regard to the second issue raised by the Claimant in its 23 December 2014 letter, the Respondent notes that: (1) OTML\u2019s financial position has improved in 2014 as compared to 2013;204 and (2) the contribution made by OTML to the State is in line with the contributions made to the State in previous years and therefore \"[t]here is... nothing questionable about the OTML Contribution, in spite of the Claimant\u2019s attempt to cast suspicion on what is otherwise an entirely uncontroversial matter.\"205\n\n*See* Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 14.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at paras. 15-16.\n\n94.\n\nOn 14 January 2015, the Claimant sent an unsolicited letter responding to the Respondent\u2019s 9 January letter, stating that the latter \"only serves to highlight the urgent need for provisional measures in this case.\"206 In its letter, the Claimant argues that \"[t]his arbitration is now at a critical juncture\" and the Tribunal \"should order provisional measures - if not to protect the Claimant, then to protect the process of this arbitration.\"207\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 2.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 9.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant argues that: (1) the Respondent \"has unequivocally confirmed its intention to transfer the OTML shares..., offering only the cynical retort that the Claimant should be happy the [Respondent] will do so because the transfer will benefit the people of the Western Province,\" and therefore, \"[o]n any view, with the intent to transfer confirmed, the [Respondent]\u2019s description of the Claimant\u2019s fears as \u2018premature and speculative\u2019... is hard to credit;\"208 and (2) instead of saying that \"prior to the Tribunal\u2019s final award, it will refrain from taking any further steps to transfer the OTML shares, or deal in any other property that is the subject of this dispute,\" the Respondent is \"bold in its disregard for the Tribunal and the arbitration process, purporting to act as the owner of the OTML shares,\" which \"alone is sufficient to justify provisional measures.\"209\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 3(a).\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 3(b).\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that its request for provisional measures \"has had to evolve to address the changing state of affairs\" in this case, because \"the threat the Claimant faces, and the threat that is now unquestionably posed to the arbitral process, has increased dramatically.\"210 The Claimant adds that, in any event, \"nothing in the ICSID Convention prevents a party from modifying or expanding its request for provisional measures (indeed, such a rule would defeat the very purpose of provisional measures).\"211\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 4.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 5.\n\n97.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant contends that the \"[h]arm of the scale threatened by the [Respondent] qualifies as irreparable on any sensible measure, and it is trite that threats to the integrity of an ICSID arbitration are, by their very nature, irreparable.\"212 In addition, according to the Claimant, \"just because the Claimant makes an alternative claim for monetary compensation does not give the [Respondent] a free hand to do whatever it likes with the property in dispute;\" the Respondent \"cannot be allowed to... take steps to place this property beyond the reach of the Tribunal.\"213\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 6.\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 7.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, with respect to the OTML Contribution, the Claimant states that the Respondent\u2019s 9 January letter \"does nothing to allay the concerns of the Claimant,\" and therefore \"the Claimant can only restate its belief that serious irregularities have occurred at the company since the expropriation was carried out.\"214\n\nLetter from the Claimant, dated 14 January 2015, at para. 8. In its (unsolicited) response to the Claimant\u2019s 14 January 2015 letter, the Respondent reiterates its request that the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures \"be dismissed with costs\" and states that the Claimant \"has not raised any new submission, and simply seeks to regurgitate its earlier submissions\" which the Respondent \"has already responded to... in its earlier correspondence and submissions....\" Letter from the Respondent, dated 20 January 2015, at paras. 2, 7. The Respondent also notes that: (1) any alarm raised by the Claimant with respect to the change of ownership of OTML sitares is \"misplaced\" given that \"it remains undisputed that the OTML shares are to be held for the benefit of the people of PNG, particularly those of the Western Province;\" (2) \"[w]here the Claimant itself accepts that monetary compensation would be an adequate remedy by claiming for monetary compensation as its final relief the Claimant cannot possibly assert that the integrity of an ICSID arbitration would be threatened if its Request [for Provisional Measures] were not granted;\" (3) \"the constant changing of the basis of the [Claimant\u2019s] Request [for Provisional Measures] every time the Claimant\u2019s assertions are demonstrated to be false / misleading / selective itself suggests that the Request is umneritorious;\" and (4) the Claimant\u2019s change of focus from OTML\u2019s 2014 financial position to that in 2013 \"is yet another illustration of the selective approach the Claimant is taking in its Request [for Provisional Measures], and demonstrates the hopelessness of the Request.\" Letter from the Respondent, dated 20 January 2015, at paras. 2-6 (emphasis omitted).\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S REASONS**\n------------------------------\n\n*A. The Tribunal\u2019s Power to Grant Provisional Measures and Applicable Standard*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s authority to grant provisional measures in this ICSID proceeding is governed by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. Article 47 of the Convention provides:\n\n*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.*\n\n100.\n\nIn turn, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 provides that:\n\n*(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).*\n\n*(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.*\n\n*(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.*\n\n*(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.*\n\n101.\n\nThese provisions of the Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules are the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s authority to order provisional measures, and define the circumstances in which such authority should be exercised.\n\n1. Tribunal\u2019s Power to Recommend Provisional Measures\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nDespite the use of the term \"recommend\" in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, this provision of the Convention has properly been understood as allowing the Tribunal to *order* provisional measures.215 The phrase \"recommend,\" in the context of the Convention, means \"order\" or \"direct.\" An arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention has the power not merely to propose or urge provisional measures, but also to issue orders mandating that such measures be taken.\n\n*See, e.g..* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, at para. 58, **Exhibit RL-29.**\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has broad authority to order particular provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. However, this power must be exercised in a manner consistent with the general purposes and character of the provisional measures. Those purposes and character include, in particular, the exceptional nature of relief granted before the parties have had the opportunity fully to present their respective cases. In the words of the ICSID tribunal in *Maffezini* v. *Spain,* provisional relief is \"an extraordinary measure which should not be granted lightly by the Arbitral Tribunal.\"216\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini* v. *The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Provisional Measures (Procedural Order No. 2), dated 28 October 1999, at para. 10 (cited in Schreuer *et al, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 776, para. 64, **Exhibit CL-19).**\n\n104.\n\nIt is nevertheless uncontested that the Tribunal may decide on provisional measures before having decided on the jurisdictional objections raised in this proceeding.217 A decision on a request for provisional measures naturally does not impede the tribunal\u2019s determination of, or otherwise pre-judge, the issues of jurisdiction pending before a tribunal. As noted below, a tribunal\u2019s finding that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction for the purposes of a decision on provisional measures is without prejudice to the final determination on the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n*See. e.g..* Schreuer *et at. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary.* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 771, para. 46, **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n105.\n\nThe types of provisional measures that may be granted by an ICSID tribunal include a wide range of measures, which depend on the particular circumstances of the case and the rights that are sought to be protected.218 Measures that are commonly sought include orders for the preservation of the *status quo,* orders directing performance of a contract or other legal obligations, orders for the preservation of evidence, enforcement of confidentiality obligations, and orders for security for costs.219\n\nSchreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary.* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 779, para. 76.\n\n*See. e.g..* Bom, *International Commercial Arbitration.* Kluwer (2nd ed., 2014), at pp. 2511-2540. *See also* Schreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary.* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 776, para. 76, **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n106.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant seeks three categories of measures directed at the Respondent - *i.e.,* that the Tribunal order the Respondent to refrain from, pending final determination of the dispute:\n\na. \"taking (or threatening to take) any further steps under Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, or otherwise interfering with or impeding the Claimant\u2019s lawful operation in PNG in accordance with the Program Rules\" ***(\"Claimant\u2019s Request No.*** 1\");\n\nb. \"harassing, arresting, or commencing any criminal prosecution against any officer, employee, servant or agent of the Claimant in connection with the performance of their responsibilities or functions as officers, employees, servants or agents of the Claimant (or making any further threats to do so)\" ***(\u2018Claimant\u2019s Request No. 2\");*** and\n\nc. \"taking any further steps that may aggravate the dispute, disturb the *status quo* as at the date of this Request, or otherwise impede the orderly resolution of the dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\"220***(\u2018Claimant\u2019s Request No. 3\")***\n\nClaimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 27.\n\n2. Standard for Granting Provisional Measures\n---------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe requirements that must be satisfied for an order of provisional measures under Article 47 are well-settled, and are not materially in dispute between the Parties in this case (save for the requirement of urgency).221\n\n*See above* at paras. 44-46, 50-51, 58-67, 70-77.\n\n108.\n\nAccording to one leading authority on the ICSID Convention, \"it is clear that provisional measures will only be appropriate where a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.\"222 As the same commentator summarized, ICSID tribunals typically \"will only grant provisional measures if they are found to be necessary, urgent and are required in order to avoid irreparable harm.\"223 It is well-established224 that the requesting party has the burden of showing why the requested provisional measures are necessary and should be ordered by the Tribunal.225 In addition, tribunals commonly hold that a decision on provisional measures cannot pre-judge the merits of the case.\n\nSchreuer *et al, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 775, para. 63 (footnote omitted). **Exhibit CL-19** (quoted with approval in, *e.g.,* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Procedural Order No. 1, dated 31 March 2006, at para. 68, **Exhibit CA-12).**\n\nSchreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 776, para. 64, **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n*See, e.g.,* Schreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary.* CUP (2nd ed., 2009), at p. 776, para. 64, **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 13; Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 2. *See above* at paras. 44, 51.\n\n109.\n\nIn particular, the party requesting provisional measures must demonstrate that, if the requested measures are not granted, there is a material risk of serious or irreparable injury. There are variations in approach or the precise wording used by the ICSID tribunals as to whether this requirement is that of \"irreparable\" harm, or whether a demonstration of \"serious\" harm will suffice. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the term \"irreparable\" harm is properly understood as requiring a showing of a material risk of serious or grave damage to the requesting party, and not harm that is literally \"irreparable\" in what is sometimes regarded as the narrow common law sense of the term. The degree of \"gravity\" or \"seriousness\" of harm that is necessary for an order of provisional relief cannot be specified with precision, and depends in part on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the relief requested and the relative harm to be suffered by each party; suffice it to say that substantial, serious harm, even if not irreparable, is generally sufficient to satisfy this element of the standard for granting provisional measures.\n\n110.\n\nThus, in *Perenco Ecuador Ltd.* v. *Ecuador,* the tribunal stated that the ICSID Convention \"does not lay down a test of irreparable loss and the authorities do not warrant so narrow a construction.\"226 That tribunal therefore reasoned that: \"[i]f Perenco\u2019s business in Ecuador were effectively brought to an end in this way [by seizure of its assets], such injury could not, in the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, be adequately compensated by an award of damages should its claim ultimately be upheld.\"227\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd.* v. *The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, at para. 43, **Exhibit CA-6.**\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd.* v. *The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, at para. 46, **Exhibit CA-6.**\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal is also of the view that the requesting party need not prove that \"serious\" harm is certain to occur. Rather, it is generally sufficient to show that there is a material risk that it will occur. The requirement of showing material risk does not, however, imply a showing of any particular percentage of likelihood, or probability, that the risk will materialize. The proper requirement is that the requesting party must establish the existence of a sufficient risk or threat that grave or serious harm will occur if provisional measures are not granted.\n\n112.\n\nOf course, the harm alleged by the requesting party must not be purely hypothetical or theoretical. As the tribunal in *Occidental* rightly noted:\n\n*Provisional measures are not meant to protect against any potential or hypothetical harm susceptible to result from uncertain actions. Rather, they are meant to protect the requesting party from imminent harm.228*\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, at para. 89, **Exhibit RL-29.**\n\n113.\n\nIn this regard, in deciding whether to grant provisional measures, tribunals also generally look to the nature of the provisional measures that are requested, and the relative injury to be suffered by each party. While some provisional measures (such as, for example, preserving the *status quo* and ordering performance of a contract or other legal obligation) typically require a strong showing of serious injury, urgency and a *prima facie* case, other provisional measures (such as preservation of evidence, enforcement of confidentiality obligations) are often unlikely to demand the same showings.\n\n114.\n\nThe requirements of necessity and urgency are also well-established. Although these requirements are not set out in express terms in the ICSID Convention, it is well-established that an order of provisional measures will only be granted if these measures are necessary to preserve the requesting party\u2019s rights, and are urgently required to avoid serious harm. In the words of the tribunal in *City Oriente* v. *Ecuador,* provisional measures may only be ordered \"if their adoption is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties and guarantee that the award will fulfill its purpose of providing effective judicial protection.\"229 In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *Burlington* v. *Ecuador* tribunal that the requirement of \"necessity\" means that the requested provisional measures \"must be required to avoid harm or prejudice being inflicted upon the applicant.\"230\n\n*City Oriente Limited* v. *The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 19 November 2007, at para. 52, **Exhibit CA-13**\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. and others* v. *Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Procedural Order No. 1 on Burlington Oriente\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, dated 29 June 2009, at para. 75, **Exhibit CA-15.**\n\n115.\n\nMoreover, as the Respondent rightly notes,231 there is a wealth of authority concluding that an implicit requirement of urgency must be read into Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the very concept of interim or provisional relief necessarily requires a showing of some measure of urgency; absent urgency, there is no justification for a tribunal issuing mandatory orders before having heard the parties\u2019 full submissions and evidence.\n\n*See above* at paras. 51, 58-62.\n\n116.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, a request for provisional measures will satisfy the requirement of urgency where it entails \"a question [that] cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.\"232 As noted above, the precise degree of urgency required in each case will again depend on the provisional measures sought, and on the balance of harms that would result if the risk of harm were to materialize. In the words of the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania:*\n\n*the degree of \u2018urgency\u2019 which is required depends on the circumstances, including the requested provisional measures, and may be satisfied where a party can prove that there is a need to obtain the requested measure at a certain point in the procedure before the issuance of an award. In most situations, this will equate to \u2018urgency\u2019 in the traditional sense (i.e. a need for a measure in a short space of time). In some cases, however, the only time constraint is that the measure be granted before an award - even if the grant is to be some time hence. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the level of urgency required depends on the type of measure which is requested.233*\n\nSchreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* CUP (2nd \u00e9d., 2009), at p. 775, para. 63, **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.* v. *United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Procedural Order No. 1, dated 31 March 2006, at para. 76, **Exhibit CA-12.**\n\n117.\n\nThus, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions,234 the mere passage of time between the Request for Arbitration and the Request for Provisional Measures will not *per se* be conclusory that there is no urgency. The Tribunal will assess urgency taking into account the entirety of the circumstances of the case, and will take into account both the seriousness of the harm and the balance of injuries that would be suffered by both parties if provisional measures are (or are not) ordered.\n\n*See above* at para. 61.\n\n118.\n\nThe Parties agree,235 and the Tribunal concurs, that in order to succeed in obtaining provisional measures, the requesting party must show that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction. The tribunal in *Occidental* explained this clearly, holding that \"[w]hilst the Tribunal need not definitely satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in respect of the merits of the case at issue for purposes of ruling upon the requested provisional measures, it will not order such measures unless there is, *prima facie,* a basis upon which the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction might be established.\"236\n\n*See above* at paras. 44, 51.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and, Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, at para. 55, **Exhibit RL-29.**\n\n119.\n\nThe fact of registration of the Request for Arbitration alone is not sufficient to establish *prima facie* jurisdiction for the purposes of the provisional measures application under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal agrees with the *Perenco* tribunal, which concluded that the fact of registration of the Request for Arbitration is \"not enough for the Tribunal,\"237 and the tribunal must itself be satisfied that there is a *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction. As Professor Schreuer notes in his commentary on the ICSID Convention, \"[i]t is ultimately with the tribunal whether it will accept the Secretary-General\u2019s registration as a sufficient basis or whether it wants to form a *prima facie* opinion on jurisdiction before recommending provisional measures.\"238 Deciding otherwise would effectively mean depriving the Tribunal of the power to determine whether it has jurisdiction, albeit on a *prima facie* basis for the purposes of a provisional measures application, and limit the analysis to the high level review that the ICSID Secretariat conducts at the registration stage. The determination of the *prima facie* jurisdiction for provisional measures is a somewhat higher threshold than that to be applied at the registration stage, although it of course also falls short of a final decision on jurisdiction.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd.* v. *The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Decision on Provisional Measures, 8 May 2009, at para. 39, **Exhibit CA-6.**\n\nSchreuer *et al. The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* CUP (2nd \u00e9d., 2009), at p. 772, para. 48 (footnote omitted). **Exhibit CL-19.**\n\n120.\n\nThe requesting party must also show that there is a *prima facie* case on the merits of its claims. Although a tribunal should engage in a consideration of the *prima facie* strength of the parties\u2019 respective claims, counter-claims and defenses, that analysis should not pre-judge the merits of the case (as explained below239). In practice, the requirement to demonstrate the *prima facie* success on the merits will ordinarily lead to a rejection of a request for provisional measures only in rare circumstances, where the requesting party has failed to advance any credible basis for its claims.\n\n*See below* at paras. 124, 133, 163.\n\n121.\n\nGranting a request for provisional measures must not involve the tribunal pre-judging the merits of the case. It is essential, in this regard, that a tribunal not pre-judge, either consciously or unconsciously, the resolution of any aspect of the parties\u2019 respective claims and defenses. The Respondent also correctly refers to this rule as \"the principle that an arbitral tribunal cannot grant a decision on the merits under the guise of interim relief.\"240 This requirement means that an order recommending provisional measures must not preclude the tribunal from ultimately deciding the issues in the arbitration in any particular way after the parties have fully presented their cases on disputed substantive issues (such as jurisdiction or the merits of the claims).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 1 at fn. 1 (emphasis omitted).\n\n122.\n\nThe assessment of whether the above requirements are satisfied, and in particular whether there is a material risk of serious or irreparable harm, and whether the requested measures are urgent and necessary to prevent that harm from occurring, must be made in light of the circumstances of the case, and particularly the likelihood that the injury will occur during the pendency of the arbitration. As noted above, when assessing whether the requirements of showing serious harm, urgency and necessity are satisfied, the tribunal should also consider the respective hardships that either party would be subjected to if the provisional measures are granted.\n\n123.\n\nThus, provisional measures would ordinarily be available where the claimant, asserting a *prima facie* credible claim, proves that they are necessary and urgently required to avoid serious injury that is likely to result from the actions threatened by the respondent that would alter the existing *status quo.* That is particularly true where the respondent would not suffer material harm from a grant of provisional measures to the claimant under the circumstances.\n\n*B. The Claimant\u2019s Requested Provisional Measures*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nWithout pre-judging any of the issues in this case that are to be finally determined at a later stage in this proceeding, the Tribunal considers that the \"threshold requirements\"241*- i.e.,* that there is *prima facie* jurisdiction and *prima facie* case on the merits - are satisfied in this case. This conclusion does not pre-judge the merits of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections or the Claimant\u2019s claims in any way, which remain subject to the Tribunal\u2019s disposition on the basis of the evidence and argument submitted by the parties in the course of the arbitration.\n\nExpression used by the Respondent. *See above* at paras. 49-58; Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 4 and Section III.\n\n125.\n\nFor the same reasons discussed in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objections under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has satisfactorily demonstrated a *prima facie* case on both jurisdiction and the merits of its claims. There are of course serious counter-arguments - both jurisdictional and otherwise - to the Claimant\u2019s claims. But, for present purposes, the Claimant has satisfied the relatively undemanding requirements of a *prima facie* case.\n\n126.\n\nBearing this in mind, the Tribunal discusses each of the Claimant\u2019s Requests for Provisional Measures below.\n\n1. Claimant\u2019s Request No. 1\n---------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn its Request No. 1, the Claimant seeks an order directing the Respondent to refrain from \"taking (or threatening to take) any further steps under Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, or otherwise interfering with or impeding the Claimant\u2019s lawful operation in PNG in accordance with the Program Rules.\" This request is for injunctive relief to restrain the Respondent from altering the *status quo* with respect to the Claimant\u2019s operations, in particular in respect of the Claimant\u2019s management structure. The Claimant argues, in particular, that this provisional relief is necessary because \"the Respondent\u2019s long-arm attempts to replace the management of [the Claimant] are clearly acts of aggravation as they are exacerbating this dispute and making the just resolution of it significantly more difficult\" and \"[t]hey also pose a direct threat to the Claimant\u2019s ability to continue operating and to pursue its claims.\"242\n\nRequest for Provisional Measures, at para. 9; *see above* at para. 42(c).\n\n128.\n\nAs noted above, Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act purports to give the Respondent the power to restructure the Claimant:\n\n*Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act,* ***the State has all necessary powers to restructure PNGSDP and its operations to ensure that PNGSDP applies its funds for the exclusive benefit of the people of the Western Province.243***\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 40 (emphasis added).\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, among the measures that the Respondent has sought to exercise on the basis of Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, the Respondent purported (by letter dated 24 October 2013) to terminate all Board members of the Claimant and replace them with a \"Transitional Management Team\" appointed by the Respondent.244 Furthermore, Mr David Sode, the Claimant\u2019s Managing Director, received a letter from the Prime Minister of PNG, stating that his appointment was terminated.245 The Tribunal understands, however, that the \"Transitional Management Team\" in fact \"never took its position, and it is Sir Mekere (and his allies) who remain in complete control of the Claimant.\"246\n\n1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 127. *See above* at paras. 38(a), 71(c).\n\n1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 128.\n\n*See above* at para. 65 and fn. 100; Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 44.\n\n130.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these facts demonstrate that the Respondent had already attempted to replace the Claimant\u2019s management. In turn, that indicates, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that there is a real risk that the Respondent may undertake to implement or give effect to this measure or undertake further measures with the same purpose of depriving the current management of the control over the Claimant. The Tenth Supplemental Act remains in full force and effect and there is no indication that the Respondent\u2019s views regarding the Claimant and its assets and management have altered since October 2013. The likelihood of further actions by the Respondent, along similar lines, is in the Tribunal\u2019s view likely to materialize before the end of this proceeding, and therefore it is a question that \"cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.\"247\n\n*See above* at paras. 108, 116.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that there is a risk of grave or serious harm to the Claimant during the pendency of the arbitration, because the evidence shows that the Respondent will likely undertake further actions to take over control and operations of the Claimant, including by seeking to remove and replace the Claimant\u2019s management, as it already purported to do by appointing the \"Transitional Management Team.\" Such a restructuring of the corporate management of the Claimant would likely cause serious damage to the Claimant, including by endangering its very existence and affecting its ability to participate as a party in this arbitration. Among other things, a restructured management could abandon (or alter) the Claimant\u2019s position in these proceedings or the Singapore court proceedings, or could dispose of or encumber the Claimant\u2019s assets, or conclude agreements with the Respondent or other parties that would be potentially adverse to the Claimant\u2019s interests as asserted in this arbitration.\n\n132.\n\nGiven the foregoing, the Tribunal considers that an order of provisional relief directed at interference with or changes to the Claimant\u2019s management is necessary in order to prevent this harm from occurring during the pendency of these proceedings. The Tribunal does not, at present, consider that a sufficient showing has been made with regard to more generalized actions by the Respondent assertedly affecting the *status quo.* If the Respondent were to undertake additional actions potentially causing grave harm to the Claimant, the Claimant would be able to seek further provisional relief from the Tribunal.\n\n133.\n\nThere is no risk that the Tribunal\u2019s order would pre-judge any of the issues in this case. In this respect, the Tribunal does not see how the Claimant\u2019s Provisional Measure 1 \"offends the principle that an arbitral tribunal cannot grant a decision on the merits under the guise of interim relief.\"248 In particular, the Tribunal\u2019s order would not in any way pre-judge the Claimant\u2019s claim that the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment in the PNG or the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. Rather, the Tribunal\u2019s order will allow the Claimant to continue its operations, under its current management, during the remainder of this proceeding, without fear of restructuring or other interference with its pre-existing corporate and management structure.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 1 at fn. 1 (emphasis omitted).\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the requested measures are \"urgent\" under the applicable standard for provisional measures.249 As indicated above, the Respondent has already taken steps to remove and replace the Claimant\u2019s management and there is no indication that it will unilaterally desist from such efforts in the immediate future. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is a material likelihood of further steps by the Respondent to remove or replace the Claimant\u2019s management during the remainder of this arbitration.\n\n*See above* at paras. 107-108, 114-117.\n\n135.\n\nIn addition, the balance of harms weighs in favor of granting the measure requested by the Claimant. If the provisional measure is not granted, there is a risk of serious harm to the Claimant. By contrast, the harm that would be suffered by the Respondent would be limited. In particular, there is no persuasive evidence that the harm that the Respondent would allegedly suffer if the Claimant\u2019s assets were dissipated by its management is likely to occur during this proceeding. If clear and convincing evidence of such dissipation of assets by the Claimant is discovered during the course of this proceeding, the Respondent would be free to request provisional measures from the Tribunal directed at the preservation of such assets.\n\n136.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal considers it appropriate and necessary to enjoin the Respondent from undertaking any further actions during this arbitration that would alter the corporate or management structure of the Claimant. The Tribunal therefore orders that:\n\n***the Respondent refrain from taking any further steps under Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, or otherwise interfering with the Claimant\u2019s management. In particular, the Respondent should refrain from taking any measures purporting to restructure or otherwise alter the management of the Claimant.***\n\n137.\n\nThis order shall remain in effect unless and until it is revoked by the Tribunal or until the end of this arbitration proceeding.\n\n2. Claimant\u2019s Request No. 2\n---------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn its Request No. 2, the Claimant requests an order directing the Respondent to refrain from \"harassing, arresting, or commencing any criminal prosecution against any officer, employee, servant or agent of the Claimant in connection with the performance of their responsibilities or functions as officers, employees, servants or agents of the Claimant (or making any further threats to do so).\"\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the requested provisional measure is necessary to prevent imminent serious harm, or that the requested measure is urgent. In particular, the Claimant has not provided evidence - beyond Sir Mekere Morauta\u2019s professed \"belie[f]\"250 - that the State \"directed persons for whom it is responsible to make threats of physical harm to officers, employees and agents [of the Claimant], or at the very least failed to prevent these persons from making such threats.\"251\n\n1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 142.\n\n1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 142.\n\n140.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence of actual harassment of or injury to the Claimant\u2019s employees by the Respondent, or of physical harm to the Claimant\u2019s employees. Nor has the Claimant provided satisfactory evidence, either direct or circumstantial, of threats of future harm or harassment by the Respondent, or evidence that any such harassment was done upon the Respondent\u2019s instructions, prompting or encouragement.252 As such, this requested measure is not sufficiently substantiated by the factual evidence provided by the Claimant.\n\n*See* 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 143.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes, however, that provisional measures would generally be appropriate if there were credible evidence that either party had made, directed or encouraged threats of physical harm against employees, officers or agents of the other party. Such actions would be a serious breach of each party\u2019s obligation to arbitrate in good faith and would ordinarily warrant immediate relief.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant also has not satisfactorily established that Mr Davis\u2019 deportation was connected with the Parties\u2019 dispute, rather than Mr Davis\u2019 breach of the visa conditions, as the Respondent contends.253 The Tribunal notes the timing of Mr Davis\u2019 deportation and accepts that it suggests a connection with these proceedings. However, standing alone, this indication is insufficient to warrant the substantial intrusion on the Respondent\u2019s governmental authority that would result from an order requiring revocation of Mr Davis\u2019 deportation. The Tribunal also notes that, in the event that there are concrete circumstances indicating that the presence of Mr Davis (or others) in PNG was necessary for purposes of preparing for these proceedings or otherwise conducting the Claimant\u2019s operations, provisional measures would in principle be available if such presence were not permitted by the Respondent.\n\n*See above* at para. 66; 1st Sir Mekere Morauta WS, at para. 144.\n\n143.\n\nIn addition, like other ICSID tribunals, the Tribunal considers that requests for provisional measures should be denied where they are aimed at \"prevent[ing] an action which [the Claimants] are not even sure is being planned,\"254 or where granting a provisional measure involves \"a degree of speculation\" and where there is insufficient evidence before the tribunal that the risk would be likely to materialize.255 Here, the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry, announced by the Respondent on or around 12 May 2014,256 does not in itself entail that the Claimant\u2019s officers and/or employees would be subjected to harassment or any other inappropriate actions by the Respondent. There is no evidence, at least at this juncture, that the Commission of Inquiry would not perform its functions in a transparent and independent manner, unconnected to these proceedings. The Respondent is entitled to pursue its own fact finding inquiries into the circumstances of the Claimant\u2019s activities in the PNG and the mere establishment of a commission to do so cannot be regarded as improper or wrongful.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, at para. 89, **Exhibit RL-29.**\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited* v. *Independent Power Tanzania Limited* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/8), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, dated 20 December 1999, at paras. 13- 14, **Exhibit RL-33**\n\n*See above* at paras. 71(c), 74(g); 1st Sir Mereke Morauta WS, at para. 148.\n\n144.\n\nIn addition, any alleged harassment or other harm arising from establishment of the Commission of Inquiry would be merely hypothetical at this stage, because the Commission of Inquiry has \"not yet been constituted\"257 and hence the harm (if any) that could result from the activities of this Commission of Inquiry remains hypothetical and uncertain. As explained above, purely hypothetical harm cannot provide the basis for granting interim measures.258 There is also no evidence that would suggest that, even if the Commission were to be established and were to take adverse actions, these actions would materialize during the pendency of this arbitration.\n\n1st Daniel Rolpagarea WS, at para. 76(a).\n\n*See above* at para. 112.\n\n145.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Caratube International Oil Co. LLP* v. *Kazakhstan* that the State\u2019s investigative powers, including in criminal matters, are \"a most obvious and undisputed part of [its] sovereign right... to implement and enforce its national law on its territory\" and \"a particularly high threshold must be overcome before an ICSID Tribunal can indeed recommend provisional measures regarding criminal investigations conducted by a state.\"259 The ICSID tribunal\u2019s decision in *Lao Holdings* is to the same effect.260 As explained above, there is insufficient evidence here of either actual or threatened harm, or of improper actions by the Respondent, sufficient to warrant interference with the Respondent\u2019s exercise of its lawful governmental functions.261\n\n*Caratube International Oil Company LLP* v. *The Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12), Decision Regarding Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, dated 31 luly 2009, at paras. 134-137, **Exhibit RL-24.**\n\n*See Lao Holdings N.V.* v. *The Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6), Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order, dated 30 May 2014, at paras. 21-25, **Exhibit RL-28.**\n\n*See above* at paras. 139-142.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"threats by a host State to commence criminal proceedings against the claimant\u2019s officials justif[y] the recommendation of provisional measures,\"262 and that \"[t]here is clearly a \u2018strong linkage\u2019\" between the institution of the Commission of Inquiry and the investment dispute before the Tribunal.263 Although there appears to be some connection with the facts that the Respondent has characterized as the dissipation of the Claimant\u2019s assets, which was part of the Respondent\u2019s justification for its recent actions *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Claimant, the Tribunal is unconvinced that there is a sufficiently \"strong linkage\" between the institution of the Commission of Inquiry and this proceeding. The Tribunal notes, in particular, that the second prong of the *Lao Holdings* tribunal that applied the \"strong linkage\" test is missing in this case - *i.e.,* that \"such a situation *[i.e.,* concurrent pendency of criminal local proceedings and arbitration proceedings] threatens the integrity of the arbitral process.\"264\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 23 (emphasis omitted).\n\n*See above* at paras. 66, 74(g); Claimant\u2019s Reply, at para. 23.\n\n*Lao Holdings N.V.* v. *The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6), Ruling on Motion to Amend the Provisional Measures Order, dated 30 May 2014, at para. 37, **Exhibit RL-28.**\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Request No. 2 is therefore rejected. As indicated above, however, in the event of substantiated threats of physical or comparable harm to a party\u2019s employees, officers or agents, provisional measures to prevent such harm from occurring would be available.\n\n3. Claimant\u2019s Request No. 3\n---------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Request No. 3 relates to the preservation of the *status quo* and the nonaggravation of the dispute. Preliminarily, it appears from the Claimant\u2019s submissions that it makes one general request for the preservation of the *status quo,* as set out in paragraph 27(c) of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, and also formulates (in its 23 December 2014 letter265) a more specific sub-request, within the broad request for the preservation of the *status quo,* relating to the ownership of OTML shares.266\n\n*See above* at paras. 85-88.\n\n*See* Letter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 20 (requesting that, ***\"as a measure under paragraph 27(c) of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures,*** the Tribunal move as soon as possible to order the State to refrain from transferring or issuing (or completing the transfer or issue of) any OTML shares to any third party, or taking any steps that otherwise change the ownership of OTML, pending determination of this dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention\") (emphasis added).\n\n149.\n\nThe general Request No. 3 and the more specific sub-request relating to the ownership of OTML shares are discussed in turn below.\n\na) Claimant\u2019s general Request No. 3\n-----------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn its Request No. 3, as articulated in paragraph 27(c) of the Request for Provisional Measures, the Claimant seeks an order from the Tribunal enjoining the Respondent from \"taking any further steps that may aggravate the dispute, disturb the *status quo* as at the date of this Request, or otherwise impede the orderly resolution of the dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\" As such, the Claimant\u2019s Request No. 3 is a request for a general order for the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute.\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Request No. 3 is rejected, because the Claimant has not shown either urgency or the necessity for such an open-ended order. The Claimant\u2019s request for the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute, without requesting specific, clearly articulated measures, is overly broad, and, as such, will ordinarily fail to satisfy the requirements of urgency and necessity. Here, the breadth of the Claimant\u2019s request precludes the Tribunal from assessing the risk of serious harm that would be likely absent such an order, or establishing whether there is necessity and urgency for such an order in light of that risk.\n\n152.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant has not articulated the character of the *status quo* that assertedly needs protection under this request. The broad category of measures \"preserving the *status quo\"* would therefore be extremely difficult to implement in practice, because any legislative measures, regulatory decisions or other actions could potentially be considered as an alteration of the *status quo* in this case. That is inconsistent with the purpose of the provisional measures or Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. Rather, requests for provisional measures must generally be narrow and specific, so that a tribunal, and the party defending the request for provisional measures, are able to clearly identify the measures, and ensure compliance therewith.\n\n153.\n\nAs the Respondent rightly points out, provisional measures are \"exceptional\" measures not to be taken lightly, particularly where they are ordered against a State. The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *CEMEX* v. *Venezuela* that the \"so-called principle of nonaggravation cannot supplant the requirements of Article 47,\" and that \"\u2018non-aggravation measures\u2019 are ancillary measures which cannot be recommended in the absence of measures of a purely protective or preservative kind.\"267\n\n*CEXIEX Caracas Investments B.V. and CEXIEX Caracas 11 Investments B.V* v. *Bolvarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15), Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, dated 3 March 2010, at paras. 61-65, **Exhibit RL-25.**\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s general Request No. 3, as articulated in paragraph 27(c) of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, must therefore be rejected.\n\nb) Claimant\u2019s request relating to the ownership of OTML shares as set out in the Claimant\u2019s 23 December 2014 letter\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nAs noted above, in its 23 December letter, the Claimant formulated a more specific subrequest within the general order sought in paragraph 27(c) of the Request for Provisional Measures. In this specific sub-request, the Claimant seeks an order directing the Respondent to \"order the [Respondent] to refrain from transferring or issuing (or completing the transfer or issue of) any OTML shares to any third party, or taking any steps that otherwise change the ownership of OTML, pending determination of this dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention.\"268\n\n*See above* at para. 88.\n\n156.\n\nUnlike the Claimant\u2019s general Request No. 3, discussed above,269 this more specific request satisfies the requirements of specificity, urgency and necessity.\n\n*See above* at paras. 150-154.\n\n157.\n\nFirst, unlike the Claimant\u2019s general Request No. 3, this sub-request is narrow and specific and clearly sets out the character of the *status quo* that the Claimant seeks to preserve *(i.e.,* the ownership of OTML shares).\n\n158.\n\nSecond, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the circumstances described by the Claimant and evidence submitted by both Parties show that an urgent order is required. In particular, information provided by the Claimant regarding the imminent disposal of 33% of shares in OTML for the benefit of the People of the Western Province, including recent press articles reporting that this sale is about to materialize, is sufficient evidence of imminent harm.\n\n159.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant\u2019s evidence is confirmed by the Respondent\u2019s admissions in its 9 January 2015 letter. In its letter, the Respondent confirmed that \"the State\u2019s National Executive Council had approved the free transfer of 33 percent ownership in OTML to the people of Western Province, following consultation with the stakeholders, including the landowners.\"270 The Respondent also referred to \"further discussions\" that will be carried out, followed by \"a further decision [to be] made by the State as to how best to implement the Intended Share Transfer\" and then the transfer itself.271 Although the Respondent does not specify the timeframe for these next steps, there is little doubt that this question \"cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits;\" rather, it requires urgent injunctive relief to restrain the Respondent from altering the ownership of the OTML shares.\n\n*See above* at para. 90; Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 4 (emphasis omitted).\n\n*See above* at para. 92; Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 12 (emphasis omitted).\n\n160.\n\nThird, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is a material risk of serious harm to the Claimant, if the Tribunal does not issue an order. The above facts demonstrate that the Respondent has already expressed an intention to, and has in fact undertaken concrete actions in order to, alter the ownership of the shares in OTML. In turn, that indicates that there is a real risk that the Respondent: (a) will proceed to finalize the transfer of 33% of shares in OTML to third parties in the near future, while this arbitration is still pending; and (b) will likely undertake further actions to alter the ownership of the OTML shares, in a manner that would significantly affect the Tribunal\u2019s ability to render an award of restitution, as sought by the Claimant.\n\n161.\n\nThe mere fact that the transfer has not yet taken place does not make the risk of harm merely \"speculative.\" Rather, the Respondent itself admitted that it had started taking steps towards the disposal of the OTML shares; therefore, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, this risk is not \"premature and speculative.\"272 The basic purpose of provisional measures is to prevent the harm from materializing; had the transfer already been completed, the provisional measure requested by the Claimant would be belated, and therefore of little use.\n\n*See above* at para. 91; Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11.\n\n162.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the transfer of the shares to third parties - that would potentially qualify as *bona fide* third party purchasers - would significantly undermine the opportunity for the Claimant to receive \"reinstatement and return of its shares in OTML\" which is the primary relief that the Claimant seeks in this arbitration.273 In this regard, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, the Claimant is not required to show \"irreparable\" harm;274 rather, as noted above, a showing of substantial, serious harm would generally suffice. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, such a showing has been made by the Claimant, and confirmed by the Respondent\u2019s admissions with regard to its intended transfer of OTML shares. The Tribunal therefore considers that an order of provisional relief is necessary to prevent this harm from occurring during the pendency of these proceedings.\n\n*See* Letter from the Claimant, dated 23 December 2014, at para. 8; Request for Provisional Measures, at para. 6.\n\n*See above* at para. 109; Letter from the Respondent, dated 9 January 2015, at para. 11.\n\n163.\n\nMoreover, there is no risk that the Tribunal\u2019s order would pre-judge any of the issues in this case. An order directing the Respondent to refrain from altering the *status quo* with regard to the ownership of OTML shares would not in any way pre-judge any of the Claimant\u2019s claims; rather, it would allow the Tribunal to preserve its authority to decide on the merits of the case (should it determine it has jurisdiction), including to order restitutionary relief, if the Tribunal decides that such relief is appropriate in this arbitration.\n\n164.\n\nIn addition, the balance of harms also weighs in favor of granting the Claimant\u2019s requested measure for the preservation of the *status quo* with respect to ownership of OTML shares. The Respondent has not provided any reasons that would justify the need to urgently dispose of OTML\u2019s shares, nor has it explained the harm that the Respondent would suffer if the shares are not disposed of at this time. By contrast, the harm that is likely to result for the Claimant will be serious, and potentially irremediable. Therefore, the need to protect the Claimant\u2019s rights - and preserve the Tribunal\u2019s authority to decide on the merits of this case and grant relief that it considers appropriate - outweighs the considerations that could warrant the disposal of shares in OTML by the Respondent before the Tribunal\u2019s final award in this arbitration.\n\n165.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal considers it appropriate and necessary to enjoin the Respondent from undertaking any actions during this arbitration that would alter the *status quo* with respect to the ownership of the shares in OTML. The Tribunal therefore orders that:\n\n***the Respondent refrain from transferring or issuing (or completing the transfer or issue of) any OTML shares to any third party, or taking any steps that otherwise change the ownership of OTML.***\n\n166.\n\nThis order shall remain in effect unless and until it is revoked by the Tribunal or until the end of this arbitration proceeding.\n\nC. *Relevance of the Singapore Court Proceedings*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Parties disagree about the relevance of the Singapore court proceedings for the Tribunal\u2019s decision on provisional measures in this case. In particular, the Respondent has alleged that \"given the Claimant\u2019s failure (on non-jurisdictional grounds) to obtain the self-same provisional measures in the Singapore Courts, the Singapore Court\u2019s finding that those measures are not urgent/necessary... ought, in the absence of any changed circumstances (and there is none, as the Claimant itself recognises), to preclude the Claimant from seeking a further bite of the \u2018provisional apple\u2019.\"275\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 25 (citing Bom, *International Commercial Arbitration,* Kluwer (2nd \u00e9d., 2014), at pp. 3787-3790, **Exhibit RL-36).**\n\n168.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal sees no scope for application of the preclusion principle referred to by the Respondent. The relief that the Claimant sought before the Singapore court was related to issues of the Singapore company law.276 By contrast, in this arbitration, the Claimant seeks injunctive relief against the Respondent, a sovereign State, under the relevant principles of international law, which the Singapore Court was not requested (and might well not have the authority) to grant.277 Thus, there can be no preclusive effect of the Singapore Court decision rejecting the Claimant\u2019s requested interim relief, because the measure requested and the basis for the requested measure was different.\n\n*See* Claimant\u2019s Reply, at paras. 26 *et seq.*\n\n*See above* at para. 75(a).\n\n169.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that it is not determinative that \"the[] same facts were relied upon by the Claimant in its unsuccessful attempt to obtain similar reliefs in Summons 5547\"278 before the Singapore Court. Rather, the character of the relief requested and the legal standard and basis for that request must also be substantially similar.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 35(a) fn. 44 (emphasis omitted). *See also* Respondent\u2019s Observations, at para. 35(b) fn. 45.\n\n170.\n\nConversely, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis is not altered by the Singapore Court\u2019s injunction that the Claimant refrain from \"effecting any further changes to its M&A and to the composition of its Board,\" which, in any event, the Tribunal understands is a temporary, \"holding order,\" pending the conclusion of the hearing of the injunction application.279\n\n*See above* at para. 75(b).\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby:\n\na. orders that, for the duration of these arbitration proceedings, the Respondent refrain from taking any further steps under Section 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act, or otherwise interfering with the Claimant\u2019s management. In particular, the Respondent should refrain from taking any measures purporting to restructure or otherwise alter the management of the Claimant, for the reasons set out above.280 The remainder of the Claimant\u2019s Request No. 1 is rejected.\n\nb. rejects the Claimant\u2019s Request No. 2, for the reasons set out above.281\n\nc. rejects the Claimant\u2019s general Request No. 3 as articulated in paragraph 27(c) of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures, for the reasons set out above.282\n\nd. grants the Claimant\u2019s sub-request set out in its 23 December 2014 letter, relating to the preservation of the *status quo* with respect to the ownership of shares in OTML, and orders that, for the duration of these arbitration proceedings, the Respondent refrain from transferring or issuing (or completing the transfer or issue of) any OTML shares to any third party, or taking any steps that otherwise change the ownership of OTML.283\n\ne. reserves the decision on costs associated with the Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n*See above* at paras. 127-137.\n\n*See above* at paras. 138-147.\n\n*See above* at paras. 150-154.\n\n*See above* at paras. 155-166.\n\n172.\n\nThe above orders shall remain in effect unless and until they are revoked by the Tribunal or until the end of this arbitration proceeding. These orders are made strictly without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the merits of the issues in dispute in this arbitration.

Procedural History*\n-----------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 October 2013, the Claimant filed a request for arbitration dated 10 October 2013 against the Respondent (the \"Request for Arbitration\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration, as supplemented by the Claimant's letters of 8 November, 22 November, and 10 December 2013, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 February 2014, the Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the method of constituting the arbitral tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nIn the result, the Tribunal was composed of Mr. Gary Born, a national of the United States of the America, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Dr. Michael Pryles, a national of Australia, appointed by the Claimant; and the Honourable Justice Duncan Kerr, Chev LH, a national of Australia, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Monty Taylor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. Ms. Valeriya Kirsey was designated to serve as the Assistant to the Tribunal on 23 June 2014. On 24 March 2015, Ms. Geraldine Fischer, ICSID Legal Counsel, replaced Mr. Monty Taylor as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by telephone conference-call on 25 July 2014. The Tribunal subsequently issued its Procedural Order No. 1 on 7 August 2014.\n\n10.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 1, issued after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal decided that the question of jurisdiction would be determined as a preliminary issue, and the hearing on jurisdiction would take place over two days prior to 31 December 2014.1\n\n*See* Procedural Order No. 1, dated 7 August 2014, at para. 16.\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 September 2014, after consulting with the Parties, the Tribunal established that the hearing on jurisdiction would take place in Singapore on 29-30 November 2014, and set out a proposed timetable for the exchange of submissions on jurisdiction, which it subsequently confirmed.\n\n12.\n\nA hearing on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections Under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules took place at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore on 10 October 2014. (The Tribunal's Decision on those objections was issued to the Parties on 28 October 2014.)\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 October 2014, the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) (\"Objections to Jurisdiction\") with the accompanying Expert Opinion of Professor Dr. Rudolf Dolzer, Expert Report of Mr. John Griffin QC and exhibits.\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 October 2014,2 the Claimant submitted its Response to State's Objections on Jurisdiction (\"Response on Jurisdiction\") with the accompanying Expert Report of Mr. Ron Webb QC and exhibits.\n\nMore precisely, the Claimant filed its submission at 1:51 am Singapore time on 30 October 2014.\n\n15.\n\nOn 7 November 2014, the Respondent filed its Reply to the Claimant's Response to the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) (\"Reply on Jurisdiction\") with the accompanying Second Witness Statement of Mr. Daniel Rolpagarea, the Reply Expert Report of Mr. John A. Griffin QC and exhibits.\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 November 2014, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction with the accompanying Second Expert Report of Mr. Ron Webb SC and exhibits.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 November 2014, as agreed by the Parties, the President of the Tribunal, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, held the pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties. Later on the same day, Mr. Monty Taylor circulated a copy of the minutes of the meeting to all participants.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 November 2014, the Tribunal confirmed the timetable and time allocation for the two days of the hearing on jurisdiction to be held on 29 and 30 November 2014.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's directions, the hearing on jurisdiction took place at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore on 29-30 November 2014.

THE PARTIES' DISPUTE**\n----------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThis proceeding concerns the Claimant's alleged investment in an open pit copper and gold mine in the Star Mountains of the Western Province of PNG (the \"Ok Tedi mine\"). As set out in the Request for Arbitration, PNGSDP owns a majority shareholding (*i.e*., 63.4146%) in Ok Tedi Mining Ltd. (\"OTML\"), a PNG-incorporated company.4 OTML's rights to the Ok Tedi mine are set out in Special Mining Lease No. 1 (the \"Special Mining Lease\"). The Special Mining Lease is the primary asset of OTML.5\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 16.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 25.\n\n31.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration provides details on the history of the Ok Tedi mine and on how the Claimant was incorporated and came to own its shares in OTML.6 These facts are summarised below.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at paras. 9-15.\n\n32.\n\nIn 2001, BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd. (\"BHP,\" a subsidiary of BHP Billiton Ltd. (\"BHP Billiton\") (the former shareholder and operator of OTML)) transferred all of its ordinary shares in OTML to the Claimant.7 This transfer was intended to entrust an independent, foreign-registered company with the management of the development of the Ok Tedi mine (through OTML) and the use of its earnings from the mine to promote sustainable development within PNG and to advance the general welfare of the people of PNG, particularly those of the Western Province where the Ok Tedi mine is located.8 In connection with the transfer, a charge was created over the Claimant's shares in OTML (the \"Charge\"), by way of a Security Deed dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Security Deed\") and a Security Trust Deed dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Security Trust Deed\"), and a mortgage was created over the Claimant's shares in OTML (the \"Mortgage\"), by way of an Equitable Mortgage of Shares dated 7 February 2002 (the \"Equitable Mortgage of Shares\").9\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at paras. 13-14.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 13.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 14.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing a selective share buyback in January 2011, the Claimant and the Respondent have respectively held 63.4146% and 36.5853% of issued ordinary shares in OTML.10\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 15.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant was incorporated in Singapore on 20 October 2001.11 It is a company limited by guarantee (as distinguished from share capital) and governed by its Memorandum and Articles of Association (the \"Memorandum and Articles of Association\" or \"M&A\").12 The M&A annex a set of Program Rules (the \"Program Rules\") which deal principally with how earnings are to be applied for the purposes of fund management, transparency and accountability.13\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 18.\n\n35.\n\nSince its establishment in 2001, the Claimant has financed and overseen several development and environmental projects. It has financed these projects, and carried out the functions for which it was established, by taking its annual dividends from OTML and (in accordance with the Program Rules) putting them into low-risk investments in international markets to establish two funds: a short-term fund (the \"Development Fund\") and a Long Term Fund (the \"LTF\").14\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 20.\n\n36.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, the Respondent adopted the Mining (Ok Tedi Tenth Supplemental Agreement) Act 2013 (the \"Tenth Supplemental Act\"), along with the Mining (Ok Tedi Mine Continuation) (Ninth Supplemental Agreement) (Amendment) Act 2013.15 According to the Claimant, among other things, the Tenth Supplemental Act purports to cancel the shares held by the Claimant in OTML.16 Section 4 provides, in the relevant part, as follows:\n\n4. Shareholders of OTML\n\n(1) On the coming into operation of this Act -\n\n(a) all ordinary shares held by PNGSDP in the share capital of OTML shall be cancelled and cease to exist; and\n\n(b) 122,200,000 new, fully paid ordinary shares in the share capital of OTML free of any encumbrance, charge or equitable interest shall be issued to the State.17\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 35.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 36.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 36.\n\n37.\n\nSections 4(5) and 4(6) of the Tenth Supplemental Act provide:\n\n(5) All references to PNGSDP in the constitution of OTML and in the Fifth Restated Shareholders Agreement shall, on and from the coming into operation of this Act, be read and construed as a reference to the State.\n\n(6) On and from the coming into operation of this Act, the Charge is void and of no legal effect and shall not create any interest of any nature whatsoever in any share of OTML.18\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 39.\n\n38.\n\nSection 6 of the Tenth Supplemental Act provides:\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act, the State has all necessary powers to restructure PNGSDP and its operations to ensure that PNGSDP applies its funds for the exclusive benefit of the people of the Western Province.19\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 40.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent, \"through its instrumentalities and entities for which it is responsible, has mounted a concerted campaign against the Claimant and its investments, culminating in the cancellation of the Claimant's shares in OTML.\"20\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 24.\n\n40.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant claims that the enactment of the Tenth Supplemental Act amounts to a breach of the prohibition against unlawful expropriation,21 and the Respondent has not yet made \"any proposal to compensate the Claimant adequately in respect of the effects of the Tenth Supplemental Act.\"22 The Claimant further claims that the conduct of the Respondent has amounted to violations of other guarantees and standards of treatment that must be accorded by the Respondent to foreign investors, including: (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard; (ii) guarantee of free repatriation of returns on investments; (iii) specific undertakings given to the Claimant (*i.e*., the umbrella clause); (iv) the full protection and security standard; (v) the rule against arbitrary, discriminatory or unreasonable measures; (vi) national treatment guarantee; and (vii) the rule of free entry and sojourn of personnel.23\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 54.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 38.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 55.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant argues that each of the jurisdictional requirements set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is satisfied in this case.24 In particular, the Claimant argues that the \"consent in writing\" requirement of Article 25 \"was satisfied\"25 because:\n\na. \"[e]ither on its own, or when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA, Section 39 of the IPA constitutes a standing offer by the Respondent to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID;\"26 and\n\nb. the Claimant \"has already accepted the standing offer made by the Respondent in Section 39 of the IPA (and Section 2 of the IDCA) to refer the dispute that has arisen out of the Claimant's investments to the jurisdiction of ICSID.\"27\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at paras. 61, *et seq*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 69.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 67.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 68. *See also* Letter to the Prime Minister of PNG from the Chairman of the Claimant (26 September 2013), **Exhibit CE-15**.\n\n**III. KEY LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n*A. ICSID Convention*\n---------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention that are at issue at this stage of the present case are set forth below.\n\n43.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention reads:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n44.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant parts:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) 'National of another Contracting State' means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n(3)...\n\n(4) Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Secretary-General shall forthwith transmit such notification to all Contracting States.\n\nSuch notification shall not constitute the consent required by paragraph (1).\n\n*B. Relevant Provisions of the PNG Law*\n---------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the PNG law that are at issue at the present stage of this case are summarized below.\n\n46.\n\n**Article 39 of the IPA** reads:\n\n39. INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES.\n\n*The Investment Disputes Convention Act 1978*, implementing the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, applies, according to its terms, to disputes arising out of foreign investment.\n\n47.\n\n**Article 2 of the IDCA** reads:\n\n2. CLASSES OF DISPUTES WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE CENTRE.\n\nA dispute shall not be referred to the Centre unless the dispute is fundamental to the investment itself.\n\n48.\n\n**Article 37(1) of the IPA** reads:\n\n37. INVESTMENT GUARANTEES.\n\n(1) The provisions of this section shall apply to a foreign investor except where treatment more favourable to the foreign investor is accorded under any bilateral or multilateral agreement to which the State is a party.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*A. The Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn its Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent advances a number of arguments as to why this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide the Parties' dispute. These objections have three principal themes: (a) the Respondent has not given its consent in writing to refer the dispute to ICSID; (b) the Claimant does not satisfy the requirements of a \"foreign investor\" and a \"foreign investment\" within the meaning of the IPA and the ICSID Convention (the objections under (a) and (b) together \"**Article 25(1) Objections**\")28; and (c) Article 37 of the IPA is not an MFN clause, and therefore the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction in respect of the claims and reliefs as set out in paragraphs 73(ii) to 73(x) of the Claimant's Request for Arbitration (the \"**MFN Objection**\").29\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Objections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 2-3.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 5.\n\n50.\n\nWith regard to the Article 25(1) Objections, the Respondent states that \"[a]s *each* of these gateway elements in Article 25(1) must exist to trigger ICSID's jurisdiction, the establishment of *any* of those grounds would *per se* be sufficient to bring these proceedings to an end.\"30\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 4.\n\n1. The State Has Not Consented to Submit to ICSID Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's case on consent as set out in paragraphs 6768 of the Request for Arbitration.31 The Respondent argues that:\n\na. \"whether under PNG or international law (both of which are relevant, given the hybrid' nature of the provisions, which are rooted in the national legal order, but have effects extending out on to the international plane), it is clear that neither Section 39 nor Section 2 provides the 'consent in writing' necessary for ICSID's jurisdiction over the matter;\"32 and\n\nb. \"regardless of whether a literal, contextual or purposive interpretation is taken of Section 39 and Section 2, no 'consent in writing' necessary for ICSID's jurisdiction over the matter may be construed from either Section 39 or Section 2.\"33\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant states that:  \n**Either on its own, or when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA,****Section 39 of the IPA constitutes a standing offer by the [State] to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID**. There is nothing in either provision to posit (or even *suggest*) any condition to the [State's] consent to ICSID arbitration, and certainly not any requirement that a separate *ad hoc* agreement to arbitrate be entered into with the investor. Notably, neither [provision] contains any equivalent of the words 'if it so provides' that caused the ICSID tribunals in *Conoco Phillips v Venezuela* and *Cemex v Venezuela* to find that Article 22 of the Venezuelan *Investment Law* did not constitute a standing offer to arbitrate. The Claimant's case is more akin to that which led the ICSID tribunal in *SPP v Egypt* to make a positive finding on jurisdiction. Indeed, from a mere comparison in the IPA and the IDCA, it is plain that the Claimant's case on jurisdiction is markedly *stronger* than that which was successfully made by the claimant in SPP. The Claimant has already accepted the standing offer made by the [State] in Section 39 of the IPA (and Section 2 of the IDCA) to refer the dispute that has arisen out of the Claimant's investments to the jurisdiction of ICSID. Request for Arbitration, at paras. 67-68 (emphasis added).\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 23.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 24.\n\na) Textual (or literal) interpretation of Section 39 and Section 2\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\n***First***, the Respondent contends that the text of Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA \"leave no doubt that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration.\"34 According to the Respondent, a literal interpretation of the IPA and IDCA is warranted under both PNG law and international law, and requires the Tribunal \"to look at the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words,\" unless that analysis leads to \"absurdity, or any repugnance or inconsistency\" (PNG law), or where the text is not clear (international law).35\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at Heading (i) on p. 9.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 28.\n\n53.\n\nTurning to ***the text of Section 39 of the IPA***, the Respondent argues that the provision simply refers to the IDCA and \"confirms that the IDCA continues to apply as it stood, '*according to its terms* '.\"36 According to the Respondent:\n\nFrom the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used in Section 39, it seeks to confirm the State's intention to abide by the IDCA which applies '*according to its terms* ', hence clarifying that the IDCA extends to '*disputes arising out of foreign investment* '. The wording of Section 39 is clear, and it does not create any new obligations for the State. This reading does not give rise to any absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency, and should therefore be strictly adhered to.37\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 29. (citing Dolzer Report at paras. 61-63).\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 29.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent then draws a parallel with Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment law and observes that at least 6 awards rendered by ICSID tribunals (the \"Venezuela Cases\"38) have \"unanimously found\" that this provision of assertedly similar national investment legislation contained no consent in writing.39 According to the Respondent, Section 39 \"presents an even less compelling case of '*consent in writing* '\" than the Venezuelan Investment law provision, because \"it does not directly refer to the ICSID Convention (it refers only to the IDCA) and contains no mandatory language (c.f. '*shall be submitted to international arbitration*' in Art 22 Venezuelan Law).\"40\n\n*Brandes Investment Partners, LP v.

Venezuela*, at paras. 110-112, **Exhibit CA-2)**.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 39.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal's finding of consent must be guided by the principles that a State's consent in writing must be \"' ***clear and unambiguous***' in order to confer jurisdiction on an international tribunal\" and \"a state's unilateral assumption of obligations is '*not lightly to be presumed* ', especially considering that a sovereign state by consenting to arbitration under ICSID is submitting itself to an external adjudicative body.\"47 The Respondent concludes that there is no consent to arbitrate on a literal interpretation of the text of Section 39.48\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 41.\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 42.\n\n57.\n\nTurning to ***the text of Section 2 of the IDCA***, the Respondent submits that \"[n]othing in the text of Section 2 compels the State to submit investment disputes (which the investors wish to so refer) to ICSID arbitration;\" to the contrary, Section 2 is assertedly phrased in \"purely negative terms\" and \"contains the *opposite* of an offer to arbitrate,\" because \"it precludes the option of arbitration for disputes which are not '*fundamental to the investment* '.\"49\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 43. The Respondent adds that \"[a]s far as disputes fundamental to the investment are concerned, Section 2 is *silent*, and neither grants nor denies the option to arbitrate under ICSID.\" Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 43.\n\n58.\n\nQuoting from the transcript of the 10 October 2014 hearing on the Respondent's Rule 41(5) Application, the Respondent notes that the Claimant \"itself '*readily acknowledges*' that '*neither the IDCA generally nor Section 2 specifically, constitutes consent of the [State] per se* ',\" and that the Claimant acknowledged that it did not suggest that \"*the IDCA**somehow represents the consent that is necessary*\"50 According to the Respondent, it follows from those statements that \"**the Claimant is left to argue that Section 39** ***on its own*** **represented the necessary** ***'consent*** **to ICSID arbitration**.\"51\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 44.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 44.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent argues that reading the PNG's consent into Section 39 \"would lead to absurd results,\" including: (i) the Respondent being held to have effectively \"extend[ed] an offer to arbitrate under ICSID, even to investors who are ineligible under the ICSID Convention,\" which the Respondent \"could not... have intended;\"52 (ii) inconsistency with the limitations on ICSID jurisdiction set forth in the Japan-PNG BIT;53 and (iii) \"[i]nsofar as the Claimant has had to rely on '*according to its terms'* in Section 39 to circumscribe the availability of arbitration under the ICSID Convention to Contracting States to the ICSID Convention (to seek to 'cure' the absurdity that would otherwise result from its construction of Section 39), such resort only served to illustrate the limiting effect of those words, which must similarly apply to the requirement of consent under Article 25(1) (which is absent in Section 39).\"54\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 45(a).\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 45(b).\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 45(c).\n\nb) Contextual interpretation of Section 39 and Section 2\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent argues that the context of Section 39 and Section 2 confirm that the Respondent has not consented to ICSID arbitration.55\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at Heading (ii) on p. 17, paras. 47, *et seq*.\n\n61.\n\nFor ***Section 39 of the IPA***, the Respondent contends that \"the scheme of the IPA and location of Section 39 within it\" show that there is no consent to ICSID arbitration by the Respondent.56 The contextual elements relied upon by the Respondent include:\n\na. The IPA's purposes listed in Section 1, Part 1 of the IPA - which do not include creation of new jurisdictional rights for foreign investors.\n\nb. Unlike Sections 37 and 38 of the IPA, which use the word \"***shall***\" to indicate \"the creation of new rights for foreign investors,\"57 \"[s]uch wording is noticeably absent in Section 39;\" rather, the wording of Section 39 indicates that \"no additional right, *e.g*., consent to arbitration, was conferred by way of Section 39.\"58\n\nc. The provisions of the Respondent's BITs concluded prior to and around the time the IPA was enacted59 contain language that stands \"in stark contrast with the wording of Section 39\"60 and \"clearly and unequivocally contain[] '*consent in writing*' to ICSID arbitration;\"61 these provisions show that the Respondent \"clearly knows how to express its consent (if any) clearly and unambiguously.\"62 This was not done in the IPA - which assertedly indicates that the \"consent in writing\" was \"*deliberately* not provided.\"63\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 47.\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 48-51.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 52.\n\nThe Respondent cites to the UK-PNG BIT, the PNG-PRC BIT and the Japan-PNG BIT. *See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 53-54.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 55.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 53.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 56.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 56.\n\n62.\n\nFor ***Section 2 of the IDCA***, the Respondent contends that the \"scheme of the IDCA\" similarly confirms that Section 2 did not contain the Respondent's \"consent in writing.\"64 The Respondent relies on the following arguments:\n\na. The IDCA's title indicates that the Act \"was meant simply '*to implement the [ICSID**Convention]* ',\" which Convention in turn requires the \"consent in writing\" under its Article 25(1).65\n\nb. The definition of the term \"disputes\" used in Section 2 also supposedly shows that Section 2 \"remains *subject* to the '*consent in writing*' requirement in Article 25(1).\"66\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 57 *et seq*.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 58.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 59.\n\nc) Purposive interpretation of Section 39 and Section 2\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\n***Third***, the Respondent argues that the purposive interpretation of Section 39 and Section 2 confirms that the Respondent has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction.67\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 60.\n\n64.\n\nFor the IPA, the Respondent relies on the following arguments:\n\na. The purposes of the IPA set forth in the Act do not include creation of \"new jurisdictional rights for 'foreign investors', beyond that available under the IDCA.\"68\n\nb. The Hansard for the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991 (the \"IPA Bill Hansard\") is \"silent on any intention to accord new jurisdictional rights in respect of ICSID arbitration to foreign investors\" under the IPA.69\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 61-62.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 63. *See also* Second Reading of the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991, at pp. 45-46, **Exhibit RE-16** ; Griffin Report, at para. 39.\n\n65.\n\nFor the IDCA, the Respondent states that its purpose \"is to give effect to the ICSID Convention in the domestic legal order of the State,\"70 and relies on:\n\na. the record of the Second Reading of the IDCA Bill 1978;71\n\nb. the Respondent's notification filed on 14 September 1978 (the \"1978 Notification\") informing ICSID and Contracting Parties that the Respondent \"wished to exclude certain types of disputes from ICSID's jurisdiction\" and stating that PNG \"will only consider submitting those disputes to the Centre which are fundamental to the investment itself;\"72 in this regard, the Respondent maintains that the 1978 Notification \"did not contain any consent to arbitrate any class of dispute;\"73 and\n\nc. the function of Section 2 - *i.e*., to serve \"as a reflection of the 1978 Notification on the domestic plane,\" which implies that Section 2 \"cannot be construed as itself providing any such consent.\"74\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 64.\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 64. The Respondent quotes the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Ebia Olewale, from the record of the Second Reading, which, in the relevant part, read: \"*Papua New**Guinea requires that [ICSID]* ***may*** ***have jurisdiction only over those disputes which are fundamental to the investment itself....

Section 2, which is subject to Article 25(1), clearly requires a further '*consent in writing* ', and does not constitute consent *per se* - this is readily conceded by the Claimant... ;\n\nb. Section 39, which merely states that the IDCA '*applies, according to its terms* ', refers back to the IDCA, and is therefore also subject to the same requirement;\n\nc. While the phrase '*according to its terms*' is akin to '*according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides*' in Art 22 Venezuelan Law (which has been found not to constitute consent), Section 39 presents an even less compelling case for '*consent*' as Section 39 does not contain any mandatory language and does not directly refer to the ICSID Convention (as opposed to the IDCA);\n\nd. Section 39 cannot be compared with Art 8 Egypt Law, which contained mandatory and hierarchic sequence of dispute settlement procedures and express reference to arbitration under ICSID, all of which are absent in Section 39 (in any event, the reasoning in *SPP v Egypt* is less persuasive than the reasoning in the Venezuelan cases interpreting Art 22 Venezuelan Law, and not consonant with current construction of international obligations);\n\ne. The context and purpose of Section 39 (and Section 2) support the literal interpretation that Section 39 cannot constitute consent to arbitrate under ICSID;\n\nf. Section 39 (whether on its own, or when read in conjunction with Section 2) therefore does *not* constitute a standing offer by the State to arbitrate disputes before ICSID; and\n\ng. There was therefore no '*standing offer*' for the Claimant to accept.75\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 70.\n\n2. The Claimant Is Not a Private Investor That Can Avail Itself of ICSID Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe second argument put forward by the Respondent is that, even if the Claimant overcomes the \"consent in writing\" hurdle, the Claimant has failed \"to show that it is a *foreign investor* protected under the ICSID Convention,\" and that \"there is a dispute arising out of a *foreign investment* both under the IPA and the ICSID Convention.\"76\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 71-72.\n\na) The Claimant is not a \"foreign investor\" and its assets are not \"foreign investment(s)\" as defined in the IPA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, whether on literal or purposive interpretation of the definitions of \"foreign investor\" and \"foreign investment\" in Section 3 of the IPA, the Claimant and its assets \"clearly fall outside\" these definitions.77 Because the Claimant has not given any consideration78 for the shares in OTML received from BHP, the Claimant neither \"' *ma[d]e or propose[d] to make an investment'*\" in PNG, nor '*stimulated*' foreign investment into PNG, \"*via* its receipt of the Gifted Shares (which were gifted to it to be held and used solely for the benefit of the People [of PNG]).\"79\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 74-76.\n\nThe Respondent relies on Mr. Griffin QC's report to support this argument. *See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 77; Griffin Report, at paras. 80-83.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 76.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the issuance of certificates to the Claimant under the PNG Companies Act and Section 25 of the IPA does not address \"the issue of whether the Claimant is a '*foreign investor*' or has made any '*foreign investmen* t' in PNG.\"80 According to Mr. Griffin QC, these certificates alone \"*are not conclusive evidence... as to the Claimant's (or any other entity's) status as a 'foreign investor' under the 1992 IPA*.\"81\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 78.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 78 (quoting from Griffin Report, at para. 87).\n\nb) The Claimant is not a private foreign investor under the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) There is no \"investment\" under Article 25(1)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\n***First***, the Respondent contends that because the transfer of the Gifted Shares to the Claimant was made for \"zero consideration,\" there is no \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.82\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 79.\n\n71.\n\nRelying on the *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* test for finding an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1)83 and citing to *Caratube v. Kazakhstan*,84 the Respondent submits that the Gifted Shares \"clearly do not qualify as '*investments'*\" under Article 25(1). The Respondent points out that the Claimant's role \"was *not* that of an investor making contribution, undertaking risks and reaping profits, but as '***a trust company***' / '***a pure development agency and funds manager***' of the Gifted Shares and the dividends flowing therefrom,\" and its only mission was to ensure that the latter are \"spent wisely on sustainable development of PNG, in particular the Western Province, for the benefit of the People, and without any benefit to itself / its members or any foreign persons / entities.\"85\n\n*See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at paras. 80, 83 (citing *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, **Exhibit RL-51**).\n\nThe Respondent relies on the decision in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* for the proposition that \"ICSID tribunals have... viewed with suspicion purported '*investments*' which involve no or nominal monetary consideration.\" Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 84 (citing *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

The Respondent namely criticizes the majority decision in *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s**v. Ukraine* for unduly applying the criterion of the place of incorporation.

The Respondent further distinguishes this case from the *Tokios* decision *. See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 101.\n\n76.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in this case the Tribunal should \"take into account the indicia of factors which show, without a doubt, that the Claimant, is in truth and substance, a PNG entity.\"90 Among these factors, the Respondent cites:\n\na. the creation of the Claimant through a PNG legislation (the Ninth Supplemental Act) for the purpose of promoting sustainable development and advancing the welfare of the PNG People;\n\nb. the Claimant's income and property that are capable of being applied \"solely for the promotion\" of the Claimant's objects set forth in the M&A\n\nc. the requirement that, upon winding up, the Claimant's assets \"be given or transferred to another institution of a charitable or public character\" with similar objects;\n\nd. incorporation of the Claimant in Singapore \"to obtain tax benefits;\" and\n\ne. the Claimant's \"self-identity\" which is \"clearly Papua New Guinean.\"91\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 97.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 99.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that finding jurisdiction in this case \"would be tantamount to allowing (what is in substance) a *Papua New Guinean national* to pursue international arbitration against its own government.\"92\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 100.\n\n(3) The Claimant discharges an essentially public function and is not a private investor\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\n***Third***, the Respondent argues that the Claimant is not \"a *private* investor who is entitled to have recourse under the ICSID Convention.\"93\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 102.\n\n79.\n\nThe Respondent cites Professor Dolzer's Report and maintains that the requirement of \"private\" foreign investor \"is alluded to in the ICSID Convention\" and \"stems from the basic purpose of the investment arbitration regime.\"94 In particular, Professor Dolzer opines that \"an ICSID Tribunal will have to decline jurisdiction in case it finds that two parties assimilated with a State, are before it, which seek to resolve a dispute.\"95\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 103.\n\nDolzer Report, at para. 113. *See also* Dolzer Report, at paras. 110-112; Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 103.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent then relies on the \"***Broches test***\" for the proposition that wholly or partially state-controlled companies may participate in ICSID arbitrations, unless they are \"acting as an agent for the government or discharging an essentially governmental function.\"96\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 104.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the background to the Claimant's incorporation, its objectives and functions \"clearly suggests that is it not '*private*' in nature, but discharges '*an essentially governmental function* ',\"97 because it is \"***not motivated by profit in the ordinary sense of a pure commercial entity would be***\" and it is a \"***trustee-style not-for-profit company, holding the Gifted Shares on behalf of the People***.\"98\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 105.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 105.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent further relies on Professor Dolzer's opinion that:\n\nLooking at all the[] features of the Claimant in conjunction, it is my view that the predominant conceptual characteristics are those which point in the direction of a public, and not as a private company. The legal framework adopted by Papua New Guinea and the M&A of the Claimant place it outside of the circle of entities covered by the ICSID Convention.99\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 106 (citing Dolzer Report, at para. 135). *See also* Dolzer Report, at paras. 123135.\n\n3. The MFN Objection: Section 37(1) of the IPA Is Not an MFN Clause\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"decline jurisdiction for various claims/reliefs which are predicated on the Claimant's unsustainable argument that Section 37(1) of the IPA is a Most-Favoured-Nation ('MFN') clause.\"100\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 5.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if the Article 25(1) requirements of the ICSID Convention were satisfied, the Tribunal's jurisdiction \"would in any event be confined to the claims arising under the IPA... as Section 37(1) of the IPA (\"**Section 37(1)**\") is *not* an MFN Clause that would allow the Claimant (the putative investor) to benefit from more favourable treatment available in the Listed BITs.\"101\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 108.\n\n85.\n\n***First***, the Respondent maintains that:\n\nSection 37(1) simply states that '*a foreign investor*' shall be entitled to the benefits set out under Sections 37(2) and 37(5) of the IPA, unless 'the foreign investor' - *i.e.,* the same foreign investor - is accorded more favourable treatment under any other bilateral or multilateral agreement to which the State is a party, in which case, the more favourable treatment will prevail over the rights under the IPA.102\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 109.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Section 37(1) does not have \"the typical construct of an MFN clause,\" which \"'extends the better treatment granted to a ***third State or its nationals******'*** to the beneficiary state in question.\"103 The Respondent adds that the \"basic premise\" of an MFN clause is that the granting State undertakes to \"treat investors (within a certain sphere) equally\" and hence agrees to grant those rights or treatment to \"all investors that are entitled to such MFN treatment.\"104 And to create such obligations, the language of the MFN provisions must be \"clear and unequivocal as to the obligations that are to be created.\"105 The Respondent concludes that, because Section 37(1) does not even refer to any \"third state,\" it is not an MFN clause.106\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 110.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 110.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 110.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 111.\n\n87.\n\n***Second***, the Respondent relies on Commentary to Article 4 of the ILC's Draft Articles on Most-Favoured-Nation Clauses in support for its proposition that \"MFN clauses involve the giving of inter-State undertakings, which are typically synallagmatic.\"107 The Respondent notes that Section 37(1) would make \"a most exceptional\" MFN clause because it is \"a unilateral domestic legislative provision addressing (not States, but) foreign investors.\"108\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 112.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 113.\n\n88.\n\n***Third***, the Respondent argues that, if Section 37(1) were to be compared with the MFN clauses of the BITs relied upon by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration, it would be obvious that Section 37(1) is not an MFN clause.109 Rather, according to the Respondent, Section 37(1) is more akin to a \"savings\" clause or a \"clause for the preservation of rights.\"110 The Respondent also denies that various domestic legislative provisions cited by the Claimant as purportedly containing MFN provisions are indeed MFN clauses; even if they were, \"it does not follow that the *differently-worded* Section 37(1)\" is an MFN clause.111\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 114 (quoting the language of the MFN clauses of the UK-PNG BIT, PNG-Germany BIT, Australia-PNG BIT and China-PNG BIT, all of which contain the words \"any third State.\") *See* Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 114(a)-(d). *See* UK-PNG BIT, at Art. 3 Exhibit CL-9;

and\n\nf. order such other and further relief as may be deemed just and appropriate in the circumstances.112\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 119.\n\n*B. The Claimant's Response on Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant argues that \"this case is about intent - an essential element no matter what interpretive methodology is applied by the Tribunal,\"113*i.e*., intent of the Respondent behind its national investment legislation.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 1.\n\n91.\n\nAlthough the Claimant has presented its arguments on jurisdiction in a different sequence from the Respondent, the Tribunal summarizes the Claimant's arguments in the order of the Respondent's objections, for clarity and ease of reading.\n\n1. Consent\n----------\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant states that this case is \"now about the meaning of five words: '*applies, according to its terms* '.\"114 The Claimant first sets out what it calls the applicable \"interpretive regimes,\" before analyzing Section 39 in light of these principles of interpretation.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 126.\n\na) Interpretive Regimes - the Options\n-------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Parties are in agreement that Section 39 \"is a unilateral declaration, and that some mix of national and international law governs its interpretation.\"115 However, the Claimant criticizes the Respondent's approach to interpretation, stating that it is \"neither correct nor appropriate as a matter of international law.\"116\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 130.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 132.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant instead argues that the correct approach to the interpretation of Section 39 is that adopted in *SPP v. Egypt* (including the *effet utile* principle).117 It then goes on to state that, even if the Tribunal does not follow *SPP v. Egypt*, on any view, a \"quasi-Vienna\" approach is warranted for interpretation of unilateral declarations of the State (which enables to bring in additional interpretive factors, including \"good faith, the object and purpose of the declaration, the wider circumstances in which the declaration was made, and any subsequent conduct by the State that may indicate the meaning of the text of the declaration\").118\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 132-134.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 135-136. The Claimant notes that \"by asking the Tribunal to prefer the ILC Guiding Principles over *SPP*, the State does itself a net harm: while it may avoid *effet utile*, it places its declaration in an interpretive matrix in which good faith and intent are of paramount importance, and subsequent practice is also given a high value.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 137.\n\n(1) The *SPP* approach\n----------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant discusses the *SPP v. Egypt* decision, and, *inter alia* :\n\na. quotes the key interpretive principle from paragraph 63 of this decision, as follows:\n\njurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if - but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favour of it is preponderant.119\n\nb. notes the *SPP* tribunal's literal analysis of Article 8 of the Egypt Law,120 including the mandatory character of the word \"*shall*\" in that provision and the \"sequence of dispute settlement procedures\" in that provision \"impl[ying] a hierarchy of schemes, such that a procedure could only be resorted to where those methods higher in the hierarchy were not available;\"121\n\nc. notes the *SPP* tribunal's articulation of the *effet utile* principle: \"a legal text should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and meaning can be attributed to every word in the text;\"122\n\nd. emphasizes the *SPP* tribunal's interpretation of the words \"*where it* [*i.e*., the ICSID Convention] *applies*\" as referring to the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and its conclusion that the \"consent required under Article 25 of the Convention was generated by the wording of Article 8 itself;\" the Claimant notes that Section 39 of the IPA \"works the same way;\"123\n\ne. discusses the *SPP* tribunal's analysis of legislative history of the Egyptian Investment Law, noting that the evidence presented by Egypt in that case was, as in this case, minimal, and that the tribunal refused to draw inferences from \"what was *not* said\" in the legislative history;124\n\nf. points out the importance that the *SPP* tribunal attached to the \"intention of the Egyptian government\" at the time the investment law was enacted, including the government's policy aimed at attracting investment and the conclusion of subsequent BITs;125 and\n\ng. observes that the *SPP* tribunal \"took note of official investment promotion literature\" when interpreting the national investment legislation, and held that the State's pronouncements \"*confirm[ed] the conclusion already reached by the Tribunal... that Article 8 does not require a further ad hoc expression of consent to establish the jurisdiction*' of ICSID.\"126\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v.

Venezuela* and *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, the tribunals declared that they would \"abandon any application of domestic principles of statutory interpretation and treat Article 22 as a unilateral declaration under international law,\"133 whereas the tribunals in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* and *Brandes v. Venezuela* departed from this approach in that they took into account both the national legal order - in which the national legislative act is \"rooted\" - and the principles of international law;134\n\nc. hence, it is not \"generally accepted\" that the ICJ jurisprudence on interpretation of unilateral declarations under Article 36(2) of its Statute applies *ipso facto* to the interpretation of legislation for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, nor that \"*effet utile* is inapplicable when the interpretive exercise is conducted this way....\"135\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 151-152.\n\nArticle 22 of the Venezuelan Decree with Force of Law No. 356 on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 3 October 1999 read: \"Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion or protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provision of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, ***if it so provides***, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\" *Mobil v.

Venezuela*, at para. 86, **Exhibit RL-52**, and *Brandes v. Venezuela*, at para. 36, **Exhibit CA-40**). The Claimant also cites *Zhinvali v. Georgia* for a similar proposition. *See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 156 (citing *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case No ARB/00/1, Award, 24 January 2003 (\"*Zhinvali v. Georgia*\"), **Exhibit CA-41**).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 157.\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal has a choice between \"a purely internationalist (ICJ) methodology, or a hybrid methodology that takes into account the fact that [Section 39] is rooted in the domestic legal order of the State.\"136 According to the Claimant, the latter is \"clearly preferable\" because national legislation \"ought not be considered as a purely international gesture,\" but requires \"at least s *ome* consideration of domestic rules of interpretation, provided they do not conflict with interpretive principles of international law.\"137 The Claimant concludes that common canons of statutory construction - such as *effet utile* - must therefore be taken into account.138\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 158.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 159.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 161.\n\n(3) The public international law approach\n-----------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant then discusses the international law principles applicable to the interpretation of the scope of unilateral declarations and its two main sources - *i.e.*, the ICJ jurisprudence and the ILC Guiding Principles.139 In particular, the Claimant notes that the \"analogical application of [Article 31 of] the Vienna Convention to unilateral declarations\" has been recognized in several decisions of the ICJ (*e.g*., the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* decision, in which the ICJ \"described a system whereby the ordinary rules of treaty interpretation apply *mutatis mutandis* to unilateral declarations\"140); despite this, the Claimant argues, the Respondent does not address this issue.141\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 163-188.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 170.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 168-170.\n\n100.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the differences between application of Article 31 to a treaty provision and application of \"its adapted variant to a unilateral act\" stem from the focus on the \"subjective intention of the declarant as *sole author*, as reflected in the text of the declaration itself.\"142 With the application of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention come other additional factors to be taken into account in the process of interpretation, including \"interpretation in good faith, the context of the initial agreement, subsequent agreement, *subsequent* practice, and other relevant rules of international law.\"143 The Claimant contends in particular that *subsequent practice* \"may readily be seen to give insight into what a State actually intended, and what it thought the legal effect of its action was, at the time at which the relevant declaration was made.\"144\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 172.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 173. The Claimant states that, \"[w]hen the Vienna Convention is applied by analogy to unilateral declarations, the result is a complex act of interpretation,\" and quotes from the ICJ *Fisheries Jurisdiction* decision: \"... The intention of a... State may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an examination of the evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 174 (quoting *Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v. Canada)*, at p. 454, **Exhibit CA-37**).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 176. *See also* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 177.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the restrictive presumption that governs the interpretation of a State's unilateral declarations under international law (including as set out in ILC Guiding Principle 7) should not apply where the State's \"unilateral acts are formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty, such as the ICSID Convention.\"145 On this issue, the Claimant disagrees with Professor Dolzer's \"*restrictive approach*\" requiring that consent be \"***clear and unambiguous***,\"146 and rejects ILC Guiding Principle 7 as a plausible rule of interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA.147\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 178-182 (quoting *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at paras. 87-90, **Exhibit RL-4**).\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 183 (discussing Dolzer Report, at paras. 25-27). The Claimant quotes from paragraph 27 of Professor Dolzer's Report, which reads: \"[W]hile a long line of decisions has assumed that such declarations have to be interpreted neither restrictively, nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, following a ruling in *SPP v. Egyp* t, it will be noted that recent jurisprudence has required that consent must be ***clear and unambiguous***, thus effectively adopting what amounts to a *restrictive approach*.\" Dolzer Report, at para. 27.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 184.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that, if the Tribunal decides to treat Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA as unilateral declarations under international law, \"the applicable law is that adopted by the ICJ with respect to unilateral acts in connection with treaty frameworks,\" and the appropriate interpretive methodology is \"to adapt Article 31 of the Vienna Convention for use in the context of a single declarant.\"148\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 186.\n\n103.\n\nBy way of summary, the Claimant synthesizes the two possible interpretive options available to the Tribunal under international law,149 contending that both approaches are similar and that the \"delta\" between them is \"narrow.\"150 The Claimant states that:\n\n[O]ption one is the ICSID-specific, neutral (neither expansive nor restrictive) approach developed in *SPP* and followed in certain of the Venezuela cases; option two is the method applied by the ICJ in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case..., which is 'Vienna by analogy' -that is, to interpret IPA Section 39 by analogy with VCLT Article 31, tailored to reflect the fact that the State is the sole author of the instrument in question (rather than a co-author of a treaty), without bringing to bear any particular interpretive presumption and with a particular focus on the intent of the State, good faith and subsequent State practice.151\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 187.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 188. The Claimant notes that the common requirements under both interpretive schemes include: \"*both* require that first the words of the declaration be read in a natural and reasonable way; *both* require that due regard be paid to the intention of the State that made the declaration; *both* require that the declaration be interpreted in good faith; *both* require that regard be had to the context of the declaration; and *both* allow for the subsequent practice of declarant State to be taken into account.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 188.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 187.\n\n104.\n\nIn sum, according to the Claimant, the choice for the Tribunal is between an ICSID-specific method developed by *SPP* and succeeding authorities, on the one hand, and a method developed by the ICJ in the State-to-State context, on the other hand.152\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 188.\n\n(4) The role of national law\n----------------------------\n\n105.\n\nOn the issue of what role the national law should play in interpretation, the Claimant submits that \"the application of national law is subject to the ultimate control of international law.\"153\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 190.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant argues that PNG statutory interpretation principles are \"essentially English\" and \"the sources of the underlying law of the State include English common law as it was immediately before the date on which PNG became independent.\"154 The Claimant further contends that PNG law bears \"little\" differences from the general principles of statutory interpretation under international law,155 and highlights the following rules of interpretation:\n\na. headings can be taken into account under PNG law, as confirmed by Mr Griffin QC in his Report;156 the Claimant notes that the heading of Section 39 reads \"*International**Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*,\" and that \"this is the State identifying the body to which it is prepared to submit disputes, in a law that implements (and has annexed to it) the Convention under which that body operates;\"157\n\nb. PNG law contains an equivalent of *effet utile*, resulting from Section 190(4) of the PNG Constitution (which requires that \"statutory provisions be given a '*fair, large and liberal*' construction and interpretation\"158), supplemented by a well-established principle of common law that \"a PNG court is not at liberty to consider any word or sentence of a statute to be superfluous or insignificant; in other words, the rule is that every provision of a written law has useful work to do;\"159\n\nc. when interpreting PNG statutes, a court \"must also have adequate regard to the social purpose and development goals of particular legislation;\"160 and\n\nd. when interpreting PNG law, a court \"must consider which of the competing interpretations will result in the dispensation of justice.\"161\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 192 (citing to Griffin Report, at paras. 20-21).\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 191, 193.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 193; Griffin Report, at para. 47.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 193.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 194.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 194. *See also* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 195-196.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 197.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 199.\n\nb) Interpreting Section 39 of the IPA\n-------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant then addresses the interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA, stating that the \"core interpretive task\" for the Tribunal is \"to ascertain the meaning and effect of the words '*applies, according to its terms* '.\"162 The Claimant refers to the conclusion in Webb Report that \"when IPA Section 39 is construed in accordance with PNG rules of statutory interpretation, it is an offer to arbitrate,\"163 and turns to the analysis under the *SPP* and \"quasi-Vienna\" approaches.164\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 200.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 202. *See also* Webb Report, at para. 62.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 203 *et seq*.\n\n(1) Applying the *SPP* approach\n-------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nReferring to the *SPP* principle that \"jurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith,\"165 the Claimant argues that:\n\n\"[I]nterpreted objectively and in good faith, Section 39 of the IPA is, at its most basic level, a deliberate statement by the State that disputes arising out of foreign investment are subject to resolution in accordance with the ICSID Convention \"166\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 203 (quoting *SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 63, **Exhibit CA-3)**.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 204.\n\n109.\n\n***First***, the Claimant addresses the meaning of the words \"*applies, according to its terms*,\" arguing that:\n\na. the word \"*applies*\" in Section 39 is \"used to declare the present, practical operation of the IDCA (and the ICSID Convention) to disputes arising out of foreign investment covered by the IPA;\"167\n\nb. the comma separating the words \"*applies*\" and \"*according to its terms*\" indicates their two distinct functions: the word \"*applies*\" has an \"*independent* function - it declares the State's consent,\" whereas the words \"*according to its terms*\" are \"cross-referential and fundamentally concerned with... ensuring that the *scope* of the State's consent is limited according to the terms of IDCA Section 2\" (*i.e*., to disputes that are fundamental to investment itself);168\n\nc. the word \"terms\" encompasses \"all of the articles of the ICSID Convention,\" including Article 25's requirement of consent in writing, which is satisfied by preceding the word \"applies;\"169\n\nd. Section 2 of the IDCA \"comes into equation\" through the words \"*according to its terms*,\" and the heading of that section contains permissive language - \"*may be referred**to the Centre*.\"170\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 207 (citing Webb Report, at para. 53).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 208.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 209.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 210.\n\n110.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the effect of Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA is that the reader understands that \"provided my dispute is fundamental to my investment, I *may* refer it to the Centre.\"171\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 211.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimant criticizes the Respondent's interpretation of Section 39 for:\n\na. \"simply making a factual statement\" and notes, quoting from Webb Report, that that interpretation would mean that \"*[i]t would be a statement that a law that applies, applies*.\"172\n\nb. doing violence to the wording of the provision itself, because \"not only does it introduce a new requirement (*i.e*. the need for a subsequent agreement on ICSID arbitration), but it also changes the provision (particularly the key word '*applies*') from the present imperative to the future conditional (*i.e*. the IDCA *will* apply, according to its terms, but only if the State agrees);\"173\n\nc. giving a \"disproportionate effect\" to the words \"*according to its terms*\" compared to the word \"*applies*,\" the point of difference between the Parties being whether \"the word '*applies*' closes the loop (the State's textual case) or whether it is an end of a line that leads to ICSID Convention (the Claimant's case).\"174\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 212-213. *See also* Webb Report, at para. 43.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 215.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 216.\n\n112.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant considers Section 39 in its context and submits that:\n\na. Section 39 is part of the \"*Investment Guarantees*\" set out in Part V of the IPA and is styled as \"an *operative guarantee* of investment protection;\" the \"right of neutral, international adjudication that IPA Section 39 provides is the means by which the investor can enforce the substantive '*investment guarantees*' given to it under Part V of the Act;\"175\n\nb. the legislative history of the IPA supports the Claimant's case on the intent behind Section 39 of the IPA because it shows that:\n\ni. There was an earlier 1991 version of the IPA setting out the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate that the final text of the IPA (1992) sought to improve and replace.176 In particular, Article 39(1)(a) of the 1991 version of the IPA contained the Respondent's \"standing offer to arbitrate (at ICSID) only disputes that concern the '*interpretation or application*' of the IPA (in other words, 'no dollars' disputes),\" and stated that \"for '*disputes arising out of the activities [of a foreign] enterprise* ', an arbitration agreement is required.\"177 According to the Claimant, because the purpose of the 1992 Act was to \"*improve*\" the 1991 text,178 the current Section 39 shows that the Respondent \"made a conscious decision to broaden the scope of IPA Section 39 and make it more attractive to foreign investors by declaring that the IDCA (and with it the ICSID Convention) *applies* to foreign investment disputes, rather than just disputes about the '*interpretation or application*' of the IPA.\"179\n\nii. \"[T]he IPA was passed with the general intention of promoting PNG as a destination for foreign investment.\"180\n\niii. \"[T]he IPA was drafted with the *specific* intention of satisfying certain conditions that attached to the World Bank's 'Structural Adjustment Loan' to the State.\"181\n\nc. The history of passing of the IPA is \"fundamentally different\" from that at issue in the Venezuelan cases, because PNG has not had any record of hostility to ICSID arbitration and therefore did not need to \"*affirm its commitment to ICSID*\" in passing the IPA.182\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 219.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 223-224(a). The Claimant points out that the Respondent has not produced the 1991 version of the IPA and invites the Tribunal to \"draw an adverse inference\" against the Respondent on the basis of this failure to produce.

The Claimant also argues that \"the 1991 text shows that the State was intending to make an offer of ICSID arbitration in the IPA - on further consideration, the Government realised the offer it made in the 1991 form of the IPA was not good enough to give foreign investors real comfort, and so it took steps to improve the offer in the 1992 revision of the IPA.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 231.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 224(b).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 224(c). *See also* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 225-227.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 235-239.\n\n113.\n\n***Third****,* the Claimant looks at the Respondent's \"*subsequent practice\"* - *i.e.,* \"the investment promotion activities that the State and its agencies have conducted since the declaration was made\" in the IPA, and in particular the official investment promotion literature183 -and claims that it is \"damning.\"184 The Claimant primarily focuses on the statements on the Investment Promotion Authority's website,185 before and after the filing of the Request for Arbitration,186 and on the PNG Embassy to the Americas website,187 and argues that:\n\na. the original version of the website of the Investment Promotion Authority before the filing of the Request for Arbitration188 left \"no doubt in the reader's mind: if you invest in PNG, and a dispute arises in relation to your investment, your dispute *can be**adjudicated at ICSID* ;\"189\n\nb. the modified version of that website after the filing of the Request for Arbitration190 and the publication of the *OPIC Karimun v. Venezuela* decision still does not help the Respondent, and it should be understood as meaning that \"if you invest in PNG, and a dispute arises in relation to your investment, the IPA allows you to start ICSID arbitration against the State.\"191\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 241.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 258.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 242-244.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 244-251; Screenshot of Investment Promotion Authority Website (October 2013), **Exhibit CE-17** and Screenshot of Investment Promotion Authority website (June 2014), **Exhibit CE-18**.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 254-255; Screenshot of Website to PNG Embassy to the Americas (October 2014), **Exhibit CE-21**.\n\n*See* Screenshot of Investment Promotion Authority Website (October 2013), **Exhibit CE-17** (\"Investment disputes can be settled through diplomatic channels or through the use of local remedies before having such matters adjudicated at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes or through another appropriate tribunal of which Papua New Guiena [sic] is a member.\").\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 245.\n\n*See* Screenshot of Investment Promotion Authority Website (June 2014), **Exhibit CE-18** (\"International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

Venezuela*, at para. 14, **Exhibit CA-2**).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 267.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the result of the application of *effet utile* in this case is two-fold:\n\na. \"it triggers the actual application of the ICSID Convention to this dispute;\" and\n\nb. it requires the Tribunal \"to dismiss the State's argument that [Section 39] merely serves to affirm the State's commitment to the ICSID system,\" which has already been affirmed twice - when the Respondent ratified the ICSID Convention, and when the Respondent passed the IDCA, \"which implemented the Convention locally.\"196\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 268.\n\n(2) Applying a quasi-Vienna approach\n------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nTurning to the alternative interpretive approach - *i.e*., interpreting the declaration in Section 39 using Article 31 of the Vienna Convention by analogy197 - the Claimant submits that, under the quasi-Vienna approach:\n\na. the *SPP* analysis also applies to determining the ordinary meaning of the word \"*applies*\";198\n\nb. also allows the Tribunal to take into account the Respondent's subsequent practice, including the websites;199\n\nc. the \"emphasis is placed on the context of the declaration,\" including the 1991 IPA and the purposes of the final 1992 IPA, which context \"*must* inform the interpretation of the IPA Section 39;\"200 this means that the Tribunal \"can use the stated object and purpose of the IPA to confirm the ordinary meaning of the term '*applies* '\" in Section 39, and should be guided by the context in resolving \"any uncertainties that it considers exist in [the IPA's] wording;\"201\n\nd. PNG's BITs relied upon by the Respondent are irrelevant to the extent that they are not \"of similar vintage to IPA,\" and even where they are, they bear \"no evidentiary value\" of the Respondent's subjective intent.202\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 269-272.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 273.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 274.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 275-276.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 277-278.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 279-284.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that, \"even on the quasi-Vienna reading that the State asks the Tribunal to prefer, consent is established.\"203\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 285.\n\nc) Additional principles bearing on the operation of Section 39 of the IPA\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimant invokes two other rules and maxims - *i.e*., *contra venire factum proprium*204 and *contra proferentem*.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 287-293.\n\n120.\n\nConsidering the former, the Claimant argues that in this case the Respondent \"*cannot deny* that the ICSID Convention applies to this dispute, and it *cannot deny* that it has, through its declaration in [Section 39 of the IPA], given (and intended to give) the consent that is necessary for this to occur.\"205 According to the Claimant, it \"relied\" on Section 39 and on being deemed a \"foreign enterprise\" for the purposes of the IPA in making its investment.206\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 292.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 293.\n\n121.\n\nConsidering the latter, the Claimant argues that any doubts whether Section 39 contains the Respondent's consent should be resolved against the State as the drafter of its legislation207 (clarifying that this rule does not apply if the Tribunal selects the quasi-Vienna approach208).\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 294.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 295.\n\n2. \"Investor\" and \"Investment\"\n------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant notes that the Respondent's Objections \"conflate two independent criteria: jurisdiction *rationae personae* and jurisdiction *rationae materiae*.\"209 The Claimant first addresses the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* and the Respondent's assertions relating to the Claimant not being a \"private\" investor and a \"foreign\" investor. The Claimant then addresses the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and the Respondent's assertions that the Claimant has not made an \"investment\" in the PNG.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 21.\n\na) Jurisdiction *ratione personae*\n----------------------------------\n\n(1) \"Private\" investor\n----------------------\n\n123.\n\n***First***, the Claimant submits that there is no \"explicit jurisdictional requirement that investors must be '*private* ', let alone any requirement as to '*private investments* '\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention,210 and there is no legal basis for implying one.211\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 26.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 28-31.\n\n124.\n\nEven if there was such a requirement, the Claimant would \"clearly satisfy\" it, under all three tests - *i.e*., the Broches Test,212 the Structural Test213 and the Functional Test214 - or any combination thereof.215 The Claimant argues that the Claimant \"*is* private\"216 under all three tests, because:\n\na. the Claimant is \"certainly not acting as agent for the government, nor can it be said to be discharging an essentially governmental function;\"217\n\nb. structurally, the Claimant is the \"opposite of a government entity\" because its constitution \"shows a design that was intended to prevent government control, rather than enable it;\"218 and\n\nc. the Claimant cannot be considered a government entity \"from a functional view,\" given that it (a) \"uses the dividend stream received from the operation of the Mine for specified purposes, for the benefit of the people of PNG and of the Western Province in particular,\" and (b) \"performs activities in a commercial capacity\" and the \"vast majority of the Claimant's assets today are managed by fund managers whose instructions are to make profits.\"219\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the \"Broches Test\" provides that \"a company that combines capital from private and government sources and state-controlled corporations may be investors in ICSID arbitrations unless it is 'acting as an agent for the government or discharging an essentially government function'.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 32(a) (citing C.

which \"controls the meaning of the term '*investment*' in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\" - and Section 2 of the IDCA that the \"only condition relating to the State's offer to arbitrate is that... the dispute must be '*fundamental to the investment itself* '.\"248 The Claimant notes that this dispute \"clearly is\" \"fundamental to the investment itself.\"249\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 90.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 90.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant notes that this case \"involves GDP-changing, long-term investments\" relating to the operation of the mine that \"has historically been a critical contributor to [the Respondent's] Treasury and its economic development,\"250 that is \"far removed from... simple sales transactions\" which would not fall within the definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.251\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 92.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 91-92.\n\n138.\n\nThe Claimant further states that the *Phoenix Action* decision cited by the Respondent is irrelevant, and, even if it were relevant, the Claimant's investments would \"match all six of the indicators of an 'investment' identified by the *Phoenix Action* tribunal.\"252 In particular, the Claimant argues that \"the contribution in money or other assets is composed of both BHPB's initial contribution establishing Ok Tedi and the Claimant's subsequent contributions to develop the mine and contribute towards economic development in PNG.\"253 The Claimant claims that it also satisfies the requirement that \"the investment make a contribution to the economic development of the host state\" applied in some decisions, and contends that that requirement \"is not necessarily limited to measureable monetary contributions.\"254\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 95-104. The Claimant identifies the following six elements of the *Phoenix**Action* test: \"(1) a contribution in money or other assets; (2) a certain duration; (3) an element of risk; (4) an operation made in order to develop an economic activity in the host State; (5) assets invested in accordance with the laws of the host State; and (6) assets invested *bona fide*.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 97.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 99.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 105-107.\n\n(3) No \"investment\" because the OTML shares were gifted\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant is not entitled to protection under the IPA or the ICSID Convention because it received the OTML shares as a gift is \"simply not true.\"255 The Claimant submits that \"significant consideration *was* provided by the Claimant to BHPB in exchange for the shares,\"256 including through \"broad indemnities\" provided by the Claimant as \"*consideration*\" for the OTML shares,257 and foregone dividends invested into the buy-back of OTML shares from Inmet Mining Corporation (\"Inmet\") in 2011.258 The Claimant also asserts that sufficient consideration was provided under the law of the State of Victoria (Australia) which governs the Master Agreement.259\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 109.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 110.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 113-115.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 116.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 120.\n\n140.\n\nFurther, the Claimant contends that the case at hand is far removed from *Caratube v.**Kazakhstan* where two of the key factors - *i.e.,* \"a contribution to the claimant company and the assumption of risk\" - were found to be absent,260 and draws a parallel with the *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile* award, in which the tribunal held that \"as long as the share transfer was valid (which it was), that was sufficient to constitute an investment.\"261\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 118.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 119.\n\n141.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that, even if the transfer of OTML shares to the Claimant were considered a \"*gift*,\" the Claimant could still bring an ICSID claim because \"the rights attaching to those shares (including rights under the ICSID Convention) at the time they were transferred passed as a bundle to the transferee,\" the Claimant.262\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 121. *See also* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 122-123 (citing *African Holding Company of America, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Construction au Congo S.A.R.L. v.

MFN Objection\n----------------\n\n142.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's MFN Objection, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to rely on Section 37(1) of the IPA as an MFN clause and that the plain meaning of this clause is that \"the investment guarantees given by the State in the IPA apply to a foreign investor, unless more favourable treatment is accorded under any bilateral investment treaty to which the State is a party.\"263\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 306-307.\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's reading of Section 37(1) and argues that:\n\nThe word '*any*' shows that Section 37(1) cannot have been intended to have the restricted operation the State suggests. The more natural reading, in the Claimant's submission, is that the class of BITs to which Section 37(1) applies is not limited by the nationality of the investor. Rather, Section 37(1) is intended to ensure that IPA-covered investors enjoy the same benefits provided by any BIT the State has signed.264\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 310.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the flaw in the Respondent's reasoning is manifest, as Section 37(1) \"is not an article of a treaty between two states,\" but a unilateral instrument, a \"section of national law to which there is no sovereign counter-party;\" therefore, this provision could not refer to a \"third state.\"265 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's submissions are based on treaty-focused authorities and are therefore \"misconceived.\"266 The Claimant also argues that MFN provisions like Section 37(1) of the IPA are \"not at all unusual\" and cites the examples of Albania, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.267\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at paras. 311-312.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 313.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 315.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that, in its investment promotion literature, the Respondent \"itself has *unequivocally* said that Section 37(1) *is* an MFN clause,\"268 and refers to excerpts from the Investment Promotion Authority website before and after the filing of the Request for Arbitration,269 as well as excerpts from websites of the PNG High Commission in Australia and the PNG Embassy to Americas.270 The Respondent concludes that there is \"no doubt that the State intended to extend MFN treatment to the Claimant through IPA Section 37(1).\"271\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 316.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at paras. 317-318.\n\n*See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 319.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 320.\n\n146.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue a decision under Rule 41(1):\n\na. dismissing the Objection in full;\n\nb. affirming that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this Dispute; and\n\nc. ordering the State to pay the legal costs incurred by the Claimant in relation to the Objection.272\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 322.\n\n*C.

The State has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant has \"maintain[ed] its concession that Section 2 of the IDCA... is '***not... the offer itself*** ',\" and that the Claimant's case on consent \"must therefore rest on Section 39 of the IPA.\"273 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not established that Section 39 of the IPA constitutes the State's \"consent in writing.\"274\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 3.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 4.\n\na) Approach to interpretation\n-----------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's two interpretive approaches articulated in its Response on Jurisdiction do \"not in fact diverge much from the approach\" set forth in Professor Dolzer's Report,275*i.e*.:\n\na. the wording should be considered \"first and foremost,\" as read \"in a ***natural and reasonable*** manner;\"276\n\nb. the \"***intention underlying these provision*** s\" should be considered as \"may be drawn from the text of the provisions, their context and the circumstances of their preparation and the purposes intended to be served;\"277\n\nc. \"[a]ny offer to arbitrate must be ***clearly and unambiguously*** expressed, and ***doubt shall be resolved against the finding of jurisdiction***.\"278\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 8.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 8(a). *See also* Dolzer Report, at paras. 42-43.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 8(b). *See also* Dolzer Report, at paras. 42-43.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 8(c). *See also* Dolzer Report, at paras. 24-26; **Exhibit RL-19**.\n\nb) The text of Section 39 and Section 2 leave no doubt that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) It is clear from the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the text of Section 39 that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates the arguments set forth in its Objections to Jurisdiction and notes in addition that:\n\na. \"the Claimant accepts that Section 39 is subject, in relation to the question of the State's consent, to the terms set out in Section 2 and Article 25(1);\"279\n\nb. the Claimant does not dispute280 and Webb Report accepts that \"Section 39 imports **all** the provisions of the IDCA (including Section 2) and the ICSID Convention (including Article 25(1))... and Section 2 (imported into Section 39) covers **only** disputes within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, **and** which are '*fundamental*' in the required sense;\"281 in its Reply Report, Mr. Griffin QC adds that \"the 'whole of the provisions' of the [ICSID Convention] must include th[e] '*consent in writing*' requirement';\"282\n\nc. the Claimant's reading of the words \"*applies, according to its terms*\" is circular and \"only serves to illustrate the hopelessness of the Claimant's attempt to overcome the clear and unambiguous wording of Section 39\" - *i.e*., \"in relation to the question of the State's consent, the terms of Section 2 and Article 25(1) apply, according to their terms, to '*disputes arising out of foreign investment* ';\"283\n\nd. given that \"it is clear from the grammatical and ordinary meaning\" of the text in Section 39 that the Respondent \"has not provided its '*consent in writing* ',\" the Tribunal \"should be slow to depart from the same;\"284 the plain and ordinary meaning of Section 39 \"does not lead to any absurdity;\"285\n\ne. in response to the Claimant's arguments regarding Professor Dolzer's \"restrictive approach\" requiring that \"any offer to arbitrate must be clearly and unambiguously expressed,\"286 the Respondent claims that these \"do not... assist the Claimant in establishing the neutral [*i.e*., *SPP*] approach as the '*correct approach* ';\"287\n\nf. because the text of Section 39 is \"clear and unambiguous\" and leaves \"no doubt that no standing offer to arbitrate\" was made by the Respondent, it assertedly does not matter in practice whether \"restrictive, expansive or objective interpretation should be adopted.\"288\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 10.\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 12.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 12-13.\n\nGriffin II Report, at para. 20. *See also* Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 14.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 17. *See also* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 16, 18-19.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 22. *See also* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 23-26.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 27.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 28.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 29.

Egypt*, at para. 63, **Exhibit CA-3**).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 30 (citing Dolzer Report, at paras. 66-67).\n\n(2) The headings of Section 2 and Section 39 lend no assistance to the Claimant\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant's reliance on the word \"*may*\" in Section 2's heading is \"a *non sequitur*,\" given the Claimant's concession that Section 2 is \"***not... the offer itself***.\"289 In any event, the word \"may\" without more does not assist the Claimant, because:\n\na. Mr. Webb accepts that the word \"may\" in Section 2 means \"***the State*** may consent\" to ICSID arbitration, and does not say that the \"option lies only with the investor;\"290\n\nb. in interpreting the word \"may,\" the Claimant fails to appreciate that the \"interpretation of any dispute resolution clause depends on the specific wording and context in question;\"291\n\nc. the reliance on the heading of Section 2 also \"adds nothing to the analysis,\" because it \"says nothing (in itself) about the conditions under which the State has agreed to ICSID arbitration.\"292\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 31.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 32.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 33. *See also* Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 34.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 35. The Respondent argues that \"any other interpretation would mean that any signatory to the ICSID Convention (which establishes the Centre) must be taken to have agreed to ICSID arbitration, which is of course incorrect.\" Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 35.\n\n(3) The grammatical and ordinary meaning of Section 39 does not offend the principle of *effet util* e\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent states that, even if *effet utile* did apply (which the Respondent denies293), Section 39 would not be \"*a provision without content*.\"294 The Respondent reiterates that such provisions \"serve meaningful purposes,\"295 as explained in Professor Dolzer's Report,296 including that of \"promoting and facilitating foreign investment by reaffirming the State's commitment to the ICSID Convention.\"297\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 37.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 38.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 38.\n\n*See* Dolzer Report, at paras. 47-48.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 39.\n\nc) The context of Section 39 and Section 2 confirm that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimant does not address its argument relating to the mandatory language (\"shall\") in Sections 37 and 38, as distinct from Section 39.298 The Respondent adds that, even if Section 39 were an \"*investment guarantee*\" as the Claimant contends, its scope would be governed by Section 2 and Article 25(1) - *i.e*., \"it guarantees the application of the IDCA (implementing the ICSID Convention), according to its terms, to '*disputes arising out of foreign investment* '.\"299\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 40-41.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 42.\n\nd) The purpose of Section 39 and Section 2 confirm that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(1) Section 39 Draft does not assist in the interpretation of Section 39 and if anything, supports the State's position\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nWith regard to the 1991 IPA relied upon by the Claimant, the Respondent notes that:\n\na. the 1991 bill was \"prepared under considerable time constraints,\" was affected by \"legal and technical ambiguities\" and \"never came into force;\"300\n\nb. the 1991 bill \"is not a valid aid to interpreting the IPA, and little (if any) reliance should be placed on it;\"301\n\nc. the 1991 draft version of Section 39 \"does **not** (contrary to the Claimant's contention) constitute any standing offer to ICSID arbitration\" for \"no dollars\" disputes,302 because:\n\ni. it is unclear what the term \"this code\" (which the Claimant replaced with the words \"the IPA\") refers to in Section 39(1)(a);303\n\nii. it is Section 39(2) which \"provides the dispute resolution mechanism applicable to enterprises certified under Part IV such as the Claimant,\" not Section 39(1)(a) which refers to \"foreign nationals\");304\n\niii. Mr Webb accepts that the draft Section 39(2) \"is not a standing offer to arbitrate;\"305\n\nd. the Hansard of the 1991 bill makes it clear that Section 39 of that bill \"does **not** constitute any standing offer to ICSID arbitration,\" because:\n\ni. the Hansard shows that the focus of the 1991 IPA bill was \"on the establishment of the Investment Promotion Authority;\"306 and\n\nii. there is no mention in the Hansard of the State \"seeking to promote and facilitate investment in PNG, by agreeing in advance to arbitrate investment disputes generally at ICSID;\"307\n\ne. even if the draft Section 39(1)(a) constituted a standing offer to refer \"no dollars\" disputes to ICSID arbitration, the State \"chose to depart from the wording used\" in the 1991 draft in the final version of Section 39;308 that departure \"in itself, clearly indicates that the State did not intend, by way of Section 39, to provide any standing offer to submit investment disputes to ICSID arbitration\"309 - rather than broaden the scope of Section 39, as the Claimant suggests;310\n\nf. the foregoing analysis is assertedly supported by the Hansard of the 1992 IPA, because, *inter alia*, the Hansard makes \"no mention of any alleged decision to '*broaden the scope of [Section 39]* ', after the Government had (allegedly) realised that the Section 39 Draft '*was not good enough to give foreign investors real comfort* '.\"311\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 47.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 48 (citing to Griffin II Report, at para. 36).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 50.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 50(a)-(b).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 50(c).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 50(d) (citing to Webb Report, at para. 57).\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 51.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 52.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 54.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 54.\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 56-57.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 58(b).\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the 1991 IPA was not produced because \"the Section 39 Draft does not assist in the interpretation of Section 39 (if anything it assists the State) - the old 1991 IPA Bill was never brought into force; the wording of the Section 39 Draft is ambiguous and does not in any event amount to any standing offer to arbitrate; moreover, Section 39 now stands in radically different form.\"312\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 59.\n\n(2) Legislative history and purpose also supports the State's position\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, contrary to the Claimant's assertions, giving the advance consent to arbitrate at ICSID was not part of the World Bank structural adjustment loan requirements; rather, the issue was the replacement of the old NIDA with the Investment Promotion Authority.313 The Respondent adds that, \"while it is true that one of the stated purposes of the IPA is to promote and facilitate investment (both domestic and foreign) in PNG, and for that purpose, to establish the Investment Promotion Authority, it does not follow therefore that Section 39 must amount to a standing offer\" to arbitrate.314\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 60-66.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 67. *See also* Reply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 68-69.\n\n157.\n\nFurther, the Respondent states that the Claimant is wrong in asserting that PNG \"did not need to '*affirm its commitment to ICSID* '\" in the IPA.315 The Respondent argues that the context in which the IPA was adopted indicates such need existed, namely because \"the State was not particularly welcoming of foreign investment after Independence; and the IPA was therefore just a step towards the 'opening up' of its economy.\"316\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 70-71.\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, at para. 73.\n\n158.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's reliance on the investment promotion material, the Respondent notes that:\n\na. such materials \"**cannot, on their own, confer '*****consent in writing*** ',\" as recognized in *SPP v.

Egypt* decision supports the Respondent's position that consent is \"not something certainly to be lightly inferred or presumed, but... it has to be clearly shown, not necessarily with taking a restrictive approach.\"396 The Respondent's counsel added that \"[t]hat's why we say essentially both schemes or approaches require the consent to be clearly shown.\"397\n\n*See* DT(Day1).2.24-5.11.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).4.02-05.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).5.06-21.\n\nDT(Day1).7.08-11. *See also* Respondent's discussion of the *Conoco Phillips* case, at DT(Day1).7.12-8.08.\n\nDT(Day1).8.09-10.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent further noted that the distinction between the Parties \"in terms of the restrictive approach\" is Professor Dolzer's view, in reliance on ILC Guiding Principle 7, that \"the approach to unilateral declarations should be restrictive.\"398 The Respondent accepted that Section 39 of the IPA was \"a unilateral declaration\"399 and explained that it was not \"only meant to convey information to domestic authorities; rather, it is to those who would read this and, hence, this would include foreign investors.\"400 The Respondent referred to Professor Dolzer's position that this declaration \"is of a hybrid nature because being a national law, but intended to operate, to an extent, on the international plane, the approach should be a mix of both national and international law principles.\"401\n\nDT(Day1).8.11-18.\n\nDT(Day1).9.21-22.\n\nDT(Day1).11.12-16.\n\nDT(Day1).11.16-20.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent reiterated its position that, \"even on the common ground between us on the principles of interpretation, consent is not clearly shown.

What is sought to be applied is the Act, not the convention. The words 'implementing the convention' appear to be descriptive of what the IDCA did. What section 39 does is apply the Act according to its terms.409\n\nDT(Day1).20.19-21.01.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent argued that, \"[a]pplying that natural and ordinary meaning, according to its terms means all its terms, not some of the terms or all but one of the terms or part of the terms; nothing more and nothing less.\"410\n\nDT(Day1).22.14-17. *See also* DT(Day2).31.15-18.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent contrasted Section 39 with the national legislation in *SPP v. Egypt* and the Venezuela Cases, which legislation \"referred to the convention rather than the Act itself, or the Act implementing it,\" and noted that \"it might be a step or half a step closer to saying consent could apply, if it was talking in terms of the convention applying directly.\"411\n\nDT(Day1).21.23-22.05. *See also* DT(Day1).34.09-13 (Mr. Yeo: \"... Just as I've said, if the reference was to the convention rather than act, perhaps an argument, you might be getting a step closer to saying that that is the standing offer to consent, the use of the use of more mandatory language like 'shall'.\").\n\n201.\n\nAddressing the Claimant's arguments on construction of \"applies\" and \"according to its terms\" as having two distinct functions,412 the Respondent contended that \"that is an artificial way of construing it.\"413 According to the Respondent, \"the claimant's submission does involve [the Tribunal] either construing this, not in a natural and ordinary way, but in a very contrived and artificial way or, indeed, to rewrite it.\"414 The Respondent stated that the Tribunal can \"construe [this provision] as best it can to prevent an absurdity or an empty form, but [the Tribunal] still can't rewrite it.\"415\n\n*See* DT(Day1).30.03-09.\n\nDT(Day1).30.12. *See also* DT(Day2).31.12-14 (Mr. Yeo: \"I submit to the tribunal that to read 'applies' and 'according to its terms' disjunctively is not natural or reasonable.\").\n\nDT(Day1).40.18-21.\n\nDT(Day1).40.15-17.\n\n202.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the expression \"applies, according to its terms\" \"should be construed together... [and] 'according to its terms' governs or limits the application,\" which \"includes the consent in writing\" and \"the issue about nationals of contracting states.\"416 Overall, the meaning that the Respondent attaches to Section 39 is that:\n\nit is reaffirming Papua New Guinea's commitment to ICSID and clarifying or informing foreign investors, or those who make foreign investment, if there's a difference, that ICSID arbitration may be available.417\n\nDT(Day1).30.13-19.\n\nDT(Day1).32.13-17.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent finally noted that, \"reading section 39 in conjunction with section 2... still wouldn't provide that consent.\"418 According to the Respondent, what Section 39 \"simply says is the IDCA applies according to its terms,\" and \"takes you back to the IDCA and if the IDCA didn't provide the consent, then section 39, read on its own, or with it, can't do more than that.\"419\n\nDT(Day1).22.21-22.\n\nDT(Day1).38.11-16. *See also* DT(Day1).45.22-24 (Mr. Yeo: \"If the IDCA didn't provide the consent, then merely applying it to disputes arising out of foreign investment doesn't achieve that effect.\");

they apply to any investment, it appears, by someone who is not a citizen.\"422 According to the Respondent, Section 37 sets out \"substantive rights, and they're given to a wider group of people, foreign investors, and there's no limitation that that can only be enforced through ICSID arbitration.\"423\n\n*See* DT(Day1).26.21-28:02.\n\nDT(Day1).28:07-10.\n\nDT(Day1).31.09-13.\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that there was nothing to suggest that substantive rights under Section 37, framed in mandatory terms,424 could not be enforced other than through ICSID, by \"bring[ing] an action in the courts or perhaps some other court;\"425 further, \"because it's available to all foreign investors, not just nationals of contracting states, certainly those nationals who are from states who are not contracting states to the ICSID convention, would have to find another way to enforce them.\"426\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, DT(Day1).33.04-06 (Mr. Yeo: \"Rather than futurity, I considered that 'shall' simply, in its mandatory form, was saying, 'We are conferring substantive rights'.\").\n\nDT(Day1).28.24-29.05.\n\nDT(Day1).29.06-10.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent pointed out that \"the language that is employed in section 39 is markedly different from what appears in sections 37 and 38.\"427 According to the Respondent, \"[w]hile section 39 appears in Part V,\" it does not appear \"from the text or the context that 39 is necessarily linked to 37 and 38\" and it is not \"the means by which you enforce sections 37 and 38.\"428\n\nDT(Day1).31.22-24.\n\nDT(Day2).35.20-36.04.\n\n208.\n\n***Second***, turning to the legislative history of the IPA and the IDCA, the Respondent made the following observations:\n\na. with regard to the Hansard of the 1991 IPA, the Respondent noted that it made clear that the \"wider context and purpose of the IPA\" was \"to introduce the authority, the IPA, the authority, to replace the NIDA, which was seen as being very cumbersome;\"429\n\nb. with regard to the 1991 Act, the Respondent argued that it \"affords [the Tribunal] no guidance in terms of construing the current IPA\"430 and that \"there are considerable difficulties in interpreting [sections] 39(1) and 39(2)\" of the 1991 IPA431 in the manner suggested by the Claimant.432 In particular, the Respondent criticized the Claimant's position that the 1992 IPA's effort \"improve\" the 1991 IPA (as stated in the Hansard of the 1992 IPA) \"means improve from the perspective of foreign investors, not from the state\"433 and argued that the improvement may also be seen from the perspective of the State.434 The Respondent noted that, when passing legislation, the States look to advance their own interests;435 for example, it may be in the State's interest to grant consent in a bilateral treaty in exchange for \"something tangible in return.\"436 The Respondent also stated that the \"reference in Hansard was to improving the legislation or to improve the bill,\" to make it clearer, rather than \"to improve the offer\" as the Claimant suggested.437\n\nc. turning to the Hansard of the 1992 IPA, the Respondent submitted that it reflects the improvements made compared to the 1991 version, including the simplification of the certification procedures for foreign investors and strengthening of \"investment guarantees for foreign investors.\"438 The Respondent emphasized that \"there's nothing here about ICSID arbitration, consent to jurisdiction or advance consent;\" rather, the strengthening of the \"investment guarantees... so as to cover ***'all*** foreign investors',\" without limitation to national of Contracting States.439\n\nd. with regard to the various Hansards of the IDCA, the Respondent stated that:\n\ni. the Hansard of the 1978 IDCA indicated that, \"at least as far as the government was concerned, the IDCA bill, being enacted in 1978, didn't itself constitute the consent,\" and that consent in writing was required;440 and\n\nii. the Hansard of the 1982 amendment to the IDCA similarly shows that \"there was no attempt to say [that the Respondent is] providing the consent in writing to ICSID;\" rather, the focus of the debate was to eliminate the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies which was reflected in \"the sole change made in 1982\" - *i.e.*, removal of the part of the provision \"about local and diplomatic remedies.\"441\n\nDT(Day1).56.21-24. *See also* DT(Day1).71.01-72.08.\n\nDT(Day1).59.19-20.\n\nDT(Day1).62.11-14. *See also* DT(Day1).62.14-64.05.\n\nDT(Day1).67.13-14.\n\nDT(Day1).68.11-14.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).06-19.\n\nDT(Day1).14-18.\n\nDT(Day1).68.19-69.05.\n\nDT(Day2).46.01-05.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).73.19-74.22.\n\nDT(Day1).74.15-22 (emphasis added).\n\nDT(Day2).38.18-39.06.\n\nDT(Day2).40.08-17.\n\n209.\n\n***Third***, the Respondent referred to the examples of BITs which it had entered into as alleged evidence of knowledge how to give its consent to arbitration. The Respondent reiterated that these treaties show that, if the Respondent \"wanted to consent to ICSID arbitration, [it] certainly knew how to do so and had done so previously in clear, unequivocal terms.\"442\n\nDT(Day1).76.03-06.\n\n210.\n\n***Fourth***, the Respondent submitted that the statements on the websites - that are in many ways inaccurate443 - should not be considered by the Tribunal in resolving the interpretive dilemma, because the websites are not \"subsequent practice falling within article 31 of the VCLT.\"444 According to the Respondent, the investment promotion literature can only be \"informative,\" but cannot \"change the rights of the statute.\"445\n\n*See* DT(Day2).12.13-14.18 (the Respondent's counsel pointed out that the IPA website contains inaccuracies, including an outdated reference to exhaustion of local remedies: \"If the tribunal notes, it's still talking about diplomatic channels or local remedies before the matter can go to ICSID.. The reference to 'diplomatic channels' or 'use of local remedies' is actually a reference back to the original IDCA before the 1982 amendment. In terms of reflecting the position post-1982, it's simply wrong.\").\n\nDT(Day2).10.06-08.\n\nDT(Day2).5.15-17.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent further contrasted the websites relied upon by the Claimant with the circumstances in *Planet Mining v. Republic of Indonesia*. The Respondent noted that these circumstances were different from the present case because they did not involve \"some general statement on a website, but a very specific document pertaining to that enterprise which was also copied to the highest authority\" of the host State.446\n\nDT(Day2).3.07-23.\n\n212.\n\n***Fifth***, regarding the purpose of the IPA and Section 39, the Respondent accepted that the purpose of the IPA \"was to promote foreign investment in Papua New Guinea,\"447 but noted that \"there are a number of degrees in terms of how attractive you seek to make yourself.\"448 According to the Respondent, the IPA was \"largely about setting-up the investment promotion agency\"449 and \"streamlining the procedures for making investments which were previously considered to be very cumbersome under the predecessor agency.\"450\n\nDT(Day1).36.20-23.\n\nDT(Day1).37.04-06.\n\nDT(Day1).37.04-08. *See also* DT(Day1).50.01-21.\n\nDT(Day1).50.23-25.\n\n213.\n\nWith regard to the purpose of Section 39 itself, the Respondent submitted that, within the wider context of the IPA, Section 39 \"does serve a purpose to tell investors that ICSID arbitration may be available;\"451 \"there is a purpose in putting everything in one statute, so that parties reading it can be made aware of it.\"452 The Respondent noted that: looked at in the wider purpose or streamlining procedures for foreign investment, [Section 39] would have value, it would have purpose to inform foreign investors, to reaffirm the commitment to ICSID arbitration and to inform them that this may be available for disputes arising out of foreign investment.453\n\nDT(Day1).35.07-11.\n\nDT(Day1).35.15-17.\n\nDT(Day1).77.02-08. *See also* DT(Day1).82.16-21; DT(Day2)35.05-08 (\"[T]here is a real purpose served in the international plane to reaffirm your commitment to the ICSID Convention and to clarify and inform that it may be available.\").\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent argued that Section 39 is \"not an absurdity or an empty form,\" because it \"does have a meaning and purpose.\"454 In any event, \"you can't just on that purpose alone, of promoting foreign investment, rewrite this provision or read in words that aren't there.\"455\n\nDT(Day1).85.11-12.\n\nDT(Day1).37.22-24. *See also* DT(Day1).85.12-86.03; DT(Day2).30.06-08 (\"What you can't do is focus on the purpose and then try to drag up those words to fit that purpose.\"); DT(Day2).37.06-10 (\"[T]here is at least more than one meaning... that would fit within that purpose. That's why you can't just look at the purpose and say that from that I divine the meaning without having a strong regard to the words.\").\n\n215.\n\n***Finally***, the Respondent noted that, \"if you look at the context of the IPA and the purpose that it was trying to serve, that the meaning we have advanced fits within that context and purpose and, to us, is congruent and consistent with the words actually used.\"456\n\nDT(Day1).86.05-09.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent concluded its submissions on consent as follows:\n\nIn conclusion... adopting what is common between the two interpretive approaches, you start with the words. And the words are clear and refer you back to the act and all its terms, or subject to its terms; no more, no less.\n\nIf section 2 of the IDCA doesn't provide the consent, section 39 doesn't take you further. Within the wider context of the IPA and the purpose of promoting foreign investment, we say this meaning makes sense and has purpose and effect. Remember that effet utile, if it applies, requires you to find that the meaning we put forward is an absurdity and an empty form. Even then, it doesn't say you can rewrite the provision. It says you do your utmost to prevent this absurdity from occurring.\n\nThis is not an absurdity or an empty form, it serves a purpose. Maybe not the purpose the claimant wants to serve, but it serves a purpose nonetheless. So at the end of the day, we are saying it is clear that the consent in writing requirement isn't fulfilled.457\n\nDT(Day2).50.22-51.16.\n\nb) \"Investor\" and \"Investment\"\n------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent underscored the \"very unique set of facts\" in this case and summarized the relevant facts, the Ninth Supplemental Act and the Claimant's M&A458 to \"help [the Tribunal] understand the animal that is the Claimant.\"459 The Respondent argued that \"this unique set of facts takes them outside the realm of the sort of private foreign investment that was meant to have disputes adjudicated through the ICSID arbitration.\"460\n\n*See* DT(Day1).90-107. The Respondent noted in passing, without going into the merits of the claims, that the Respondent disputes that there had been an expropriation. *See* DT(Day1).102.12-13.\n\nDT(Day1).99.15-16.\n\nDT(Day1).107.16-20.\n\n218.\n\nIn particular,461 the Respondent:\n\na. accepted that the place of incorporation of the Claimant is Singapore, but argued that \"beyond that factor,... everything else points to Papua New Guinea;\"462 according to the Respondent, the Claimant is \"in substance... a PNG institution, albeit incorporated in Singapore;\"463\n\nb. clarified that it was \"not talking about nominal consideration\" but rather about \"zero consideration that came out from the claimants;\"464\n\nc. stated that the Claimant's \"purposes are all public and charitable;\"465\n\nd. distinguished this case from the facts and circumstances in other investor-State cases.466\n\nThe Respondent elsewhere also stated that the purpose of the Claimant's certification as a \"foreign enterprise\" under Section 25 of the IPA \"is to carry on business in the country, and that's why I say it doesn't correlate to investment in the context of the ICSID convention\" (DT(Day1).51.24-52.05), and that the fact that the Claimant did not avail itself of the exemption under Section 26 of the IPA did not mean that \"they are not a charitable or public-purpose type of company.\" (DT(Day1).52.06-22).\n\nDT(Day1).110.10-12.\n\nDT(Day1).107.07-09. *See also* DT(Day2).28.05-09.\n\nDT(Day1).108.03-05.\n\nDT(Day1).109.11.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).107-110.\n\nc) MFN\n------\n\n219.\n\nOn interpretation of Section 37(1) of the IPA, the Respondent reiterated its written submissions and summarized its position as follows:\n\nThe reference to 'the foreign investor'... must be the same one.... We say our construction is consistent and congruent with the wording of section 37, because the reference to 'the foreign investor' in the second line must mean the same one in the first line. I accept the word 'same' isn't there, but I'm saying that's the meaning of 'the'. The claimant's construction would require you to read 'the foreign investor' to mean 'any other foreign investor' because, essentially, it's someone other than the one in the first line, and we say that does considerable violence to the language.467\n\nDT(Day1).111.06-24.\n\n220.\n\nThe Respondent further contended that Section 37(1)'s \"reference to 'any treaty' to which the state is a party is qualified by the words in the second line of 'the investor'. In other words, the treaty that's being referred to needs to be with a state of which the investor is a national.\"468\n\nDT(Day2).1.14-20.\n\n2. The Claimant's Submissions\n-----------------------------\n\na) Consent\n----------\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimant's counsel approached the interpretation of Section 39 from the perspective of a potential foreign investor looking at the IPA.469 The Claimant pointed out the circularity of the provisions of Section 39 and stated that \"[i]t needs to be interpreted, in particular the word 'applies';\"470 \"[e]lliptical provisions require interpretation; they don't necessarily require rewriting.\"471\n\n*See* DT(Day1).118.11-119.04.\n\n*See* DT(Day1).119.05-120.04.\n\nDT(Day1).124.11-12.\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant defined the Tribunal's task in this case as follows:\n\n[T]he question is whether what you are asked to do, having regard to the interpretive methods available to a Papua New Guinea court..., falls within the interpretive mandate of the tribunal or falls outside the interpretive mandate of the tribunal so that you have to hold up your hands and say, 'There's nothing to be done. The hole can't be fixed', despite the fact that there was an evident intention to give investment guarantees, which included reference to ICSID.472\n\nDT(Day1).125.01-11.\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimant summarized its interpretive approach as follows:\n\n[T]he question is the application of a domestic law which relates to an international treaty. And, therefore, the parties are agreed that you refer both to international law and to Papua New Guinea law in determining the questions arising.\n\nWe rely on Papua New Guinea law because of its strong emphasis on object and purpose in relation to a phrase which is equivocal. We rely on international law as supporting the idea of investment arbitration on the basis of a good faith commitment by the state.473\n\nDT(Day1).156.13-22.\n\n224.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the word \"applies\" in the context of the IPA's purpose is that \"it is open consent to arbitration under the convention in cases where the substantive requirements of the convention are met.\"474 The Claimant noted that interpretation of Section 39 \"involves very careful appreciation of the facts,\"475 and argued that \"the idea that there is in principle a view of restrictive interpretation, a document of statements or propositions in legislation made with a view to attracting foreign investment, is frankly pass\u00e9.\"476\n\nDT(Day1).120.11-14.\n\nDT(Day1).122.08-09\n\nDT(Day1).122.12-15.\n\n225.\n\n***First***, the Claimant discussed the legislative history of the IDCA and described what the Claimant's counsel characterized as \"the trend of the PNG legislation... to expand access to an arbitration, with a view to attracting investment.\"477\n\na. The Claimant referred to the original version of the IDCA, noting that it implemented the ICSID Convention \"in a very comprehensive way,\" was \"carefully drafted\" and annexed the Convention itself.478 The Claimant submitted that, throughout the revisions to the IDCA, \"there was a progression towards consent over the three pieces of legislation.\"479\n\nb. the Claimant referred to the Hansard of the IDCA Amendment Act 1982480 and noted that the sentence stating \"[t]he bill will remove from the Act a provision requiring all domestic remedies to be exhausted before this bill can be referred to ICSID\" contained a mistake and should instead read \"before a dispute under the convention can be referred to ICSID.\"481 According to the Claimant, by removing the requirement to exhaust local remedies before bringing a dispute to ICSID, the 1982 amendment \"did take Papua New Guinea quite a long way down the line to an agreement to arbitrate\" because \"it got rid of a major obstacle to foreign investment, which is the local remedies rule... ;482\n\nc. the Claimant stated that:\n\nWe're told by counsel for the respondent that all of this was simply intended to open the door to ICSID, but the door was already wide open insofar as they would have it open, because it was already fully agreed by 1982 that the ICSID arbitration was the best method of resolving investment disputes. It would be a work of supererogation for Parliament in 1991 and 1992 to say, again, ICSID is the best method. We say that you are entitled to take into account the progressions in the legislations, it's [sic] public documents which led to the position of 1992.483\n\nThe Claimant argued that \"when parliament in two tries in 1991 and 1992 enacted legislation which is capable of a broader interpretation, having regard to the object and purpose of that legislation, that is the right interpretation to give to it.\"484 The Claimant stated, however, that it did not suggest that Section 2 of the IDCA, as amended in 1982, \"constituted an open offer\" to arbitrate.485\n\nd. the Claimant turned to the 1991 IPA and argued that Section 39(1) \"indisputably\" contained \"an offer to arbitrate a certain class of cases\"486 which \"wasn't drafted by a neophyte.\"487 Looking at Section 39(1), the Claimant stated that the reference to the term \"code\" meant \"as a minimum, [that] it applies to the code of investment, substantive investment guarantees in section 37, and quite possibly to other provisions of the Act as well.\"488 The Claimant added that \"it is as clear as the night follows the day that [section] 39(2) is subject to a subsequent agreement to arbitrate and [section 39(1)] is not.\"489 The Claimant concluded on this point that \"in this legislation, unproclaimed, PNG took the next step and offered arbitration for an uncertain but real class of cases involving investment guarantees.\"490\n\ne. in relation to the Hansard of the 1991 IPA, the Claimant argued that the creation of the Investment Promotion Agency was not \"the only piece\" in this Act.491 According to the Claimant, although it is true that governments \"only legislate in their own interests,\" in this case there was \"a relatively weak government rich in natural resources which desperately wanted to attract inward foreign investment.\"492 The Claimant added that, although there is a \"vacuum\" in the parliamentary debate on the issue of ICSID arbitration, it could be because this issue was \"passed as a technicality.\"493\n\nf. according to the Claimant, if the 1992 IPA were interpreted as the Respondent suggests, it would have been \"a significant step backwards from a consent to arbitrate matters related to the interpretation or application of the Act to a refusal to arbitrate matters relating to interpretation or application of the Act.\"494 The Claimant added that:\n\nThere was nothing that the Papua New Guinea parliament could have done after 1982 that would have made Papua New Guinea more available to ICSID than the expression of a consent to arbitrate. Nothing more was required.\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the context of the notion of... the application of a treaty provision, in the context of an act which is intended to facilitate investment and to encourage investment, in the context of a legal system where purpose of interpretation is more supportive and more supported than it is in the classic common law tradition... [,] we say that the right interpretation is that when it is said that the convention was to apply, that meant that the convention was to apply as a method of the resolution of disputes.495\n\ng. looking at the Hansard of the 1992 Act, the Claimant noted that the reference to that Act's purpose to \"improve\" the previous 1991 version could mean \"an improvement from the point of view of the aims which [the Minister] articulated, which included to promote private sector investment as well as meet conditions set under the World Bank structural adjustment loan.\"496\n\nDT(Day1).144.21-23. The Claimant stated that the Respondent \"has not been entirely helpful in producing the language of the legislation\" and that the Claimant had to find and produce the Hansards and the 1991 IPA itself; \"to the extent that a government seeks to rely upon the terms of its legislation in front of the tribunal, it has an obligation to the tribunal to be candid and productive in relation to the content of that legislation, which it has not been.\" DT(Day2).57.24-58.04, 58.17-22.\n\nDT(Day1).126.02-09.\n\nDT(Day1).128.23-24. *See also* DT(Day1).128.25-130.08.\n\nHansard extracts in respect of the IDCA Amendment Act 1982, **Exhibit CL-15**.\n\nDT(Day1).130.09-21.\n\nDT(Day1).131.23-132.06.\n\nDT(Day1).132.07-17. *See also* DT(Day1).133.05-13.\n\nDT(Day1).133.09-13.\n\nDT(Day1).133.20-21.\n\nDT(Day1).133.12-16.\n\nDT(Day1).138.06.\n\nDT(Day1).138.14-17. *See also* DT(Day1).140.11-13 (Prof. Crawford: \"what is indisputable is that section 39(1), whatever it extends to, and however far it extends, is an offer to arbitrate.\").\n\nDT(Day1).140.18-20.\n\nDT(Day1).140.24-141.02.\n\nDT(Day1).141.20-23.\n\nDT(Day1).142.03-10. The Claimant subsequently noted that \"in capital-importing jurisdictions with weak domestic institutions, especially those which are highly reliant on mineral exports, investment guarantees are of extreme importance. And in making decisions about very substantial upfront investments, or further investments, investors look to see what guarantees are on offer. Guarantees provided by domestic courts... are not regarded as satisfactory or sufficient.\" DT(Day2).61.22-62.05.\n\nDT(Day1).143.13-15.\n\nDT(Day1).145.24-146.03.\n\nDT(Day1).146.12-147.03.\n\nDT(Day1).148.15-18.\n\n226.\n\n***Second***, the Claimant addressed the interpretation of Section 39 of the 1992 IPA and:\n\na. stated that its position was that Section 39 \"imports the amended 1978 Act, including section 2 in its amended formulation, and that it deems that section 2 is satisfied for disputes arising out of the investment guarantees;\"497\n\nb. cited the *Interocean v. Nigeria* case, in which the tribunal found that the word \"apply\" was \"sufficient to constitute consent in advance,\" albeit applying a different legislative provision;498\n\nc. contended that \"[i]f the effect of applying the limitation [that a normative instrument is subject to] is that the document fails to have any operation at all, as the reference to the rules in *Interocean* would have had if it had been taken literally, then you've got to modify the interpretation of the word 'applies' accordingly;\"499\n\nd. argued that:\n\nthe reference to 'in its own terms', with commas before and after, is simply making it clear... that the convention is still the convention and still is subject to limitations in the convention. We say that that is itself subject to the qualification that the convention is made to apply as guarantee, which without consent it would not be. So the minimum application that the convention has to have in order not simply to be part of PNG law but to be applicable to the dispute is that PNG has consented to the dispute.500\n\ne. taking Section 39 in its context, argued that the \"investment guarantees provided for in section 37 of the 1992 Act would be of very limited value, and, indeed, ultimately perhaps of no value at all, unless they're underpinned by the further investment guarantee arbitration.\"501 The Claimant added that \"it's not the case that section 39 is an afterthought in the provision, only section 37 and 38 of which constitute investment guarantees;\" rather, it was \"intended as part of a section, we say a code, dealing with investment guarantees.\"502 According to the Claimant, if Section 39 had said what the Respondent said it means, \"it wouldn't be an investment guarantee,\" but would instead \"deter investment and defeat the object and purposes of the [IPA].\"503\n\nDT(Day2).67.12-16.\n\n*See* DT(Day2).62.06-19.\n\nDT(Day2).70.14-19.\n\nDT(Day2).70.20-71.05.\n\nDT(Day2).63.11-18.\n\nDT(Day2).63.19-24.\n\nDT(Day2).64.17-25.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant submitted that there were \"five interpretive conclusions available to the tribunal\" in relation to Section 39, including:504\n\na. \"what it does is simply to reaffirm the availability of ICSID if the parties agree\" - in which case this would be an (unnecessary) fourth reaffirmation of its commitment to ICSID by the Respondent, following the ratification of the ICSID Convention, the 1978 IDCA and the 1982 amendment to the IDCA;505\n\nb. it is a \"domestic confirmation of the position of ICSID within the PNG legal system, in effect confirming the force and effect of the 1978 Act;\" according to the Claimant, in a dualist PNG legal system, the 1978 IDCA, as implementing legislation, \"did everything it needed to do to give effect to ICSID\" and nothing further was required;506\n\nc. Section 39 \"clears the way for reference to ICSID, but there's no evidence that there was any legal impediment once the 1982 amendment had removed the requirement of domestic remedies;\"507 according to the Claimant, this \"clear the way\" interpretation is therefore \"redundant;\"508\n\nd. \"all section 39 did was to refer back to a 1978 Act, already part of the law of Papua New Guinea, and say that the Act applied,\" and that \"it was not a guarantee but the contingent possibility of a guarantee;\"509 according to the Claimant, this interpretation advanced by the Respondent \"is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the legislation,... is not required by the terms of section 39\" and is \"an example of redundancy, if not absurdity;\"510\n\ne. Section 39 \"expressed an intention to extend investment guarantees,... because that was what parliament intended to do as the minister said in introducing the legislation,\"511 and the intention \"achieved, albeit elliptically,\" in the 1992 IPA was \"to extend and not reduce the guarantee.\"512 This is the interpretation favoured by the Claimant.\n\nDT(Day2).83.01-02.\n\nDT(Day2).83.05-23.\n\nDT(Day2).84.03-07.\n\nDT(Day2).84.14-17.\n\nDT(Day2).85.13-14.\n\nDT(Day2).87.10-17.\n\nDT(Day2).87.18-21.\n\nDT(Day2).87.24-88.05.\n\nDT(Day2).89.15-16.\n\n228.\n\n***Third***, the Claimant further argued that, when one faces an \"elliptical piece of legislation,\" it is a matter of \"preponderance of the arguments,\" and in this case \"the preponderance of arguments favours our view of the position, rather than Papua New Guinea's view of the position....\"513 The Claimant also stated that, \"[i]f the position is that the legislation is open to more than one interpretation... we say that the purpose of interpretation in the context of the legislation... directed at the outside and intended to have beneficial effects, that interpretation is to be preferred.\"514\n\nDT(Day1).150.20-22.\n\nDT(Day2).65.24-66.06.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant submitted that, in this case, its interpretation of Section 39 \"is more than just a possible scenario; it is the more likely scenario,\"515 or \"it's not simply a possible interpretation; it's the better interpretation.\"516\n\nDT(Day1).151.13-14.\n\nDT(Day1).151.23-25. *See also* DT(Day1).151.15-24.\n\n230.\n\n***Finally***, on the issue of websites, the Claimant noted that it did not suggest, \"in the context of the interpretation of domestic legislation,... that the practice of administrative agencies is determinative\" because \"[i]t's a matter of law, and not a matter of what may be misguided appreciations;\" however, \"[i]t's nonetheless relevant, and similar conduct has been treated as relevant in other cases.\"517 According to the Claimant, \"the conduct of the competent authority under the relevant legislation in giving effect to that legislation can be taken into account.\"518\n\nDT(Day1).153.09-14.\n\nDT(Day2).74.14-17.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant stated that, bearing in mind Sections 6 and 7 of the IPA setting out the functions of the Investment Promotion Authority:\n\n[I]t was within the scope of the statutory mandate of the IPA to do what it did on its website, and that in doing so, it was acting as an organ of the state in PNG within its authority and the exercise of its competence, and what it did was to be taken seriously.519\n\nDT(Day2).75.01-06.\n\n232.\n\nGiven its authority as the \"competent body in respect of investment,\" \"it is highly relevant what [the Investment Promotion Authority] thought the legislation meant and what it announced the legislation meant in its public pronouncements.\"520\n\nDT(Day2).77.01-10.\n\n233.\n\nTurning to the language on the website statements (pre-RFA),521 the Claimant reiterated that the use of the word \"can\" should be understood as \"it is accessible to the investor,\" rather than \"it's open to PNG to agree subsequently to settlement of disputes....\"522 According to the Claimant:\n\na. \"the situation is that the competent authority regarded the relevant provision of its act, the act which it administered, as having that effect, and we rely on that as confirmation that that's what the words mean;\"523 and\n\nb. \"[t]his was not merely promotional material, it's not merely blurb; it's a statement by an official agency authorised to make it as to what the position is.\"524\n\nThe Claimant noted that it would \"rely exclusively\" on the website of the Investment Promotion Authority because the latter \"was in a special position by virtue of the legislation itself.\" DT(Day2).60.04-12.\n\nDT(Day1).156.07-11. *See also* DT(Day2).80.01-17 (\"[I]f I tell you a dispute can be settled by reference to ICSID, I don't mean that it's theoretically possible that it could be settled by reference to ICSID, I mean that ICSID is available for the settlement of that dispute....

THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n242.\n\nAccording to well-established principles of international arbitration and Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, this Tribunal is \"the judge of its own competence.\"541 This basic rule of competence-competence applies to all international tribunals and is confirmed by Article 41(1). Neither Party disputes the Tribunal's competence in this regard.\n\nICSID Convention, at Article 41(1). *See above* at para. 43. *See also* *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at para. 74 (The tribunal is the \"judge of its own competence,\" and \"[i]t is so whatever the basis of that competence, including a unilateral offer made in the Host State's legislation and subsequently accepted by the investor.\"), **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n243.\n\nIn determining its competence to decide on the present dispute, the Tribunal applies the requirements of the ICSID Convention, including the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25(1), the instrument of consent and the relevant principles of international law, as articulated below. According to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre - and of this Tribunal - \"shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"542\n\nICSID Convention, at Article 25(1).\n\n244.\n\nThe requirement of \"consent in writing\" is correctly termed the \"cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"543 It is well-established that this requirement is not satisfied merely by a State's ratification of the ICSID Convention or by a notification under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention that the Contracting States may choose to make.544 In particular, the preamble to the ICSID Convention makes clear that \"no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"545\n\nThe Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, at para. 23, **Exhibit RL-18**.\n\n*See* ICSID Convention, Preamble, at para. 7; C. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2nd ed., CUP (2009), at para. 374 (\"The fact that the host State and the investor's State of nationality have ratified the Convention will not suffice.\"), **Exhibit RL-11** ; *SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 62, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\nICSID Convention, Preamble, at para. 7.\n\n245.\n\nAlthough the ICSID Convention does not precisely define the form in which consent to the Centre's jurisdiction must be expressed, beyond the statement that consent must be \"in writing,\" it is well-established that such consent can be given in advance of any dispute, and that consent may be expressed in multiple forms, including through domestic investment legislation.546 According to the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank:\n\nConsent of the parties must exist when the Centre is seized... but the Convention does not otherwise specify the time at which consent should be given. Consent may be given, for example, in a clause included in an investment agreement, providing for the submission to the Centre of future disputes arising out of that agreement, or in a *compromis* regarding a dispute which has already arisen. Nor does the Convention require that the consent of both parties be expressed in a single instrument. Thus, ***a host State might in its investment******promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre***, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.547\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at paras. 64, 86, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\nThe Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, at para. 24, **Exhibit RL-18** (emphasis added). *See also SPP v. Egypt* award, at paras. 70, 101 (\"The Convention does not prescribe any particular form for the consent, nor does it require that consent be given on a case-by-case basis.\"), **Exhibit CA-3** ; *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 58, **Exhibit CA-2**.\n\n246.\n\nIt is thus well-established that a State can make a standing offer to arbitrate in its domestic investment legislation, which an investor can accept by bringing the dispute to ICSID.548 Although agreements to arbitrate in investment contracts, or offers to arbitrate in bilateral (and multilateral) investment treaties may be more frequently encountered, there is no question but that a binding agreement to arbitrate may be derived from national legislation.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., C. Schreuer *et al.*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2nd ed., CUP (2009), at para. 378 (\"Consent may also result from a unilateral offer by the host State, expressed in its legislation or in a treaty, which is subsequently accepted by the investor.\"), **Exhibit RL-11**. The Claimant purports to have expressed its consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration in a letter from Sir Mekere Morauta to the Prime Minister of PNG dated 26 September 2013. *See* Request for Arbitration, at para. 69; Letter to the Prime Minister of PNG from the Chairman of the Claimant (26 September 2013), **Exhibit CE-15**.\n\n247.\n\nThe Parties largely agree on the foregoing principles. However, the Parties disagree as to whether the relevant PNG investment legislation, at issue in this case, does in fact contain a standing offer to arbitrate by the Respondent, sufficient to give rise here to a binding agreement to arbitrate.549\n\n*See above* at paras. 41, 51-66, 92-121, 148-158, 174-184, 191-216, 221-233.\n\n248.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, and as detailed above, the Claimant argues that \"[e]ither on its own, or when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA, Section 39 of the IPA constitutes a standing offer by the Respondent to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID.\"550 In contrast, in its Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent contends that Section 39 of the IPA, on its own or read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA, does not constitute a standing offer to arbitrate by the Respondent necessary to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this case.551\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 67; *see above* at para. 41.\n\n*See above* at paras. 51-66.\n\n249.\n\nThe Parties made thorough submissions both on the principles of construction to be applied to Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA, and on the proper interpretation of these statutory provisions. The Tribunal first addresses the principles that apply to the construction of the relevant PNG investment legislation provisions, before turning to the interpretation of those provisions.\n\n*A. Principles Governing Interpretation of Domestic Investment Legislation*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Parties are in (apparent) disagreement on the basic approach to construction of PNG investment legislation that is alleged to contain the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate.\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent argues for a restrictive approach and submits that a State's consent in writing must be \"'clear and unambiguous' in order to confer jurisdiction on an international tribunal,\" and that \"a state's unilateral assumption of obligations is 'not lightly to be presumed', especially considering that a sovereign state by consenting to arbitration under ICSID is submitting itself to an external adjudicative body.\"552\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 41. *See above* at para. 56.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant, in turn, submits that the correct approach to interpretation of Section 39 is that adopted in *SPP v. Egypt* (including the *effet utile* principle), which essentially requires that jurisdictional instruments be interpreted \"neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith \"553 Alternatively, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal should apply what it terms a \"quasi-Vienna\" approach to the interpretation of the Respondent's unilateral declaration made in its domestic investment legislation at issue in this case.554\n\n*See above* at paras. 95-96.\n\n*See above* at paras. 99-104, 117-118.\n\n253.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is well-settled, for good reason, that there is no presumption against the finding of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention, and no heightened requirement of proof of an agreement to arbitrate. Jurisdictional instruments, whether investment contracts, treaties or legislation, must be interpreted objectively and neutrally, and not either expansively or restrictively. The Tribunal adopts the principle set out in the *SPP* decision on jurisdiction that:\n\n[J]urisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if - but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favor of it is preponderant.555\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the *Amco Asia v. Indonesia* tribunal's statement that \"a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally*.556\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 63, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, reprinted in 23 ILM 351 (1984), at p. 359, **Annex 14 to Dolzer Report** (also quoted in, *e.g*., Carolyn B. Lamm, *Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*, 6(2) ICSID Review 462 (1991), at p. 465, **Exhibit RL-10**). The *Amco* tribunal also noted that \"any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that it to say by taking into account the consequences of their commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\" *Amco Asia Corp. and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, reprinted in 23 ILM 351 (1984), at p. 359, **Annex 14 to Dolzer Report**.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the view of the Respondent's legal expert that \"[a]ny offer to arbitrate must be *clearly and unambiguously* expressed, and *doubt shall be resolved against the finding of jurisdiction*.\"557 It is the Claimant's burden to prove that the Respondent has given its consent within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, but there is no requirement that the offer to arbitrate be \"clearly and unambiguously\" expressed, or that doubts must be \"resolved against the finding of jurisdiction.\"\n\nDolzer Report, at para. 49.\n\n255.\n\nThere is no reason, or justification, to adopt presumptions against (or in favor of) a State's submission to ICSID jurisdiction: the issue is rather to be approached objectively and neutrally, aiming to ascertain the true intentions of the relevant party (or parties) in a particular instrument. Where relevant, the standard of proof is generally held to be a preponderance of the evidence or a balance of probabilities.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *ConocoPhillips* tribunal that \"[t]he necessary consent is not to be presumed.\"558 Conversely, however, the lack of consent is also not to be presumed. The finding of consent is a matter of interpretation of the relevant provision, objectively and in good faith, applying all relevant principles of interpretation.\n\n*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, at para. 254, **Exhibit CA-1**. The same tribunal said that, with respect to jurisdiction, its \"approach should be cautious.\" *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, at para. 254, **Exhibit CA-1**. The Tribunal does not accept this. The proper approach is neither aggressive nor cautious, but objective and neutral.\n\n257.\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that States should be presumed not to have compromised their sovereignty by submitting to the Centre's jurisdiction.559 It is at least equally true, however, that States should be presumed to desire the effective and just resolution of international investment disputes, in a manner that enhances the prospects for foreign investment and confidence in the rule of law. In the Tribunal's view, these various considerations are best reflected in a neutral, objective approach towards jurisdictional objections, without preconceived preferences in one direction or the other, consistent with the substantial weight of authority on the issue.560 As the Claimant noted in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \"[i]n investment arbitration, both the interpretive and substantive facets of in dubio mitius have been consistently rejected in favour of a neutral (neither restrictive nor expansive) approach.\"561 The Tribunal agrees with this statement.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., Carolyn B. Lamm, *Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*, 6(2) ICSID Review 462 (1991), at p. 465, **Exhibit RL-10** (the author summarizes Indonesia's arguments in *Amco Asia v. Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, p. 358, as follows: \"The Government further suggested that consent to ICSID arbitration by a State should be construed restrictively since it constituted a limitation of the State's sovereignty.\"); Dugan *et al*., *Investor-State Arbitration*, Oxford (2008), at p. 219 (\"The requirement of consent to arbitral jurisdiction in the context of investor-state arbitration is also a corollary of the principle that 'there is no power superior to the states which can force a judge upon them'. There is nothing to preclude states from voluntarily submitting a dispute to a court or tribunal, however, and nothing can prevent them from making that submission irrevocable. A fundamental element of state sovereignty is the state's ability voluntarily to limit its own sovereignty.\"), **Exhibit RL-69**. In this arbitration, the Respondent argues that consent is \"'not lightly to be presumed,' ***especially considering that a******sovereign state by consenting to arbitration under ICSID is submitting itself to an external adjudicative body.***...\" Objections to Jurisdiction, at para. 41 (emphasis added). Similarly, Professor Dolzer states that \"applying ILC Principle 7 in the present context is also consistent with the view that ***when states make statements by which their freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is called for***, especially where the declaration is expressed *erga omnes*.\" Dolzer Report, at para. 26 (emphasis added).\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Mondev Int'l Ltd v.

Moreover,. any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\" (citing *Amco Asia et al. v.

To go beyond those bounds would be an act *ultra vires*.\"), Annex 7 to the Claimant's Submission on Costs, 5 March 2015. The Tribunal has found no authority in related fields to cause it to doubt the conclusions in these decisions. *See, e.g.,* *Dispute Regarding Navigational and Related Rights* (*Costa Rica v. Nicaragua*), 2009 ICJ Rep. 213, at para. 48 (\"[T]he Court is not convinced by Nicaragua's argument that Costa Rica's right of free navigation should be interpreted narrowly because it represents a limitation of the sovereignty over the river conferred by the Treaty on Nicaragua. While it is certainly true that limitations of the sovereignty of a State over its territory are not to be presumed, this does not mean that treaty provisions establishing such limitations, such as those that are in issue in the present case, should for this reason be interpreted *a priori* in a restrictive way. A treaty provision which has the purpose of limiting the sovereign powers of a State must be interpreted like any other provision of a treaty, i.e., in accordance with the intentions of its authors as reflected by the text of the treaty and the other relevant factors in terms of interpretation.\").\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, at para. 27.\n\n258.\n\nBoth Parties concur that Section 39 is a unilateral declaration and that both international law and PNG law are relevant to the interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA.562 The Claimant argues that \"some mix of national and international law governs [Section 39's] interpretation,\"563 while the Respondent accepts that this unilateral declaration \"is of a hybrid nature because being a national law, but intended to operate, to an extent, on the international plane, the approach should be a mix of both national and international law principles.\"564\n\n*See above*, *e.g*., at paras. 52, 93-94, 105-106.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 130. *See above* at para. 93.\n\nDT(Day1).11.16-20. *See above* at para. 193.\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that several arbitral tribunals have previously addressed, with varying results, the issue of what set of interpretive rules applies to the construction of domestic investment legislation that is said to contain a standing offer to arbitrate to foreign investors.565 The approach taken by those tribunals has ranged from the application of \"general principles of statutory interpretation,\" taking into account both \"relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations,\" to the application of international law without any reservation, to the application of domestic law \"subject to ultimate governance by international law.\"566\n\n*See* *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at paras. 72-79, **Exhibit CA-2** (citing, in particular, *SPP v. Egypt*, *CSOB v. Slovak Republic, Zhinvali v. Georgia*); *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at paras. 77-85 (\"Legislation and more generally unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction must be considered as standing offers to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Those unilateral acts must accordingly be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention itself and to the rules of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.\"), **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n*See* *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at paras. 82, 85 (regarding *SPP v. Egypt*, *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* and *Zhinvali v. Georgia*, respectively), **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n260.\n\nIn *SPP v. Egypt*, the ICSID tribunal formulated the issue, and its preferred approach, as follows:\n\n[T]he jurisdictional issue in this case involves more than interpretation of municipal legislation. The issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation. Also, to the extent that Article 8 is alleged to be a unilateral declaration of acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction, subject to reciprocal acceptance by a national of another Contracting State, the Tribunal must also consider certain aspects of international law governing unilateral juridical acts.567\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 61, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n261.\n\nAccordingly, the *SPP* tribunal applied the following principle of interpretation:\n\n[I]n deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case Law No. 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.568\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 61, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n262.\n\nAnother example is the arbitral tribunal's decision in *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, holding that:\n\nUnilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction are standing offers made by a sovereign State to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Such offers could be incorporated into domestic legislation or not. But, whatever may be their form, they must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to the principles of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.569\n\n*CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 79, **Exhibit CA-2**.\n\n263.\n\nSimilarly, in *Mobil v. Venezuela*, the tribunal decided that:\n\nIt is on the basis of th[e] rules of international law governing the interpretation of unilateral acts formulated within the framework and on the basis of a treaty that this Tribunal will now proceed to the interpretation of Article 22 of the [Venezuelan] Investment Law.\n\nThe Tribunal must add that the fact that domestic law and the international law of treaties are not controlling or dispositive does not mean that they should be completely ignored:\n\n(i)... when tribunals interpret unilateral acts, they must have due regard to the intention of the State having formulated such acts. In this respect domestic law may play a useful role.\n\n(ii) Although the law of the treaties as codified in the Vienna Convention is not relevant in the interpretation of unilateral acts, the provisions of that Convention may 'apply analogously to the extent compatible with the *sui generis* character' of unilateral acts.570\n\n*Mobil v. Venezuela*, at paras. 95-96, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, where national investment legislation is claimed to contain a standing offer to arbitrate under an international instrument, such as the ICSID Convention, that provision constitutes a unilateral declaration made by a State that is rooted in the national legal order of that State, but that also (assertedly) produces effects under international law. To use the words of the *SPP* tribunal, unlike a treaty, Section 39 of the IPA \"is not the result of negotiations between two or more States, but rather the result of a unilateral act by a single State.\"571\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 59, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n265.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal concludes that such legislative provisions are of a \"hybrid\" nature. As a consequence, interpretation of those provisions must also be approached from a hybrid perspective, taking into account both that State's domestic law on statutory construction and international law. Where the principles of interpretation under the State's domestic law conflict with international law principles, international law principles will ordinarily prevail, although this is an issue that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, in light of the nature of the conflict. In general, the relevant rules of international law would be *sui generis*, reflecting the character of unilateral acts, but the Vienna Convention's provisions will often be applicable by analogy.\n\n266.\n\nBeyond the general agreement that both international and PNG law are relevant to a certain extent, one of the specific areas of disagreement that emerges from the Parties' submissions is whether the *effet utile* principle should apply to the interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA. The Claimant argues that *effet utile* should apply as one of the common canons of statutory construction; it was applied in the ICSID arbitration context in *SPP v. Egypt*572 and otherwise exists in an equivalent form under Section 190(4) of the PNG Constitution.573 The Respondent argues that *effet utile* should not apply because it \"is now no longer taken into account in interpreting state's unilateral declarations, including its domestic legislation,\" as distinguished from treaties.574\n\n*See above* at paras. 55(c), 94-95. *See also above* at paras. 98, 115-116, 152, 176, 216.\n\n*See above* at para. 106.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 37. *See above* at para. 55(c).\n\n267.\n\n*Effet utile* has been recognized as one of the principles of treaty interpretation under international law.575 However, whether this principle applies to the interpretation of unilateral declarations of the States has been less fully considered, particularly in the context of investment arbitration. In *SPP*, the arbitral tribunal referred to *effet utile* as a principle of statutory interpretation, noting that:\n\n\"Under general principles of statutory interpretation, a legal text should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word in the text.\"576 By contrast, in *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, the tribunal refused to apply the principle of *effet utile* to unilateral declarations, relying on ICJ judgments in *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* and *Fisheries Jurisdiction*.577\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Fisheries Jurisdiction* (Spain v. Canada), ICJ Reports 1998, p. 455, at para. 52 (The principle of effectiveness \"[c]ertainly. has an important role in the law of treaties and in the jurisprudence of this Court.\"), **Exhibit CA-37, RL-54** and **Annex 33 to Dolzer Report** ; *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* (United Kingdom v. Iran), ICJ Reports 1952, p. 105 (The Court recognized that the principle of *effet utile* \"should in general be applied when interpreting the text of a treaty.\"), **Exhibit CA-35** (cited in *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 110, **Exhibit CA-2**);. *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, at para. 110 (referring to \"the rule *ut magis valeat quam pereat* ('effet utile')\"), **Exhibit CA-31** ; *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 107, **Exhibit CA-2**. The Tribunal has found no authority to cause it to doubt the conclusions in these decisions. *See, e.g., Pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Co. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13, and *BP America Production Co. and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on Preliminary Objections, 27 July 2006, at para. 132 (\"Given [the parties' silence], the provision must be considered to carry some legal meaning on account of the rule *ut magis valeat quam pereat* ('*effet utile*').\"); *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 9 November 2004, at para. 95 (\"Such an interpretation [of a Treaty provision] runs counter to the general principle of effectiveness ('effet utile') and for that reason also ought to be set aside.\").\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 94, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n*See* *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at paras. 110-112, **Exhibit CA-2**. *See also* *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at para. 118, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n268.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as explained above, provisions of domestic investment legislation that assertedly contain the State's standing offer to arbitrate must be interpreted taking into account both international law and the law of that State. Regardless of whether it applies to \"pure\" unilateral declarations made by States under international law, the Tribunal is of the view that *effet utile* is one of the common principles of statutory construction that generally apply to the interpretation of such \"hybrid\" provisions.\n\n269.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the same considerations that warrant application of *effet utile* to treaties apply fully to \"hybrid\" instruments like Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA: States ordinarily intend their legislative acts, particularly in the context of investment legislation, to have meaning and to produce consequences, rather than to be empty or meaningless. *Effet utile* gives effect to that common sense proposition.\n\n*B. Interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties disagree as to the meaning of Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA. The Claimant maintains that:\n\n[I]nterpreted objectively and in good faith, Section 39 of the IPA is, at its most basic level, a deliberate statement by the State that disputes arising out of foreign investment are subject to resolution in accordance with the ICSID Convention....578\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the context and purpose of the PNG legislation, as well as subsequent practice of the Respondent, confirm this interpretation.579\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 204. *See above* at paras. 108-111.\n\n*See above* at paras. 112-114.\n\n271.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent argues that, \"regardless of whether a literal, contextual or purposive interpretation is taken of Section 39 and Section 2, no '*consent in writing*' necessary for ICSID's jurisdiction over the matter may be construed from either Section 39 or Section 2.\"580\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 24.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal's mandate therefore requires it to interpret Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA, in light of the Parties' submissions, to determine their meaning and legal significance. These provisions of PNG law have not been previously interpreted or applied by any international arbitral tribunal, and the Tribunal's task is therefore one of first impression.\n\n273.\n\nPreliminarily, like other investment tribunals faced with an analogous interpretive task, the Tribunal considers that, although the Respondent's interpretation of its own legislation \"is unquestionably entitled to considerable weight, it cannot control the Tribunal's decision as to its own competence.\"581 It is for the Tribunal itself, applying the principles of construction set out above, independently to construe the relevant provisions of PNG law. The Respondent's interpretation is of relevance, but no more so than that of other parties; the decisive issue is how the text of the legislative provision, in all the circumstances, would be understood by those to whom it is addressed.\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 60, **Exhibit CA-3**. *See also* *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 70 (\"[A] sovereign State's interpretation of its own unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is not binding on the tribunal or determinative of jurisdictional issues. Thus the interpretation given to Article 22 by Venezuelan authorities or by Venezuelan courts cannot control the Tribunal's decision on its competence.\"), **Exhibit CA-2** ; *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at para. 75, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n274.\n\nIn fulfilling its interpretive mandate, the Tribunal analyzes the relevant statutory provisions in light of the ordinary meaning of their language, objectively construed, as well as their purpose and relevant context. The Tribunal also considers the legislative history of these provisions and the investment promotion materials as part of the relevant context in which the legislation was adopted and understood.\n\n1. Textual Interpretation\n-------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe starting point of interpretation of PNG investment legislation is the ordinary or grammatical meaning of the words used in the relevant statutory provisions, objectively construed, as they would be understood by a reasonable investor or other addressee.582\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 74, **Exhibit CA-3** ; *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 90, **Exhibit CA-2**.\n\n276.\n\nThe critical provisions on which the Tribunals' decision turns are Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA. Article 2 of the IDCA provides that \"[a] dispute shall not be referred to the Centre unless the dispute is fundamental to the investment itself.\"583 In turn, according to Section 39 of the IPA, \"[t]he *Investment Disputes Convention Act 1978*, implementing the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, applies, according to its terms, to disputes arising out of foreign investment.\"584\n\nIDCA (as amended in 1982), at Section 2, p. 2, **Exhibit CL-2**.\n\nIPA, at Section 39, **Exhibit CL-1**.\n\n277.\n\nThe instrument upon which the Claimant principally relies in arguing that the Respondent has made a standing offer to arbitrate disputes at ICSID is the IPA, and specifically its Section 39. The Claimant's submissions on this issue have evolved through this arbitral proceeding, from the initial position articulated in the Claimant's Request for Arbitration - \"[e]ither on its own, or when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA, Section 39 of the IPA constitutes a standing offer by the Respondent to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID\"585 - to the position that Section 39 of the IPA constitutes \"consent in writing,\" which requirement \"is satisfied by the word '*applies* '.\"586\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at para. 67. *See above* at para. 41.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, at para. 34. *See above* at para. 179.\n\n278.\n\nIn reply, and as detailed above, the Respondent submits that literal interpretations of the IPA and the IDCA \"leave no doubt that the State has not consented to ICSID arbitration,\"587 because Section 39 of the IPA merely provides that the IDCA \"applies, according to its terms,\" and thus refers back to the IDCA, and is therefore subject to the requirement of a separate \"consent in writing,\"588 not independently provided by either Section 2 or Section 39.\n\n*See above* at paras. 52-59.\n\n*See above* at paras. 52-59, 66.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' arguments and submissions, which have been both thorough and of great assistance. The Tribunal records with particular appreciation the value of the oral and written submissions of both Parties' counsel.\n\n280.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the meaning of Section 39 of the IPA turns on the interpretation of the statement that the IDCA \"applies, according to its terms.\" It is this text, and ultimately only this text, that provides, or fails to provide, the State's standing offer to arbitrate.\n\n281.\n\nThe Parties agree that, grammatically, Section 39's reference to \"its terms\" means the terms of the IDCA, rather than those of the ICSID Convention.589 The IDCA attaches the ICSID Convention, as an annex, and implements the Convention, but IPA Section 39's reference is, as the Parties agree, to the IDCA, not the Convention. The Parties are in disagreement, however, concerning the meaning of, and relationship between, the words \"applies\" and \"according to its terms,\" as used in Section 39.\n\n*See above* at paras. 53, 66, 109, 111(b), 150(c), 153, 198-200.\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the words \"applies\" and \"according to its terms\" play two distinct functions: the word \"*applies*\" has an \"*independent* function - it declares the State's consent,\" whereas the words \"*according to its terms*\" are \"cross-referential and fundamentally concerned with... ensuring that the scope of the State's consent is limited according to the terms of IDCA Section 2\" (*i.e*., to disputes that are fundamental to investment itself).\"590 According to the Claimant, the word \"terms\" encompasses \"all of the articles of the ICSID Convention,\" including Article 25's requirement of consent in writing, which is then satisfied by the preceding word \"applies.\"591 Put simply, the Claimant argues that, by declaring all of the ICSID Convention applicable to investment disputes, Section 39 of the IPA provides the written consent required by Article 25 of the Convention.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 208. *See above* at para. 109.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 209. *See above* at para. 109.\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this is an \"artificial way of construing\" Section 39's decisive phrase; rather, the expression \"applies, according to its terms\" \"should be construed together... [and] 'according to its terms' governs or limits the application,\" which \"includes the consent in writing\" and \"the issue about nationals of contracting states.\"592 In other words, the Respondent argues that the word \"terms\" encompasses all the requirements of the ICSID Convention, including Article 25's \"consent in writing\" requirement, and that this requirement is not satisfied by Section 39 itself.593\n\nDT(Day1).30.12-19. *See above* at paras. 201-202.\n\n*See above* at para. 203.\n\n284.\n\nThese arguments are finely balanced and the proper interpretation of Section 39 is by no means free from doubt. Nonetheless, reading the words of the legislation literally, the Tribunal concludes that Section 39 of the IPA simply refers the reader to the IDCA, which \"applies, according to its terms.\" The terms of Section 39, read literally, do nothing more than declare that the IDCA applies, without adding to the content of the IDCA.\n\n285.\n\nAs both Parties appear to acknowledge, Section 39 refers to all of the terms of the IDCA. There is no exception in Section 39's text for any of the \"terms\" of the IDCA that are made applicable through the operation of Section 39.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to discern, in this general reference to the IDCA, anything that would qualify as an independent consent to ICSID jurisdiction by the State. In the Tribunal's view, Section 39's natural and ordinary meaning is a declaration that the terms - all the terms - of the IDCA apply to foreign investments. Nothing in Section 39's text does more than that.\n\n287.\n\nThere is nothing in Section 39's general reference to the IDCA that can fairly be read to satisfy the specific requirement for written consent to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 25 of the Convention. There is no specific reference to consent or ICSID jurisdiction in Section 39, or in the IDCA, apart from Section 2 of the IDCA (which, as discussed below, contains no such consent). In particular, there is nothing in Section 39 that indicates that Article 25's requirement for consent is satisfied, or waived, in future cases. If anything, the general reference of Section 39 reaffirms the continued application of the requirement for consent, \"according to its terms,\" rather than fulfills or waives it.\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that Section 2 of the IDCA does not provide consent to ICSID jurisdiction. That is the Respondent's position,594 and the Claimant accepts this as well595 (although its initial position was arguably to the contrary596).\n\n*See above* at paras. 57-58, 62, 66, 148, 196-197, 216.\n\n*See above* at paras. 179, 225(c).\n\nAs explained above, the Claimant's original position on consent was that \"[e]ither on its own, ***or when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA***, Section 39 of the IPA constitutes a standing offer by the Respondent to arbitrate investment disputes at ICSID.\" Request for Arbitration, at para. 57.\n\n289.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Parties' positons regarding Section 2 are correct: the provision does not grant consent, but instead limits the cases in which future consent may be given. The function, and the only function, of Section 2 of the IDCA is to narrow the category of disputes that may be referred to ICSID to disputes that are \"fundamental to the investment itself.\"\n\n290.\n\nSection 2 does not eliminate, and does not affirmatively satisfy, the requirement of \"consent in writing\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Instead, this language simply mirrors the Respondent's 1978 Notification, in which it informed ICSID of its \"wish[] to exclude certain types of disputes from ICSID's jurisdiction. [and] will only consider submitting those disputes to the Centre which are fundamental to the investment itself.\"597 Indeed, Section 2 very clearly contemplates that future consent is required for submission to ICSID jurisdiction. Section 2 not only does not provide consent; it makes clear that future consent is required.\n\n*See above* at para. 65.\n\n291.\n\nLikewise, there is nothing else in the IDCA, beyond Section 2, that would constitute consent to ICSID jurisdiction. The Claimant does not point to any other provisions of the IDCA that would have this effect or purpose. In any event, that is the clear import of the IDCA's text: it is Section 2 of the IDCA that is the only part of the statute that is addressed to the issue of ICSID jurisdiction. As already discussed, nothing in that provision provides consent to ICSID jurisdiction; on the contrary, the provision clearly contemplates a requirement that consent be provided in a future investment dispute.\n\n292.\n\nThus, Section 39's reference to the IDCA, including Section 2 of the IDCA, does not incorporate any consent to ICSID jurisdiction from the IDCA. That is because, as the text of Section 2 makes clear, and as the Parties agree, the IDCA does not contain any such consent. Thus, by making the IDCA applicable to investment disputes, Section 39 does not incorporate anything that can be regarded as consent to ICSID jurisdiction. And the act of \"apply[ing]\" the IDCA to investment disputes does not, if the IDCA contains no consent to ICSID jurisdiction, itself constitute consent to jurisdiction. Put simply, neither Section 2 standing alone, nor Section 39's incorporation of Section 2, provides consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to conclude that Section 39's statement that the IDCA \"applies\" separately constitutes consent to ICSID jurisdiction. The statutory declaration that the IDCA applies, read literally, is only a confirmation that the IDCA is in force and applicable to investment disputes. That declaration adds nothing by way of consent that the IDCA does not already provide (and, as noted above, the IDCA concededly does not provide the requisite consent to the ICSID jurisdiction, and, on the contrary envisages that consent must be given with respect to future disputes).\n\n294.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this interpretation is confirmed by Section 39's reference to \"according to its terms\" (*i.e.*, \"according to [the IDCA's] terms\"). That language makes even more clear that Section 39 does not add anything to what was contained in the IDCA, but merely declares the IDCA's applicability - whatever the IDCA's terms may be.\n\n295.\n\nIn this regard, ICSID decisions cited by the Parties do not provide any reason to arrive at a different interpretation of Section 2 or Section 39. As summarized above, the Parties relied on several ICSID awards which interpreted and applied provisions of Egyptian598 and Venezuelan599 investment law. None of those cases materially alters the Tribunal's interpretive task in this arbitration because they dealt with very different wording in different legislative provisions.\n\nArticle 8 of the Egyptian Investment Law: \"Investment Disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's home country, or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of International Disputes between the State and nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law No. 90 of 1971, where such law applies.\" *SPP v. Egyp* t, at para. 71, **Exhibit CA-3** ; Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 138.\n\nArticle 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law: \"Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion or protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provision of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, ***if it so provides***, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect.\" *Mobil v. Venezuela*, at para. 68, **Exhibit RL-4** (emphasis added); Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 152. *See also* *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 64, **Exhibit CA-2**.\n\n296.\n\nBecause of the difference in the wording used in the Egypt Investment Law and the Venezuelan Investment Law, on the one hand, and Section 39 of the IPA, on the other hand, the Tribunal considers that extending the solutions reached in *SPP* or any of the Venezuela Cases to the present case would be inappropriate.\n\n297.\n\nIn particular, unlike Article 8 of the Egypt Investment Law, and as the Respondent pointed out,600 Section 39 of the IPA:\n\na. does not contain mandatory language \"shall be settled;\"601\n\nb. does not set forth a \"mandatory and hierarchic sequence of dispute settlement procedures\"602 for resolution of the parties' dispute, including the right to dispute settlement conferred under a bilateral investment treaty, and culminating with the ICSID Convention;603\n\nc. does not contain the language \"within the framework of the Convention for Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law No. 90 of 1971, ***where it (i.e., the Convention) applies***.\"604\n\n*See above* at paras. 54-55, 66(c).\n\n*See SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 74, **Exhibit CA-3**. *See above* at paras. 55, 66(c).\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 116, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n*See SPP v. Egypt*, at paras. 83-88, **Exhibit CA-3**. *See above* at paras. 55-56.\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 71, **Exhibit CA-3**. *See above* at paras. 55, 95(d).\n\n298.\n\nWith regard to the last of the foregoing points, the Respondent noted at the hearing on jurisdiction that such a reference *to the ICSID Convention* that applies would take the provision one step further towards the finding of consent.605 It is common ground, however, that no such language is contained in Section 39 of the IPA.\n\n*See above* at paras. 198-200.\n\n299.\n\nAs noted above, Section 39 instead refers to back to *the IDCA* - *i.e*., the Act, and *not* the ICSID Convention. It is therefore the IDCA, and not the ICSID Convention itself, which \"applies, according to its terms.\" As already noted above, however, it is the Tribunal's view (accepted by the Parties), that nothing in the IDCA provides consent to ICSID jurisdiction.606\n\n*See above* at paras. 288-292.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore need not, and does not, decide whether a different result would be obtained if Section 39 had provided that the ICSID Convention itself, rather than the IDCA, \"applies, according to its terms.\" In that case, not presented here, the Tribunal would need to decide whether the legislation's application of the ICSID Convention directly to foreign investments would constitute consent in writing to ICSID jurisdiction. That is not, however, the present case.\n\n301.\n\nSection 39 refers to, and recognizes the application of the IDCA, but does not do the same with respect to the ICSID Convention itself. The IDCA implements the ICSID Convention in PNG, including by annexing the Convention, but the IDCA is not the same as the ICSID Convention, as the Claimant acknowledges.607 On the contrary, as already discussed, Section 2 of the IDCA fairly clearly provides that future consent - and only future consent in some categories - is necessary. Whatever the effect of direct and specific application of the ICSID Convention itself might be, the Tribunal is satisfied that application of the IDCA, including particularly Section 2 of the IDCA, does not constitute advance consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*See above* at para. 225.\n\n302.\n\nMoreover, as the Claimant pointed out,608 unlike Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law, Section 39 of the IPA:\n\na. does not refer to an obligation relating to the settlement of disputes (\"shall be submitted to international arbitration\");609\n\nb. does not contain \"certain conditions\" to which the obligation to submit disputes to arbitration is subject, including the conditional language \"if it so provides;\"610\n\nc. does not contain language that renders two interpretations \"grammatically possible\" - one referring to international arbitration, and the other referring to the obligation to submit disputes to arbitration;611\n\nd. does not make any reference to the ICSID Convention but only refers to the IDCA.\n\n*See above* at para. 97.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Mobil v. Venezuel* a, at paras. 101-111, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Mobil v. Venezuel* a, at paras. 98 (\"The Parties agree that [Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law] creates an obligation to go to arbitration subject to certain conditions and in particular subject to the last condition thus incorporated in Article 22. But they disagree on the interpretation to be given to that condition.\"), 101-111, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Mobil v. Venezuel* a, at paras. 109-110, **Exhibit RL-4**.\n\n303.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal agrees that the different text of the Venezuelan Investment Law makes awards interpreting it of limited relevance here. Suffice it to say, however, that none of the awards provides any reason for the Tribunal to adopt a different reading of Section 39 from that set forth above.\n\n2. Effet Utile\n--------------\n\n304.\n\nAs noted above,612 in the Tribunal's view, the principle of *effet utile* applies to the interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA in this case.\n\n*See above* at para. 266-269.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Section 39 of the IPA would be \"a provision without content\" if the Tribunal were to adopt the Respondent's textual interpretation.613 According to the Respondent, Section 39 - like other analogous investment legislation provisions - \"could serve useful purposes, *e.g*., to recall and confirm the state's commitments under ICSID or to '*clear the way for the State to conclude specific types of dispute resolution agreement,**without internal issues such as ultra vires arising, and as such... [provide] a degree of certainty for investors'*.\"614 The Respondent also argues that, within the wider context of the IPA, Section 39 \"does serve a purpose to tell investors that ICSID arbitration may be available;\"615 \"there is a purpose in putting everything in one statute, so that parties reading it can be made aware of it.\"616\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 38. *See above* at para. 152.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 39. *See above* at paras. 55, 152, 157, 202, 213.\n\nDT(Day1).35.07-11.\n\nDT(Day1).35.15-17.\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"neither of these alleged purposes is convincing - first because there was no need for the provision to do either of these things, and secondly, because there is no evidence that either was what the State intended.\"617 The Claimant argues that the result of the application of *effet utile* in this case is two-fold: (i) \"it triggers the actual application of the ICSID Convention to this dispute;\" and (ii) it requires the Tribunal \"to dismiss the State's argument that [Section 39] merely serves to affirm the State's commitment to the ICSID system,\" which has already been affirmed twice - when the Respondent ratified the ICSID Convention, and when the Respondent passed the IDCA, \"which implemented the Convention locally.\"618 In other words, if Section 39 of the IPA does not provide the Respondent's consent to arbitrate, it serves no meaningful purpose.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, at para. 43. *See also* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, at paras. 44-52.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 268.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that *effet utile* does not authorize the Tribunal to re-write the legislative provisions.619 As acknowledged by the Claimant, \"intent and good faith come first,\"620 whereas *effet utile* plays a subsidiary role in determining intent. As the *CEMEX v. Venezuela* tribunal explained, *effet utile* \"does not require that a maximum effect be given to a text;\" rather, \"[i]t only excludes interpretations which would render the text meaningless, when a meaningful interpretation is possible.\"621\n\n*See* DT(Day1).37.22-24. *See above* at para. 216.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 263.\n\n*CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 114, **Exhibit CA-2**. *See* Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 264. *See above* at paras. 115, 269.\n\n308.\n\nThat said, the principle of *effet utile* is an important interpretive tool. As noted above, it rests on the natural proposition that meaning should be given to the words of States, rather than the opposite. As other ICSID tribunals pointed out, this principle requires rejecting or disfavoring interpretations of treaties and similar instruments that would render particular provisions or language either meaningless or redundant.622\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 114, **Exhibit CA-2** ; *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, at para. 261, **Exhibit CA-1**. *See also Pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Co. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13, and *BP America Production Co. and Others v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/8, Decision on Preliminary Objections dated 27 July 2006, at para. 132 (\"Given [the parties' silence], the provision must be considered to carry some legal meaning on account of the rule *ut magis valeat quam pereat* ('*effet utile*').\"); *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 9 November 2004, at para. 95 (\"Such an interpretation [of a Treaty provision] runs counter to the general principle of effectiveness ('effet utile') and for that reason also ought to be set aside.\"); *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 October 2006, at para. 52 (\"[W]henever possible, terms must be interpreted literally and given practical effect, which excludes redundancy.\")\n\n309.\n\nNonetheless, there are serious reasons for applying this principle - disfavoring *ex abundanti cautela* interpretations - with circumspection in the context of unilateral declarations.623 The rationale of this position applies, in part, to national investment legislation which, as discussed above, has a hybrid character.624 In particular, unlike cases involving negotiated, bilateral treaties, a State's legislation may in some circumstances be merely confirmatory. Critically, however, this remains a question of interpretation, in particular cases, of specific language. The presumption against *ex abundanti cautela*, whatever its precise terms, is merely an aid to what remains the objective construction of specific words in a particular context.\n\n*See*, *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.* (United Kingdom v. Iran), ICJ Reports 1952, at p. 105, **Exhibit CA-35** ; ILC Guiding Principles applicable to Unilateral Declarations of States Capable of Creating Legal Obligations (2006), Article 7, Commentary (3), **Exhibit RL-19.**\n\n*See above* at para. 265.\n\n310.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, application of *effet utile* does not provide a basis for finding consent to ICSID jurisdiction in Section 39. As explained above, the language of Section 39 of the IPA - even when read in conjunction with Section 2 of the IDCA - is insufficient to establish the Respondent's \"consent in writing\" to ICSID jurisdiction. It is therefore not simply a matter of selecting between two plausible interpretations that follow from the grammatical meaning of the provisions. Finding consent in Section 39 requires going beyond, and to some extent against, the words of this provision.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no basis for doing so. Section 39 of the IPA serves a useful purpose, particularly in the context of a comprehensive national investment statute, even if it does not provide the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate at ICSID. As the Respondent pointed out, even on its interpretation, Section 39 serves constructive purposes, including declaring the continued applicability of the IDCA, notwithstanding the later enactment of the IPA; providing all material information regarding investors' potential rights in one comprehensive statute;625 and clearing \"the way for the State to conclude specific types of dispute resolution agreements.\"626\n\n*See above* at paras. 55, 152, 157, 202, 213.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, at para. 39.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant's argument that the Respondent did not need to reaffirm its commitment to the ICSID Convention in Section 39 because it \"has already been affirmed twice.\"627 The Tribunal considers that the IPA sought to set forth a relatively detailed and comprehensive legislative regime addressing foreign investments. In that context, recording the continued force and effect of a prior legislative enactment, for the benefit of readers (including investors and courts), serves a useful purpose. The fact that the statute might, perhaps, have been interpreted to reach the same result, even absent Section 39, does not render the provision useless.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 268. *See above* at para. 116.\n\n313.\n\nSection 39's purpose is to provide a limited form of investment guarantee - *i.e*., access to ICSID arbitration - which will be available, but only if the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are satisfied (*i.e*., that there is a an investor from another ICSID Contracting State, an investment, a legal dispute, and consent in writing being provided by the parties). Section 39 provides this limited protection, without also providing a further offer to arbitrate then and there.\n\n314.\n\nThis result is not unusual. It is not uncommon for national legislation (and investment treaties) to set out provisions that are conditional upon completion of certain conditions. This is what Section 39 does: it refers to the conditions in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as implemented by the IDCA, and does not do more or less.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimant agrees that all of the Article 25 requirements must be satisfied, but contends that the word \"applies\" \"declares the State's consent.\"628 As explained above, the Tribunal sees no reason to differentiate between Article 25's consent requirement, on the one hand, and the other Article 25 requirements, on the other hand. It is therefore unable to conclude that Section 39's statement that the IDCA \"applies\" separately constitutes consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n*See above* at para. 109.\n\n316.\n\nPNG law principles reinforce the Tribunal's conclusion. As pointed out by the Claimant, PNG law contains a principle analogous to *effet utile*.629 As a general matter, as set out in Part 2, Schedule 2.2 of the PNG Constitution, PNG law applies the rules and principles of English common law in force as at immediately before PNG's independence.630 It is a well-established common law principle of statutory interpretation that a court should strive to give effect to every element of a statutory enactment.631\n\n*See above* at para. 106(b).\n\n*See* First Griffin QC Report, at paras. 16-23; Schedule 2.2 of the Constitution of Papua New Guinea, Annex A3 to First Griffin QC Report; *Wahgi Savings & Loan Society Ltd. v. Bank of South Pacific Ltd*. [1980] PGSC 4 (per Kapi J), at pp. 15-16, Annex B1 to First Griffin QC Report.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Hill v. William Hill (Park Lane) Ltd*. [1949] AC 530, at pp. 546-547 (\"The rule that a meaning should, if possible, be given to every word in the statute implies that, unless there is good reason to the contrary, the words add something which would not be there if the words were left out.\"), **Exhibit CA-47**.\n\n317.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, Section 39 is not meaningless or useless if it is not interpreted as constituting a standing offer to arbitrate; rather, it serves several possible purposes or functions. Nothing has been advanced by the Parties regarding PNG law that would conflict with the Tribunal's conclusion above, resulting from the application of *effet utile.*\n\n3. Context and Purpose\n----------------------\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal has also carefully considered the Parties' submissions on the context and purpose of Section 39 of the IPA.\n\n319.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the purpose and context of the IPA, including the place of Section 39 in the chapter entitled \"Investment Guarantees,\" and Sections 37 and 38 of the IPA, as confirming its case on consent.632 The Respondent submits that neither the purpose of the IPA nor Sections 37 and 38 of the IPA indicate that \"consent in writing\" was provided in Section 39.633 The Parties also discuss the Respondent's BITs concluded prior to and around the time the IPA was enacted; the Respondent argues that these BITs contain clear language of express consent and show that the Respondent knows how to phrase its \"consent in writing\" when one is provided.634\n\n*See above* at paras. 112, 226(e).\n\n*See above* at paras. 60-66, 205-215.\n\n*See above* at paras. 61(c), 84, 88, 95(f), 117(d), 209.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal examines the main elements of the Parties' context and purpose analysis in turn below.\n\n321.\n\n***First***, Section 39's location in Part V of the IPA entitled \"*Investment Guarantees*\" does not in and of itself indicate that Section 39 sets forth an automatic right to neutral, international adjudication. The suggestion that inclusion of Section 39 in a Part of the legislation titled \"Investment *Guarantees*\" connotes an intention to confer an immediate right to international adjudication has a measure of credibility.\n\n322.\n\nOn more careful consideration, however, the title of Part V is of minimal assistance. If one assumes that Section 39 contains \"guarantees,\" by virtue of its inclusion in Part V (labelled \"Investment Guarantees\"), it remains necessary to ascertain the content of those \"investment guarantees.\"\n\n323.\n\nAs explained above,635 the wording of Section 39 itself does not allow the Tribunal to conclude that the provision sets forth a right to arbitrate, absent a further \"consent in writing\" by the Respondent. What Section 39 identifies as \"guarantees,\" therefore, are the provisions of the IDCA and, as incorporated and implemented by the IDCA, the ICSID Convention. Both the statute and the Convention provide significant legal protections (\"guarantees\"), which is sufficient to explain the inclusion of Section 39 in a Part titled \"Investment Guarantees.\" The fact that Section 39 would provide greater legal protection for investors, if interpreted as the Claimant urges, does not alter this conclusion: Part V refers only to \"Guarantees,\" not the most favorable or protective guarantees that could be afforded.\n\n*See above* at paras. 279-303.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the natural interpretation of Section 39 is that it refers back to the investment protections provided by the IDCA. The inclusion of Section 39 in a Part of the IPA entitled \"Investment Guarantees\" does not, in the Tribunal's view, alter the substantive content of Section 39's terms.\n\n325.\n\nMore broadly, the Tribunal is doubtful that Part V's title can provide any substantial assistance in interpreting Section 39. It is noteworthy that Section 37 (like Part V) is entitled \"Investment *Guarantees*,\" while Section 38 is entitled \"The Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment *Guarantee* Agency.\" An entirely plausible explanation for the title to Part V (\"Investment Guarantees\") is that it refers to the fact that two of the three provisions in Part V are concerned with guarantees. There is no necessary reason that Section 39 itself must be regarded as concerning guarantees, merely by virtue of its placement in Part V.636 But, even assuming it does, then, as discussed above, that title provides no real guidance in determining what the content of Section 39's guarantees are.\n\nFurther, neither the Parties nor the Tribunal have any doubt that Sections 37 and 38 of the IPA extend \"investment guarantees\" to investors. As the Respondent pointed out, those provisions are phrased in mandatory terms (\"shall\") and set out specific rights. In contrast, Section 39 contains no such mandatory language, suggesting that it was not in fact intended to give investors the automatic right to international adjudication.\n\n326.\n\nSimilarly, Section 39 is entitled \"International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\" Section 39 is not titled \"Enforcement of Investment Guarantees,\" nor \"Guarantee of ICSID Arbitration.\" The most that can be drawn from the titles to Part V and Section 39 is that the provision contains guarantees of some sort, and that the content of these is set out in the terms of that provision, implementing the ICSID Convention.\n\n327.\n\n***Second***, the general purpose of the IPA also does not provide any basis for reaching a different conclusion. It is not disputed that one of the purposes of the IPA was to promote foreign investment; however, as the Respondent pointed out, there were other purposes, on which the parliamentary debate was focused, including the creation of the Investment Promotion Authority. More fundamentally, there are a variety of balances that could be struck in promoting foreign investment, and that general objective does not compel one interpretation or another of Section 39.\n\n328.\n\n***Third***, as explained in Section V.B.4 below, the legislative history of the relevant PNG legislation does not assist the Tribunal in reaching a definitive conclusion either.637\n\n*See below* at Section V.B.4.\n\n329.\n\n***Finally***, the reference to the BITs entered into by the Respondent also does not advance the analysis. On this point, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that BITs relied upon by the Respondent are irrelevant, to the extent that they are not contemporaneous to the IPA; even where they are contemporaneous, they bear \"no evidentiary value\"638 of the Respondent's intent behind a separate, unrelated provision of domestic investment law.\n\n*See above* at para. 117(d).\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the arbitral tribunal's analysis in *CEMEX v. Venezuela* in addressing similar arguments. The *CEMEX* tribunal noted that acceptance of arbitration clauses in BITs by Venezuela \"does not imply that Venezuela was ready to accept such an obligation vis-\u00e0-vis States with which it had no BIT. One cannot draw from Article 1 [*i.e*., investment promotion purposes of the Venezuelan Investment Law] and from the Law as a whole the conclusion that Article 22 must be interpreted as establishing consent by Venezuela to submit to arbitration all potential disputes falling within the ambit of the ICSID Convention.\"639\n\n*CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 120, **Exhibit CA-2**.\n\n331.\n\nThe *CEMEX* tribunal concluded that:\n\n[T]he Tribunal cannot draw from this general evolution the conclusion that Venezuela, when adopting Article 22, intended to give in advance a general consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of any Treaty. ***For a State to commit itself through treaties******creating reciprocal obligations is one thing; to commit itself unilaterally without counterpart is another***.640\n\n*CEMEX v. Venezuela*, at para. 126, **Exhibit CA-2** (emphasis added).\n\n332.\n\nIn this case, the reference to the various BITs does not advance the discussion on whether Section 39 of the IPA constitutes the Respondent's \"consent in writing,\" other than to illustrate the examples of possible language in which the Respondent's consent may be expressed.641 The language of the various BITs is irrelevant either for establishing the Respondent's consent, or, conversely, for disproving its existence in Section 39 of the IPA.\n\n*See SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 111, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n4. Legislative History of the IPA and the IDCA\n----------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nThe Parties exchanged detailed submissions on the legislative history of the IPA and the IDCA, including the 1991 text of the IPA (the \"1991 Bill\"); Hansards of the 1991 Bill and the 1992 IPA; Hansards of the 1978 IDCA and its 1982 amendment.642\n\n*See above* at paras. 64(b), 154-158, 181-182, 208, 225.\n\n334.\n\nThe Claimant has attached substantial significance to the legislative history of the IPA and the IDCA. According to the Claimant, the evolution that the relevant legislative provisions of PNG law underwent support its case on consent, because this evolution shows that \"there was a progression towards consent over the three pieces of legislation.\"643 The Claimant further argues that legislative history evidences the Respondent's intention and desire to improve the investment protection climate in PNG and attract foreign investment.644\n\n*See above* at para. 225.\n\n*See above* at para. 225(e).\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, argues that the legislative history supports its position because, *inter alia*, it shows that the Respondent removed from the 1992 IPA the standing offer to arbitrate \"non-dollar\" disputes that was set out in the 1991 Bill, and that the purpose of enacting the IPA was primarily to create the Investment Promotion Authority.645 The Respondent argues that the 1991 Bill is irrelevant because it never entered into force, and was superseded by the 1992 IPA;646 the 1991 Bill was imperfect because it was adopted hastily, and was therefore substituted by the 1992 final version currently in force, in an effort to \"improve\" the previous version.647\n\n*See above* at paras. 154, 156.\n\n*See above* at para. 154.\n\n*See above* at para. 154.\n\na) Legislative History of Section 39 of the IPA\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nAs explained below, the Tribunal is of the view that, contrary to the Claimant's suggestions, the evolution of the legislation - and in particular the change of language between the 1991 Bill and the 1992 IPA - suggests that the Respondent did not intend to extend a standing offer to arbitration under the ICSID Convention in that legislation. Rather, it would appear that the Respondent intended to withdraw what would have become the imperfect offer to arbitrate \"non-dollar\" disputes had the 1991 Bill been enacted, and instead adopted a general statement currently in Section 39 of the IPA that refers back to the IDCA that \"applies, according to its terms.\"\n\n337.\n\nThese inferences are, however, necessarily of uncertain and subsidiary weight. In the Tribunal's view, the fundamental point is that there is nothing in the legislative history that justifies not giving effect to the plain, ordinary reading of Section 39 of the IPA (and Section 2 of the IDCA).\n\n338.\n\nThe legislative history sheds some light on the Respondent's decision-making process in adopting the IPA. As explained below, the language of Section 39 of the IPA significantly changed between the 1991 Bill and the 1992 IPA.\n\n339.\n\nThe text of the two versions of Section 39 of the IPA is provided below:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **1991 Bill, Section 39648** | **1992 IPA, Section 39 (current****version)649** |\n| 1) A dispute resulting from interpretation or application of this Act shall be settled by the competent Papua New Guinea jurisdiction in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country. a. however, unless otherwise agreed by the parties concerned, disputes between Papua New Guinea State and foreign nationals relating to the application or interpretation of this code shall be settled definitively in arbitration conducted - | The Investment Disputes Convention Act 1978, implementing the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, applies, according to its terms, to disputes arising out of foreign investment.\" |\n| i. in accordance with the provisions of the convention of March 18 1965, on the 'Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States' adopted under the aegis of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and ratified by the State; and |  |\n| ii. if the person or business concerned does not meet the nationality requirements stipulated in Article 25 of this convention, in accordance with the provisions of the additional mechanism approved on September 27 1978, by the Administrative Council of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). |  |\n| 2) By agreement between the Government and investors in an enterprise certified under Part IV, any disputes arising out of the activities of that enterprise may be referred to international arbitration under the convention of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) or to any other international arbitration body to which the State is a beneficiary.\" |  |\n\nSections 37 and 39 of the 1991 IPA Act, **Exhibit CL-51**.\n\nInvestment Promotion Act 1992, **Exhibit CL-1**.\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that Section 39(1)(a) of the 1991 Bill contained language that, had the 1991 Bill been enacted, would have constituted the Respondent's standing offer to arbitrate \"non-dollar\" disputes in ICSID arbitration (and arguably \"dollar\" disputes as well).650 In the Tribunal's view, however, the version of Section 39 in the 1991 Bill does not materially assist with construction of Section 39 of the 1992 Act. The two provisions differ so significantly that it is impossible to draw any guidance from the 1991 Bill as to the meaning of the wording in the current text of Section 39. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the 1991 Bill \"affords [the Tribunal] no guidance in terms of construing the current IPA.\"651\n\n*See above* at paras. 112(b), 182, 225(d).\n\nDT(Day1).59.19-20.\n\n341.\n\nThe Hansards of the 1991 Bill and the 1992 IPA also do not provide any guidance for establishing the legislators' intention on the issue of consent. The Hansard of the 1991 Bill indicates that the purposes of that Act included, *inter alia*, \"[t]o promote and facilitate investment in Papua New Guinea for domestic and foreign investors;\" and \"[t]o establish an Investment Promotion Authority.\"652 It also indicates that the legislator intended to \"encourage both domestic and foreign investors particularly through assistance in setting up joint ventures, to bring together the expertise of both parties.\"653 The Hansard of the 1991 Bill does not make any mention of ICSID, let alone any consent granted by the Respondent to arbitrate disputes with foreign investors at ICSID.654\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, at p. 48.\n\n**Exhibit RE-18**, at p. 49.\n\n*See above* at paras. 64(b), 154(d).\n\n342.\n\nThe Hansard of the 1992 IPA655 also does not shed light on the intention behind the text of Section 39 of the IPA. The Claimant maintains that the Hansard of the 1992 Act aimed to \"improve\" the 1991 Bill, which could mean \"an improvement from the point of view of the aims which [the Minister] articulated, which included to promote private sector investment as well as meet conditions set under the World Bank structural adjustment loan.\"656 According to the Claimant, because the purpose of the 1992 Act was to \"improve\" the 1991 text,657 the current Section 39 shows that the Respondent \"made a conscious decision to broaden the scope of IPA Section 39 and make it more attractive to foreign investors by declaring that the IDCA (and with it the ICSID Convention) applies to foreign investment disputes, rather than just disputes about the 'interpretation or application' of the IPA.\"658\n\nSecond Reading of the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991, **Exhibit RE-16**.\n\nDT(Day1).148.15-18.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 230. *See also* Second Reading of the IPA Bill 1991, at p. 45 (recording the PNG Minister for Trade and Industry's statements that the 1992 IPA was meant \"to incorporate... improvements\" to the 1991 bill and \"replace and repeal the previous Act.\"), **Exhibit RE-16**.\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 230. The Claimant also argues that \"the 1991 text shows that the State was intending to make an offer of ICSID arbitration in the IPA - on further consideration, the Government realised the offer it made in the 1991 form of the IPA was not good enough to give foreign investors real comfort, and so it took steps to improve the offer in the 1992 revision of the IPA.\" Response on Jurisdiction, at para. 231.\n\n343.\n\nIn contrast, according to the Respondent, this Hansard only indicates that the purpose of the IPA was to streamline procedures through the establishment of the Investment Promotion Authority, and it makes no mention of ICSID or of giving advance consent to ICSID arbitration or of broadening the scope of such consent compared to the previous version of the Act.659 The Respondent argues that the intention of the legislature to make \"improvements\" to the previous version of the Act could be understood from the point of view of the State, rather than from the point of view of foreign investors.660\n\n*See above* at paras. 154, 156, 212-213.\n\n*See above* at para. 208(b).\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant's interpretation of the significance of the removal of the 1991 Bill's language (which, as noted above, could have constituted the Respondent's limited standing offer to arbitrate, had the 1991 Bill been enacted) from Section 39 in the 1992 IPA. The Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant's inference, which is merely based on the intention of PNG legislator to \"improve\" the 1991 text in the 1992 IPA.\n\n345.\n\nThe relevant passage of the 1992 Hansard reads:\n\n[The 1991 Bill] was prepared under considerable time constraints in the light of this Government's ambition to promote private sector investment as well as ambitions to meet conditions set under the World Bank structural adjustment loan. This circumstance resulted in an Act which as it turned out later on ***could be substantially improved***. I therefore decided not to bring the Act into force. Instead I decided ***to incorporate these improvements in this improved Bill which will replace and repeal the previous Act***.661\n\nSecond Reading of the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991, **Exhibit RE-16**, at p. 45 (emphasis added).\n\n346.\n\nAmong the improvements made in the 1992 IPA, the Hansard cites, in particular: (i) the simplification of the certification procedures for foreign investors; (ii) the fact that \"investment guarantees for foreign investors have been strengthened so as to cover all foreign investors, legally operating in the country;\" and (iii) \"several improvements... made in order to strengthen the promotional functions of the Investment Promotion Authority.\"662 However, there is no mention of \"consent in writing\" to ICSID arbitration or any broadening of the standing offer to arbitrate. As noted by the Claimant, the silence may well have meant that the Parliament thought that dispute resolution provisions were just a technicality, and therefore did not address the issue.663\n\nSecond Reading of the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991, **Exhibit RE-16**, at p. 46.\n\n*See above* at para. 225(e).\n\n347.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal does not draw any conclusions, one way or the other, from the silence in the Hansard on the consent to arbitration at ICSID, and agrees with Mr. Webb's suggestion that the Hansard should be \"neutral on the question of interpretation.\" Thus, the 1992 Hansard does not assist with the Tribunal's interpretive task. The general reference to the 1992 IPA's purpose of \"promotion of domestic and foreign investment\" in the Hansard664 does not, in itself, alter the Tribunal's analysis.\n\nSecond Reading of the Investment Promotion Authority Bill 1991, **Exhibit RE-16**, at pp. 45-46.\n\n348.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, absent any clear indication to the contrary in the legislative history, deletion of the standing offer to arbitrate \"non-dollar\" disputes is not indicative of an intention to extend that offer to all categories of disputes. Likewise, the reference to a desire to \"improve\" the 1991 Bill in the 1992 IPA does not materially advance the analysis. As the Respondent pointed out, \"improvement\" is a multi-faceted concept, which could be taken from the perspective of the State or from that of an investor.665 It is also a general reference that did not necessarily extend to provisions regarding ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*See above* at para. 208(b).\n\n349.\n\nIf anything, the legislative history arguably supports the Respondent more than the Claimant. Although Section 39(1)(a) in the 1991 Bill could have constituted a standing offer to refer \"no dollars\" disputes to ICSID arbitration (had the 1991 Bill been enacted), the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the deletion of this language in the 1992 IPA can be understood to suggest that the State \"chose to depart from the wording used\" in the 1991 Bill in the final version of Section 39 in the 1992 IPA;666 that departure would weigh towards the conclusion that the Respondent did not intend to make a standing offer to arbitrate. At a minimum, the replacement of the 1991 language with the current wording of Section 39 cannot be interpreted as broadening the scope of the consent to arbitrate set forth in Section 39(1)(a).667\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at para. 54.\n\n*See above* at para. 154.\n\n350.\n\nOn balance, the legislative history of the IPA appears to show a regression - rather than a progression - in the scope of jurisdictional rights that the Respondent granted to foreign investors. While the 1991 Bill undoubtedly could have contained a standing offer to arbitrate \"non-dollar\" disputes - albeit of limited use - had the 1991 Bill been enacted, the 1992 IPA does not contain that language at all.\n\nb) Legislative History of Section 2 of the IDCA\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the original 1978 IDCA was an act that implemented the ICSID Convention in a comprehensive way, and which also annexed the Convention itself.668 Moreover, the Claimant argues that the 1982 amendment to the IDCA, which removed the requirement to exhaust local remedies,669 took the Respondent quite a long way down the line to an agreement to arbitrate,\" because \"it got rid of a major obstacle to foreign investment, which is the local remedies rule \"670 The Claimant maintains that \"[t]here was nothing that the Papua New Guinea parliament could have done after 1982 that would have made Papua New Guinea more available to ICSID than the expression of a consent to arbitrate. Nothing more was required.\"671\n\n*See above* at para. 225.\n\n*See above* at para. 225(b).\n\nDT(Day1).131.23-132.06. *See above* at para. 225(b).\n\nDT(Day1).146.12-147.03. *See above* at para. 225(f).\n\n352.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Hansard of the 1978 IDCA indicated that consent was not provided in the IDCA itself but rather was required to be provided.672 The Respondent further argues that the Hansard of the 1982 amendment to the IDCA similarly shows that \"there was no attempt to say [that the Respondent is] providing the consent in writing to ICSID;\" rather, the focus of the debate was to eliminate the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies which was reflected in \"the sole change made in 1982\" - *i.e.,* removal of the part of the provision \"about local and diplomatic remedies.\"673\n\n*See* DT(Day2).38.18-39.06. *See above* at para. 208(d).\n\nDT(Day2).40.08-17. *See above* at para. 208(d).\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it useful to provide the text of the original version of Section 2 in the 1978 IDCA and the text of Section 2 resulting from its 1982 amendment:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Original 1978 version of the IDCA, Section 2674 | Section 2 of the IDCA in the Amendment Act (1982)675 |\n| CLASSES OF DISPUTES WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE CENTRE \"A dispute shall not be referred to the Centre unless - | REPEAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SECTION 2 Section 2 of the Principal Act is repealed and replaced by the following: |\n| (a) all administrative and judicial remedies in Papua New Guinea that are appropriate to the dispute have been exhausted; and | \"2. CLASS OF DISPUTES WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE CENTRE |\n| (b) the dispute is fundamental to the investment itself.\" | No dispute shall be referred to the Centre unless the dispute is fundamental to the investment itself.\" |\n\nOriginal 1978 Version of the IDCA, Section 2, **Exhibit CL-53**.\n\nAct No. 14 of 1982 - Section 2 of the IDCA Amendment Act (1982), **Exhibit CL-3**.\n\n354.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the original text of Section 2 and its amended version do not evidence the Respondent's intention to make a standing offer to arbitrate. There is no dispute between the Parties that the 1978 Section 2 of the IDCA did not constitute consent or that the current version of Section 2 does not constitute consent in itself.676 Likewise, the legislative history of the IDCA does not assist the Claimant's case either.\n\n*See above* at paras. 289-290. See *also above* at paras. 57-58, 62, 66, 148, 179, 196-197, 208(d), 216, 225(b)-(c).\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Hansards of the 1978 IDCA and the 1982 Amendment Act indicate that consent in writing was still required in order to permit access to ICSID jurisdiction. This is particularly clear from the Hansard of the original IDCA. That Hansard states that the purpose of that bill \"is to provide for the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes - ICSID - to have internal effect in Papua New Guinea.\"677 It further states that:\n\nThe centre may only be used for dispute settlement after all Papua New Guinea administrative and judicial remedies have been exhausted, ***provided that consent in writing has been given to permit the matter to be brought to the centre***.678\n\nJurisdiction is ceded to the centre only after all Papua New Guinea administrative and judicial remedies have been exhausted, ***provided that consent in writing has been given***.679\n\nSecond Reading of the IDCA Bill 1978, at p. 15/6/2, **Exhibit RE-15**.\n\nSecond Reading of the IDCA Bill 1978, at p. 15/6/1, **Exhibit RE-15** (emphasis added).\n\nSecond Reading of the IDCA Bill 1978, at p. 15/6/2, **Exhibit RE-15** (emphasis added).\n\n356.\n\nIt is clear from the above excerpts that in 1978 there were two pre-conditions for bringing a dispute to ICSID arbitration under the IDCA - (i) exhaustion of local remedies; and (ii) consent in writing. This is also confirmed by the following passage from the Hansard:\n\nBy giving effect to the terms of the Convention, the flow of private international investment into Papua New Guinea should be stimulated. The limitations which should ensure that Papua New Guinea will not be disadvantaged ***in entering any agreement in which ICSID clauses are included***.680\n\nSecond Reading of the IDCA Bill 1978, at p. 15/6/2-3, **Exhibit RE-15** (emphasis added).\n\n357.\n\nIf the 1978 IDCA provided the Respondent's consent in writing within the meaning of Article 25 of the Convention, there would have been no need for \"any agreement in which ICSID clauses are included\" to be entered into.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that the Hansard of the 1982 Amendment Act681 shows that the revisions made to Section 2 were aimed at streamlining the dispute resolution process by removing the first, but only the first, of the above two requirements (*i.e*., the requirement to exhaust local remedies).682 The Hansard states that:\n\nThe Bill will remove from the Act a provision requiring that all domestic remedies be exhausted before this Bill can be referred to ICSID. We have found that the requirement to exhaust all domestic remedies, that is the attempt to settle disputes through all the courts and tribunals in Papua New Guinea has caused difficulty in negotiating contracts for the development of this country. Foreign investers [sic] prefer to be able to apply straight to ICSID if there is a dispute. Their argument is that the process of going to all the courts and tribunals of Papua New Guinea is costly and time consuming. Also the most satisfactory way of settling these disputes is through arbitration not through the judicial process.\n\nMr. Speaker, the Government believes that this agreement will be an incentive to foreign investers [sic] and will enable agreement with those investers [sic] to be concluded more speedily.683\n\nHansard extracts in respect of the IDCA Amendment Act 1982, **Exhibit CL-15**.\n\n*See above* at paras. 208(d), 352.\n\nHansard extracts in respect of the IDCA Amendment Act 1982, **Exhibit CL-15**, at p. 1.\n\n359.\n\nAs the Respondent pointed out, this Hansard demonstrates that the purpose of the 1982 amendment was to remove the requirement for local remedies to be exhausted; nothing was said about removing the second requirement of \"consent in writing.\"684 There is nothing in the Hansard that would indicate the removal of the \"consent\" requirement. The phrase \"prefer to be able to apply straight to ICSID\" does not remove that requirement; rather, when read in the context of the paragraph in which it is contained, it clearly refers to the removal of the requirement to exhaust local remedies as a pre-condition for referral of any dispute to ICSID.\n\n*See above* at para. 208(d).\n\n360.\n\nIn its expert opinion submitted at the registration stage, Professor Crawford opined that \"IDCA s 2 was inserted in 1982 in substitution for an earlier provision requiring exhaustion of local remedies. Again the amendment might be argued to have had some operative effect.\"685 In the Tribunal's view, that amendment indeed had an operative effect - namely, that of removing the requirement to exhaust local remedies as the last additional obstacle to ICSID jurisdiction. Once that obstacle had been removed, investors could submit disputes to ICSID arbitration, provided that there was a \"consent in writing\" from the Respondent.\n\nProf. James Crawford AC SC, *Expert Opinion on the Screening Power of the ICSID Secretary-General under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention in Relation to Papua New Guinea Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Papua New Guinea*, 21 November 2013, at para. 15, **Exhibit RE-2**.\n\n361.\n\nIn light of the foregoing analysis and reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the legislative history of the PNG's investment protection legislation does not change the conclusion that Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA contain no standing offer to arbitrate under the ICSID Convention.686\n\n*See above* at paras. 275-303.\n\n5. Investment Promotion Materials\n---------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turns to the excerpts from the investment promotion materials relied upon by the Claimant. The Claimant argues that, as part of the Respondent's \"subsequent practice,\" the Tribunal should take into account the statements on the Investment Promotion Authority's website, before and after the filing of the Request for Arbitration, and on the PNG Embassy to the Americas website.687\n\n*See above* at paras. 113, 117, 230-233.\n\n363.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, those statements are \"relevant\" because they are statements \"by an official agency authorised to make [them],\" acting within the scope of its statutory mandate of the \"competent body in respect of investment.\"688 The Claimant submits that these statements are \"damning\" for the Respondent because they leave \"no doubt in the reader's mind: if you invest in PNG, and a dispute arises in relation to your investment, your dispute can be adjudicated at ICSID.\"689\n\n*See above* at para. 233(b).\n\nResponse on Jurisdiction, at para. 245. *See above* at para. 113.\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these investment promotion materials are not \"subsequent practice falling within article 31 of the VCLT;\"690 instead, they are purely \"informative\" and \"cannot, on their own, confer 'consent in writing'.\"691 The Respondent submits that, in any event, the excerpts from websites - both old and new - do not assist the Claimant because their language \"cannot... be construed as reflecting the State's 'consent' to ICSID arbitration.\"692\n\nDT(Day2).5.15-17. *See above* at para. 210.\n\n*See above* at para. 210.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, at paras. 81, 83-84.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the text of the website of the Investment Promotion Authority was modified as of 18 November 2013, as submitted by the Respondent.693 The website of the PNG Embassy to the Americas has remained unchanged.694\n\n*See above* at para. 158(d).\n\n*See above* at paras. 113, 158(f).\n\n366.\n\nTurning to the text of the websites, the Tribunal considers it useful to reproduce the wording used on those websites in the below table.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Original Version of the Website of the Investment Promotion Authority (before****18 November 2013)****695** | **Current Version of the****Website of the Investment Promotion Authority (since 18 November 2013)696** | **Website of the PNG Embassy to the Americas** |\n| \"Investment disputes can be settled through diplomatic channels or through the use of local remedies before having such matters adjudicated at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes or through another appropriate tribunal of which Papua New Guiena [sic] is a member.\" | \"International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Section 39 of the [IPA] seeks to encourage greater flows of international investment by providing facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of disputes between government and foreign investors.\" | \"The issue of repudiating or cancelling contracts must be settled through diplomatic channels or through the use of other local remedies, before having such matters adjudicated at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes or through another appropriate tribunal of which Papua New Guinea is a member.\" |\n\nScreenshot of Investment Promotion Authority Website (October 2013), **Exhibit CE-17**.\n\nScreenshot of Investment Promotion Authority Website (June 2014), **Exhibit CE-18**.\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the *SPP* tribunal that the investment promotion materials are, by their nature, usually informative and are not usually intended to have independent legal or normative significance. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *SPP* tribunal that:\n\nIn determining the effect to be accorded [to]... statements made in promotion investment literature.the Tribunal must take account of the fact that such statements by their nature are intended to be informative rather than normative. Investment promotion literature does not create rights; it informs potential investors of the rights they will enjoy by virtue of existing law if an investment is made.697\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 112, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n368.\n\nApplying the above principle, the *SPP* tribunal looked at the investment promotion literature - not to alter the terms of the statute - but to \"confirm the conclusion already reached by the Tribunal on the basis of the text of Law No. 43 and the legislative intent thereof to the effect that Article 8 does not require a further *ad hoc* expression of consent to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"698\n\n*SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 115, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n369.\n\nHowever, as noted above, the ICSID Convention does not set forth any limitations as to the form in which a State's consent to arbitrate may be expressed.699 The Tribunal therefore sees no reason why, as a matter of principle, a State's consent to arbitrate cannot be given in a statement on a website, or in another form of investment promotion literature. Notwithstanding, for the reasons detailed below, however, the Tribunal concludes that the pre-November 2013 version of the IPA website could not reasonably have been understood by an investor to have been of that nature.\n\n*See above* at paras. 244-245.\n\n370.\n\nUnlike in the *SPP* case, the statements on websites relied upon by the Claimant in this case make no reference to a \"right to arbitration.\"700 In the Tribunal's view, these statements do not eliminate the requirement of \"consent,\" and do not themselves evidence or \"confirm\" such consent by the Respondent in either the IPA or the IDCA.\n\n*See SPP v. Egypt*, at para. 114, **Exhibit CA-3**.\n\n371.\n\nThe language of the statements cited by the Claimant is broad and of a general nature; they are also rife with inaccuracies.701 For example, the pre-November 2013 IPA website refers to the requirement to exhaust local remedies \"before\" bringing a dispute to ICSID arbitration. The website was apparently based on the 1978 IDCA, and not the 1982 version (now in force): the requirement to exhaust local remedies was removed in the subsequent version of Section 2 of the IDCA.702\n\n*See above* at para. 210.\n\n*See above* at paras. 358-359.\n\n372.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the statements on the pre-November 2013 IPA website are not only outdated and inaccurate, but they are also equivocal and do not provide unambiguous interpretations of Section 39 or Section 2. The excerpt from the website reads as follows: \"[i]nvestment disputes ***can*** be settled through diplomatic channels ***or*** through the use of local remedies ***before having such matters adjudicated*** at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes ***or*** through another appropriate tribunal of which Papua New Guiena [sic] is a member.\"\n\n373.\n\nEven if the website text is understood as a statement that investment disputes \"***can*** be settled... at [ICSID],\"703 that statement does not clearly indicate that the Respondent's consent has already been provided to ICSID arbitration. A variety of other interpretations of this statement are possible, including that the requirements of the ICSID Convention, including those set forth in Article 25 of the Convention, remain to be satisfied. If the website intended to express a right, different language would have been used - *e.g*., \"investment disputes shall be brought\" to ICSID arbitration or \"shall be settled through ICSID arbitration.\"\n\nThe text is in fact more equivocal. It states that \"investment disputes can be settled\" through diplomatic channels or local remedies, and then only implies that such disputes thereafter also \"can be settled\" through ICSID or other means. The text is ambiguous as to the status of ICSID or other international adjudication.\n\n374.\n\nMoreover, the website refers to ICSID \"or... another appropriate tribunal of which Papua New Guinea ***is a member***.\" Thus, the website indicates that PNG is \"a member\" of ICSID - or more accurately, a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention - and that other *fora* may be available to investors (\"***another appropriate tribunal*** of which Papua New Guinea is a member\"). The Claimant does not contend - nor could it - that this sentence means that PNG has extended its consent to arbitrate in other *fora*.\n\n375.\n\nThus, the website excerpt does nothing more than: (a) (mistakenly) say that local remedies must precede bringing the dispute to ICSID; (b) indicate that PNG is a member of ICSID; and (c) suggest (at best) that the dispute \"can\" be brought to ICSID. It does not say that investors have unconditional access to ICSID, or even that they can directly bring the dispute to ICSID. It does not say, as the Claimant argues, that \"if you invest in PNG, and a dispute arises in relation to your investment, your dispute *can be adjudicated at ICSID*.\"704\n\n*See above* at para. 113.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimant also has not alleged, and there appears to be no evidence, that it relied upon the statements on these websites in making its investment in PNG. Absent evidence of such reliance, the Tribunal concludes that the language on the websites do not provide consent in circumstances where no such consent has been found in the relevant legislative provisions of the PNG investment law.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal does not draw any adverse inference from the modification of the text of the website of the Investment Promotion Authority in this case, because there is no evidence of any bad faith or other inappropriate behavior on the Respondent's part, beyond a mere circumstantial temporal proximity between the changes made to the Investment Promotion Authority's website and the filing of the Request for Arbitration. As the original version of the IPA website shows, the relevant web-page contained a number of inaccuracies and required an update (for example, it still referred to the requirement to exhaust local remedies before bringing the dispute to ICSID, which, as explained below, was removed by the 1982 Amendment Act to the IDCA705). The Tribunal considers that the Respondent's explanation for the amendment of the website is a plausible one.\n\n*See above* at paras. 358-359; DT(Day2).12.13-14.18 (Mr. Yeo: \"If the tribunal notes, it's still talking about diplomatic channels or local remedies before the matter can go to ICSID.. The reference to 'diplomatic channels' or 'use of local remedies' is actually a reference back to the original IDCA before the 1982 amendment. In terms of reflecting the position post-1982, it's simply wrong.\").\n\n378.\n\nIn any event, what is relevant in this regard is what the IPA and the IDCA provide. The Tribunal has already indicated its views on these matters. The character of the Respondent's after-the-fact changes to the Investment Promotion Authority's website is therefore of very limited relevance.\n\n379.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Claimant's claims fail for lack of \"consent in writing\" by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Centre and thus of this Tribunal. Because the Tribunal has arrived at this conclusion on the basis of the Respondent's first objection, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to decide on other objections raised by the Respondent, including that the Claimant does not qualify as an investor that has made the requisite investment in the PNG. Similarly, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to rule on the issue of whether Section 37(1) of the IPA constitutes an MFN clause.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n*A. The Parties' Submissions on Costs*\n--------------------------------------\n\n1. The Respondent's Submission on Costs\n---------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal has \"full discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention to make costs orders as it deems appropriate.\"706 According to the Respondent, \"there is no universal 'starting point' / presumptive standard for the allocation of costs... for ICSID proceedings.\"707 The Respondent submits that \"regardless of the 'starting point' for the analysis, the appropriate end point would be for parties to bear their own expenses and share the arbitration costs equally, and there are no countervailing factors (*e.g.*, procedural misconduct) warranting a different approach.\"708\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 4.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 5. According to the Respondent, ICSID tribunals \"commonly require parties to bear their own expenses and share arbitration costs equally in circumstances that either (a) do not justify a departure from the American rule, where that is used as a starting point; or (b) justify an equitable allocation of costs, where the American rule is not used / not expressly used as a starting point.\" Respondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 6.\n\n381.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should decide that the costs \"lie where they fall\"709 and make no order as to costs in this arbitration, for the following reasons.\n\na. Costs associated with the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction: the Respondent states that:\n\ni. it \"is prepared not to ask that the Claimant bears the costs of the Rule 41(1) Application, it being undisputed that the Claimant's assets are assets held solely for the benefit of the people of Papua New Guinea;\"710\n\nii. \"costs shifting would not be a meaningful exercise where the assets of *both* the Claimant and the State are to be used solely for the benefit of the People;\"711 and\n\niii. there are \"unusual\" facts and \"novel issues of law\" in this case that \"also favour the making of no costs order,\" and this would be consistent with the approach of other ICSID tribunals in cases \"where the matter concerns novel and complex questions in relation to which jurisprudence remains undeveloped.\"712\n\nb. Costs associated with the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures and the Respondent's 41(5) Application: the Respondent submits that:\n\ni. \"there should be no order as to costs (*i.e*., each party should bear its own expenses ('party expenses') and half of the costs payable under Articles 59 and 60 of the ICSID Convention ('arbitration costs')), given *inter alia* the relative newness of the Rule 41(5) procedure, the expediting effect the Rule 41(5) Application had on the Rule 41(1) proceedings, and the mixed result of the Claimant's [Request for Provisional Measures];\"713\n\nii. the Tribunal should not order costs against the Respondent in connection with Rule 41(5) Application because of \"the relative newness of the Rule 41(5) procedure;\"714 because the Tribunal has not found the Respondent's Rule 41(5) Application \"to be an abuse of the Rule 41(5) procedure\" as the Claimant argued;715 and because costs and expenses \"had not... been wasted\" given that the Rule 41(5) Application \"resulted in less time being required for briefing and hearing\" the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction under Rule 41(1);716\n\niii. the Tribunal should not order costs in connection with the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, because \"no clearly prevailing party emerged\" in respect of that application;717 rather, the Tribunal \"allowed only certain of the Claimant's provisional measures requests and rejected the others.\"718\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 14.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 2.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 7.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 3.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 10.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 13.\n\n382.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare that:\n\na. \"each party shall bear its own expenses incurred in respect of the Rule 39, 41(1) and 41(5) Applications and in preparing its Submissions on Costs and Costs Statement;\"719 and\n\nb. \"each party shall bear half of the arbitration costs in respect of the Rule 39, 41(1) and 41(5) Applications.\"720\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 14.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 14.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent's costs statement is for the total amount of: (a) USD 350,000.00 (for the advance payments on account of the arbitration costs); and (b) SGD 837,626.25 + EUR 28,000.00 + AUS 36,000.00 (for the Respondent's legal costs and expenses).721\n\n*See* Respondent's Costs Statement, dated 5 March 2015, at Sections 1-6.\n\n2. The Claimant's Submission on Costs\n-------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs, the Claimant maintains that the Tribunal \"has the authority and discretion to make awards of costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\"722 While the Claimant notes that Article 61(2) \"gives the Tribunal broad discretion to award costs as it sees fit,\"723 the Claimant invites the Tribunal to apply the costs follow the event principle,724 rather than the costs lie where they fall approach, which, according to the Claimant, \"is becoming more of an exception rather than a rule.\"725\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 3.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 3.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, in applying this principle, ICSID tribunals \"have taken into account, inter alia,... (a) the reasonableness with which the parties pursued their claims and defences; and (b) the record as it reflects the parties' general cooperativeness in achieving cost-effective results.\" Claimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 4.\n\n385.\n\nIn connection with each of the three applications considered by the Tribunal in this arbitration, the Claimant makes the following submissions.\n\na. ***Costs associated with the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures*** : the Claimant argues that it \"should be awarded the costs incurred in the provisional measures phase (even if the State's objection to jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 41(1) succeeds),\"726 because the Respondent \"intentionally and unapologetically took steps which posed a direct threat to the integrity of the arbitral proceedings;\"727 according to the Claimant, \"this conduct is independent of the wider result in the arbitration and is sufficient to warrant a costs order against the State.\"728\n\nb. ***Costs associated with the Respondent's 41(5) Application*** : the Claimant submits that, because the Tribunal \"dismissed the State's 41(5) application *in toto*,\"729 the Claimant is \"entitled to an order that the State pay the costs that the Claimant reasonably incurred in the Rule 41(5) phase.\"730 The Claimant argues that the Respondent's conduct \"amplif[ied] its costs exposure,\"731 including due to: (i) the fact that the Rule 41(5) Application \"was dismissed comprehensively;\"732 and (ii) the Respondent \"unnecessarily declined to accept the Claimant's proposal that the Rule 41(5) objection be dealt with on the papers,\" and the Respondent's conduct in this regard was \"unhelpful and unnecessarily escalated costs.\"733\n\nc. ***Costs associated with the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction*** : the Claimant argues that, if it prevails on jurisdiction, the Respondent \"should be ordered to pay its reasonable costs incurred in this phase of the arbitration,\" including the costs of engaging Professor James Crawford as external counsel.734 In the Claimant's submission, the Tribunal \"should adjust any cost order to reflect the fact that the State was not entirely helpful in producing the language of the relevant legislation.\"735\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 10. *See also* Claimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 10.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 10.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 14.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 15.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 16.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 16(a).\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 16(b).\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 20.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015, at para. 21.\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant's costs statement is for the total amount of: (a) USD 350,000.00 (for the advance payments on account of the arbitration costs); and (b) USD 1,611,645.98 (for the Claimant's legal costs and expenses).736\n\n*See* Claimant's Schedule of Costs, dated 5 March 2015 (Annex A to the Claimant's Submission on Costs).\n\n3. The Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs\n---------------------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nIn its Reply Submission on Costs, the Respondent reiterates that \"*regardless* of whether the Tribunal chooses to adopt the American rule or the principle that costs shall follow the event as the '*starting point*' for its costs analysis, the appropriate end point in view of the circumstances of this case would be for parties to bear their own expenses and share the arbitration costs..., notwithstanding that the State would have been *wrongfully* forced to go through these proceedings..., if the arbitration is eventually terminated for want of jurisdiction under Rule 41(1).\"737 The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not established \"any ground justifying a deviation from the above approach.\"738\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 1.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 2.\n\n388.\n\nShould the Tribunal choose to apply a costs-shifting approach, however, the Respondent submits that \"the costs presented by the Claimant... - which were in excess of USD 1.6 million (*i.e*., almost 2.5 times of the State's total expenses) and which far exceeded the State's corresponding expenses at every phase of the proceedings... have not been shown to be reasonable, and should in any case be scaled down accordingly.\"739 According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not challenged the factors that the Respondent cited in support of its position that \"costs of the Applications should lie where they fall, *viz*. the relative newness of the Rule 41(5) procedure, the expediting effect the Rule 41(5) Application had on the Rule 41(1) proceedings, the mixed result of the Claimant's Rule 39 Application, and more importantly, the fact that the assets of *both* the Claimant and the State are held for the benefit of the People.\"740\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 3\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 4.\n\n389.\n\nThe Respondent objects to certain allegations made in the Claimant's Submission on Costs, which the Respondent considers as being \"untrue and unwarranted,\"741 as follows.\n\na. In response to the Claimant's allegation that the Respondent \"deliberately chose not to disclose\" the 1991 IPA, the Respondent notes that, as explained in its submissions, it did not produce the 1991 Bill because it \"*never came into force* and was *irrelevant* to the interpretation of section 39\" of the IPA.742\n\nb. In response to the Claimant's assertion that the Respondent unnecessarily amplified the costs of Rule 41(5) phase by refusing that this application be dealt with on the papers, the Respondent notes that this assertion is \"surprising\" given that the parties \"were at the outset *agreed* that the Rule 41(5) Application should in principle be disposed of after an oral hearing.\"743 In any event, although Rule 41(5) Application did not succeed, the Tribunal \"did not find that the State had acted unreasonably or had misused the Rule 41(5) procedure.\"744\n\nc. In response to the Claimant's assertion that its provisional measures application \"should be deemed an '*independent costs event*' as the State had purportedly infringed its '*self-standing*' right to the *status quo*,\" the Respondent argues that this argument is \"a non-starter\" because the Claimant \"cannot rely on a non-existent '*right*' to justify costs-shifting in disregard of the mixed outcome of Rule 39 Application.\"745 Rather, according to the Respondent, the Claimant \"had itself escalated costs of the Rule 39 Application by engaging in lengthy post-briefing correspondence in which it constantly shifted the basis for its provisional measures requests,\" which is \"a further reason *against* shifting costs of the Rule 39 Application in favour of the Claimant.\"746\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 6.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 7.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 9. The Respondent submits that: (a) \"there is no 's *elf-standing right*' to protection of *status quo* in general as rights to be preserved by provisional measures are circumscribed by the requesting party's claims for reliefs;\" and (b) the Tribunal \"did not grant the Claimant's request for a general order for the preservation of the *status quo* and had also noted that such a request would '*ordinarily fail* '.\" Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 9.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 10.\n\n390.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's costs are in any case unreasonable,747 because: (a) the Claimant's costs \"far exceeded the State's corresponding expenses at every phase of the proceedings;\"748 and (b) the Claimant \"has provided *no* detail (beyond the total costs incurred for each Application) on how its substantial costs came to be incurred,\" making it \"impossible to meaningfully assess the reasonableness of the Claimant's costs.\"749\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at paras. 11-13.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 12.\n\n391.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its requests for relief relating to costs, set out in paragraph 14 of its Submission on Costs.750\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 14.\n\n4. The Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs\n-------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nIn its Reply Submission on Costs, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal \"retains the discretion to make orders as to costs at any stage of the arbitration that it deems appropriate,\" including to decide now on the costs relating to the various phases of proceedings to date.751\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at paras. 3-5.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's \"submission on the state of the law is both inaccurate and internally inconsistent,\" in particular because the Respondent concedes that \"there is no universal 'starting point' with respect to the allocation of costs\" but contradicts itself \"by suggesting that there somehow needs to be a *justification* to depart from the principle that each party bears its own costs.\"752 According to the Claimant, \"[t]his is not the law;\" rather, \"the '*starting point*' is that costs follow the event and there is widespread support amongst international investment tribunals for the idea that the costs award should reflect success.\"753 The Claimant argues that \"the burden lies with the State to justify a departure from the principle that costs shall follow the event.\"754\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 6.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 7.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para, 8. The Claimant argues that, in its submissions in this arbitration, the Respondent \"advocated the same approach that the Claimant asks the Tribunal to take now;\" the Respondent \"had previously championed the 'costs follow the event' approach,\" and the Claimant \"invites the Tribunal to draw its own inferences from this radical shift in the State's position.\" Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at paras. 9-10.\n\n394.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"conduct is an important factor that tribunals have regard to in determining a just and equitable cost order;\" the factors that were considered by tribunals as tipping the scales in favour of adopting the costs follow the event approach included, *e.g*., \"misconduct, fraudulent activity or abuse of process by the losing party,\" and \"circumstances where parties have been uncooperative or engaged in behaviour that resulted in wastage of resources, time and costs.\"755\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 11.\n\n395.\n\nIn connection with each of the three applications considered by the Tribunal in this arbitration, the Claimant argues that:\n\na. ***Costs associated with the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures*** : the Claimant submits that it \"is entitled to the costs necessitated and/or occasioned by [the provisional measures] application.\"756 The Claimant argues that the relevant factors to be taken into account include (a) \"the Claimant's critical success in restraining the State from disturbing the *status quo*, insofar as it relates to transferring (or issuing) OTML shares to third parties;\" and (b) \"the State's manifest lack of respect for the integrity of these proceedings, which necessitated the [provisional measures] application in the first place.\"757 On the latter point, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent displayed its lack of respect for the integrity of these proceedings by: (i) \"declaring its intent to transfer OTML shares... to third parties pending the determination of this dispute;\" (ii) \"acting in a manner that had a serious, adverse impact on the profitability of OTML;\" and (iii) \"undermining the quality of OTML's management.\"758\n\nb. ***Costs associated with the Respondent's 41(5) Application*** : the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's arguments on the \"relative newness of the Rule 41(5) procedure,\"759 and states that \"it should have been obvious to the State that the procedure was wholly unsuited for cases involving 'difficult questions of fact and law'\" at issue in this case.760 According to the Claimant, \"the relative novelty of the procedure cannot be used by the State to mask the fact that its reliance on the Rule 41(5) mechanism was entirely misconceived.\"761\n\nc. ***Costs associated with the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction*** : the Claimant argues that the Respondent \"has consistently taken the approach that costs should follow the event\" in is applications in this arbitration, and \"[i]t is only now that the State sought to manufacture various bases to depart from its original position.\"762 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's arguments on costs \"are mere afterthoughts.\"763 The Claimant submits that, \"[i]f the Tribunal accepts that the favoured approach is that costs should follow the event, this approach should be consistently applied for all phases of the arbitration to date.\"764\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 15.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 12.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 13.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 16.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 18.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 20.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 23.\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 23.\n\n396.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant seeks an order that it be awarded its costs in the arbitration,765 in the total amount of: (a) USD 350,000.00 (for the ICSID and Tribunal fees); and (b) USD 1,655,972.54 (for the Claimant's legal costs and expenses, including those associated with the submissions and reply submissions on costs).766\n\nClaimant's Reply Submission on Costs, dated 13 March 2015, at para. 24.\n\n*See* Claimant's Schedule of Costs, dated 13 March 2015 (Annex A to the Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs).\n\n*B. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs*\n-------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nAs required by Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal sets out its decision on the allocation of costs of this arbitration proceeding below. The Tribunal's decision is the result of the careful consideration of the Parties' Submissions on Costs and authorities relied upon by the Parties, and takes into account the Parties' conduct during this arbitration.\n\n398.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers it useful to define the categories of costs allocated in this award. The Tribunal's award deals with two categories of costs:\n\na. The \"Costs of the Arbitration\" shall include the Tribunal's fees and expenses, and the ICSID administrative charges and fees.\n\nb. The \"Legal Costs\" shall include the legal fees and expenses, and any other party costs, incurred by either Party in the course of and in connection with this arbitration proceeding.\n\n399.\n\nAccording to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.767\n\nICSID Convention, at Article 61(2). Similarly, Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules gives discretion to the Tribunal in allocating costs:  \n (1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:  \n (a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;  \n (b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.  \n (2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.\n\n400.\n\nAs one leading commentator noted, this provision indicates that, if there is no agreement between the parties on the allocation of costs, \"the tribunal is given discretion to make a decision on the issue.\"768\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2nd ed., CUP (2009), at p. 1224, para. 3, **Exhibit RL-87**.\n\n401.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Article 61(2) of the Convention leaves the door open to the Tribunal to exercise its discretion,769 in light of all the circumstances of each case,770 to allocate costs among the parties in the manner that it considers fair and appropriate.771\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Burimi SRL & Eagle Games SH.A v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Award, 29 May 2013, at para. 162 (referring to the tribunal's \"broad powers to rule on the costs incurred by the Parties and ICSID in connection with this proceeding\"), Annex 17 to the Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 13 March 2015.\n\n*See*, *e.g*, *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005, at para. 235, **Exhibit RL-82**.\n\nCertain tribunals have used the terms \"fair and reasonable.\" *See*, *e.g*, *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, 12 October 2005, at para. 236, **Exhibit RL-82**. Others stated that Article 61(2) allows an ICSID tribunal to allocate costs \"as it deems appropriate.\" *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, at para. 150, Annex 1 to the Claimant's Submission on Costs, 5 March 2015; *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, at para. 316, Annex 5 to the Claimant's Submission on Costs dated 5 March 2015.\n\n402.\n\nArticle 61(2) does not set forth any presumption concerning allocation of costs among the parties. The practice of ICSID tribunals on apportioning costs is \"neither clear nor uniform.\"772 As the *LG&E v. Argentina* tribunal noted, \"there is no uniform practice in treaty arbitration with regard to this matter.\"773\n\nC.

Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/08/1 and ARB/09/20, Award, 16 May 2012, at para. 328, **Exhibit RL-85**. For an award applying the \"costs lie where they fall\" as a matter of principle or \"normal practice\" in ICSID arbitrations, *see*, *e.g*., *Bayview Irrigation District et al. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, 19 June 2007, at para. 125, **Exhibit RL-79**.\n\n403.\n\nDifferent ICSID tribunals followed the \"costs lie where they fall\" principle,774 or \"the costs follow the event\" (or \"loser pays\") principle,775 or the principle that costs should be allocated \"as a sanction against what they saw as dilatory or otherwise improper conduct in the proceedings.\"776 For example, one ICSID tribunal stated that \"the recent practice of other arbitral tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations (including ICSID) [was] to take as their starting-point the general principle that the successful party should have its reasonable costs paid by the unsuccessful party, in accordance with the general position in other forms of transnational commercial arbitration.\"777\n\nC.

Rather, the practice has been to split the costs evenly, whether the claimant or the respondent prevails.\"778 That tribunal added that its \"preferred approach to costs is that of international commercial arbitration and its growing application to investment arbitration\" - *i.e.,* \"there should be an allocation of costs that reflects in some measure the principle that the losing party pays, but not necessarily all of the costs of the arbitration or of the prevailing party.\"779\n\n*EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, at para. 322, **Exhibit RL-90**.\n\n*EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, at para. 327, **Exhibit RL-90**.\n\n405.\n\nIn many cases, ICSID tribunals' decisions on costs allocation were guided, *inter alia*, by the parties' procedural conduct and specific circumstances of each case. For example, in *Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal applied the \"costs follow the event\" principle because the Claimant's claims failed for lack of jurisdiction, but more importantly because the tribunal held that \"the initiation and pursuit of this arbitration is an abuse of the international investment protection regime under the BIT and, consequently, of the ICSID Convention.\"780\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, at para. 151, Annex 1 to the Claimant's Submission on Costs, 5 March 2015.\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that its decision on costs allocation should generally be guided by:\n\na. the parties' respective requests for relief concerning the allocation of costs;\n\nb. the outcome of the parties' respective claims and defenses and applications (*i.e*., their relative - partial or complete - success or failure);781\n\nc. the complexity or novelty of issues raised in the arbitration proceeding;782\n\nd. the existence of special reasons or circumstances, such as, for example, \"procedural misconduct, the existence of a frivolous claim, or an abuse of the [investment arbitration] process or of the international investment protection regime;\"783 and\n\ne. the reasonableness of the parties' legal costs, including any material disproportion that may exist between the parties' respective costs.784\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Award, 25 July 2007, at para. 112, **Exhibit RL-80** ; *Gemplus S.A., SLP S.A and Gemplus Industrial S.A. de C.V. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, Part XVII, at para. 17-20, Annex 11 to the Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 13 March 2015.\n\n*See*, *e.g*., *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003, at para. 240 and Orders (\"[T]he Tribunal is of the view that the dispute raised difficult and novel questions of far-reaching importance for each party, and the Tribunal therefore makes no award of costs. [E]ach party shall bear its own costs, and shall bear equally the expenses of the Tribunal and the Secretariat.\"), **Exhibit RL-81** ; *KT Asia Investment Group BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2001, at para. 228 (\"[T]he Tribunal finds it appropriate that each Party bear one half of the ICSID costs and bear its own legal and other costs. Such approach seems fair and reasonable considering [inter alia] that while the Respondent prevailed on jurisdiction, the issues involved were complex and the Claimant's case was certainly not brought lightly.\"), **Exhibit CA-19** ; *Robert Azinian et al. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, at para. 126, **Exhibit RL-84**.\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010, at para. 63, **Exhibit RL-78**. *See also* *Robert Azinian et al. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, at para. 126, **Exhibit RL-84**.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, at para. 321 (stating that \"the material disproportion between Claimant's and Respondent's arbitration costs\" is \"a circumstance that shall be duly considered when deciding the allocation of such costs\"), **Exhibit RL-90**.\n\n407.\n\n***First***, in this case, the Respondent has not requested that the Tribunal allocate costs in its favor. Rather, the Respondent asked that the Tribunal apply the \"costs lie where they fall\" principle by ordering that each Party bear its own Legal Costs and half of the Costs of the Arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it would generally be inappropriate to go beyond the relief requested by the prevailing Party - the Respondent -and order costs in a different manner.\n\n408.\n\n***Second***, the Tribunal has not found any evidence of \"special circumstances\" or procedural misbehavior by either Party that would influence the Tribunal's decision on the allocation of costs. Neither Party has behaved in a procedurally improper manner in this proceeding. On the contrary, from the moment of the constitution of the Tribunal, both Parties contributed to the efficiency of this proceeding. Both Parties' behaviour was exemplary in complying with the deadlines set by the Tribunal (with minor exceptions) and with the Tribunal's directions in this proceeding. And, as noted above, both Parties' counsel have been of particular assistance to the Tribunal.\n\n409.\n\n***Third***, both Parties have submitted reasonable applications and carefully articulated the grounds for those applications. Neither Party's claims, arguments nor applications were manifestly unfounded, frivolous or otherwise improper.\n\n410.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal rejected Rule 41(5) Application should not be misinterpreted as recognition by the Tribunal of impropriety of the Respondent's application. Rather, as explained in the Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Rule 41(5) Application, the Tribunal dismissed that application because there were complex issues of fact and law to be addressed, and the Rule 41(5) process would not have allowed appropriately to address these complex and novel issues. This decision is not to be understood as criticizing the Respondent's submission as improper in any way. The Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent that its Rule 41(5) Application has significantly expedited and focused the discussion on the issues of jurisdiction.\n\n411.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal granted the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures in part where the Claimant had established sufficient urgency and serious harm that would result for the Claimant if those provisional measures were not granted. In contrast, the Tribunal rejected those limbs of the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures that were overly broad and/or not supported by a sufficient showing of urgency and/or serious harm to the Claimant. Thus, the Tribunal's decision on the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, too, should not be interpreted as criticizing the Claimant or the Respondent in any way. The Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate, therefore, to allocate the costs associated with the Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures in favor of the Claimant, as the Claimant requests.785\n\n*See above* at para. 385(a).\n\n412.\n\n***Fourth***, the Claimant's claims - including its arguments on jurisdiction - were not frivolous or manifestly unfounded. As explained above, interpretation of Section 39 of the IPA and Section 2 of the IDCA was a complex undertaking, and the Claimant advanced serious and reasonable arguments in support of jurisdiction in this case. As noted above, these provisions have not been interpreted by any arbitral tribunal, and the task of the Tribunal - and the Parties - in this case was that of first impression. It was a difficult task due to the peculiar language of the relevant provisions and the novelty of the interpretive challenges that these provisions created for the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n413.\n\nThis case is therefore far from the *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* scenario, where the tribunal found that \"[a] party pursuing a claim which is clearly outside the scope of the Centre's jurisdiction should not be encouraged, and should bear the risk of paying the full costs of such frivolous proceedings.\"786 The Claimant's position in this arbitration was far from frivolous or speculative: the Claimant brought its claims in good faith and advanced an attractive, serious case on jurisdiction.\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, at para. 154, Annex 2 to the Claimant's Submission on Costs, dated 5 March 2015.\n\n414.\n\nAbsent special circumstances or procedural impropriety, and taking into account the Parties' respective submissions and requests for costs orders (in particular, the Respondent request that the Tribunal order no costs), the Tribunal decides to apply the \"costs lie where they fall\" principle in allocating costs.\n\n415.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal orders that the Costs of the Arbitration and the Parties' Legal Costs in this proceeding shall be allocated as follows:\n\na. each Party shall bear its own Legal Costs incurred in this arbitration; and\n\nb. each Party shall bear 50% of the Costs of the Arbitration.\n\n416.\n\nBecause the Tribunal decided to apply the \"costs lie where they fall\" principle in this case, there is no need to assess the reasonableness of, or otherwise \"scale[] back,\" the Claimant's Legal Costs, as the Respondent requests.787\n\n*See above* at para. 388.\n\n**VII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n417.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby unanimously decides that:\n\na. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimant in this arbitration.\n\nb. All provisional measures ordered by the Tribunal will cease to have effect as of the Award's date of dispatch.\n\nc. Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses.\n\nd. Each Party shall bear 50% of the Costs of the Arbitration.\n\ne. All other requests for relief are dismissed.\n\n418.\n\nThis Award concludes this arbitration proceeding."}]}
