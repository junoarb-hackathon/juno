Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 26, 2001, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) received from Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P., a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic. On February 27, 2001, the Centre acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C., in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules). The Request concerns certain tax assessments allegedly imposed by some Argentinean provinces in respect to a gas transportation company in which the Claimants participated through investments in various corporate arrangements that will be described below. In the Request, the Claimants invoke the provisions of the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (\"the Bilateral Investment Treaty\" or \"Bilateral Treaty\").1\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of November 14, 1991, in force from October 20, 1994.\n\n2.\n\nOn April 5, 2001, the Centre requested the Claimants to explain how each of the two Claimants in the present case would meet the conditions for registration of its request. On April 6, 2003, the Claimants satisfied this request.\n\n3.\n\nPursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, on April 11, 2001, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request. On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nOn April 12, 2001, the Claimants submitted a proposal for the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. Under the Claimants' proposal, the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 25, 2001, the Argentine Republic notified the Centre of its agreement to the Claimants' proposal concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. In those circumstances, on April 27, 2001, the Centre confirmed that the Arbitral Tribunal in the present case would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who would serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 11, 2001, the Claimants appointed Mr. Pierre-Yves Tschanz, a Swiss national. On July 10, 2001, the Argentine Republic appointed Dr. H\u00e9ctor Gros Espiell, a national of Uruguay. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. By letter dated August 30, 2001, the Claimants requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator be appointed pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n7.\n\nIn those circumstances, and after consulting the parties, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national, was appointed by the Centre as the third presiding arbitrator. Pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on November 1, 2001, the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment and the Arbitral Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on December 5, 2001, in Washington, D.C. During the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal was properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections to any members of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties also agreed on several procedural issues, which were later reproduced in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Regarding the written phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal, after consulting with the parties in this respect, fixed the following time limits for the presentation of the parties' pleadings: The Claimants would file a memorial within 90 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial within 90 days from its receipt of the Claimants' memorial; the Claimants would file a reply within 60 days from their receipt of the Respondent's counter-memorial and the Respondent would file a rejoinder within 60 days from its receipt of the Claimants' reply. It was further agreed that if the Respondent raised any objections to jurisdiction the following alternative tentative schedule would apply: The Respondent would file a memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from the receipt of the Claimants' memorial on the merits; the Claimants would file a counter-memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from their receipt of the Respondent's memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would file a reply on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Claimants' counter-memorial on jurisdiction, and the Claimants would file a rejoinder within 30 days from their receipt of the Respondent's reply on jurisdiction.\n\n10.\n\nOn January 14, 2002, the Claimants requested a suspension of the proceedings for six months in order to explore the possibility of settling the dispute through direct consultations with the authorities appointed by a new government of the Argentine Republic. By a letter dated January 30, 2002, the Argentine Republic informed the Centre that it did not consider it necessary that the proceedings be suspended at this stage.\n\n11.\n\nOn January 31, 2002, the Claimants requested the suspension of the proceedings for a period of six months in order to obtain certain internal authorizations to continue with the arbitration. On February 5, 2002, the Tribunal requested the Argentine Republic to present any observations in this respect. The Argentine Republic presented its observations on February 18, 2002, agreeing to an extension of only three months. On February 25, 2002, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, granting an extension of 90 days, from the date of the procedural order, for the Claimants to obtain the relevant authorization to continue with the proceeding.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 22, 2002, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had been authorized to proceed with the arbitration and requested an extension until August 1, 2002 to file their memorial on the merits. On May 29, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by the Claimants. In its communication, the Tribunal noted that the Argentine Republic would, if it requested, be entitled to the same time extension granted to the Claimants to file its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n13.\n\nOn August 1, 2002, the Claimants filed their memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation. On December 13, 2002, the Argentine Republic notified the Tribunal that it would be using part of the extension granted by the Tribunal in its letter of May 29, 2002 to file its memorial on January 15, 2003. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), on January 15, 2003, the Argentine Republic filed a memorial raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nOn January 21, 2003, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), the proceedings on the merits were suspended.\n\n15.\n\nOn March 5, 2003, the Claimants requested an extension of time to file their counter-memorial on jurisdiction. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Argentine Republic to provide its observations to the Claimants' request. The Argentine Republic presented its observations on March 7, 2003. On March 11, 2003, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by the Claimants and informed the parties that the Argentine Republic would be granted an extension on the same terms to file its reply on jurisdiction if it so requested.\n\n16.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, the Claimants filed before the Centre a new request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic. On the same date, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to suspend the jurisdictional proceedings in the present case until the Tribunal renders a decision concerning their new request for arbitration. On March 28, 2003, pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre forwarded the request to the Arbitral Tribunal to determine whether to receive it as an additional claim to the present case. On the same date, the Tribunal requested the Argentine Republic to submit any observations that it may have in this respect and decided not to grant the suspension requested by the Claimants, asking them to file their counter-memorial on jurisdiction on the date previously decided. On April 15, 2003, the Argentine Republic presented its observations concerning the Claimants' new request for arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nOn April 25, 2003, after having examined the Claimants' new request for arbitration and the observations submitted by both parties in this respect, the Tribunal decided to accept the new request for arbitration as a claim ancillary to the present case and to have both cases proceed on separate tracks until the Tribunal has decided on jurisdiction in respect of both claims. In its communication, the Tribunal also proposed an expeditious procedure to the parties for filing their written submissions on the ancillary claim. According to this proposal, there would be no memorial on the merits submitted by the Claimants at this stage and the Argentine Republic would file a memorial on jurisdiction within 60 days. The Claimant would file a counter-memorial on jurisdiction within 60 days from the receipt of the Respondent's memorial on jurisdiction. The Argentine Republic would file a reply on jurisdiction within 30 days from the receipt of the Claimants' counter memorial on jurisdiction and the Claimants would file a rejoinder on jurisdiction within 60 days from the receipt of the Respondent's reply. The Claimants accepted the Tribunal's proposal on April 29, 2003 and the Respondent did the same on May 6, 2003.\n\n18.\n\nOn March 31, 2003, the Claimants filed their counter-memorial on jurisdiction, concerning the first claim here addressed by the Tribunal. Thereafter, on May 20, 2003, the Argentine Republic filed its reply on jurisdiction and on June 26, 2003 the Claimants filed their rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place in Paris on September 3-4, 2003. At the hearing the Claimants were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop (King & Spalding, Houston), Guido Santiago Tawil (M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires), Craig S. Miles (King & Spalding, Houston) and Ignacio Minorini Lima (M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires); all of whom addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. The Respondent was represented by Mr. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena, Mr. Jorge Barraguirre and Ms. Beatriz Pallar\u00e9s, all of them from the office of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. Mr. Su\u00e1rez addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. During the hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n**B. Considerations**\n---------------------\n\n*The Claimants' participation in Argentina's privatization program*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimants in this dispute, like other companies that have brought to ICSID their differences with the Government of the Argentine Republic, is a participant in the privatization program that that government undertook beginning in 1989. The investments the Claimants seek to protect were made in the important gas industry of Argentina, the privatization of which was carried out under the terms of the Gas Law and related instruments.2 The Claimants satisfy the requirements of the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty as to having substantial business activities in the United States and not being controlled by nationals of a third country, a matter in respect of which Argentina had requested a clarification.\n\nLaw 24,076 of 1992 on the Privatisation of the Gas Sector; Decree 1738/92 of 1992 on the implementation of the Gas Law.\n\n21.\n\nClaimants' participation concerns the privatization of *Transportadora de Gas del Sur* (\"TGS\"), one of the major networks for the transportation and distribution of gas produced in the provinces of the South of Argentina. The Claimants own 50% of the shares of CIESA, an Argentine incorporated company that controls TGS by owning 55.30% of its shares; the Claimants' participation in CIESA is held by two wholly-owned companies, EPCA and EACH. The Claimants, through EPCA, EACH and ECIL, another corporation controlled by the Claimants, also own 75.93% of EDIDESCA, another Argentine corporation that owns 10% of the shares of TGS; and they also have acquired an additional 0.02% of TGS through EPCA. The investment as a whole, it is explained, amounts to 35,263% of TGS.\n\n22.\n\nThis part of the Claimants' dispute before ICSID concerns only a question of tax assessments by some Argentine provinces. An auxiliary claim has been introduced for disputes concerning tariffs, devaluation and other financial measures adopted by the Government of the Argentine Republic. Jurisdictional issues as to the additional claim will be dealt with in due course by this Tribunal in a separate decision.\n\n23.\n\nA number of questions introduced in the context of objections to jurisdiction are closely related to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal at this stage will only deal with those issues that are strictly jurisdictional.\n\n*ICSID's case law concerning the Argentine Republic*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nA number of prior decisions adopted by other ICSID tribunals concerning disputes between foreign investors and the Argentine Republic have dealt with a number of relevant issues in the context of international law, the use of its sources and treaty interpretation.3 This Tribunal bears in mind those decisions but will not discuss their findings here, except insofar they are necessary for disposing of specific issues raised in this case.\n\n*Lanco v. Argentina*, Preliminary Decision of the ICSID Tribunal of December 8, 1998; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija et al. v. Argentina*, ICSID Award of November 21, 2000; *Vivendi v. Argentina,* ICSID Annulment Decision of July 3, 2002; *CMS v. Argentina*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003.\n\n*Tax assessments by Argentine provinces*\n----------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nSeveral Southern Argentine provinces, which will be identified further below, have assessed stamp taxes on various operations of TGS, which together with interest and fines amount to approximately AR$ 800 million. The contracts underlying these operations include transportation and distribution of gas, technical assistance, the Transfer Agreement and some other contracts. The Claimants argue that this tax assessment is illegal under Argentine law and tantamount to an expropriation, resulting in a violation of international law, the Bilateral Investment Treaty and other commitments and guarantees undertaken by the Argentine Republic in connection with the privatization process and the investments therein.\n\n26.\n\nThe Argentine Republic opposes such arguments and believes that the question cannot be submitted to this arbitration. A provisional stay for the collection of taxes has been granted by the Argentine Supreme Court on the basis of actions brought before it by TGS. As a result, the taxes have not been paid as of this date and no final decision has been taken by the Argentine courts. The Federal Government has supported before the courts TGS's arguments in respect of the illegality or inapplicability of the taxes assessed, including the view that some taxes violate the Law of Federal Co-participation that governs the relationship between the Federal Government and the Provinces, but is of the opinion that the actions of the Provinces do not amount to a violation of the Treaty.\n\n27.\n\nIn the view of the Argentine Republic the taxes assessed are within the range of 1%-2% of the contracts value, and are thus not confiscatory. The additional amounts owed by the Claimants, it is further explained, are the result of penalties and interests and this is not to be attributed to the Respondent. In the Claimants' view, however, the taxes are confiscatory and expropriatory as applied, including penalties and interests, their retroactive assessment for a five-year period and the fact that to an important extent the taxes levied by the different Provinces overlap each other.\n\n28.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has also made the argument that the Claimants' petitions to this Tribunal, if accepted, would disrupt the conditions of competition within the Argentine market as foreign investors would be exempt from taxes assessed on other business entities. The Claimants believe in this connection that if the taxes are illegal they should not be paid by any economic agent, national or foreign, and thus there is no discrimination involved in their petitions.\n\n29.\n\nThis Tribunal will not sit in judgement over the general tax policies pursued by the Argentine Republic or the Provinces, nor for that matter of the arrangements the provinces have with the Federal Government of the Argentine Republic. This is a matter exclusively appurtenant to the sovereignty of the Argentine Republic.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, has the duty to establish in connection with the merits of the case whether such assessments violate the rights accorded to foreign investors under treaties, legislation, contracts and other commitments. As decided by an ICSID Tribunal in an earlier case with reference to the role of bilateral investment treaties, these treaties cannot entirely isolate foreign investments from the general economic situation of a country. They do provide for standards of fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination, guarantees in respect of expropriation and other matters, but they cannot prevent a country from pursuing its own economic choices. These choices are not under the Centre's jurisdiction and ICSID tribunals cannot pass judgement on whether such policies are right or wrong. Judgement can only be made in respect of whether the rights of investors have been violated.\"4\n\n*CMS*, paragraph 29.\n\n31.\n\nThe line separating general tax measures from measures that affect the investor's rights is conceptually clear, but in practice what falls within or without the Tribunal's competence can only be established in the light of the evidence that the parties will produce in connection with the merits of the case.\n\n32.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has expressed the view that because the taxes have been assessed by the Argentine Provinces, and irrespective of whether this is a lawful or unlawful action or whether it violates the federal arrangements in force, the responsibility and liability of the Argentine Republic cannot be engaged. The Tribunal is mindful in this respect that under international law the State incurs international responsibility and liability for unlawful acts of its various agencies and subdivisions.5 The same holds true under Article XIII of the Bilateral Investment Treaty when providing that this \"...Treaty shall apply to the political subdivisions of the Parties\".\n\nJames Crawford: The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, 2002, Comments on Article 4 at 94-99.\n\n*Admissibility and Jus Standi*\n------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Argentine Republic submits that the Tribunal must establish whether, as a matter separate from jurisdiction, the claim is admissible in the instant case. The distinction between admissibility and jurisdiction does not appear to be necessary in the context of the ICSID Convention, which deals only with jurisdiction and competence. A successful admissibility objection would normally result in rejecting a claim for reasons connected with the merits. In the light of the Bilateral Investment Treaty the essential question is whether the claimant invoking the benefit of its provisions qualifies as a protected investor. The right to claim will arise from this determination. This is the situation that specifically needs to be discussed under the Treaty irrespective of whether it is labelled a question of admissibility or otherwise.\n\n34.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has objected to the admissibility of the claim on the ground that the Claimants do not have the rights upon which they base such claim. The measures adopted, as the argument goes, directly affect only TGS, a corporation incorporated in Argentina. The Claimants are only indirectly affected as they are minority shareholders in TGS and they do not control CIESA, an entity which as explained controls TGS. Neither TGS nor CIESA qualify in the Respondent's view as an investment or as an investor under the Bilateral Investment Treaty. Indirect damages in this view are not included within the scope of the Treaty.\n\n35.\n\nThe Argentine Republic accepts that an investment in shares qualifies for protection under the Bilateral Investment Treaty, but in such a case claims can only be made in respect of measures affecting the shares *qua* shares, as in the event of expropriation of the shares or other measures affecting directly the economic rights of the shareholders. Claims by minority shareholders concerning measures that affect the corporation as a separate legal entity cannot be admissible in the context of the Treaty.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants oppose such views on the ground that they are not claiming for or on behalf of TGS, but in their own right as United States investors with investments qualifying under the Treaty. Their claim, according to the argument, is independent of any claim that TGS might have under Argentine law as it concerns an alleged violation of the Treaty. Claims that are treaty claims can, in the Claimants' view, stand on their own irrespective of whether they may further constitute a breach of TGS's rights under municipal law. Thus, the claims are in that opinion direct and not indirect.\n\n37.\n\nThe question of *jus standi* thus becomes inseparable from the determination of the Claimant's status as a protected investor. This determination involves, first, whether a shareholder can claim for its rights in a foreign company independently from the latter's rights. If so, then the inquiry must determine whether these rights refer only to the Claimants' status as shareholders or also to substantive rights connected with the legal and economic performance of the investment made. These various questions will be addressed next.\n\n*Argentine legislation, international law and ICSID's decisions*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal does not intend to discuss again questions that have been amply considered in recent decisions and which have been also extensively argued by the parties in this case. These questions are mainly the following:\n\n\u2022 The role of Argentine legislation in a determination concerning corporate personality for the purpose of an international claim. It has been concluded in this respect that the applicable provisions in respect of jurisdiction and admissibility are only those of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Investment Treaty. This same conclusion stands for the argument that Argentine legislation would be the applicable law under Article 42 of the Convention, as this Article is designed to govern the applicable law in connection with the merits but not in respect of questions of jurisdiction.\n\n\u2022 The meaning and effect of international law in respect of the rights of minority and non-controlling shareholders to claim independently of a separate corporate entity for the measures that affect their investment. This right has been upheld both under international law and the ICSID Convention.\n\n\u2022 The meaning of the *Barcelona Traction* decision,6 which has been held not to be controlling in investment claims such as the present one, as it deals with the separate question of diplomatic protection in a particular setting.\n\n\u2022 The meaning of a number of decisions issued by ICSID tribunals that have upheld the right of shareholders to claim independently from the affected corporation, but have not considered the question of minority or non-controlling shareholders in itself,7 with few exceptions.8 This Tribunal also notes that the Argentine Republic disagrees with the conclusions of those tribunals or with the relevance of their decisions to the present case.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co. Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain)*, Judgment of February 5, 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, 3\n\n*AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Award of June 27, 1990; *AMT v. Zaire*, ICSID Award of February 21, 1997; *Antoine Goetz et consorts v. R\u00e9publique du Burundi*, Sentence du CIRDI du 10 F\u00e9vrier 1999 ; *Lanco; Genin et al.v. Estonia*, ICSID Award of June 25, 2001; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija* ; *Vivendi*. Also, *CME v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award of September 13, 2001.\n\n*Goetz* ; *CMS*.\n\n39.\n\nThe reasoning supporting the above holdings will not be repeated for the sake of brevity. It is sufficient for the purpose of the present case to emphasize that there is nothing contrary to international law or the ICSID Convention in upholding the concept that shareholders may claim independently from the corporation concerned, even if those shareholders are not in the majority or in control of the company.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal is of course mindful that decisions of ICSID or other arbitral tribunals are not a primary source of rules. The citations of and references to those decisions respond to the fact that the Tribunal in examining the claim and arguments of this case under international law, believes that in essence the conclusions and reasons of those decisions are correct.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal will accordingly discuss with particular attention the situation of these claims under the Bilateral Investment Treaty in view of the existence of facts that are specific to this particular case. This is mainly the case of the foreign investment having been made in CIESA and related companies, all being separate Argentine corporations, and only indirectly in TGS.\n\n*Shareholders' rights under the Bilateral Investment Treaty*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nAs the ICSID Convention did not attempt to define \"investment\", this task was left largely to the parties to bilateral investment treaties or other expressions of consent. It has been aptly commented that there is, however, a limit to this discretion of the parties because they could not validly define as investment in connection with the Convention something absurd or entirely incompatible with its object and purpose.9 The definition of investment relevant to this case is set out in Article I (1) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty, which provides in part:\n\n\"(a) \u2018investment' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(\u2026)\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof.\"\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer: The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2001, paragraph 89.\n\n43.\n\nAs noted above, in the view of the Argentine Republic neither TGS nor CIESA qualify as an investment or as investor under the Bilateral Investment Treaty. While it is admitted that the investment made by the Claimants is protected under the Treaty this would only allow for claims affecting their rights *qua* shareholders. This view, as also noted, is contested by the Claimants.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, as did the Tribunal in *Lanco* and also the Committee on Annulment in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija* or *Vivendi*, the latter in respect of a different but comparable bilateral investment treaty, that the definition of investment set out above is broad indeed. It is apparent that this definition does not exclude claims by minority or non-controlling shareholders. Neither is there anything unreasonable in this definition that would make it incompatible with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\n45.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has made in this context the argument that when treaties have wished to include within their scope indirect damages of the sort claimed in this case, they have done so expressly. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Algiers Claims Settlement Declaration establishing the jurisdiction of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal have been invoked as examples of this express reference. This, it is further explained, is also the case of the Argentina-United Kingdom Bilateral Investment Treaty. Most treaties, in the Respondent's view, allow for claims of locally incorporated companies only when controlled by foreign nationals, a situation not given in the instant case. The silence of the Bilateral Investment Treaty on the question of claims for indirect damage cannot be held, in the Respondent's argument, against the principles established in the legislation of Argentina or international law.\n\n46.\n\nThe fact that a treaty may have provided expressly for certain rights of shareholders does not mean that a treaty not so providing has meant to exclude such rights if this can be reasonably inferred from the provisions of such treaty. Each instrument must be interpreted autonomously in the light of its own context and in the light of its interconnections with international law. Moreover, the United States model investment treaties are based on a rather broad interpretation of investment that was included with the express intention of overriding the eventual restrictive effects that could result from the *Barcelona Traction* decision.\n\n47.\n\nThe rules governing the interpretation of treaties under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties lead to a similar conclusion in so far as the parties to the treaties concerned are different.10 Indeed, the interpretation of a bilateral treaty between two parties in connection with the text of another treaty between different parties will normally be the same, unless the parties express a different intention in accordance with international law. A similar logic is found in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention in so far as subsequent agreement or practice between the parties to the same treaty is taken into account regarding the interpretation of the treaty. There is no evidence in this case that the intention of the parties to the Argentina-United States Bilateral Treaty might be different from that expressed in other investment treaties invoked.\n\nConvention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969, Article 31.\n\n48.\n\nThe parties in this case have also discussed the meaning and extent of the *Mondev* case11 where, as indicated by the Argentine Republic, the United States held the view that shareholders cannot claim for injury to a corporation and can claim only for direct injuries suffered in their capacity as shareholders. The Claimants have argued that what matters is the conclusion of the tribunal in that case, which dismissed the United States' arguments and upheld the claimant's standing. The Tribunal must note in this connection that what the State of nationality of the investor might argue in a given case to which it is a party cannot be held against the rights of the investor in a separate case to which the investor is a party. This is precisely the merit of the ICSID Convention in that it overcame the deficiencies of diplomatic protection where the investor was subject to whatever political or legal determination the State of nationality would make in respect of its claim.\n\n*Mondev International Limited v. United States of America,* ICSID Award of October 11, 2002, International Legal Materials, Vol. 42, 2003, p. 85.\n\n49.\n\nThis Tribunal must accordingly conclude that under the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty, broad as they are, claims made by investors that are not in the majority or in the control of the affected corporation when claiming for violations of their rights under such treaty are admissible. Whether the locally incorporated company may further claim for the violation of its rights under contracts, licences or other instruments, does not affect the direct right of action of foreign shareholders under the Bilateral Investment Treaty for protecting their interests in the qualifying investment.\n\n50.\n\nBut this conclusion is not the end of the matter. It was explained above that the Claimants made their investment in various companies participating in CIESA and only marginally in TGS. That is, they invested in a string of locally incorporated companies that in turn made the investment in TGS. The Argentine Republic has rightly raised a concern about the fact that if minority shareholders can claim independently from the affected corporation, this could trigger an endless chain of claims, as any shareholder making an investment in a company that makes an investment in another company, and so on, could invoke a direct right of action for measures affecting a corporation at the end of the chain.\n\n51.\n\nCounsel for the Argentine Republic have addressed this issue by describing the case as one in which \"certain investor who is the owner of the shares in certain corporations which, in turn, own shares of an Argentine corporation, that does not qualify either as investor or as an investment, alleges that the treaty was breached as a consequence of certain tax claims over the latter corporation\".12\n\nReply on Jurisdiction by the Argentine Republic, paragraph 115.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while investors can claim in their own right under the provisions of the treaty, there is indeed a need to establish a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected company. As this is in essence a question of admissibility of claims, the answer lies in establishing the extent of the consent to arbitration of the host State. If consent has been given in respect of an investor and an investment, it can be reasonably concluded that the claims brought by such investor are admissible under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as extending to another investor or investment, these other claims should then be considered inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the legal system protecting that investment.\n\n53.\n\nThis issue was discussed, but not actually decided, in the ICSID case of *Gruslin* v *. Malaysia*,13 where the respondent government raised as an objection to jurisdiction the question that \".the Claimant has made no investment in Malaysia, and has no legal relationship with Malaysia that falls within the scope of the investment treaty\".14 The Tribunal in that case ruled that it lacked jurisdiction on another ground, namely that the investment was not made in an approved project as required under the pertinent bilateral investment treaty, thus making unnecessary a determination of the first issue. It is also interesting to note that the objection raised relied on the argument that the claimant was not the \"owner\" of the investment and that its rights in respect of the management company involved were no more than rights of a contractual nature.15\n\n*Philippe Gruslin v. Malaysia,* ICSID Award of November 27, 2000, ICSID Reports, Vol. 5, p. 483.\n\n*Gruslin*, paragraph 15.1.\n\n*Gruslin*, paragraph 10.3.\n\n54.\n\nAt the hearing on jurisdiction held in the present case, the Tribunal put a question to the parties as to whether the Claimants had been invited by the Government of Argentina to participate in the investment connected to the privatization of TGS. It turned out that this had been precisely the case.\n\n55.\n\nIn fact, the Information Memorandum issued in 199216 and other instruments related to the privatization of the gas industry had specifically invited foreign investors to participate in this process. A \"road show\" followed in key cities around the world and specific meetings with the Claimants were held in this context. Successful bidders were required to establish an investment company in Argentina \"which will hold their interest in the licensed operating company\". Moreover, the technical expertise of the Claimants was one of the elements required to materialize their participation in the process. This explains why EPCA was required to execute the Transfer Agreement and to enter into a Technical Assistance Agreement with TGS. The requirements of the Technical Assistance Agreement referred not only to the Technical Operator but also to the \"company participating in the same Economic Group providing the necessary technical support\". The investors also had certain decision-making power in the management of TGS. The pertinent officials of the Argentine Government were kept abreast of the various corporate arrangements organized to materialize the investment sought.\n\nInformation Memorandum on the Initial Public Tender Offer, 1992.\n\n56.\n\nThe conclusion that follows is that in the present case the participation of the Claimants was specifically sought and that they are thus included within the consent to arbitration given by the Argentine Republic. The Claimants cannot be considered to be only remotely connected to the legal arrangements governing the privatization, they are beyond any doubt the owners of the investment made and their rights are protected under the Treaty as clearly established treaty-rights and not merely contractual rights related to some intermediary. The fact that the investment was made through CIESA and related companies does not in any way alter this conclusion.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly decides that the claim in the present case is admissible under the Bilateral Investment Treaty or, stated in another way, that the Claimants have *jus standi* under this Treaty in their capacity as protected investors.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning the lack of direct connection between the dispute and the investment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs a question separate from, but related to, the discussion examined above, the Argentine Republic has raised a jurisdictional objection on the ground that the dispute does not arise directly out of an investment as required by the ICSID Convention. In the Respondent's view, as neither TGS nor CIESA qualify as investments or investors under the Treaty, and the dispute concerns only tax obligations of TGS, the claims in this case do not arise directly out of an investment made by the Claimants. The investment in shares is recognized by the Argentine Republic as an investment protected under the Treaty, but only in respect of rights that might be invoked by the Claimants *qua* shareholders, a matter discussed above.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants have explained in this connection that they do not consider the TGS Share Transfer Agreement as an investment agreement or as an investment in and of itself, but that the investment they have made in shares of CIESA and TGS does qualify as an investment under the Treaty. Their right of action, the argument goes on, is related to the protection the Treaty gives to their investment in those shares and, accordingly, the dispute arises directly out of an investment.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above that the rights of the Claimants can be asserted independently from the rights of TGS or CIESA. As the Claimants have a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the investment made, the Tribunal concludes that the present dispute arises directly out of the investment made and that accordingly there is no obstacle to a finding of jurisdiction on this count.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection as to the consent to arbitration excluding tax matters*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nArticle XII of the Bilateral Investment Treaty governs tax matters. Paragraph 1 of this Article states the overall policy on taxation, the Parties undertaking to \"strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party\". Paragraph 2 of the Article concerns the application of the Treaty to tax matters in the following terms:\n\n\"Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VII and VIII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article IV;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VII (1) (a) or (b),\n\n62.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has argued that the claim made in this case exceeds the limits set out in Article XII, first because the Claimants complain about the violation of the \"transparency principle\" in tax matters and about the lack of effective means available in Argentina for the protection of their rights. None of these questions, in the Respondent's view, allow for the application of the Treaty in accordance with Article XII. Moreover, the Respondent further argues, not even the complaint about violation of fair and equitable treatment could be brought in connection with tax matters as the Treaty only requires the parties to \"strive\" in this respect.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent is also of the view that the Claimants cannot invoke expropriation or the violation of an investment agreement or authorization as these questions are unrelated to the tax assessments affecting TGS and, furthermore, there is no investment agreement or authorization. The Treaty, it is concluded, does not apply to the present claim under Article XII as it concerns only tax matters; nor are the remedies sought by the Claimants allowed for under this Article or the Treaty.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimants hold a different view. First, in their opinion fairness and equity as invoked in paragraph 1 of the Article are not meaningless, and \"to strive\" involves a commitment that cannot be ignored in the implementation of tax policies. Second, the Claimants argue that they are specifically invoking expropriation as part of their claim on the merits, as the tax assessed constitutes a measure tantamount to expropriation. And third, the Claimants believe that fair and equitable treatment and other standards set out in Article II (2) of the Treaty do apply as they are conditions for legal expropriation under Article IV of the Treaty.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no disagreement about the fact that the dispute concerns a tax matter. However, it is also quite apparent that in the Claimants' submissions expropriation is a prominent cause for action under the Treaty. The Treaty builds in this connection a chain of linkages between the pertinent provisions. First, it is quite true that to strive under paragraph 1 of Article XII is not a meaningless reference. It is even less so in the present case, where the Federal Government of the Argentine Republic shares the concerns of the Claimants about the tax assessments by the Provinces. Second, if expropriation is invoked and there is a finding upholding this allegation, then the Treaty becomes applicable without question. This finding is of course a matter that can only be considered on the merits.\n\n66.\n\nIt is also important to note that once expropriation is invoked, as indeed it has been, then the connection between Article IV and the standards of treatment under Article II (2) of the Treaty becomes operational, including fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and treatment not less than that required by international law. In turn, this brings in the meaning of paragraph 1 of Article XII. It is in this context, and not in isolation, that the questions of transparency and the availability of effective remedies also become relevant. And, above all, the whole discussion is then governed by Article VII of the Treaty on the settlement of disputes.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants have satisfied the requirement of having a present interest to bring action under the Treaty, particularly in view of the fact that is has been alleged that the tax assessments resulted in the violation of specific provisions and standards of treatment established in the Treaty. These allegations can only be considered at the merits phase of the case, but *prima facie* they are sufficient to justify the exercise of the right of action by the Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal upholds jurisdiction to consider the matter on the merits as far as this objection is concerned.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection related to the absence of investment agreement or authorization*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has raised another jurisdictional objection related to the question of absence of an investment agreement or authorization, another possibility foreseen by Article XII to trigger the application of the Treaty to tax matters and in particular the operation of the dispute settlement mechanism of Article VII. A part of the Claimants' complaint concerns the duty of the Argentine Republic to indemnify the investors for taxes assessed in respect of periods prior to the privatization of TGS as provided for under the Transfer Agreement. In the argument of the Respondent the Transfer Agreement does not qualify as an investment agreement or authorization because it only concerns TGS and not the Claimants. Moreover, it is argued that the conditions for the indemnification have not been satisfied.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants have explained, as noted above, that they consider the Transfer Agreement not as an investment agreement or authorization in itself, but that certainly it is a part of the overall elements involved in the privatization and the investment in shares which cannot now be ignored. In their view, the investment is a process that was manifested in several instruments, not just one agreement or authorization, and the claim concerns their rights as investors in the process as a whole. In particular the Claimants invoke the fact that EPCA, as noted, was required to execute the Transfer Agreement and, moreover, it executed a Technical Assistance Agreement with TGS in its capacity as technical operator. The Claimants have expressly stated that they have not desisted of their claim in connection with the existence of an investment agreement thus conceived. Accordingly, the argument continues, both Article XII and VII are applicable in this context.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this context that an investment is indeed a complex process including various arrangements, such as contracts, licences and other agreements leading to the materialization of such investment, a process in turn governed by the Treaty. This particular aspect was explained by an ICSID tribunal as \"the general unity of an investment operation\"17 and by one other tribunal considering an investment based on several instruments as constituting \"an indivisible whole\".18\n\nPierre Lalive: \"The First \u2018World Bank' Arbitration (*Holiday Inns v. Morocco*) - Some Legal Problems\", British Year Book of International Law, Vol. 51, 1980, p. 123.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner v. Cameroon,* ICSID Award of October 21, 1983, ICSID Reports, Vol. 2, p. 3.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal must examine these various aspects to reach a conclusion about the claim and particularly about the manner in which tax measures might have affected the protected investment. Such a determination again belongs to the merits, particularly in so far there is a need to establish whether the requirements of indemnification have or have not been met. Accordingly, jurisdiction to consider these other aspects of the claim must also be upheld.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning a hypothetical dispute*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe parties have different views concerning the nature of the dispute. While for the Argentine Republic the dispute is purely hypothetical, for the Claimants it is quite actual and specific. The Respondent argues that because the taxes assessed have not been collected and might never be, or be collected only in a small amount, the dispute is hypothetical and not actual. As a result, according to the argument, expropriation has not occurred and cannot be invoked in the context of the present claim.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants believe otherwise. About AR$ 800 million have been assessed in taxes, enough to wipe out the entire value of the investment and lead to the Claimants' bankruptcy, cancellation of the licence and other consequences. This amount has not been collected only because there is an injunction ordered by the Supreme Court suspending judicial collection of those amounts. Expropriation, it is further argued, can occur much earlier than the actual taking of the investors' property or funds, as many times this is also a process gradual in time. All of it, the argument continues, results in the specific violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that once the taxes have been assessed and the payment ordered there is a liability of the investor irrespective of the actual collection of those amounts. This means that a claim seeking protection under the Treaty is not hypothetical but relates to a very specific dispute between the parties. Whether there has been a violation of the terms of the Treaty and its eventual extent is an aspect that belongs to the merits. The eventuality of an expropriation and its conditions is still more so. The Tribunal cannot decline its jurisdiction to examine these various points of fact and law. Jurisdiction is accordingly affirmed on this point too.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning injunctive relief and other remedies*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has made two objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal concerning the remedies requested by the Claimants. The first objection relates to the question that any remedy would really have its effect on TGS, which cannot benefit from the claim as not being in the Respondent's view an investment or an investor under the Treaty. This part of the objection has been dealt with above in the context of the determination that the Claimants are exercising a right in their own capacity under the Treaty which is separate from any rights appurtenant to TGS. Whether a remedy, in addition to protecting the investors' rights, benefits a separate but related corporate entity is not a ground for objection to jurisdiction.\n\n76.\n\nThe second objection to jurisdiction made under this heading is more complex. It concerns the power of the Tribunal to order injunctive relief. In the Respondent's view the Tribunal lacks such a power under the Convention and the Treaty, and it could only either issue a declaratory statement that might satisfy the investor or else determine the payment of compensation based on a finding that a certain measure is wrongful. In particular it is argued that an ICSID tribunal cannot impede an expropriation that falls exclusively within the ambit of State sovereignty; that tribunal could only establish whether there has been an expropriation, its legality or illegality and the corresponding compensation.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants agree on the point that a tribunal has the power to issue a declaratory statement, but in addition they believe that it can order injunctive relief concerning the performance or non-performance of certain acts. To this end, an award can deal both with pecuniary and non-pecuniary determinations, including specific performance and an injunction. In the present case the Claimants have indeed requested that the taxes assessed be declared expropriatory and in breach of the Treaty and unlawful, and that they be annulled and their collection permanently enjoined.\n\n78.\n\nThe parties have discussed in this context the decisions of ICSID Tribunals and other courts and tribunals. For the Claimants, the ICSID case of *Goetz* v. *Burundi*,19 like the cases decided by other tribunals in *Martini* (Italy v. Venezuela),20 the *Trail Smelter* (United States v. Canada),21 the *La Grand* (Germany v. United States)22 and the *Arrest Warrant* (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium),23 amply support their view about tribunals having a broad power to order injunctive relief and other non-pecuniary measures. The Respondent argues that these various cases are not relevant here, either because they involve inter-State disputes or because they are based on the agreement of the parties, concern contractual relations or the tribunals have been specifically empowered to adopt measures of the kind requested. Neither is the subject matter of this case, the Respondent further argues, in any way related to recent decisions of the International Court of Justice.\n\n*Goetz*, op. cit\n\n*Martini case* (Italy v. Venezuela), American Journal of International Law, Vol. 25, 1931, p. 554, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 102.\n\n*Trail Smelter case* (United States v. Canada), U.N.R.I.A.A., Vol. 3, 1941, p. 1905, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 104.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *La Grand case* (Germany v. United States), June 27, 2001, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 105.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, *Arrest Warrant case* (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium), February 14, 2002, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 106.\n\n79.\n\nAn examination of the powers of international courts and tribunals to order measures concerning performance or injunction and of the ample practice that is available in this respect, leaves this Tribunal in no doubt about the fact that these powers are indeed available. The Claimants have convincingly invoked the authority of the *Rainbow Warrior*, where it was held:\n\n\"The authority to issue an order for the cessation or discontinuance of a wrongful act or omission results from the inherent powers of a competent tribunal which is confronted with the continuous breach of an international obligation which is in force and continues to be in force. The delivery of such an order requires, therefore, two essential conditions intimately linked, namely that the wrongful act has a continuing character and that the violated rule is still in force at the time in which the order is issued\".24\n\n*Rainbow Warrior,* R.I.A.A., Vol. XX, 1990, p. 217, at 270, paragraph 114, as cited in James Crawford: The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, 2002, p. 196, note 457 and associated text, and in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 107.\n\n80.\n\nThe same holds true under the ICSID Convention. In *Goetz* v. *Burundi* such a power was indeed resorted to by the Tribunal, and the fact that it was based on a settlement agreement between the parties does not deprive the decision of the Tribunal of its own legal force and standing. A scholarly opinion invoked by the Claimants is also relevant in this context, having an author concluding that it is\n\n\"...entirely possible that future cases will involve disputes arising from ongoing relationships in which awards providing for specific performance or injunctions become relevant\".25\n\nSchreuer, op. cit, at 1126, paragraph 73, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 100.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that, in addition to declaratory powers, it has the power to order measures involving performance or injunction of certain acts. Jurisdiction is therefore also affirmed on this ground. What kind of measures might or might not be justified, whether the acts complained of meet the standards set out in the *Rainbow Warrior*, and how the issue of implementation that the parties have also discussed would be handled, if appropriate, are all matters that belong to the merits.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning the absence of notification in respect of the Provinces of La Pampa and Chubut*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has raised yet another jurisdictional objection on the ground that the claims against the Provinces of La Pampa and Chubut, unlike those concerning Neuqu\u00e9n and Rio Negro, were not notified to the Respondent in accordance with the Treaty requirements and hence neither was the six-month consultation period observed.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants oppose such objection arguing that there is a single continuing dispute about the tax assessments of various Provinces of the Argentine Republic that stems from the same factual background and involves the same causes of action under the Treaty. Moreover, the Claimants believe that they can update the Request for Arbitration in their Memorial and that, in any event, they are entitled to submit such disputes as an ancillary or additional claim under Article 46 of the Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40. As in the view of the Claimants the issues at stake relate to the same dispute, there is no need to register a second dispute when the relevant issues arise out of the same subject matter as that of a dispute already registered.\n\n84.\n\nThere can be no doubt in the present case about the fact that the dispute relates in identical terms to various Provinces. It is the same tax that has been assessed by the Provinces in respect of several operations of TGS, involving exactly the same legal issues both under Argentine law and the Bilateral Investment Treaty. Moreover, the Request for Arbitration expressly indicated that other Provinces could seek to assess those taxes on the same type of instruments, a matter that was spelled out in connection with La Pampa and Chubut in the Claimants' memorial. At some point the Province of Santa Cruz was also mentioned in the context of this dispute, but this particular Province has not been named in the submissions before this Tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nEven more so than the situation discussed in the *Metalclad*,26*Pope & Talbot Inc.27* and *Ethyl28* cases, the filing of multiple, subsequent and related actions in this case would lead to a superlative degree of inefficiency and inequity. This would be particularly unjustified in view of the many efforts by ICSID to avoid the multiplicity of proceedings concerning the Argentine Republic.\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico,* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, (August 30, 2000), International Legal Materials, Vol. 40, 2001, at 36.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada* (Award Concerning the Motion by the Government of Canada Respecting the Claim Based upon the Imposition of the \"Super Fee\" (August 7, 2000)).\n\n*Ethyl Corp. v. Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction of June 24, 1998, International Legal Materials, Vol. 38, 1999, at 700, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 120.\n\n86.\n\nIn this context, the question that this Tribunal must answer is not even whether the claims in respect of La Pampa and Chubut can be considered as ancillary or additional claims. It is the much simpler question whether the action of other Provinces further extending the same dispute already registered requires a separate registration and procedure. It certainly does not.\n\n87.\n\nThe issue concerning the observance of the six-month consultation period becomes therefore moot. If the Argentine Republic had the opportunity to consider negotiations with the investors on the occasion of the first claims, and the claims that followed did not involve any new element, the observance of this requirement is evidently fulfilled. This is particularly so in view of the fact that the Argentine Republic did not take advantage of the possibility of defusing the dispute during that start-up period.\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to note in this matter, however, that the conclusion reached is not because the six-month negotiation period could be a procedural and not a jurisdictional requirement as has been argued by the Claimants and affirmed by other tribunals.29 Such requirement is in the view of the Tribunal very much a jurisdictional one. A failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction. In the present case, as noted, the requirement was complied with in view of the identical nature and scope of the dispute with the Argentine Provinces; the same holds true if a dispute is ruled to be ancillary or additional to an earlier claim.\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic*, Final Award of the UNCITRAL Tribunal of September 3, 2001; *Ethyl*, op. cit.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning the dispute on indemnity under the Transfer Agreement*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has also objected to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal in respect of the indemnity dispute under the Transfer Agreement on the ground that this Agreement provides for the submission of disputes to the Argentine courts. This aspect of the dispute, it is argued, should be considered as a purely contractual dispute and hence it is not subject to the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal under the Convention. The Respondent explains that in its view this situation is different from that relating to a contractual dispute which in turn becomes an investment dispute under the Treaty.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants again believe otherwise. In their view, even if the Transfer Agreement had a choice of forum clause they still have an option under the Treaty to resort to arbitration because the actual claim does not relate to contractual performance but to the violation of the investors' rights under the Treaty.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the various ICSID decisions that have recently discussed this very issue, particularly those in *Lanco*, *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija* (Award and Annulment), *Wena*,30*CMS* and *Salini*.31 In all these cases the tribunals have upheld jurisdiction under the Convention to address violations of contracts which, at the same time, constitute a breach of the pertinent bilateral investment treaty. The Tribunal will not repeat those considerations.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt*, ICSID Decision of the Annulment Committee, February 5, 2002.\n\n*Salini v. Morocco,* ICSID Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001, International Legal Materials, Vol. 42, 2003, at 609.\n\n92.\n\nThe issue for the Tribunal is then a narrower one, namely whether the indemnity clause of the Transfer Agreement is just a contractual provision subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the Argentine Republic, or if it is in addition a clause that concerns the rights of the investors under the Treaty. In the latter case the Tribunal has jurisdiction in so far as those rights are concerned.\n\n93.\n\nThe indemnity clause is no doubt a contractual provision that relates to tax indemnification of the investors, together with other parties to the Transfer Agreement, if certain conditions are met. The present dispute concerns tax assessments by the Provinces that in the opinion of the Claimants trigger the operation of that clause. Should this be so, then the breach of the clause becomes instantly a violation of the Treaty rights. This effect is independent of whether the investors alone can benefit by resorting to ICSID jurisdiction or others might benefit from such action as well, just as it is independent of whether TGS might benefit from a certain action brought about by the investors. There is no practical way in this context to separate the operation of the indemnity clause from the treaty rights, particularly in so far as it has been noted above that Article XII of the Treaty is intertwined with both Article VII on dispute settlement and with Article II on the substantive treatment owed to the investors.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that it also has jurisdiction to consider this matter on the merits.\n\n*Jurisdictional objection concerning the triggering of the \"fork in the road\"*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has made a jurisdictional objection in the alternative on the ground that TGS has applied to various courts of the Argentine Republic seeking remedies in respect of the tax measures affecting it. This, it is affirmed, amounts to the choice of local courts under the Treaty and hence the \"fork in the road\" provision has been triggered. In that argument the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal would thus be precluded.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants are of the view that the claimants, the respondents and the subject matter of the actions before Argentine courts being different from those involved in the present arbitration, there could be no triggering of the \"fork in the road\". They explain to this end that before local courts it is TGS and not the investors who is claiming, that the Respondents are the Provinces and not the government of the Argentine Republic, and that the subject matter concerns a violation of the legislation of Argentina and not a violation of treaty rights.\n\n97.\n\nThis Tribunal is mindful of various decisions of ICSID Tribunals also discussing this very issue, particularly *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija*, *Genin*, and *Olgu\u00edn*.32 In all these cases the difference between the violation of a contract and the violation of a treaty, as well as the different effects that such violations might entail, have been admitted, not ignoring of course that the violation of a legal rule will always have similar negative effects irrespective of its nature. It has accordingly been held that even if there was recourse to local courts for breach of contract this would not prevent resorting to ICSID arbitration for violation of treaty rights, or that in any event, as held in *Benvenuti & Bonfant*, any situation of *lis pendens* would require identity of the parties.33 Neither will these considerations be repeated here.\n\n*Olgu\u00edn v. Paraguay*, ICSID Decision on Jurisdiction of August 8, 2000.\n\n*Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo,* ICSID Award of August 8, 1980, International Legal Materials, Vol. 21, 1982, p. 740, as cited in Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, footnote 142.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the present case the Claimants have not made submissions before local courts and those made by TGS are separate and distinct. Moreover, the actions by TGS itself have been mainly in the defensive so as to oppose the tax measures imposed, and the decision to do so has been ordered by ENARGAS, the agency entrusted with the regulation of the gas sector. The conditions for the operation of the principle *electa una via* or \"fork in the road\" are thus simply not present. The Tribunal accordingly dismisses the objection to jurisdiction on this other ground.\n\n*Jurisdiction affirmed*\n-----------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe fact that the Claimants have argued and demonstrated *prima facie* that they have been adversely affected by the tax measures complained of is sufficient for the Tribunal to consider that the claim, as far as this matter is concerned, is within its jurisdiction to examine such claim on the merits under the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal must note in concluding that counsel for both parties have performed their duties with outstanding professionalism and have at all times fully cooperated with the work of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Decision**\n---------------\n\n101.\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. The Order necessary for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4) has, accordingly, been made.\n\nSo decided."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim)", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2004-08-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim)\n------------------------------------------\n\nProcedural History\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. (\"Claimants\") submitted before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"Centre\") a request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic (\"Argentine Republic\" or \"Argentina\") for alleged violations of the provisions of the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (\"Treaty\"). The request concerns the adoption by the Government of Argentina of certain measures that allegedly affect the Claimants' investment in a gas transportation company.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants had previously submitted a request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic, also for alleged violations of the Treaty. However, at that time the Claimants disputed the assessment of Stamp Taxes that certain Argentinean provinces applied to the gas transportation company where the Claimants have their investment (\"first dispute\"). This request was registered by the Centre on April 11, 2001.\n\n3.\n\nAfter requesting observations from the Argentine Republic with respect to the Claimants' request for arbitration of March 25, 2003, the Tribunal decided, in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"Convention\"), to accept such request as a claim ancillary to the one already registered by the Centre (\"ancillary claim\").\n\n4.\n\nIn its decision, the Tribunal proposed to handle both disputes independently until it decided on the exceptions to jurisdiction in both cases. In addition, the Tribunal also proposed an expeditious schedule in order for the parties to file their written submissions on jurisdiction in connection with the ancillary claim. Based on this schedule, Argentina filed its memorial on jurisdiction on August 20, 2003, while the Claimants filed their countermemorial on jurisdiction on October 17, 2003. Then, on November 19, 2003, Argentina filed its reply and on December 22, 2003, the Claimants filed their rejoinder.\n\n5.\n\nThe exceptions to jurisdiction regarding the first dispute were resolved by the Tribunal on January 14, 2004. In its decision, the Tribunal declared that it has jurisdiction over the first dispute.\n\n6.\n\nSubsequently, a hearing on jurisdiction regarding the ancillary claim was held in Paris, on April 1 and 2, 2004. At the hearing the Claimants were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop and Craig S. Miles from the law firm of King & Spalding, Houston, United States, as well as by Messrs. Guido Santiago Tawil, Alix M. Mart\u00ednez and Ms. Silvia M. Marchili from the law firm of M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Messrs. Bishop and Tawil addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. The Argentine Republic was represented by Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Ms. Ana Badillos, and Mr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s from the office of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. All of them addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic.\n\n7.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with the Rule 32(2) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the Centre (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\nThe Dispute between the Parties\n-------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nAs noted above, this is the second dispute between Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L. P and the Argentine Republic brought before this Tribunal. The first dispute concerned the assessment of Stamp Taxes by the Argentine Provinces and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal was affirmed by its decision of January 14, 2004 *(Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic)* (\"Stamp Tax Decision\"). This dispute is an ancillary claim arising from the refusal of the Argentine Government to allow tariff adjustments in accordance with the United States Producer Price Index (\"PPI\") and the enactment of Law No. 25,561 which nullified PPI adjustments and the calculation of tariffs in dollars of the United States of America. In the Claimants' argument, these various measures violate the commitment made to the investor under the Treaty.\n\n9.\n\nThe extent of the participation by the Claimants in the privatization of the gas industry in Argentina has been explained in the Stamp Tax Decision, and shall not be repeated here. The same holds true of the various shareholding arrangements and companies set up to this end. The Tribunal notes, however, that the parties have continued to argue about the shareholding arrangements connected with the participation of Enron in *Transportadora de Gas del Sur Sociedad An\u00f3nima* (\"TGS\") and related companies.\n\n10.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has requested that Enron explain these arrangements and the Claimants have provided the Tribunal and Argentina with a number of documents to this effect. The Tribunal is satisfied that the shareholding arrangements have not changed, or not in any significant manner, since the Stamp Tax Decision. Should these arrangements change, evidently the Tribunal will take any developments into account. The Claimants have undertaken the commitment of informing the Tribunal promptly of any changes in this matter.\n\nArgentina's Economic Emergency\n------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nAn extensive portion of the pleadings of the Argentine Republic and the documents submitted in this dispute concern explanations about the economic and social emergency affecting that country.\n\n12.\n\nAlthough most of these aspects belong to the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal is nonetheless aware of this emergency and takes due note of it. At this stage, it is only appropriate to conclude, as in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (\"CMS\"),1 that the Tribunal is not here to examine measures of general economic policy or to judge whether they are right or wrong. Its duty is only to examine in due course \"whether specific measures affecting the Claimant's investment or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\".\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, par. 33; see also *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, pars. 29-30.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that while for Argentina there are two different disputes involved in this claim, one relating to the PPI and the other to legislative emergency measures, in the Claimants' view the dispute is just one evolving set of measures that have ended up affecting the investor's rights.\n\nArgentina's Objections to Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nLike in the Stamp Tax dispute, the Argentine Republic has raised five objections to the jurisdiction of the Center and the competence of the Tribunal. These are first that the Claimants lacks *ius standi* because the dispute concerns contractual rights that appertain to TGS and not the Claimants. Second, an indirect claim such as that asserted by the Claimants is in violation of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention. Third, the dispute does not arise directly out of an investment as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention. Fourth, the existence of a forum selection clause in the License Contract prevails over any other forum. And fifth, the dispute has already been submitted to the local courts of Argentina.\n\n15.\n\nSince these arguments have already been discussed in the Stamp Tax Decision, and the situation in respect of this dispute is not different, the Tribunal will address them briefly and devote more attention to certain aspects that the Argentine Republic has emphasized in respect of this particular dispute.\n\nJurisdictional Objection Based on the Lack of *Ius Standi* and Related Questions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Argentine Republic first objects to the competence of the Tribunal on the ground that the Claimants lack *ius standi* because only TGS is entitled to bring claims as a corporation. The point has been raised as one of admissibility.\n\n17.\n\nIn Argentina's view shareholders cannot claim separately from the corporation, not even in proportion to their interest, as they would have only an indirect claim. Under both Argentine legislation and international law, Argentina argues, corporate personality does not allow for indirect claims by shareholders. To the extent that this has been allowed it has always been under express provisions of an exceptional nature. While an investment in shares might qualify for protection under the Treaty, this is only when the shares have been affected as such by measures of the host Government.\n\n18.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, however, the Treaty specifically allows investors to bring action in relation to their investments, and there is nothing in international law that precludes the exercise of this right. Their claim is independent of any claim that TGS might have as the holder of the License.\n\n19.\n\nAgain in this case, the parties have discussed the meaning of the *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited* (\"Barcelona Traction\")2 and the *Elettronica* *Sicula, S.p.A*. (\"ELSI\")3 cases in so far as these decisions reflect customary international law. Argentine legislation has also been discussed in this context. In particular, the Claimants argue that the Treaty does not require the Claimants' control of TGS and that a number of ICSID cases have upheld the right of investors to claim on their own right.4\n\nInternational Court of Justice, \" *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited* \", (New Application: 1962) (Belgium v. Spain) (1962-1970).\n\nInternational Court of Justice, \" *Elettronica Sicula, S.p.A*.\" (ELSI), United States of America v. Italy (1987 1989).\n\n*Lanco International, Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Decision of December 8, 1998; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of November 21, 2000; *Antoine Goetz and others v. Republic of Burundi* (ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3), Award of February 10, 1999; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment Proceeding of July 3, 2002; and *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003.\n\n20.\n\nAs was also discussed in the Stamp Tax Decision, Argentina is rightly concerned about the fact that successive claims by minority shareholders that invest in companies that in turn invest in other companies, could end up with claims that are only remotely connected to the measures questioned. However, as explained by the Tribunal in that case, there is a clear limit to this chain in so far as the consent to the arbitration clause is only related to specific investors.5\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of January 14, 2004, pars. 50-53.\n\n21.\n\nThe parties also have different views about the second and third jurisdictional objections raised by Argentina. The question of indirect claims is inseparable from the conclusion on *ius standi* : to the extent that minority shareholders are allowed to claim this situation by definition will include investors that could be described as having an indirect participation. The connection of this matter to Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention will be discussed further below.\n\n22.\n\nWhether the dispute arises directly out of an investment is related to the same issue as that of which are precisely the rights of the investor under the Treaty. If both majority and minority shareholders are allowed to claim it is because they are protected investors under the Treaty. This element will govern the conclusion as to whether the dispute arises directly out of an investment.\n\nJurisdictional Objection Concerning the Existence of a Contractual Forum Selection Clause and the Submission of the Dispute to Local Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nTwo other objections raised by the Argentine Republic concern the issue of the existence of a forum selection clause in the License Contract and the related question of whether the dispute was submitted to the local courts. Argentina believes that the forum selection clause of the Contract, assigning exclusive jurisdiction to the Administrative Courts of Buenos Aires, prevails. The Claimants, it is argued, are a third party to that Contract without a right of action of their own. Moreover, it is argued that TGS appealed the PPI measures and submitted to administrative courts other aspects of the dispute.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants oppose such conclusions and are of the view that contractual choice of forum provisions do not impede ICSID jurisdiction when a Treaty-based claim is involved.6 In addition, the Claimants argue that they have not resorted to any local court in Argentina and that eventual actions by TGS do not preclude resort to ICSID arbitration by the Claimants, as held in *Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia* (\"Genin\")7 and *CMS*.8\n\n*Lanco International, Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Decision of December 8, 1998; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of November 21, 2000; *Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment Proceeding of July 3, 2002; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment Proceeding of February 5, 2002; and *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003.\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Award of June 25, 2001.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003.\n\nThe Tribunal's Findings in Respect of Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the view expressed by the Argentine Republic in the hearing on jurisdiction held in respect of this dispute, to the effect that the decisions of ICSID tribunals are not binding precedents and that every case must be examined in the light of its own circumstances. This was also the conclusion expressed by the Tribunal in the Stamp Tax Claim Decision.9 The key issues raised by the parties in connection with jurisdiction in this case, however, are not really different from those raised in earlier cases. This being the case, the conclusions of the Tribunal follow the same line of reasoning, not because there might be a compulsory precedent but because the circumstances of the various cases are comparable, and in some respects identical.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of January 14, 2004, par. 40.\n\n26.\n\nBecause the present claim is an ancillary one to that in the Stamp Tax Claim, the Tribunal could have relied on the jurisdictional findings made in that Decision and extend them to this additional dispute. However, the Tribunal has wished to examine anew the jurisdictional arguments made by the Argentine Republic and the views of the Claimants on this matter. The parties have not really made any new argument in this respect and, therefore, the Tribunal sees no basis for changing any of the conclusions already reached in the Stamp Tax Claim.\n\n27.\n\nIt follows that the Tribunal is persuaded that again in this case the Claimants have *ius standi* to claim in their own right as they are protected investors under the Treaty.10 The Claimants' right to bring an action on their own has been firmly established in the Treaty and there are no reasons to hold otherwise in connection with this dispute. Neither is this situation contrary to international law or to ICSID practice and decisions.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, pars. 62-63.\n\n28.\n\nForeign investors, such as the Claimants, were specifically invited to participate in the privatization process, various companies were set up in Argentina to this effect and investments were channeled into TGS through this network of corporate arrangements. It is simply not tenable to try now to dissociate TGS from those other companies and the investors and argue that the Claimants do not have *ius standi*. This is one of the essential features of the Treaty and the protection it extends to foreign investors.\n\n29.\n\nThe Treaty language and intent is specific in extending this protection to minority or indirect shareholders. The Tribunal must also emphasize that the definition of investment under Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty has been expressly related to the direct or indirect ownership or control by the foreign national:\n\n(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(...)\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n30.\n\nThis definition is the one that controls the whole discussion. It evidently includes the channeling of investments through locally incorporated companies, particularly when this is mandated by the very legal arrangements governing the privatization process in Argentina. Not only was it required that TGS be an Argentine company but also that the holding companies should be incorporated in Argentina.\n\n31.\n\nFaced with this very explicit provision, the Tribunal can only conclude that indirect investments are specifically protected under the Treaty.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation is, in addition, fully consistent with the rules on the interpretation of treaties laid down in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Article 31.1 of this Convention provides that \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". Also Article 32 indicates the recourse to supplementary means of interpretation, including the \"preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\". That the Treaty was made with the specific purpose of guaranteeing the rights of the foreign investors and encouraging their participation in the privatization process, is beyond doubt. In view of the explicit text of the Treaty and its object and purpose, it is not even necessary to resort to supplementary means of interpretation, such as the preparatory work, a step that would be required only in case of insufficient elements of interpretation in connection with the rule laid down in Article 31 of the Convention.\n\nThe *Mondev* Case Distinguished\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has relied, however, on some recent and earlier cases with a view to request that tribunals should be consistent in their decisions. The Tribunal will examine these cases so as to appreciate their real meaning and extent.\n\n34.\n\nThe first case on which the Argentine Republic relies is *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (\"Mondev\").11 Here, it is correctly argued, the United States adopted the view that shareholders cannot assert claims under the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") for damages suffered by the company in which they own shares. Also NAFTA Article 1139 refers to both direct and indirect ownership or control of investments. This same interpretation, it is argued, should be adopted by this Tribunal particularly because the United States is a party to the Treaty.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of October 11, 2002.\n\n35.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal in *Mondev* reached a different conclusion. After explaining Mondev's argument to the effect that the phrase \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly\" was adopted specifically to avoid the difficulties relating to the standing of shareholders raised by the *Barcelona Traction* decision, the Tribunal concluded:\n\n\"In the Tribunal's view, it is certainly open to Mondev to show that it has suffered loss or damage by reason of the decisions it complains of, even if loss or damage was also suffered by the enterprise itself..For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Mondev has standing to bring its claim.\".12\n\nId., pars. 82-83.\n\n36.\n\nA similar argument is made by the Argentine Republic in connection with the view expressed to the same effect by the United States in *GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican States*,13 a case that at this date has not been yet decided.\n\n*GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican States* (NAFTA/UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules Proceeding), Submission of the United States of America of June 30, 2003.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal must note, however, as also indicated in the Stamp Tax Claim Decision,14 that the greatest innovation of ICSID and other systems directed at the protection of foreign investments is precisely that the rights of the investors are not any longer subject to the political and other considerations by their governments, as was the case under the old system of diplomatic protection, often resulting in an interference with those rights. Investors may today claim independently from the view of their governments.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of January 14, 2004, par. 48.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the United States Supreme Court has recently held, in the context of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, that if direct ownership of shares is envisaged in legislation this should be understood as referring to the ownership of a majority of shares and the requirements of formal corporate structure, but when legislation refers to indirect ownership this means that minority shareholders are entitled to certain rights as well and that the formal corporate structure is no longer controlling. Referring to the expression \"direct and indirect ownership\" used in other statutes, the Court held:\n\n\"Where Congress intends to refer to ownership in other than the formal sense, it knows how to do so\".15\n\n*Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson*, U. S. Supreme Court, 123 S. Ct. 1655 (2003).\n\n39.\n\nThe definition of investment adopted in bilateral investment treaties is a clear example of protection of minority shareholders and most certainly this was not ignored by the United States Senate. This decision of the United States Supreme Court should probably have more weight for the purpose of the United States' views on indirect ownership than that expressed in arbitrations by counsel for that government.\n\nThe *Vacuum Salt* Case Distinguished\n------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has also urged this Tribunal to be consistent with what was decided in the earlier ICSID case *Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana* (\"Vacuum Salt\").16 The Tribunal has examined this case with the greatest interest in order to see whether in fact there would be anything in it suggesting the need for this Tribunal to adopt a conclusion different from that in the Stamp Tax Claim Decision.\n\n*Vacuum Salt Products Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1), Decision on Jurisdiction of February 16, 1994\n\n41.\n\nIn that case, the tribunal dealt with the interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention in connection with the meaning of \"foreign control\". This Article provides for juridical persons which have the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute to be able to qualify for ICSID jurisdiction when \".because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\". The decision held that because there was no such agreement, the Claimant was precluded from acceding to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nThe Argentine Republic believes that this is also the case here, as there has been no agreement to treat any of the Argentine companies involved as nationals of another Contracting State because of foreign control.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by these arguments for two reasons. The first one is that *Vacuum Salt* had been at all material times a corporation organized under the 1963 Companies Code of Ghana. There was no foreign investment contract nor any connection to a foreign investment law. There was only a minority Greek shareholder in that company.\n\n44.\n\nThe situation here is entirely different. There are specific foreign investors, who were invited by the Argentine Government to participate in the privatization process and required to organize locally incorporated companies to channel their investments. At all times this was a foreign investment operation.\n\n45.\n\nBut there is a second and still more powerful reason that convinces the Tribunal about the fact that *Vacuum Salt* was an entirely different case not comparable in any way to this one. There was no bilateral investment treaty and hence there was no specific definition of investment available.\n\n46.\n\nThe provision of Article 25(2)(b) allows for locally incorporated companies to claim in ICSID arbitration to the extent that there is an agreement to this effect. Such an agreement would be normally the outcome of the Treaty. This is what the tribunal explained in *CMS* when holding that:\n\n\"The reference that Article 25(2)(b) makes to foreign control in terms of treating a company of the nationality of the Contracting State party as a national of another Contracting State is precisely meant to facilitate agreement between the parties, so as not to have the corporate personality interfering with the protection of the real interests associated with the investment. The same result can be achieved by means of the provisions of the BIT, where the consent may include non-controlling or minority shareholders\".17\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, par. 51.\n\nContract Claims and Treaty Claims\n---------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nA number of questions raised by the jurisdictional objections of the Argentine Republic concern the discussion about Contract claims and Treaty claims, in so far it is argued that the forum selection clause of the License Contract and the alleged submission of claims to Argentine courts are separate and distinct from Treaty claims, which are precluded because of the lack of *ius standi* and connected arguments.\n\n48.\n\nMany tribunals have had to deal with the difference between contract-based claims and treaty-based claims, as evidenced by *Lauder*,18*Genin*,19*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (\"Aguas del Aconquija\"),20*CMS*21 and *Azurix*22 as well as the Annulment Committees in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (Annulment Proceeding)* (\"Vivendi\")23 and *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (\"Wena\").24*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

To the extent that a dispute might involve the same parties, object and cause of action27 it might be considered as a dispute where it is virtually impossible to separate the contract issues from the treaty issues and drawing from that distinction any jurisdictional conclusions.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic,* Uncitral Final Award, September 3, 2001, paras. 161, 163.\n\n50.\n\nHowever, as the Annulment Committee held in *Vivendi*, \"A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action; it requires a clear showing of conduct which is in the circumstances contrary to the relevant treaty standard\".28 The tribunal also held in *CMS*, referring to this line of decisions, that \"as contractual claims are different from treaty claims, even if there had been or there currently was a recourse to the local courts for breach of contract, this would not have prevented submission of the treaty claims to arbitration\".29\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v.

Having the Tribunal concluded that there are no reasons to change the conclusions on jurisdiction reached in the Stamp Tax Claim Decision, the distinction between contract-based claims and treaty-based claims looses to a great extent its significance in the present phase of the case.\n\nDecision\n--------\n\n52.\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.

Summary of the Proceedings\n-----------------------------\n\n*1. Procedure leading to the Decisions on Jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn February 26, 2001, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received from Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P., (the \"Claimants\") a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentine Republic\" or the \"Respondent\"). On February 27, 2001, the Centre acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C., in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\"). The Request concerned certain tax assessments allegedly imposed by some Argentinean provinces in respect to a gas transportation company in which the Claimants participated through investments in various corporate arrangements (the \"original\" or \"stamp tax claim\"). In the Request, the Claimants invoke the provisions of the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments (\"the Bilateral Investment Treaty\", \"Bilateral Treaty\" or \"Argentina-US BIT\")1.\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, signed on November 14, 1991, which entered into force on October 20, 1994.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, the Claimants filed before the Centre a new Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic, invoking the protections of the Bilateral Investment Treaty. The Request concerns the refusal of the Argentine Government to allow tariff adjustments in accordance with the United States Producer Price Index (\"PPI\") and the enactment of Law No. 25,561 which nullified PPI adjustments and the calculation of tariffs in dollars of the United States of America (the \"ancillary claim\").\n\n6.\n\nOn March 28, 2003, pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre forwarded the new Request to the Arbitral Tribunal to determine whether to receive it as an ancillary claim to the stamp tax claim. On the same date, the Tribunal requested the Argentine Republic to submit any observations that it may have in this respect. On April 15, 2003, the Argentine Republic presented its observations concerning the Claimants' new Request for Arbitration. On April 25, 2003, after having examined the observations submitted by both parties in this respect, the Tribunal decided to accept the new Request for Arbitration as a claim ancillary to the stamp tax claim in accordance with Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, and to have both cases proceed on separate tracks until the Tribunal has decided on jurisdiction with respect to both claims. In its communication, the Tribunal also proposed an expedited procedure to the parties for filing their submissions on jurisdiction in connection with the ancillary claim.\n\n*(i) The Stamp Tax Claim*\n-------------------------\n\n7.\n\nWith respect to the \"stamp tax claim\", after receiving the Claimants' Request for Arbitration, on April 5, 2001, the Centre requested the Claimants to explain how each of the two Claimants in the present case would meet the conditions for registration of the Request. On April 6, 2001, the Claimants satisfied this request from the Centre.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, on April 11, 2001, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request. On the same date, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n9.\n\nOn April 12, 2001, the Claimants submitted a proposal for the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. Under the Claimants' proposal, the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 25, 2001, the Argentine Republic notified the Centre of its agreement to the Claimants' proposal concerning the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. In those circumstances, on April 27, 2001, the Centre confirmed that the Arbitral Tribunal in the present case would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who would serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 11, 2001, the Claimants appointed Mr. Pierre-Yves Tschanz, a Swiss national. On July 10, 2001, the Argentine Republic appointed Dr. H\u00e9ctor Gros Espiell, a national of Uruguay. The parties, however, failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding, arbitrator. By letter dated August 30, 2001, the Claimants requested that the third, presiding, arbitrator be appointed pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n12.\n\nIn those circumstances, and after consulting the parties, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, a Chilean national, was appointed by the Centre as the third presiding arbitrator. Pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on November 1, 2001, the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment and the Arbitral Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with the parties was held on December 5, 2001, in Washington, D.C. During the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal was properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections to any members of the Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties also agreed on several procedural issues, which were later reproduced in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Regarding the written phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal, after consulting with the parties in this respect, fixed the following time limits for the presentation of the parties' pleadings: The Claimants would file a memorial within 90 days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial within 90 days from its receipt of the Claimants' memorial; the Claimants would file a reply within 60 days from their receipt of the Respondent's counter-memorial and the Respondent would file a rejoinder within 60 days from its receipt of the Claimants' reply. It was further agreed that if the Respondent raised any objections to jurisdiction the following alternative tentative schedule would apply: The Respondent would file a memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from the receipt of the Claimants' memorial on the merits; the Claimants would file a counter-memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from their receipt of the Respondent's memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would file a reply on jurisdiction within 30 days from its receipt of the Claimants' counter-memorial on jurisdiction, and the Claimants would file a rejoinder within 30 days from their receipt of the Respondent's reply on jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nOn January 14, 2002, the Claimants requested a suspension of the proceedings for six months in order to explore the possibility of settling the dispute through direct consultations with the authorities appointed by a new government of the Argentine Republic. By a letter dated January 30, 2002, the Argentine Republic informed the Centre that it did not consider necessary that the proceedings be suspended at this stage.\n\n16.\n\nOn January 31, 2002, the Claimants requested the suspension of the proceedings for a period of six months in order to obtain certain internal authorizations to continue with the arbitration. On February 5, 2002, the Tribunal requested the Argentine Republic to present any observations in this respect. The Argentine Republic presented its observations on February 18, 2002, agreeing to an extension of only three months. On February 25, 2002, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, granting an extension of 90 days, from the date of the Procedural Order, for the Claimants to obtain the relevant authorization to continue with the proceeding.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 22, 2002, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had been authorized to proceed with the arbitration and requested an extension until August 1, 2002 to file their memorial on the merits. On May 29, 2002, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by the Claimants. In its communication, the Tribunal noted that the Argentine Republic would, if it requested, be entitled to the same time extension granted to the Claimants to file its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n18.\n\nOn August 1, 2002, the Claimants filed their memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation. On December 13, 2002, the Argentine Republic notified the Tribunal that it would be using part of the extension granted by the Tribunal in its letter of May 29, 2002 to file its memorial on January 15, 2003. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), on January 15, 2003, the Argentine Republic filed a memorial raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn January 21, 2003, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), the proceedings on the merits were suspended by the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 5, 2003, the Claimants requested an extension of time to file their countermemorial on jurisdiction. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Argentine Republic to provide its observations to the Claimants' request. The Argentine Republic presented its observations on March 7, 2003. On March 11, 2003, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by the Claimants and informed the parties that the Argentine Republic would be granted an extension on the same terms to file its reply on jurisdiction if it so requested.\n\n21.\n\nOn March 31, 2003, the Claimants filed their counter-memorial on jurisdiction. Thereafter, on May 20, 2003, the Argentine Republic filed its reply on jurisdiction and on June 26, 2003 the Claimants filed their rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place in Paris on September 3-4, 2003. At the hearing the Claimants were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop (King & Spalding, Houston), Guido Santiago Tawil (M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires), Craig S. Miles (King & Spalding, Houston) and Ignacio Minorini Lima (M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires); all of whom addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. The Respondent was represented by Messrs. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena, Jorge Barraguirre and Ms. Beatriz Pallar\u00e9s, all from the office of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. Mr. Su\u00e1rez addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. During the hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n23.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Decision on Jurisdiction concerning the Claimants' original claim. In its Decision, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction. On this basis, the Tribunal concluded that the Centre had jurisdiction and that the Tribunal was competent to consider the dispute between the parties concerning the original claim in accordance with the provisions of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. On the same day, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2 declaring the continuation of the proceeding on the merits, regarding the original claim.\n\n24.\n\nCertified copies of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, on May 17, 2004, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n*(ii) The Discontinuance of the Stamp Tax Claim*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn May 28, 2004, the Claimants requested the suspension of the proceeding concerning the Claimants' original claim for a period of six months in order to verify if certain decisions currently before the courts in Argentina could have an effect in the Claimants' original claim. On June 1, 2004, the Tribunal requested the Argentine Republic to present its observations to Claimants' request. On June 8, 2004, the Argentine Republic presented its observations accepting to suspend the proceedings, but requested the suspension to be for a period of eighteen months. On June 10, 2004, having examined the positions of both parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 3, declaring the suspension of the stamp tax claim for a period of eight months. Thereafter the parties successively agreed and the Tribunal granted, by letters of February 25 and September 8, 2005, further suspensions of the stamp tax claim for a period of six and four months respectively.\n\n27.\n\nOn December 8, 2005, at the end of the hearing on the merits for the ancillary claim, after having heard the position of the parties, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order on Discontinuance of the Stamp Tax Claim embodying the parties' agreement on the discontinuance, without prejudice to the merits of the proceeding of the stamp tax claim.\n\n28.\n\nIn its Procedural Order on Discontinuance the Tribunal declared, among other things, that the discontinuance of the stamp tax claim shall in no way affect the disposition of the ancillary claim. The Procedural Order decides as follows:\n\n1. The proceeding of the Stamp Tax Claim is hereby discontinued without prejudice to the Parties' claims on the merits;\n\n2. Either Party shall be entitled to file the Stamp Tax Claim as a new proceeding with ICSID;\n\n3. In such new proceeding,\n\n- the Parties shall remain bound by the decision on jurisdiction rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in the Stamp Tax Claim of January 14, 2004,\n\n- the arbitral tribunal to be appointed shall have the same members as currently the Arbitral Tribunal -- or if one or more arbitrators become unavailable for any reason he shall be replaced by using the method in which he was appointed,\n\n- the memorials, evidence and other submissions already submitted in the Stamp Tax Claim shall become part of the record;\n\n4. The discontinuance of the Stamp Tax Claim shall in no way affect the disposition of the Ancillary Claim;\n\n5. The costs incurred in the Stamp Tax Claim until its discontinuance shall be borne in equal shares by the Parties.\n\n*(iii) The Ancillary Claim*\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal proposed an expedited schedule to the parties for filing their submissions on jurisdiction in connection with the ancillary claim. Based on this schedule, Argentina filed its memorial on jurisdiction on August 20, 2003, while the Claimants filed their counter-memorial on jurisdiction on October 17, 2003. On November 19, 2003, Argentina filed its reply and on December 22, 2003, the Claimants filed their rejoinder.\n\n30.\n\nSubsequently, a hearing on jurisdiction regarding the ancillary claim was held in Paris, on April 1 and 2, 2004. At the hearing the Claimants were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop and Craig S. Miles from the law firm of King & Spalding, Houston, United States, as well as by Messrs. Guido Santiago Tawil, Alix M. Mart\u00ednez and Ms. Silvia M. Marchili from the law firm of M. & M. Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Messrs. Bishop and Tawil addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. The Argentine Republic was represented by Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Ms. Ana Badillos, and Mr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s from the office of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. All of them addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic.\n\n31.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n32.\n\nOn August 2, 2004, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Decision on Jurisdiction concerning the ancillary claim rejecting the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction. In its Decision the Tribunal concluded that the Centre had jurisdiction and that the Tribunal was competent to consider the dispute between the parties regarding the ancillary claim in accordance with the provisions of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. Certified copies of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction were distributed to the parties by the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 18, 2005, after an exchange between the parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ordering the continuation of the proceeding concerning the ancillary claim. The ancillary claim constitutes the object of the present Award on the merits.\n\n*2. Procedure Leading to the Award on the Merits*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 4, on November 17, 2004 the Claimants submitted their memorial on the merits while the Respondent submitted its Countermemorial on March 7, 2005. On May 6, 2005, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the merits and on July 7, 2005, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n35.\n\nAfter consulting with both sides, the Tribunal by letter dated June 15, 2005 informed the parties that the hearing on the merits would be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. from November 28, 2005 to December 8, 2005.\n\n36.\n\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing the Claimants were represented by Messrs. Doak Bishop, Craig S. Miles, Martin Gusy and Ms. Zhennia Silverman of the law firm of King & Spalding LLP Houston, United States; Messrs. Guido Santiago Tawil, Hector M. Huici and Ms. Silvia M. Marchili of the law firm of M & M Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The Respondent was represented by Messrs. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Gustavo Scrinzi, Jorge Barraguirre, F\u00e9lix Helou, Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9z, Tom\u00e1s Braceras, Rodolfo Alberto Garc\u00eda Bollini, Rodrigo Ru\u00edz Ezquide, Fabi\u00e1n Markaida, Carlos Winograb and Mesdames Mar\u00eda Luz Moglia, Leticia Sierra Lobos and Alicia Federico, all from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n37.\n\nAs indicated by the Tribunal, on February 28, 2006 the parties filed their post-hearing briefs.\n\n38.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, the Tribunal and the parties discussed the possibility of retaining independent expert advice to better understand the underlying assumptions and methodology relied upon in the valuation reports offered by the parties' experts. After a brief exchange between the parties and the Tribunal as to the appointment of the independent expert, the Tribunal by letter dated March 16, 2006, appointed Mr. Luis Hern\u00e1n Paul, a Chilean engineer, finance consultant and professor of economics, as its expert.\n\n39.\n\nOn May 26, 2006, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Gros Espiell submitted his resignation as an arbitrator. On the same date, a vacancy on the Tribunal was announced by the Centre, and pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended. On July 10, 2006, after consulting the parties, the Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, as arbitrator in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(2)(a). On July 11, 2006, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceedings were resumed.\n\n40.\n\nOn October 30, 2006, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal an Application for Provisional Measures requesting the Tribunal to order the office of the Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina \"to cease its actions (or inactions) with respect to the ENARGAS file and exercise all deliberate dispatch to ensure the resumption of Claimants' right to consummate the CIESA swap and their right to manage, control and dispose of their CIESA/TGS shares\". Subsequently, the Claimants' request for provisional measures was slightly modified requesting the Tribunal to order \"Argentina to exercise all deliberate dispatch to ensure approval of the second stage of the CIESA swap and to refrain from taking any further act itself or through any of its agencies that aggravates the present dispute.\" After hearing the Respondent's observations in this respect, the Tribunal dismissed on December 13, 2006 the Claimants' request for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the requests made, either in its original or in its modified versions.\n\nC. Considerations\n-----------------\n\n*Argentina's Privatization Program*\n-----------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nBeginning in 1989, the Government of Argentina undertook a vast program of privatization of State-owned companies, including, among other key sectors of the economy, gas transportation and distribution. With a view to restructure the Argentine economy, the Currency Convertibility was introduced in 1991 (Law 23,928) and the Argentine peso was fixed at par with the United States dollar (Decree 2128/91). Various other measures were directed at opening the economy to foreign trade and investments, including most significantly among them the policy of negotiating bilateral investment treaties with many countries.\n\n42.\n\nNew rules governing gas transportation and distribution were introduced in 1992 by the Gas Law (Law 24,076) and the implementing regulations embodied in de Gas Decree (Decree 1738/92). Under this regulatory framework, gas transportation was separated from distribution. Two major transportation companies were created to this effect, resulting in Transportadora de Gas del Sur (\"TGS\") and Transportadora de Gas del Norte (\"TGN\"), while eight other companies were established for gas distribution. This award concerns the dispute arising from the Claimants' investment in TGS.\n\n43.\n\nIn order to facilitate the process of privatization, a Standard Gas Transportation License or \"Model Licence\" was approved by Decree 2255/92 including the applicable Basic Rules; all such rules were embodied in the License actually signed by TGS and the Government of Argentina and approved by Decree 2458/92. The duration of the License is of 35 years, leading up to 2027. An \"Information Memorandum\" concerning the privatization of Gas del Estado, the former State-owned transportation and distribution company, together with a \"Pliego\" explaining the bidding rules and the legal and contractual arrangements, were provided to prospective investors so as to organize the bidding process. The parties dispute the legal significance of these information materials. Discussions to attract investors were held with prospective foreign investors in Argentina and abroad, while the broad program of bilateral investment treaties noted was simultaneously undertaken with a view to provide guarantees to such investments.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants explain that in making the decision to invest in TGS, they relied specifically on the conditions offered by these various legislative and regulatory enactments. These conditions, the Claimants assert, included the calculation of tariffs in US dollars; their semiannual adjustment according to changes in the US Producer Price Index (\"PPI\"); the commitment that there would be no price freeze applicable to the tariff system and, if one was imposed, the licensee had a right to compensation; the commitment that the license would not be amended by the Government, in full or in part, except with the prior consent of the licensee; a 35-year license, with the possibility of a 10-year extension; and the commitment not to withdraw the license except in case of specific breaches listed.\n\n45.\n\nAll of the above, the Claimants maintain, was in turn related to the setting of gas tariffs at a level that would ensure operators with sufficient revenues to cover all reasonable costs, taxes, depreciation and a reasonable profit. In this context, the Claimants assert, the Government of Argentina made additional representations concerning the immediate and automatic adjustment of tariffs in case the parity between the dollar and the peso would experience a variation, the use of the New York exchange rate for adjustments, and the passing through to consumers of all cost variations resulting from changes in tax provisions.\n\n46.\n\nThe Government of Argentina, as will be discussed further below, has a different understanding about the meaning and extent of these various elements of the legal and regulatory framework.\n\n*Claimants' investment in TGS*\n------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants' investment in TGS has evolved over time by means of a number of complex transactions. It began in 1992 when Enron Pipeline Company Argentina S. A. (\"EPCA\"), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron, formed with three other companies a bidding consortium to submit a bid for TGS. The Consortium was awarded 70% of the shares of TGS. Ultimately, in order to comply with the requirement that an Argentine company should hold the shares in TGS, the Consortium incorporated Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Inversiones de Energ\u00eda S. A. (\"CIESA\"), which became the holder of the 70% of the shares awarded. Each of the four members of the Consortium acquired a 25% interest in CIESA, and consequently, through CIESA, an indirect 17.5% interest in TGS.\n\n48.\n\nThe purchase price for the 70% of the shares of TGS is put by the Claimants at US$561,189,000. The Consortium contributed to CIESA first US$305,000,000 (or US$76,250,000 for each member) and later the balance of US$256,189,000 (or US$64,047,250 for each member). In respect of the first contribution, the Claimants explain that Enron made a direct cash contribution of US$7,625,000 to CIESA, while the balance of US$68,625,000 was satisfied through a loan to CIESA by Chase Manhattan Bank, which Enron guaranteed. The Tribunal must note at this point that this loan became a crucial issue in the discussions on valuation that will be addressed further below. It is further explained that in respect of the second contribution, Enron contributed its total share by means of Argentine foreign and domestic debt securities2.\n\nWitness Statement of K. George Wasaff of November 12, 2004, paras. 22-31.\n\n49.\n\nEPCA in turn qualified as a member having the technical operation expertise required by the regulations. In this capacity it entered into a Technical Assistance Agreement with TGS. EPCA also contributed, it is explained by the Claimants, US$21,900,000 to CIESA in the form of a direct payment to the Chase Manhattan Bank in partial satisfaction of the loan referred to above.\n\n50.\n\nIn 1996, both Enron and one other member of the Consortium purchased an additional 25% interest in CIESA from another member, each paying US$117,500,000. Enron thus became the indirect owner of a 37.5% interest in CIESA and, through it, of a 26.25% interest in TGS.\n\n51.\n\nAlso in 1996 Enron and one other member purchased the remaining 25% of the shares of CIESA from another shareholder, for a total price of US$ 249,150,000, of which Enron paid its share by two transfers of funds. Enron thus became the indirect owner of 50% interest in CIESA and, through it, of 35% interest in TGS.\n\n52.\n\nOther transactions made in 1999 between CIESA's shareholders and their subsidiaries, and the purchase of publicly traded shares of TGS by EPCA in the amount of US$ 7,000,170, according to the Claimants, resulted in Enron becoming the indirect holder of a 27.65% interest in TGS through its 50% participation in CIESA, the indirect holder of an additional 7,593% interest in TGS through its participation in the subsidiary company EDIDESCA and the indirect holder of 0.02% in TGS through its participation in EPCA. The aggregate of Enron's interest in TGS at this stage is thus claimed to be 35,263%.\n\n53.\n\nThe evolving structure of ownership, however, does not end there. Enron's participation in TGS, while remaining the same in respect of CIESA, changed again in respect of both the subsidiaries EDIDESCA (7.62%) and EPCA (.23%), thus totaling (through Ponderosa) an indirect ownership of 35.5% interest in TGS, as explained by the Claimants.\n\n54.\n\nAdditional transactions took place in 2005 and 2006. The first of these transactions, the *Rawhide* or *Ponderosa Settlement* and the parallel *CIESA Settlement*, was executed in part on August 29, 2005 and resulted in reducing Ponderosa's interest in TGS from 35.5% to 20.7% in the Claimants' estimate, a figure which the Respondent puts at 19.5%. In view of the fact that the parties have constantly referred to a 19.5% in this proceeding, the Tribunal will use this last figure for ease of reference. This reduction involved complex arrangements under which the Claimants and related subsidiaries, by means of an exchange of shares through a trusteeship agreement, transferred their participation in CIESA to Petrobras and others of its various subsidiaries, acquiring from them a direct participation in TGS of 11.65% that together with Enron's participation of 7.85% through its subsidiaries totaled 19.5%. On January 27, 2006, the Claimants sold shares representing 15.2% of TGS to D. E. Shaw Laminar Emerging Markets LL. C. for US$114.6 million, with an option to buy the remainder of the Claimants' shares in TGS (*i.e.,* 4.3%) for US$33.9 million.\n\n55.\n\nThe Government of Argentina, while not disputing that the transactions described in the preceding paragraphs took place, considers that their true meaning is different from that explained by the Claimants. The Respondent asserts that Enron could only claim for a 19.5% indirect interest in TGS, not for 35.5%, because its investment was financed in part by the loan taken by CIESA. The fact that Enron guaranteed this loan, the Respondent maintains, does not mean that the cash flow received by CIESA from TGS would benefit Enron as it would have to be applied first to CIESA's creditors. The Respondent also argues in this respect that the 2005 transaction noted above confirms this view in so far the Claimants exchanged their nominal 35.5% indirect interest in TGS for a real 19.5% direct interest.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to other aspects of the Claimants' description of their investment, in particular the distinction between a regulated and a non-regulated sector of the business and the true value of the debt securities with which the purchase of the shares in TGS was paid in part. The Respondent also explains that the technical assistance agreement between TGS and EPCA was transferred to Petrobras in 2004, for an undisclosed amount, thus not allowing for any claims in this respect after the transfer date.\n\n57.\n\nAs a result of these various differences about the meaning of the investment, the Parties have also different views about the amounts that were actually involved, the returns obtained on the investment and the true measure of damages.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants estimate their total investment in TGS to be in the amount of US$343,954,134 and that TGS invested in Argentina's gas transportation system US$925.5 million. This, in the Claimants' view, resulted in significant improvements in the performance of the gas sector; financial gains for the Government of Argentina in terms of cash revenue from the sale of *Gas del Estado* ; transfer of indebtedness; tax revenues; and low gas prices ranking among the lowest in the world.\n\n59.\n\nThe Government of Argentina has a very different view about the amounts actually invested by Enron in the indirect purchase of TGS. In the Respondent's estimate, Enron would have paid US$84.8 million for the purchase of the original 17.5% interest in TGS and an alleged US$250.4 million for the additional 18% purchased later, resulting in a total investment of US$335.1 million for the claimed 35.5% interest.\n\n60.\n\nThis, the Respondent asserts, would have resulted in benefits to the investor of US$487 million through 2004 in dividends and fees, a residual value of US$349.1 million and a rate of return on the investment of 39.4%, all of it totaling a net result of US$500 million in favor of Enron. In other estimates the rate of return on the investment for the period 1992-2004 is put at 64.1%, and at 35.9% for Enron's total participation, with net gains of US$527 million. The Claimants dispute these estimates because in their view, if a 64% return were true, it would have resulted in a cumulative staggering figure of US$7355.10 million through 2004; it is argued that the true rate of return was not more than 8.4% with a total income received by Enron of US$390.5 million, while the real damage suffered amounts to US$278.7 million to August 2000 or US$323.4 million to December 2001. The precise figures which the Claimants have requested as damages will be discussed in the context of valuation.\n\n61.\n\nAs many of these views are inextricably related to valuation issues and the conclusions of expert reports, they will be considered further below in this other context.\n\n*The measures complained of*\n----------------------------\n\n*1. No adjustment for PPI since 1999*\n-------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThroughout the 1990s the regulatory system devised for the gas transportation sector operated without difficulties, including most significantly the periodic modification of tariffs to reflect changes in the cost of natural gas and the adjustment of tariffs, both up and down, following the variations in the US PPI. A quinquiennial tariff revision was also approved by ENARGAS, the government regulatory agency for the gas sector, for the period 1997-2002.\n\n63.\n\nIn late 1999, however, the situation began to change as the impending economic, social and political crisis evidenced its early symptoms. The political and public opinion environment was not sympathetic towards utility companies and the foreign investors therein as a consequence of tariff increases resulting from the operation of the regulatory framework, including the influence of higher natural gas prices and taxes.\n\n64.\n\nGovernment officials met with industry representatives in late 1999 and early 2000 to discuss the suspension of tariff increases. As a result, an agreement was signed on January 6, 2000, postponing for six months the PPI adjustment due on January 1, 2000 and providing that the deferred increase would be recovered with interest in the period July 1, 2000-April 30, 2001 (ENARGAS Resolution 1470/00).\n\n65.\n\nThis agreement, however, proved to be short-lived. The Government insisted a few months later that tariffs should be frozen altogether for a two-year period. As a result, a second suspension agreement intervened on July 17, 2000, suspending through June 30, 2002 PPI adjustments as from July 1, 2000 and providing that the differences would be placed in an interesting-bearing stabilization fund and tariff increases would resume at the end of the suspension period, including the recovering of the deficits originating in these arrangements (Decree 669/00).\n\n66.\n\nThe Government of Argentina expressly stated in this last decree that investments connected to the privatization process were protected by the legislation in force and, in particular, by the bilateral investment treaties signed by the Government. It should be noted that while the Government of Argentina considers the above-mentioned agreements as the outcome of genuine consent by the parties, the Claimants assert that Licensees were pressured by the Government into giving their consent.\n\n67.\n\nNot long after the second agreement, a judicial injunction was requested by the Argentine Ombudsman (\" *Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n* \") against Decree 669/00 on the argument that it was both unconstitutional and contrary to the law. The injunction was granted on August 18, 2000, suspending this decree pending a ruling on the legality of the PPI adjustment mechanism, a ruling that has not been issued thus far; the Respondent has explained, however, that the injunction would have been confirmed indirectly by the Argentine Supreme Court in 2005. The injunction was appealed by both the ENARGAS and the Ministry of Economy on the argument that it would upset the economic balance of the license and alter the system of tariffs established in US dollars and their PPI adjustment, which were the instruments chosen with \"the aim of luring investors\" in the privatization process. The appeal was rejected on October 5, 2001.\n\n68.\n\nOn the basis of this injunction, ENARGAS directed the licensees to suspend all PPI adjustments and has rejected all requests for adjustment made since. This includes the PPI adjustment under the first agreement noted. As a result, no such adjustments have been made since 1999. This is the situation that gives rise to the first claim before this Tribunal.\n\n69.\n\nThe Government of Argentina has a different view of the ultimate meaning of this process. The Respondent explains that the PPI adjustment made sense at a time when adjustments in pesos were prohibited under the Convertibility law, because of the adverse effect that indexation had on inflation, and the US price indexes were considerably lower than those of Argentina. This, however, it is further explained, changed dramatically in 1998-1999 when the Argentine economy entered into recession and deflation, with lower costs and prices, and the US inflation became considerably higher than that of Argentina, thus making the PPI an unreasonable mechanism that would only lead to tariff increases.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent also explains that a PPI adjustment of tariffs on January 1, 2000 would have meant a 3.78% increase, while that due on July 1, 2000 would have meant a 6.18% increase, including the increase postponed under the first agreement noted above. This is what, in Respondent's view, justifies the need for the agreements made with the licensees and was also the issue considered by the judge granting the injunction, together with the interests of consumers. In any event, it is asserted, the Government is only complying with a binding judicial decision even if not agreeing with its terms. The non-adjustment of tariffs for PPI increases would thus be the result of, first, the consent of the parties and, next, the order of the judiciary.\n\n*2. The Emergency Law*\n----------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe crisis referred to above continued to evolve and expand until major trouble became evident in late 2001. The Government of Argentina decided in that context to enact on January 6, 2002, Law No. 25,561 or the \"Emergency Law\", which has come to be at the heart of this and many other claims brought by foreign investors against the Argentine Republic.\n\n72.\n\nThe Emergency Law eliminated the right to calculate tariffs in U. S. dollars, converting tariffs to pesos at the fixed rate of exchange of one dollar to one peso. In addition, the Government was authorized under this Law to devalue the peso, which a few days later was fixed at a new rate of exchange of 1.40 pesos per dollar for certain transactions (mainly banking transactions) and the free market rate for all other transactions. A month later, the free market rate applied to all transactions. PPI adjustments were definitely abolished.\n\n73.\n\nThe Emergency Law also directed the Government of Argentina to begin a renegotiation process of public utility contracts affected by the measures indicated. The second quinquiennial review of gas tariffs that should have taken place in 2002 was paralyzed by ENARGAS. While the rights of licensees were expressly safeguarded under the arrangements first set up to undertake the renegotiation, gradually the Government conditioned the right to participate in this process to the abandonment of all claims (by the Licensees or their shareholders), either totally or partially according to the nature of the claim, before local courts or arbitral tribunals. Various bodies in charge of renegotiation have been set up over time and the deadlines established have been regularly extended, the last extension leading to the end of 2007.\n\n74.\n\nThe renegotiation process has succeeded in respect of a number of public utility contracts and sectors3, notably among them the gas producers, but has not made much progress in the gas transportation and distribution industry, except for one contract with a gas provider (GASBAN), signed in July 2005. Information about the later steps of presidential and congressional approval is not available in the record. It was explained at the hearing on the merits that this last renegotiation arrangement provides for a 27% tariff increase during the transition period and it is believed to consider a 120% increase thereafter4.\n\nWitness Statement of Jorge G. Simeonoff of July 5, 2005, paras. 57-66.\n\nRemarks of Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, November 28, 2005, pp. 154-157.\n\n75.\n\nExchanges of correspondence with TGS have not borne fruit in respect of a negotiated settlement and preliminary proposals made by the Government have not met the expectations of the licensee. Claimants explain that this is due in part to the fact that the tariff adjustment proposed has been well below the minimum required by the industry and in part to the fact that none of the rights existing under the license would be reestablished and that no compensation would be paid for the losses incurred thus far. In addition, Claimants are required to withdraw legal actions and make the Government whole for any adverse decision.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants also explain that in spite of the fact that the Government, recognizing the difficulties many companies are going through, has on occasion been willing to authorize small emergency adjustments, these have been systematically blocked by court injunctions. The Bill on National Public Utilities introduced by the Government in Congress in 2004 has also been the cause of concern, it is maintained, because, if approved, it would result in the final and complete abandonment of the regulatory system and conditions governing the licenses. The Claimants also argue that a trusteeship arrangement established for the expansion of the gas transportation network, although involving a tariff adjustment, does not benefit the licensees but only new investors in such scheme.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent attaches an entirely different meaning to the developments outlined above. It first explains that the crisis that erupted in full force in late 2001 has been among the most severe in the world, with dramatic consequences in social well-being and increased poverty, deep recession, deflation and unemployment, all of it leading to political events characterized by instability and institutional collapse. In this context, it is further explained, the Government had no other option than to enact the Emergency Law and abandon the convertibility regime.\n\n78.\n\nThe pesification of contracts and financial obligations that followed, the Respondent asserts, was applied to the Argentine economic system as a whole and did not target foreign investors in utility companies in particular, and even less did it adversely discriminate against them. In any event, it is also argued, the Emergency Law was expressly declared by Congress as one of public order so that no individual could invoke alleged acquired rights against its provisions, and as a consequence superseded all prior rules that were inconsistent with the new law.\n\n79.\n\nThe Government of Argentina also explains that the renegotiation process is gradually advancing and that a good number of contracts have been successfully renegotiated. It is further asserted that international claims have been one obstacle to the more expedient progress of negotiations. In any event, it is explained, UNIREN, the government agency presently in charge of the renegotiations, has made various offers to TGS and this company participates in various expansion projects, including the trusteeship arrangement mentioned above and other partial agreements to this effect, all of which result in benefits to the company.\n\n**I. Damaging effects claimed**\n-------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants sum up the damaging effects of the measures described in two major areas of the business. The first is the inability to secure international financing as a result of TGS having been unable to restructure its debt of over US$1 billion and the ensuing default on the payments due. It is explained that as a consequence TGS was rated D (default) by Standard & Poor's credit rating5.\n\nWitness Statement of Eduardo Ojea Quintana of November 16, 2004, paras. 185-216.\n\n81.\n\nThe second area the Claimants explain has suffered major damages is that concerning the revenues and the value of the company. According to the Claimants, the unavailability of PPI adjustments for 2000-2001 alone led to a loss of revenue in the amount of US$15.8 million. The emergency measures, it is also maintained, have decreased the value of the regulated business of the company in more than US$1 billion, decreasing from a value of US$1.68 billion it had in December 2001 to US$651.3 million, less than the debt associated with the regulated business and thus resulting in a total loss of the equity value. It must be noted that the Claimants make a sharp distinction between the regulated part of the business and the non-regulated part of the business, a question that will be examined further below.\n\n82.\n\nThe Government of Argentina also believes differently in this regard. It is first argued that TGS must be considered as a business as a whole, including both the regulated sector of gas transportation and the non-regulated sector of production of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), as both were subject to the privatization. The LNG Plant of *Complejo Cerri* (Bah\u00eda Blanca), as well as the midstream services provided in preparing gas for its injection in the gas transportation network and the construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipelines through subsidiaries, form an integrated whole and hence must also be computed in the value of TGS.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the revenues of the non-regulated sector alone have increased 420% in US dollars in the period 1993-2004, while its incidence in the total income of TGS has been constantly increasing. It is thus the case, it is further asserted, that TGS benefited from the devaluation, while its costs were pesified and international prices increased. Moreover, it is explained, TGS is the principal exporter of LNG in Argentina.\n\n84.\n\nA second aspect that leads the Respondent to differ from the actual damages claimed is that since the outset TGS adopted an aggressive financial policy, which by 2001 meant that 50% of the company's assets had been financed with debt. This is contrasted with the tariff calculation which assumed that 33% of assets would be debt-financed, a figure that was increased in the first quinquiennial tariff revision to 36.6%. This policy, the Respondent argues, allowed the company to distribute generous dividends and pay significant fees, which totaled US$ 1,354 million or 97% of the accumulated earnings. ENARGAS duly warned, it is also explained, about the implications of this policy and about changes in depreciation periods. The result of it was, in the Respondent's view, that the crisis impacted on TGS more significantly than would have been the case with a prudent financial policy.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent concludes in this matter that TGS has today a value 40% higher than before the emergency measured on the stock market value of its shares, or US$668.29 million. In the Respondent's estimates, TGS earned approximately US$1.2 billion on the amount invested or 325%. The Government of Argentina also asserts that the indebtedness resulting from CIESA's financial policy noted above should be taken into account.\n\n86.\n\nSome of the issues related to the discussion of damages have legal implications while all of them have valuation implications. These various aspects will also be discussed further below.\n\n**II. Legal claims and defenses**\n---------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the various measures complained of have resulted in the violation of specific commitments made to the investors and the contractual obligations the Government undertook under the License, all of it in a manner contrary to the applicable legal and regulatory framework and the specific guarantees provided under the Argentina-United States bilateral investment treaty. All such commitments and guarantees were determinative of the decision to invest in TGS, the Claimants also argue.\n\n88.\n\nThese commitments, the Claimants assert, include in particular the right to calculate the tariffs in US dollars, the semi-annual adjustment in accordance with the variation of the US PPI and the quinquiennial review of tariffs. In addition, the Claimants also maintain, the obligation not to freeze tariffs or subject them to price controls, or if done so to compensate the licensee, as well as the obligation not to alter the License without the consent of the licensee, were prominent guarantees under the License.\n\n89.\n\nAs all the measures complained of originate in actions of the Government of Argentina or attributable to it, the Claimants further state, a wrongful expropriation of the investment has ensued, both in the form of direct and of indirect or creeping expropriation. It is also claimed that fair and equitable treatment and legitimate expectations have been violated, arbitrariness and discrimination have characterized the measures adopted, and full protection and security have not been provided to the investors. It follows, in the Claimants' view, that all the guarantees provided under the Treaty have been breached.\n\n90.\n\nThe legal defense of the Respondent is principally based on the argument that the legal and regulatory framework governing the privatization provided only for the right of the licensee to a fair and reasonable tariff and that the right to the calculation of the tariffs in US dollars was a feature that could last only as long as the Convertibility Law was in force, but not if this law was abandoned at some point in time.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that if the investors relied on the information conveyed by private consulting firms, such as that contained in the Information Memorandum, this cannot be attributed to the Government which expressly disclaimed any responsibility for such information.\n\n92.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent explains, the Government has the duty to take into account the interests of the consumers in regulating a national public service such as the transportation of gas, a function which is within the ambit of discretionary Government powers.\n\n93.\n\nIn the view of the Government of Argentina, the legal and regulatory framework of Argentina has been strictly enforced in adopting the measures in question and none of it involves a breach of the Treaty. Moreover, it is also maintained, the Government's responsibility is excluded both under the Argentine legislation and jurisprudence on emergency and under the rules of international law governing the state of necessity, whether customary or contained in the bilateral investment treaty.\n\n94.\n\nThe legal claims put forth by the Claimants and the defenses opposed by the Respondent will be examined in the necessary detail in connection with each of the specific measures complained of.\n\n**III. The PPI claim**\n----------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe first claim the Tribunal needs to consider is that concerning the semi-annual adjustment of tariffs in accordance with the US PPI, a claim which originates in the measures adopted in 2000-2001, continued under the Emergency Law and kept unchanged since.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants argue in this respect that this adjustment is a right guaranteed under Article 41 of the Gas Law, which provided for the adjustment of tariffs \"in accordance with a formula based on international market indicators\", and was further confirmed by the Basic Rules, which, as explained in the Information Memorandum invoked by the Claimants, was specifically related to the US PPI. As such, the Claimants assert, it is a vested right and was so recognized under Decree 669/00 noted above in describing this adjustment as a \"legitimately acquired right\". This adjustment mechanism, the Claimants maintain, was an essential feature of the tariff system devised for the privatization, as it would prevent erosion of the US dollar value of the tariffs, and its suspension and abandonment was related to purely political reasons, thus causing a substantial loss.\n\n97.\n\nThe Government of Argentina explains that the situation was different. Article 41 of the Gas Law, it is argued, expressly related the adjustment to the change in value of goods and services of the industry. The US PPI made sense, the argument follows, at the beginning of the privatization process when the US indexes were lower than those of Argentina, but lost any meaning when the situation in Argentina was reversed and the economy went into recession, and deflation. As noted above, the Respondent explains that any US PPI indexation would have resulted in higher tariffs at a time when the economy was experiencing serious difficulties and later ended up in a major crisis.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent also argues in this connection that the purpose of the US PPI adjustment was only to reflect the evolution of changes in costs and not to ensure a given value of tariffs in US dollars. The costs considered, in the Respondent's view, unlike what the Claimants believe, include operational costs which are a part of the concept of fair and reasonable tariffs according to the Gas Law.\n\n99.\n\nIn any event, it is also maintained by the Respondent, the suspension of the adjustment was first agreed with the licensees and next ordered by the judicial injunction of August 2000, which came to be indirectly confirmed by the Argentine Supreme Court on May 24, 20056. The fact that the Government appealed the injunction on arguments which were shared by the Claimants, it is also maintained, does not mean that the Government should at present ignore the decisions of the Argentine judiciary in dismissing the appeal and later in indirectly confirming such injunction, as it is its duty under the Argentine Constitution and administrative law7.\n\nRespondent's Exhibit no. 225.\n\nLegal Opinion of Julio Rodolfo Comadira of June 2005, para. 177.\n\n100.\n\nThe parties also differ on the meaning of the ENARGAS Resolution that ordered the observance of the judicial injunction of August 2000 (Resolution 3480/00). In the Claimants' view, such Resolution went beyond the judicial suspension which only referred to the adjustments embodied in the second agreement, that is those due as from July 1, 2000, but not to what had been agreed for the first semester in the first agreement. On these bases, the Claimants requested the reconsideration of the ENARGAS Resolution, but this request was denied. The Respondent explains that the Resolution in question only informed the Licensee that the injunction should be observed and the tariffs managed accordingly.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal must first note that it is correct that Article 41 of the Gas Law, while providing for adjustment of tariffs in accordance with a formula based on international market indicators, also related this formula to the change in value of goods and services. The formula, however, was not defined under the Law. This task was left to the Basic Rules of the License, which provided in this connection that tariffs were to be adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the US PPI. This was also the information conveyed to investors by the Information Memorandum.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that such understanding was also the Government's view at the time and for almost a whole decade. This explains that Decree 669/00, dealing specifically with this mechanism, referred to the adjustment under it as a \"legitimately acquired right\", thus involving an unequivocal recognition of the existence of such a right.\n\n103.\n\nEven if the Information Memorandum was in fact prepared by private consultants and the responsibility of the Government was expressly disclaimed, if it had been in error in this respect, what is not quite likely in the case of highly prestigious consulting firms engaged by the Government to explain the privatization plan to prospective foreign investors, such error would not have passed unnoticed to competent government officials. In such case, moreover, the Government would have been under the duty to issue a clarification, as otherwise a false legitimate expectation would have been created. No such clarification was ever issued until the US PPI was first suspended and next discontinued under the Emergency Law. It is thus the conclusion of the Tribunal that the licensees had a right to the US PPI adjustment under both the regulatory framework and the License, confirmed by the context and the practice of the privatization.\n\n104.\n\nThis is not to say that the Government did not have the sovereign authority to change its mind later, as in fact it did. The rationale for this change might be perfectly reasonable in light of changing economic conditions in the country, a matter which is not for the Tribunal to judge. But even to this end, the Government had mechanisms available under the License and the regulatory framework, including the quinquiennial tariff revision. One such revision had already taken place (\"RQT I\") and one other was in preparation to govern the tariffs precisely as from 2002 (\"RQT II\"), but this was never finalized. If the Government decided to take a different route, this cannot be to the detriment of investors' rights and any ensuing damage must be compensated if legally justified.\n\n105.\n\nThe meaning of the ENARGAS Resolution adopted in connection with the judicial injunction of PPI adjustments must be understood in the context of what such injunction aimed at. While the Claimants are right in pointing out that the injunction did not refer to adjustments related to the first agreement, the fact of the matter is that the injunction in question sought to suspend the increase of tariffs in general. ENARGAS cannot be faulted for having so understood. It must be kept in mind that the undertakings of the first agreement would have also begun to materialize in the second semester of 2000, the period which the injunction was considering.\n\n**IV. The claim about the calculation of tariffs in US dollars**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. The Claimants' argument*\n----------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe central claim in this arbitration is that concerning the alleged right to calculate tariffs in US dollars. The Claimants argue in this respect that under the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the Basic Rules of the License, key tariff-related guarantees were offered to investors, paramount among which were the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, the US PPI adjustment, the commitment not to freeze tariffs or subject them to price control without compensation, and the obligation not to amend the License without the consent of the licensees.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that such guarantees were at the heart of the protection offered against currency fluctuations and an essential feature to attract foreign investors to the privatization process. The Claimants further assert that their claim is not related to an issue of devaluation, and hence also unrelated to questions arising under the Convertibility Law as the Respondent argues, but based on the breach of guarantees made available to investors so as to keep them free from the extreme fluctuations that had historically characterized the Argentine economy, including the period immediately preceding the privatization. The Claimants believe that if such guarantees were not available at the time they were needed because of renewed fluctuations, they would be entirely futile.\n\n108.\n\nIn support of their views, the Claimants invoke in particular Article 41 of the Gas Decree, which provides that \"Transportation and Distribution Tariffs shall be calculated in Dollars\" (Tribunal's English translation), just as Article 9.2 of the Basic Rules indicated that the \"tariff has been calculated in US dollars\". It would then be expressed in pesos at the time of billing. This understanding, it is further maintained, was confirmed by the minutes of a meeting of the Privatization Committee held on October 2, 1992, stating in connection with Article 9.2 of the Basic Rules that it \"makes sufficiently clear that the tariffs are in dollars and that they are expressed in convertible pesos, and, therefore, in case of an eventual amendment to the Convertibility Law, they should be automatically re-expressed at the modified parity\"; this understanding made it unnecessary to include additional rules in respect of this guarantee.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimants further invoke in confirmation of this understanding, among a number of other provisions, the wording of Annex F of the Pliego to the effect that tariffs \"shall be adjusted immediately and automatically in the event that parity varies\", indicating to this effect that the \"quantity of Argentine currency necessary to acquire a US dollar in the New York market shall be applied\".\n\n*2. The Respondent's argument*\n------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Government of Argentina holds a completely different view about the meaning of the Gas Law and related provisions on this issue. It believes first that the essential provision of the Law is that embodied in Article 2 to the effect that tariffs shall be fair and reasonable, a provision that is also reflected in Article 2 (6) of the Gas Decree in terms of the obligations which ENARGAS must ensure. The concept of a fair and reasonable tariff is associated, the Government maintains, to the objective of covering operating costs, taxes and depreciation and earning a reasonable income, all of which within the framework of an efficient operation of a satisfactory service at the minimum cost and a return similar to other activities of comparable risk.\n\n111.\n\nIn the context of such concept, the Respondent argues, the reference to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, and related PPI adjustment, could only be understood as inextricably related to the Convertibility Law. This is confirmed, the argument follows, by the very terms of Article 41 of the Gas Law when making express reference to the fact that tariffs shall be expressed in pesos convertible under Law 23,928 (the Convertibility Law) and taking into account the parity established in Article 3 of its Regulatory Decree (Decree No. 2,128/91), which was the one to one parity between the peso and the dollar. The Respondent finds further confirmation of this link to the Convertibility Law in Article 9.2 of the License, which also referred to Article 3 of the Regulatory Decree and its eventual modifications.\n\n112.\n\nIt is thus the case, the Respondent asserts, that the mechanism envisaged only the possibility of a modification of the relationship between the peso and the dollar under the Convertibility Law, but not the situation if the Convertibility Law was altogether abandoned. In the Respondent's view, the modification of the parity under the Convertibility Law is different from the abandonment of such Law. In this last scenario, the calculation of tariffs in US dollars no longer made any sense, the Respondent believes. The Respondent also explains that this was the understanding of the Privatization Committee, which recorded in its minutes of July 17, 1992 that the parity should be adjusted in accordance with the New York market and that \"the adjustment proposed does not consider the current exchange rate as the basis, but the currency board exchange rate\", concluding that \"as long as Argentina does not abandon the currency board system, no tariff adjustment will be required\".\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent also reads the minutes of the Privatization Committee of October 2, 1992 referred to above, as expressly conditioning the adjustment of tariffs in case of modification of the parity to the Convertibility Law. The Respondent argues that this is so particularly because when the Committee concluded that the License offered sufficient coverage in this respect, a proposal that would have provided for adjustment in case of abandonment of the convertibility was rejected. The Respondent further maintains that the Gas Decree makes no mention at all of the possibility of abandonment of the Convertibility Law.\n\n114.\n\nAlthough Annex F of the Pliego, noted above, seems to convey a broader concept of tariff adjustment in case of modification of the parity, the Respondent points out that this Annex was held to be merely descriptive, just as the Information Memorandum, on which Claimants also rely, is a non-binding document that was not prepared by the Government, and any responsibility thereunder was expressly disclaimed. It is also explained that in any event the Memorandum was prepared before the regulatory framework was enacted.\n\n*3. Discussion of historical experience*\n----------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe views of the parties also differ significantly in respect of this specific claim in light of arguments concerning the historical experience of the privatization of ENTEL, the national telecommunications company. This privatization, the Respondent asserts, confirms that calculation of tariffs in US dollars was inextricably related to the Convertibility Law.\n\n116.\n\nENTEL was privatized under the Law on the Reform of the State, but before the Convertibility Law was enacted; originally tariffs were set in \"Australes\", the Argentine currency at the time, and adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index of Argentina (IPC). The Respondent explains that because the Convertibility Law froze tariffs and adjustments in pesos, the parties agreed to express tariffs in US dollars and to adjust them on the basis of the US PPI variations, but this, unlike the case of TGS, was done without specific reference to the Convertibility Law. The Respondent concludes in this respect that this evolving framework evidences that there was no exchange rate assurance given and that, consequently, the devaluation risk was not eliminated or shifted to the Government, as argued by the Claimants, and that the Respondent received no compensation for any such currency risk.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants reach an entirely different conclusion on this historical experience. It is first explained that the tariffs of ENTEL, even before any changes were made, included a US dollar component to temper devaluation effects that was automatically triggered if certain ratios were met, just as international services were set in Gold Francs. It is next maintained that the changes introduced after the Convertibility Law was enacted were made precisely to ensure that no adverse effects would ensue for the investors and to provide incentives for new investments.\n\n118.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the tariffs calculated in US dollars were to be billed in pesos at the exchange rate applicable at the time of billing, confirms in the Claimants' view that the system is not related to the Convertibility Law, as they also argue in the case of TGS. It is also explained, lastly, that underwriting arrangements made with banks and the placement of remaining shares in the New York and Buenos Aires markets, resulted in additional benefits to the Government that would not have been possible had the risk of currency fluctuation not been eliminated under the tariff system.\n\n*4. The discussion about country risk*\n--------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe parties disagree also about another regulatory issue, namely whether tariffs were higher because they included a premium for the risk that convertibility might be abandoned at some point in the future. This the Respondent equates with country risk or default risk, and argues that if the licensees were guaranteed that US dollar tariffs would be converted to pesos at the prevailing exchange rate, they would be obtaining a double benefit as the tariffs already were set higher to offset this risk.\n\n120.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the original tariffs were established taking into consideration debt bonds of the Argentine Republic (Bonex 1989), which resulted in a higher cost of debt of 9.50%. RQT I also considered a 6.17% country risk and RQT II had envisaged a figure of 7.40% to this effect, all of it leading to additional return over the invested capital. On the basis of these arguments, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants cannot pretend to charge higher tariffs for a risk, and later, if the risk materialized, argue that such risk should not be born by them.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that such an argument is wrong because country risk only relates to the default on sovereign debt, which is conceptually different from the risk concerning \"pesification\" and the freezing of tariffs. The latter was, in the Claimants' view, allocated to the Government through the License and the tariff system envisaged, for which it was rather the investors who paid more for shares benefiting from this guarantee.\n\n*5. Discussion about an incomplete regulatory framework*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nStill one other regulatory issue divides the opinion of the parties in connection with the meaning of the tariff system. In the Respondent's view, because the regulatory framework was incomplete and did not foresee what should be done in case the Convertibility Law was abandoned, it falls upon the Government to adapt the licenses to the new situation. This was done, it is explained, by means of the pesification of the whole economy, the dollarization of export-related tariffs and the renegotiation of contracts and licenses.\n\n123.\n\nThis, the Respondent maintains, is the duty of the Government in respect of a public utility service, and such regulatory powers are exercised in a discretionary manner as it is accepted in economic theory and judicial decisions in both Argentina and other countries, particularly if the need for adaptation results from a major economic crisis. In the Respondent's opinion, the exercise of this regulatory power in such a context cannot be considered equivalent to a unilateral derogation or amendment of the tariff regime, as argued by the Claimants.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the regulatory framework might be considered incomplete because all the assurances given were specifically related to the possibility that the Convertibility Law might be abandoned in the future. The only meaning of the Emergency Law in this context, it is maintained, was to unilaterally change the tariff system and related aspects. Moreover, the Claimants argue, none of the mechanisms provided under the License to undertake a tariff revision were used.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the Argentine legislation itself provides all the necessary guarantees in terms of fundamental safeguards of acquired rights and legitimate expectations. Even the regulatory powers recognized to governments in cases of changed circumstances, it is also argued, are limited and subject to specific conditions, and do not reach into questions of compensation and financial advantages, least of all alter the economic balance of the contract. The Claimants also assert that it was precisely in order to provide for a clear limit to these powers that the Government included in the License the guarantee that it could only be amended with the consent of the parties and that it could not be terminated except in very specific situations. The discussion of the pertinent legal arguments will be addressed by the Tribunal further below.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimants also contest the Respondent's views about the meaning of the Emergency Law in this context as they believe it was adopted following political motivation in a climate of hostility towards investors and that the renegotiation process that followed has not been conducive to any solution for TGS, as discussed above. Issues relating to export contracts and the question of the non-regulated business of TGS will be discussed separately.\n\n*6. The Tribunal's findings on the US dollar calculation of tariffs*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal is grateful to counsel for the parties for the detailed arguments with which they have assisted the Tribunal in the examination of this claim. The Tribunal finds the Claimants' arguments about the existence of a right to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars persuasive.\n\n128.\n\nThis conclusion is based first on the examination of the legal and regulatory framework. If the Gas Decree and the Basic Rules of the License unequivocally refer to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, and such feature was also explained in the same terms by the Information Memorandum, there cannot be any doubt about the fact that this is the central feature governing the tariff regime.\n\n129.\n\nGiven the emphasis that this regulatory framework placed on the stability of the tariff structure, it is not surprising that the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, as the PPI adjustment, were assigned a significant role therein. Whether devaluation could at some time intervene was not ignored, but hardly addressed in view of the fact that stability was the principal aim and, as will be explained, the problem would be corrected by means of the automatic adjustment of tariffs to the new level of exchange rate.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent has devoted particular attention to the link that in its view these clauses have with the Convertibility Law. It is maintained in this respect that if tariffs were set in US dollars independently from the Convertibility Law this would have resulted in an unreasonable, unfair and unconstitutional legal regime8, unsustainable in Argentine courts as it would be in the courts of the United States in light of the regulatory experience of that country. Sophisticated investors and their lawyers, it is also asserted, could not have relied solely on the information conveyed by unofficial documents, such as the Information Memorandum or Annex F of the Pliego, and if they did their claims should be now held inadmissible.\n\n*Id.*, paras. 97, 106.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on a witness statement to the effect that if tariffs had been set in dollars independently from the Convertibility Law, the risk of devaluation would have been placed on the consumers, which were the less prepared to face such a risk9.\n\nWitness Statement of Cristian Folgar of March 5, 2005, para. 45.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants have also invoked in favor of their argument decisions of the Argentine Supreme Court holding that if for political or other reasons the Government decides to maintain tariffs lower than the cost and a reasonable profit, compensation should be granted, as otherwise the assets of the company or its profits would be destroyed10. Claimants have also distinguished the *Maruba* case11, invoked by the Respondent to show that there was no entitlement to the original tariff but only to a reasonable rate of return, arguing that in such case the tariff system was different, was not established by contract and there were no provisions for its amendment.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Tranv\u00edas Anglo Argentina v. Naci\u00f3n Argentina*, p. 569, as cited in Claimants' Reply, no. 186.\n\n*Maruba Empresa de Navegaci\u00f3n Mar\u00edtima v. Ministerio de Obras y Servicios P\u00fablicos*, Fallos 321:1784 of June 30, 1998, submitted as Respondent's Legal Authority no. 31.\n\n133.\n\nIt is true that the Gas Decree provides that tariffs calculated in US dollars shall be expressed in pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law and that reference is made to the need to take into account the parity established under Decree 2128/91, which regulated the convertibility regime.\n\n134.\n\nThe meaning of these provisions, however, can also be read differently. Convertibility, as the Claimants have argued, is different from the question of a given parity or exchange rate, as convertibility simply relates to the right to buy a certain foreign currency with local currency. It is the exchange rate that will determine how much local currency you will need to buy a unit of the foreign one. Because the Convertibility regime was aiming at the stabilization of the economy following a period of galloping inflation and continued devaluation of the currency, the Government of Argentina chose to do the two things at the same time. It first confirmed the right to the convertibility of the currency, which has remained unaffected. Simultaneously it pegged the peso to the US dollar at the one to one parity, while also prohibiting indexation in pesos. This fixed parity is the one no longer available following devaluation and the adoption of a floating rate system.\n\n135.\n\nThis difference is reflected in the regulatory framework with which the Tribunal is concerned. The Gas Decree indeed made a link to the first aspect in referring to pesos convertible under the Convertibility Law, but the reference to a given parity established under the Convertibility Decree was more qualified. In fact, Clause 9.2 of the License did take into account that the parity and the ratio could be amended in the future, as it expressly refers to the eventual modifications of Convertibility Decree 2128/91. Further references of the Pliego to the New York market exchange rate must be understood in the same context.\n\n136.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion the Tribunal is also mindful of the economic context in which convertibility and the ensuing privatization were introduced. Precisely because these measures were preceded by a long period of economic turmoil, investors would not be attracted to participate in the privatization process unless specific assurances were provided in respect of the stability of their arrangements. These were the specific guarantees envisaged in the calculation of tariffs in US dollars, the conversion in pesos of the calculated amounts at the time of billing at the prevailing exchange rate and its US PPI adjustment, together with other stabilization mechanisms of contractual arrangements.\n\n137.\n\nThe distinction made by the Respondent between the modification of the convertibility regime and its abandonment is not persuasive. Guarantees and stability are meant precisely to operate when problems arise, not when business continues as usual. The tariff regime approved was devised as a permanent feature of the privatization, not a transitory one, and if it was intended to be transitory it should have also been clearly advised to prospective investors, but again nothing of the sort was done. The regulatory and contractual arrangements were thus not incomplete, as argued, and if such were the case it would certainly not have passed unnoticed to competent officials, businessmen and counsel and advisors.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that the discussion of the matter in the Privatization Committee was on occasions confusing. The Respondent, as noted, has invoked in favor of its argument the minutes of the Privatization Committee meeting of July 17, 1992, where few weeks after the enactment of the Gas Decree reference was made to adjustment of tariffs, not at the actual exchange rate, but at the convertibility rate, and that unless convertibility was abandoned there should be no adjustments on this basis. The minutes further added a reference to the adjustment of parity in the New York market and to an understanding of the Committee to the effect that if convertibility was abandoned licensees should be assured of adjustment according to a realistic exchange rate.\n\n139.\n\nWhile these minutes could be read as allowing for adjustment under the convertibility regime and not if it were abandoned, a different reading is also justified. In fact, the Committee was discussing two different kinds of adjustment. It was first discussing the thought of an automatic adjustment in accordance with the variation of cost structure expressed in pesos, but this was ruled out as it meant an indexation forbidden under the Convertibility Law. It is in relation to this cost adjustment that reference was made to the convertibility exchange rate and to the view that no adjustments on these bases should take place unless convertibility was abandoned and, if this was the case, a realistic exchange rate should then be found for the adjustment.\n\n140.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee was discussing an adjustment related to the parity and its eventual modifications, which was the one that finally the regulatory framework and the License included in its terms. This is the kind of adjustment that would follow the New York market exchange rate and was expressly referred to as the \"adjustment for parity\". This was what the Committee later addressed in the minutes of October 2, 1992, invoked by the Claimants in support of their own view, where the Committee decided to reject a proposal to the effect of expressly referring to the abandonment of the convertibility regime on the ground that Clause 9.2 of the License embodied a sufficient guarantee in connection with the adjustment at the modified exchange rate.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal also wishes to consider on this point the witness statement of Mr. Patricio Carlos Perkins, who was a key official in the privatization process and the author of the initiative that the Committee addressed on October 2, 1992. In referring to the approach followed by the Government officials at the time, Mr. Perkins explains:\n\n\"Although there was consensus in applying US Dollar-based tariff rates, the manner by which such criteria would be expressed in the official documents was a matter of some discussion.  \n Government officials decided that expressing tariff rates in Convertible Pesos according to the Convertibility Act and its Regulatory Decrees was sufficiently clear and that it was not prudent to state in the official documents that Argentina could eventually abandon convertibility in the future. This was the criterion argued by Government representatives on the Committee. I wanted it stated clearly in the section of the license where the tariff rates, service terms and conditions were addressed that the tariff rates were established in US Dollars and invoiced in local currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the billing date.  \n After much discussion, it was decided that the license would state that tariff rates have to be calculated in US Dollars and that invoicing would be made in Convertible Pesos [...]  \n Therefore, in order to attract many well-qualified bidders, the licensees were protected from this risk. It was established in item 7.1 of Annex F to the Pliegos, that in case of an eventual variation in the parity of the local currency to the US Dollar, tariff rates would be \"immediately and automatically\" adjusted.\"12\n\nWitness Statement of Patricio Carlos Perkins of December 11, 2004, paras. 294-297.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal would have wished that Mr. Perkins had been examined and cross-examined on this and other aspects of his testimony, and also to put questions to him, but his participation in the hearing on the merits was regrettably prevented by an injunction issued by an Argentine judge on November 24, 2005 at the request of the Government. The Tribunal makes no inference of this situation, but decided in Procedural Order No. 5, dated December 2, 2005, that the witness' written statement was admissible and that, moreover, Mr. Perkins enjoyed and continues to enjoy the immunities provided under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention. Quite different was the situation concerning the witness Mr. Roberto Kozulj, who after giving a written statement did not appear at the hearing providing the Tribunal with a rather vague and unsatisfactory explanation; as the witness could not be cross-examined, the Tribunal has not considered his testimony13.\n\nRemarks of R. Doak Bishop, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, November 28, 2005, pp. 9-10.\n\n143.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal on this matter does not mean that it ignores economic reality and the crisis which has affected Argentina in the recent past. It is perfectly possible that economic conditions can change, as they dramatically did, and this can have a profound effect on the economic balance of contracts and licenses. In this context, the Respondent's argument that the Gas Law was principally concerned with a fair and reasonable tariff is not misconceived. To this effect, particularly if tariffs ceased to be fair and reasonable, the regulatory framework provided for specific adjustment mechanisms, tariff reviews on periodic basis and even the possibility of an extraordinary review. The issue then is not whether contracts should remain frozen forever, but whether they can be adjusted to such changing realities in an orderly manner as provided under the regulatory framework and the contract itself, including the negotiated modification of the license, or whether this will be done by unilateral action of the Government.\n\n144.\n\nThe real problem underlying the claims is that the unilateral action by the Government became the predominant feature of the process of adjustment. Broad as the regulatory authority of States and governments might be at present, it can only be exercised within the confines of the law and duly taking into account the rights of individuals. It will be seen further below that the Argentine legislation and the decisions of courts in that country have carefully set out the limits of government regulatory power in light of a long experience of economic crisis and emergency intervention.\n\n145.\n\nIn support of its view that the calculation of tariffs in US dollars is inextricably linked to the Convertibility Law, the Respondent also invokes arguments concerning the historical experience surrounding the privatization of ENTEL. The conclusions the Tribunal draws from that experience are not quite the same as those of the Respondent.\n\n146.\n\nIt is first an undisputed fact that because the Convertibility Law froze indexation in pesos and adopted other currency stabilization measures, the terms of the original privatization of ENTEL were no longer viable and had to be adapted to the new economic policy. All the changes introduced were done in agreement with the licensee, which is thus an entirely different situation from the present one. The ultimate meaning of this agreement was, as argued by the Claimants, to avoid adverse economic consequences for the licensees arising from the changed regulatory measures, which is also a proposition different from the instant case.\n\n147.\n\nWithout prejudice to the Claimants' argument that the original tariff structure included a US dollar component and other stable value references, the fact that the new agreement provided for US dollar-calculated tariffs without reference to the Convertibility Law, far from proving that those tariffs later were inseparable from that law, such as the Respondent alleges was the case of the gas tariffs, it rather proves the contrary. If tariffs were calculated in US dollars and converted into pesos without reference to the Convertibility Law in the case of ENTEL, it can well be read as a confirmation of the conclusion that the reference to the Convertibility Law in later arrangements was not a guarantee conditioned on a given parity. On the other hand, the fact that ENTEL's tariff was not related to the Convertibility Law did not spare this company from the consequences of the Emergency Law and related measures.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded either by the argument concerning the premium for a country risk. That such a premium was considered in the tariff structure and RQT I is not disputed. The issue is whether this premium and the guarantee of tariff adjustment in case of a changed parity with the US dollar are compatible or they should be considered as a kind of \"double dipping\" by the Claimants.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes in this respect that country risk or default risk is related exclusively to the risk of default of a given country on its foreign debt and as such it relates to the question of the financial structure of the investment, making borrowing more costly and being compensated by means of the additional premium. The currency devaluation is a different kind of risk and responds to a different rationale, as it concerns the level of income and revenues of the company as reflected in the tariff system and its eventual adjustments. While these risks may in some way interact, for example country risk increasing as a result of currency instability, they operate independently from each other and are subject to different safeguards.\n\n150.\n\nIn the end, there are two rather simple and practical considerations which the Tribunal must also keep in mind. If a premium was provided for the country risk and this risk was the same as the devaluation risk, why allow for an additional adjustment mechanism under the regulatory framework? The second consideration is still more elementary. If the meaning of the tariff structure was not to allow for adjustment in case the original parity would be abandoned, why then bother to establish a mechanism in US dollars when peso-denominated tariffs would have accomplished the same result? The only logical answer is that if the risks considered were the same, none of these additional mechanisms of protection would have been necessary.\n\n*Claim concerning the breach of stability clauses of the License*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants have also argued that the measures adopted by the Respondent resulted in other breaches of the License concerning some basic guarantees about the stability of this instrument. This claim refers in particular to Clause 9.8, which prohibits the freezing, administration or control of prices, and if because of controls prices would be lower that the level resulting from the tariff, the licensee shall be entitled to compensation for the difference. The claim also refers in particular to Clause 18.2 of the License, in the terms of which the Licensor shall not amend the Basic Rules of the License, in whole or in part, without the written consent of the Licensee.\n\n152.\n\nTwo aspects must, however, be clarified at the outset. The first is a jurisdictional argument which the Respondent has reiterated in the pleadings on the merits to the effect that the investors are not the licensees and, therefore, cannot invoke the terms of a contract to which they are not parties. The Tribunal has dealt with this question in its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n153.\n\nThe second issue is a novel one. The Respondent has argued that as the prohibition of Clause 18.2 refers to the License not being modified by the Licensor, and the Licensor is the Executive Branch of Government, any measures or effects arising from congressional action, such as the Emergency Law, or from judicial decisions, such as the US PPI injunction, are not adopted by the Licensor and hence not envisaged in the prohibition of unilateral modification14.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, p. 10\n\n154.\n\nIngenuous as this argument might be it is no more than a play of words because the Executive Branch binds the State in guaranteeing certain rights to foreign investors. Furthermore, quite evidently any State action, governmental, legislative or judicial, must respect the rights acquired under a contract. If contract rights were at the mercy of other branches of the State the rule of law, under both domestic and international law, would be seriously in jeopardy, a view which is not quite likely to be accepted in an arbitration which, at least in part, is governed by international law.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that Clause 18.2 of the License, in prohibiting the modification of the License makes special reference to the fact that even if an authorized modification under the Service and Tariff Regulations results in a favorable or unfavorable alteration of the economic and financial balance existing before the modification, the Licensee will have the right to request the pertinent adjustment of the tariff. It is that economic balance what the whole tariff regime purported to ensure.\n\n*Regulatory economic and financial defenses*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIn addition to the specific arguments made by the Respondent in respect of each of the claims explained above, it has also raised a number of important questions touching on economic and financial aspects that are closely related to the regulatory framework governing the investment. These defenses will be examined next, without prejudice to what will be discussed as pertinent in connection with valuation issues further below.\n\n*The question of leverage policy*\n---------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that TGS has obtained an annual return of 33% over its investment and that its stock market value in Buenos Aires and New York is 40% higher in dollars than the value it had before the crisis, thus resulting in a situation that, far from meaning a drop of 78% in the value of the company, as claimed, has actually meant that the value has considerably increased.\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent, as explained above, also maintains that the leverage policy followed by the company has had a negative impact on its equity value, which would otherwise be higher, and this is not something for which the Government is to be held liable, as the risk for having taken a large debt in foreign currency belongs to the Claimants. TGS, the Respondent believes, could have taken other more prudent options, such as debt in pesos or even in dollars in the local market, which were later pesified at a one-to-one parity, or could have diversified the risk of devaluation. This was not done, in the Respondent's view, in order to obtain higher dividends and benefit from tax advantages, an approach which was also allegedly followed by CIESA; time depreciation of assets would also have been modified in order to increase profits.\n\n159.\n\nIn this regard the Respondent argues that the tariff system envisaged under the Gas Law was geared to satisfy reasonable costs of operation, taxes, amortization and a reasonable return, but did not include financial costs, and required in addition an efficient service at the minimum cost for consumers.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the decisions of the Argentine courts have been at one in considering, in light of earlier devaluations, that the risk entailed in foreign currency obligations is a market business risk that cannot be transferred to the State. The Respondent also recalls in this respect that in accordance with Clause 2.4 of the Basic Rules the Government does not guarantee or ensures the return on the operation of the business, and that more generally neither TGS nor the Claimants can exclude themselves from the effects of the crisis.\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants oppose this defense on the basis that the leverage policy adopted was reasonable in light of the long-term optimal capital structure of the industry as a whole, and that it was not too different from the estimates used in RQT I and proposed for RQT II. The first envisaged a debt to capital ratio of 36.7% while TGS was at a ratio of 40.8%. The second considered 46% compared to 49.8%, respectively. It is also explained that the question of time depreciation followed the rules issued by ENARGAS, except at a point when this entity delayed the enactment of such rules.\n\n162.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants explain that the leverage of CIESA is irrelevant in this arbitration because they are claiming for their own losses and not for those of CIESA, and that, in any event, the dividend distribution policy was reasonable as it ranged between 15% and 35% of annual revenues, an approach that was never questioned by the Government when it was a shareholder of TGS.\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants do not believe that there were relevant options to taking debt in foreign currency abroad, particularly since the Argentine financial markets did not have sufficient funds available, which was the very reason why the Government itself had to resort to foreign financial markets for its needs. Lastly, the Claimants assert that the value of TGS's shares is not representative of the value of the company, in part because the shares are extremely illiquid and its traded volumes are not significant, a question that will again be examined in connection with valuation.\n\n164.\n\nThe first question the Tribunal must address is whether the tariff included financial costs as part of their structure. There can be no doubt that this was the case. It must be recalled that Article 38(a) of the Gas Law specifically relates the income obtained to the sufficient recovery of, among other elements, depreciation (or \" *amortizaci\u00f3n* \"), just as Article 2(4) of the Gas Decree still more specifically provides for the recovery of all costs, \"including the cost of capital\". The Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that also the very elements of RQT I and the proposed RQT II did envisage the question of leverage in calculating the tariff, just as the original tariff structure did.\n\n165.\n\nWhether the leverage was reasonable is not something the Tribunal is called to decide on. While ENARGAS did discuss this matter with the licensees, no claim was made that the policy followed might be contrary to the regulatory framework or the License. This was essentially a company decision and the fact that tariff calculation was to be made in US dollars and adjusted in accordance with the US PPI did provide for a reasonable assurance allowing for the option of taking debt in dollars in the international financial markets. The Tribunal is also persuaded by the argument that sufficient financing was not available in Argentina for such a large operation, which aimed precisely at attracting foreign investments in the country.\n\n166.\n\nIf the claim before the Tribunal dealt with the question of devaluation, the Respondent's argument to the effect that devaluation falls within the sovereign prerogative of the State would be entirely appropriate. But this is not a claim about the devaluation and so has been expressly disavowed by the Claimants. It is a claim concerning the breach of the various aspects of the tariff system that have been explained above and the rights the investors have in that respect in light of the legal, regulatory and contractual commitments made.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal must also conclude that the view of the Respondent to the effect that CIESA could not claim for the interest the investors had in TGS, if these were separately compensated, is correct, and if such eventual compensations were to be accumulated they would result in a \"double-dipping\" or double recovery. To the extent that the investors are compensated for their interest, that is the end of the matter in respect of such interest as far as the Respondent is concerned. This issue is also related to the discussion of what is precisely the interest the Claimants held in TGS, which will be addressed further below.\n\nA. The question of export contracts\n-----------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nA second defense the Respondent raises is that TGS is a major exporter of gas in Argentina, and that Decree 689/02 expressly excluded from the pesification transportation and other contracts related to exports. It follows, in the Respondent's view, that the impact of devaluation on the company is much smaller than claimed as the tariffs in this area have been kept in US dollars and the US PPI continues to apply, with the result that such tariffs have increased by 15.89% since 2002 and returns have increased. This, the Respondent maintains, is a further confirmation that TGS, far from being affected by the abandonment of Convertibility, has benefited from it.\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimants oppose to such a defense the argument that, first, TGS's export-related revenue is insignificant as it amounts only to 1% of the total revenue of the company and, next, that the decision to exclude this activity from pesification was not taken to benefit the company but to ensure a greater flow of foreign currency into the country. It is also pointed out that ENARGAS, in rejecting a request by a foreign shipper to the effect that the PPI should not apply to export contracts, invoked arguments which are coincident with those of the Claimants, namely that transportation costs have increased as a consequence of devaluation and that investments cannot be recovered with frozen and pesified tariffs.\n\n170.\n\nThe meaning of the parties' arguments on this matter is not quite clear. The Respondent appears at some point to identify the export gas transportation business with the export of LNG, but at the same time Decree 689/02 applies to a broader range of export-related activities. On the other hand, it is not clear either whether the Claimants are addressing in this context also the revenue originating in the non-regulated sector of their business.\n\n171.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal must note that the Respondent's arguments about the meaning of the emergency are not quite consistent with Decree 689/02. By its very terms, this Decree provided that export-related tariffs would be adjusted in the manner established in the respective licenses, which is to say calculated in US dollars and adjusted by the US PPI. Thereby the Decree appears to confirm that such mechanisms did in fact survive as rights under the license in spite of the fact that the Convertibility Law had come to an end. On the other hand, if the Decree, as it is also argued, aimed at reestablishing a right which allegedly had been abrogated by the Emergency Law, it then appears to take up a certain legislative role. In any event, the Decree is certainly taking up a judicial role because it orders this reestablishment of rights as from August 2000 in spite of the fact that the judge did not so order under the injunction.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal does accept the Respondent's view that the revenue originating in the export side of the business does contribute to mitigate the eventual damages arising from the measures discussed, and to that extent it should be reflected in the valuation of the company. But this is true only in respect of the regulated side of the business. To the extent that this revenue relates to the non-regulated sector it is then inseparable from the discussion about whether non-regulated business should be included in the overall valuation of the company, as argued by the Respondent, or kept entirely apart, as argued by the Claimants. The Tribunal will turn to this issue next.\n\nB. Regulated and non-regulated business activities\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent has also raised in its defense that if the claim for compensation refers to the Claimants' interest in TGS, such interest relates to the company as a whole, including all of its business, regulated or non-regulated, and that shares representing that interest cannot be separated into different portions. This argument is in turn linked to the Respondent's view that the appropriate method of valuation is the value of shares in the stock market, among other reasons because when an investor purchases a share in a company it is considering the value of that share in connection with the business in its entirety.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent asserts in this matter that the shares transferred by the Government to TGS referred both to regulated activities, such as transportation, and to non-regulated activities, most notably the production of LNG in the plant of *General Cerri*. This decision was based, it is maintained, on the fact that technically one activity is inseparable from the other in light of both operational and geographical considerations15, as this was expressly recognized by the Privatization Committee when discussing the proposal that the plant of *General Cerri* should be integrated into the southern transportation business unit (\" *unidad de negocios de transporte del Sur* \") and concluding that this recommendation was the most appropriate because of the \"operational consequences of the geographical location of the plant of General Cerri\"16. According to the Respondent's experts, it appears that such an integrated approach to the regulated and non-regulated sides of the business was also present in the debt restructuring of TGS17, having also been explained that \"the debt of the regulated and unregulated businesses are not separable\"18.\n\nWitness Statement of Charles Joseph Massano, March 2, 2005, paras. 14-21; Testimony of Charles Joseph Massano, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 4, December 1, 2005, pp. 633-637.\n\nMinutes of the Privatization Committee Meetings of October 8 and 9, 1991, Respondent's Exhibit no. 32.\n\nExpert Report of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, Casar\u00edn, and Sarria Allende (\"GSCSA Expert Report\") of June 2005, paras. 19, 170.\n\nExpert statement of Javier Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, December 3, 2005, pp. 915-916.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants believe differently. In their view, there are no physical or operational reasons why the plant in question should be included in TGS's assets and in fact neither the Privatization Committee nor TGS considered this possibility. The accounts of the non-regulated sector, it is further explained, are kept separately from those of the regulated sector, as required by the applicable rules. In any event, it is also argued, in spite of the fact that the non-regulated sector benefited from the devaluation and its revenue has increased, the financial profile of TGS was significantly damaged by the measures adopted by the Government.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal realizes that there are two different approaches to this question. Looked at from the point of view of the value of equity as expressed in shares, the Respondent's argument has merit. In fact, shares are not divisible and represent an interest in a company as a whole. Their stock market transactions are priced considering this whole, for better or worse. If stock market valuation is chosen as the appropriate method to determine the value of the company and eventual compensation for losses, the integration of regulated and non-regulated activities is the natural consequence.\n\n177.\n\nThere is, however, another approach. The only purpose of the claims brought to the Tribunal is to obtain compensation for losses allegedly suffered as a consequence of government measures. These measures refer only to a sector of activity which is subject to regulation. It follows that if regulated tariffs were the source of the complaint, it is only the consequence of the measures in respect of such tariffs that should be compensated. Conversely, it is quite evident that if the non-regulated sector had been affected by government measures, a claim to the effect that tariffs of the regulated activity should be increased to compensate for that loss would not be admissible. Valuation methodologies do exist so as to measure the damage on an individual sector of the business.\n\n178.\n\nWhich of the two approaches is more convincing is the question the Tribunal must now address. Admittedly, the privatization process and the License were not quite clear in providing a precise answer to this question. On the one hand, the Privatization Committee did refer, as noted by the Respondent, to a business unit. The License, while defining the licensed service as that concerning gas pipeline transportation (Clause 1.1), appears to narrow its scope to the regulated sector, but in fact the privatization undertaken included both sectors of activity simultaneously.\n\n179.\n\nThe intention of what was done is where the answer must then be found. The Tribunal is persuaded by two arguments the Claimants have made. As noted, TGS was instructed under the applicable rules to keep the accounts of the two sectors completely separate from each other. This was so decided so that the non-regulated sector would not end-up in any way affecting the transportation regulated sector. Annex XXVII of the Share Transfer Agreement stated that \"The Licensee shall carry out the operation of General Cerri Plant keeping separate accounting records so that the results of said Plant operation and the respective costs do not affect the rendering of the transportation service. For this purpose, said Plant shall be organized as a branch, or a controlled company\"19.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, p. 23, no. 101.\n\n180.\n\nThis very intention was confirmed, the Claimants also explain, by ENARGAS Resolution 1660/2000. In instructing for separate accounting, this entity stated that this measure resulted from \"the principle that cost distribution between activities and related companies should not amount to subsidies to non-regulated activities, thus avoiding users from being subject to higher tariffs -in benefit of other activities- than those that should pertain to the service provided\"20.\n\n*Id.*, p. 24, no. 102.\n\n181.\n\nAt the time, the Government was evidently thinking that the success of the regulated tariff system should not subsidize the non-regulated business and thus avoid that consumers pay tariffs higher than those relating strictly to transportation. Avoidance of crosssubsidization is the right economic principle applied by many companies that have various sectors of activity within their overall business. This is the same principle that applies the other way round. The success of the non-regulated business should not subsidize the losses of the regulated business and this is to be the criteria also guiding the eventual determination of compensation. The Tribunal thus concludes that the regulated and the non-regulated sectors of TGS are to be kept separate and independent for the purpose of this claim.\n\nC. The influence of renegotiation\n---------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above the parties' views about the meaning of renegotiations currently before the UNIREN. The Respondent believes that following the emergency, renegotiation is in fact the only viable alternative and much progress has been made in a variety of sectors, including the gas transportation sector in terms of an agreed understanding with GASBAN S. A., while some other gas companies are also very advanced in the process of reaching an agreement.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts that in this context it is reasonable for the Government to require the discontinuance of arbitration claims as these are interfering with the progress of negotiations, particularly in the case of companies which have sold their interest in the licensed companies, as the Claimants in this arbitration have.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants do not share this optimistic view as they assert that no progress has been made in many years and that, in any event, the understandings reached are still subject to some further form of legislative and executive approval, which has not been forthcoming. The Claimants also explain that this question is in abeyance from another point of view, namely that the understandings reached only provide for a provisional adjustment of tariffs while the long-term tariff structure has not even been discussed.\n\n185.\n\nThe main points of disagreement, in the Claimants' view, continue to be the limited adjustment, the uncertainty about the long-term tariff and the question of discontinuance of arbitration claims, which they regard as simply another form of pressure in breach of the investors' rights under the Treaty. Particularly troublesome, in the Claimants' argument, is the understanding that with or without renegotiation there does not appear to be any intention of compensating for past losses, as confirmed by Mr. Simeonoff, head of UNIREN, at the oral hearing when stating that \"I understand that there is not going to be any compensation\" for the freezing of tariffs and the elimination of PPI adjustments21.\n\n*Id.*, p. 8, with reference to Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, November 30, 2005, p. 493.\n\n186.\n\nWhatever the virtues or shortfalls of the renegotiation process, the Tribunal is not called to pass judgment on any of its aspects as this depends exclusively on whether the parties agree or not on new contractual terms of the license. Any process of negotiation requires of course that the parties genuinely agree on the outcome and this cannot be imposed or forced upon one party. There are, moreover, two aspects originating in this discussion that are indeed the concern of the Tribunal. The Tribunal must first hold that the Claimants positively have a right to resort to arbitration under the Treaty and this cannot be curtailed by the terms of the renegotiation or in any other manner, except with the consent of the Claimants.\n\n187.\n\nTo the extent that this discussion also implies that there are measures arising from the emergency likely to extend beyond the temporary character that an emergency has by definition, the Tribunal must also consider this situation. This is so because temporary or permanent effects of a given measure have a different incidence on the legal consequences arising from such measures, a matter that will be discussed separately below.\n\nD. The Trust Fund\n-----------------\n\n188.\n\nAs evidence that normalization is progressing, the Respondent explains that a Trust Fund was established in 2004 to facilitate new investments in the gas transportation and distribution with a view to the expansion and extension of the network. It is also explained that TGS accepted to participate in this Trust and has benefited from it in terms that licensees make their services available to a greater number of consumers and their sales and revenues increase.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants oppose this other defense on the ground that far from proving normalization the Trust Fund proves rather the opposite, that is that the licensee's tariff system has been dismantled and a new approach has been introduced in its place. The Claimants assert that under this new approach only new investors benefit from tariff increases related to the expansion and licensees are left in a situation which makes still more difficult the recovery of costs connected to investments under the license, with an evident result of adverse discrimination.\n\n190.\n\nTo the extent that TGS has consented to this Trust Fund and its operation, the Tribunal considers that the question cannot be a matter of complaint before it. Whatever the meaning and extent of the Trust Fund, it does not raise a question concerning the tariff system under the License. At the most it provides indirect and limited evidence about the organization of the industry after the emergency.\n\nE. The Claimants' interest in TGS\n---------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal has explained above the discussion the parties have had in respect of the interest the Claimants really held in TGS. In the Respondent's view, this interest is only 19.5%, and in the Claimants' view it is 35.5%. The discussion is related to the fact that Enron financed part of its investment with a loan taken by CIESA in its own name, guaranteed by Enron.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the transactions made by the Claimants in 2005 resulted in the exchange of an indirect 35.5% holding in TGS for a direct 19.5% holding, while shortly thereafter, in 2006, they sold most of their holdings to another investor, which has a right to a further purchase of the balance, thus effectively withdrawing from both CIESA and TGS.\n\n193.\n\nA distinction is made by the Respondent to this effect between the corporate rights of Enron in TGS, which the Respondent admits amount in fact to 35.5%, and the right to dividends that TGS distributes, which amount only to 19.5%. The latter right, it is argued, is the consequence of CIESA having taken a loan for financing part of Enron's investment, and thus having to apply such dividends first to payments to the lenders and then to Enron in proportion to their financial contributions. Mr. Fabi\u00e1n Bello, expert for the Respondent, explains this distinction in the following terms:\n\n\"Enron holds 35.5 percent corporate rights in TGS, but it has no right from the economic viewpoint (...) to receive 35.5 of the dividends distributed by TGS [...] when CIESA receives the dividends, it has to first pay the interest of the debt and then distribute the dividends\"22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 111, with reference to the testimony of Fabi\u00e1n Bello, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 5, December 2, 2005, p. 877.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent and its experts maintain that claiming compensation for 35.5% assumes that the Claimants are taking charge of CIESA's debt on their behalf, which is not the case, thus resulting in depleting CIESA and impeding that creditors collect their debt23.\n\nExpert statement of Fabi\u00e1n Bello, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 5, December 2, 2005, p. 856; Expert statement of Javier Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 6, December 3, 2005, p. 904, pp. 982-983.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants have explained that these transactions do not have any influence or consequence in respect of the damages claimed, an aspect that will be examined in the context of valuation. A witness for the Claimants also explains that during \"my ten-year tenure with CIESA at each of the Board meetings and also in each of the statements we had to report, we had to present to the regulatory agency on the company's shareholders, the participation was based on the 35 percent participation...\"24.\n\nTestimony of Eduardo Ojea Quintana, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 2, November 29, 2005, p. 325.\n\n196.\n\nThere are, however, some legal issues in this regard that the Tribunal must consider now The first is a jurisdictional question that the Respondent has suggested in correspondence with the Tribunal, to the effect that the 2006 transaction would have decisive implications in this arbitration, presumably because the Claimants would no longer have any interest in CIESA or TGS.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants assert that this is not the case in light of ICSID Tribunal's jurisprudence, where it has been held that the Claimants' jurisdictional standing \"is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted\"25 and that \"Events that take place before that date may affect jurisdiction; events that take place after that date do not\"26.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 35-37, with reference to *Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of May 24, 1999, 14 *ICSID Rev.-FILJ* 251 (1999), para. 31.\n\n*Id.*, with reference to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of November 14, 2005, paras. 60-62.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that this last view is indeed correct and that jurisdiction is not altered by later transactions. It should also be noted that the 2006 transaction expressly safeguarded the Claimants' rights in this litigation (Share Purchase Agreement, Schedule B). A different question arises in respect of the agreements themselves, as these will not necessarily be within the Tribunal's jurisdiction to the extent that they might refer to different matters or involve different parties.\n\n199.\n\nA separate issue arises from the Claimants' assertion that damages are not affected either by the 2005 or 2006 transactions as damages are measured as from the date of expropriation, at which time the Claimants owned a 35.5% interest in TGS27.\n\nClaimants' letter to Secretary of the Tribunal of September 1, 2005; Claimants' letter to Secretary of the Tribunal of February 2, 2006.\n\n200.\n\nWhile the principle that damages are specifically related under the Treaty to the date prior to the events giving rise to the claim is correct, this is not to mean that events taking place after that date are not relevant for a determination of compensation, as happens for example when a given transaction is made to minimize damages. This too will be considered by the Tribunal in the context of valuation.\n\n201.\n\nA third issue concerns the situation of CIESA's debt on behalf of the Claimants. If the Claimants eventually obtain compensation for the whole of the 35.5% interest they claim to have in TGS, either they should take over the debt or otherwise make CIESA whole, either directly or through some other transaction. The Tribunal can assume that CIESA and its shareholders will make sure that the interest of the company is not affected by the transactions made, as it is already evident in the 2005 swap noted above.\n\n202.\n\nIf such interest was in any way affected, CIESA might have a claim against the Claimants, but not against the Respondent. On the other hand, if the Respondent reaches a negotiated agreement with TGS it will also make sure that its terms will take into account any compensation that might have been paid for an interest in the company; thus it cannot be assumed here either that double payment will occur. The specific influence of these considerations in the valuation of the claim will be discussed further below.\n\n*(a) The applicable law*\n------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe parties have also disagreed about the law applicable to this dispute. The Claimants hold the view that under Article 42(1) of the Convention, in the absence of agreement between the parties, the law of Argentina applies in this case, just as international law does in light of the second sentence of that Article. The Claimants assert, however, that domestic law is relevant primarily to factual matters only, such as the nature of the assurances made to the Claimants. In the Claimants' view, it is the Treaty that principally applies as *lex specialis* between the parties, while other rules of international law not inconsistent with the Treaty also have a role, including the rules on the interpretation of treaties and customary rules that provide for a minimum treatment of covered investments.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent believes that Article 42 has a different meaning as to the role of the various sources of law it enumerates. In its view, domestic law is not confined to factual matters but has a substantive role in defining the rights of the investor, particularly when property rights are involved in the dispute; these rights are not defined by international law but by the local law to which the investor has voluntarily submitted. More importantly, the Respondent also asserts, when the parties have agreed on a forum-selection clause giving jurisdiction to a domestic court, this choice cannot be ignored later by an international tribunal. It is further explained that this approach does not exclude the application of either the Treaty, in defining for example which investors are covered under its provisions, or general international law, which provides for rules on the treatment of investments.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that on this matter the discussion of the parties is largely theoretical. Article 42(1) of the Convention has provided for a variety of sources, none of which excludes a certain role for another. This is particularly evident in the case of complex disputes such as that presently before the Tribunal. As the issue of the choice of forum was discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, it shall not be considered again here. What matters now is the law applicable to the merits of the dispute.\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent is right in arguing that domestic law is not confined to the determination of factual questions. It has indeed a broader role, as it is evident in this very case from the pleadings and arguments of the parties that have relied heavily on the Gas Law and generally the regulatory framework of the gas industry, just as they have relied on many other rules of the Argentine legal system, including the Constitution, the Civil Code, specialized legislation and the decisions of courts. The License itself is governed by the legal order of the Argentine Republic and it must be interpreted in its light28.\n\nLicense, Clause 16.1.\n\n207.\n\nSo too, the Claimants are right in arguing about the prominent role of international law. Both the Treaty and international conventions have been invoked by the parties, as they have also discussed the meaning of customary international law in a number of matters. While on occasions writers and decisions have tended to consider the application of domestic law or international law as a kind of dichotomy, this is far from being the case. In fact, both have a complementary role to perform and this has begun to be recognized29.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), *Ad Hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment of February 5, 2002, 41 *ILM* 933 (2002), para. 941.\n\n208.\n\nIt must be noted also that the very legal system of the Argentine Republic, like many modern systems, provides for a prominent role of treaties under both Articles 27 and 31 of the Constitution. Treaties are constitutionally recognized among the sources considered \"the supreme law of the Nation\". It follows that in case of conflict between a treaty rule and an inconsistent rule of domestic law, the former will prevail. This is not just the consequence of the Constitution so providing, but also the solution dictated by Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in that a State \"may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty\". Consistent with this role of international law, regulatory instruments have also made specific reference to the protection of investments under the Treaty (Decree 669/00).\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note that in examining the Argentine law as pertinent to various issues disputed by the parties, it finds that there is generally no inconsistency with international law as far as the basic principles governing the matter are concerned. The Tribunal will accordingly apply both Argentine law and international law to the extent pertinent and relevant to the decision of the various claims submitted.\n\n**V. The stability of contracts and the License under Argentine law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded above that various rights the Claimants have under the license are no longer observed in light of the measures complained of. It is now necessary to examine the Argentine law governing contracts in order to determine whether liability exists under the domestic legal order.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent has raised again the objection that such rights, to the extent they exist, belong to TGS as the licensee and not to the Claimants. As noted, this question has already been decided in the decision on jurisdiction and it shall not be discussed again here. The Respondent adds on this point an argument on the merits concerning an issue of potential double recovery. In its view, if the Tribunal grants compensation to the Claimants and then the license is reconstituted in some way compensating TGS, consumers will end up paying twice in terms of increased tariffs.\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent contends that this is contrary to the principle held in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case30, as the parties would not be put in the same position they would be in had the contract been observed. The Tribunal cannot provide an answer to a question which is in essence speculative. However, as noted above in respect of another argument concerning double recovery, it can only express the certainty that if the situation arises or its consequences would end up affecting the tariffs, able government negotiators or regulators would make sure that no such double recovery or effects occur.\n\n*Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland* *) (* *Chorz\u00f3w Case*), Permanent Court of International Justice Proceeding, as referenced in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, no. 34.\n\n213.\n\nArticle 17 of the Argentine Constitution enshrines the basic principle that \"property may not be violated and that no inhabitant of the Nation can be deprived of it except by virtue of a sentence based on law\". The Constitution also provides in Article 28 that \"the principles, guarantees, and rights recognized in the preceding articles shall not be modified by the laws that regulate their enforcement\". Consistent with these provisions, Article 1197 of the Civil Code mandates that contractual rules must be observed as the law between the parties. Stability of rights and contracts is thus a central feature of the applicable domestic law.\n\n214.\n\nThis is not to say that contractual obligations must be kept unchanged forever irrespective of the circumstances. Article 1198 of the Civil Code addresses the case of extraordinary and unforeseeable events that could allow a party to the contract to request its termination for having become excessively onerous, thus recognizing the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" and seeking the rebalancing of the contractual benefits. *Force majeure* and unjust enrichment are also mechanisms that would allow for renegotiation and rebalancing of contractual obligations.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent's legal expert, Professor Julio Rodolfo Comadira, regrettably deceased before the hearing on the merits, explained that in his view, the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" applied in the context of this dispute as this theory relates mainly to administrative contracts and the events characterizing the greatest economic crisis in history could not have been foreseen31. The Respondent relies by reference on these legal arguments32.\n\nLegal Opinion of Julio Rodolfo Comadira of June 2005, para. 131.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 608.\n\n216.\n\nThe parties discussed at various points whether the events underlying the claims had or not been foreseeable in light of the various meanings they tend to assign to insuring against country risk and whether it includes or not the devaluation risk and the risk concerning the freeze of tariffs, as they have discussed about who bears what risk. The Respondent is right in stating that to consider a risk is not the same as foreseeing that the events in question will necessarily take place. However, if the major features of the whole regulatory regime put in place under the privatization were based on taking cover against all kind of risks inspired by the economic history of the country and the instability of the 1980s, including country risk and devaluation, it is in itself indicating that the parties were quite aware of the dangers ahead. It would then make no sense if when the dangers materialized, as they did, the protection envisaged would not operate.\n\n217.\n\nThis question aside, however, it must be kept in mind that, at least as the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\" is expressed in the concept of *force majeure*, this other concept requires, under Article 23 of the Articles on State Responsibility, that the situation should in addition be the occurrence of an irresistible force, beyond the control of the State, making it materially impossible in the circumstances to perform the obligation. In the commentary to this article it is stated that \" *Force majeure* does not include circumstances in which performance of an obligation has become more difficult, for example due to some political or economic crisis\"33.\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries*, p. 171, (ed., Cambridge University Press) (2002).\n\n218.\n\nImportant as this discussion is, the Respondent's principal argument has not relied on the theory of \"imprevisi\u00f3n\", but state of emergency. The courts of Argentina have on various occasions addressed recurring situations of emergency declared by Congress, conditioning their legal recognition to very precise terms34. The Supreme Court has held in connection with the Emergency Law presently in force that\n\n\"...it is not useless to remind, as the Tribunal has done for long, that restrictions imposed by the State on the normal exercise of patrimonial rights must be reasonable, limited in time, and constitute a remedy and not a mutation in the substance or essence of the right acquired by judicial decision or contract...\"35.\n\nRub\u00e9n S. Stiglitz: *Contratos Civiles y Comerciales* (1998), paras. 28-30.\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, Judgment in the case *Provincia de San Luis c. P. E. N. -Ley 25561, Dto. 1570/01 y* *214/02 s/ amparo*, March 5, 2003. (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants have introduced an expert opinion of Dr. Alberto R. Bianchi which together with that of Professor Comadira offers a most learned, albeit differing, discussion of the state of Argentine law on the question of regulatory powers. In Dr. Bianchi's view, although \"the emergency authorizes the use of extraordinary powers, it does not allow the exercise of unlimited powers. Police power in this case is limited in three senses: (i) it cannot result in a change in the substance or essence of a right acquired under a judgment or contract; (ii) measures are subject to a reasonability judicial review; and (iii) measures are temporary in essence\"36.\n\nLegal Opinion of Alberto B. Bianchi of October 11, 2005, para. 386.\n\n220.\n\nIt is against this background that the Tribunal must examine the effects of the emergency measures enacted in 2002 on the obligations and commitments defined in the License. The License of course is not an ordinary contract since it involves the operation of a public service under the regulatory authority of the State, but even in this context the licensees enjoy specific rights which are subject to protection under the Constitution, the law and the provisions of the contract. As noted above, however strong the regulatory powers of the State might be they are still governed by the law and the obligation to protect the rights acquired by individuals.\n\n*First requirement: temporality*\n--------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal can well understand the need to adopt emergency measures in the midst of the major crisis that has been noted. Yet this is not enough to validate these measures in light of the applicable law. A first question that must be examined in this respect is whether the measures adopted are temporal or permanent, a matter on which the parties' views also differ. The Respondent has repeatedly emphasized the temporal nature of the emergency measures and the fact that the Emergency Law expires on precise dates, which have been extended, it is argued, so as to ensure the orderly settlement of complex outstanding problems. The fact is, however, that year after year the expiry date has been extended and presently the Emergency Law is scheduled to end on December 31, 2007. This is the situation that gives rise to the Claimants' argument that the Emergency Law has in reality been turned into a permanent feature of the Argentine economy.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this is a rather disquieting situation because in actual fact the crisis is largely over, although quite naturally aftershocks might still be felt for some time. An expert witness for the Claimants believes the crisis began to improve in 2003 at the time when the Central Bank was able to convince the public to buy its newly-issued financial instruments37. Another ICSID tribunal has set this date some time by the end of 2004 or beginning of 200538. In any event, the fact that the Argentine economy has grown 35.5% in the period 2003-2006, with an average growth of 8.8%, and that the Government has prepaid its obligations to the International Monetary Fund, are evidence enough that the crisis is behind39. The argument about the temporary character of the emergency measures would thus seem not to be quite confirmed by the facts.\n\nExpert statement of Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 7, December 6, 2005, pp. 1234-1235.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005, 44 *ILM* 1205 (2005).\n\nEconomic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, *Statistics Yearbook of Latin America and the Caribbean 2006*, Economic Statistics, Table 2.1.1.1.\n\n*Second requirement: no essential mutation of rights*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nA second requirement the courts have set for the legal validity of the emergency measures is that the restrictions imposed must provide a remedy and not result in the mutation of the substance or essence of the rights acquired under a contract. A witness for the Respondent advanced a view that appears not to be consistent with this other requirement, namely that a good part of the emergency provisions, especially those on conversion to pesos and elimination of dollar clauses \"were taken not on a transitory basis. They were adopted on a definitive basis\"40. Such effects would mean in fact the permanent elimination of the rights under the License, at least in so far as the calculation of tariffs in US dollars and their PPI adjustment are concerned. Licensees might of course accept the terms of a new tariff regime in the context of a renegotiated contract; in such a case, the mutation would be validated by the agreement of the parties.\n\nWitness Testimony of Eduardo Ratti, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 3, November 30, 2005, p. 555.\n\n*Third requirement: reasonableness*\n-----------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nA third requirement the courts have indicated is that restrictions imposed under the emergency must be reasonable. The discussion on the tariff regime outlined above reveals profound disagreement between the parties about what is to be regarded as a just and reasonable tariff. While for the Claimants a tariff frozen for nearly five years and kept unadjusted for seven years cannot in any way be considered reasonable, for the Respondent this was the only measure possible in the context of crisis and deflation and is thus eminently reasonable. Costs, leverage, devaluation, returns and other issues examined are characterized by this same difference of opinions.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal can only note in this respect that both the Government and the licensees of public services have repeatedly indicated that there is an inescapable need to attend to tariff adjustments and thereby ensure the continued operation of the companies and the necessary supply of energy and other services. The very emphasis the Respondent has put on the question of renegotiation is further evidence of this recognition. It follows that the prolongation of emergency measures without reestablishing or rebalancing the benefits of the License cannot be regarded as satisfying the legal requirement of reasonableness.\n\n*Unilateral determinations and consented adjustment*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThere is still one other aspect that does not help the Respondent's argument about the consistency of the emergency measures with the domestic legal order. If changes became necessary, they cannot be unilaterally decided by the Government or its regulators, competent as they may be. This is a decision that has either to be taken jointly by the parties, as in a successful renegotiation, or requested from a judge, as in Article 1198 of the Civil Code. In any event, even in the case of the regulatory authority entailed in a license, this decision is subject to judicial control.\n\n227.\n\nIt so happens that the domestic judicial control of the emergency decisions has for the most turned out adversely for the Respondent's justification, as in *Provincia de San Luis* noted above, but as judicial determinations are made on a case by case basis they have not been taken to mean that the measures as a whole might not be compatible with Argentine legislation.\n\n228.\n\nIt must also be noted that the licenses have carefully provided for a detailed adjustment mechanism so that tariffs would be revised periodically in order to take into account the true conditions of the industry, thus evidencing that the question of an eventual rebalancing of benefits was not ignored. The semi-annual adjustment under the PPI, an efficiency-related adjustment following the first quinquennial review, and an investment-related adjustment also applicable after the first five-year review, were some of the mechanisms envisaged to reflect the changes in the value of goods and services for the operator. The five-year review was another such mechanism. In addition, the possibility of an extraordinary review to correct tariffs considered inadequate, discriminatory or preferential was also included in the license terms; this review could be initiated either by ENARGAS or the licensees.\n\n229.\n\nAll such mechanisms could have resulted in an increase of tariffs or equally in a reduction. The interests of consumers could have been attended to and protected under these mechanisms, particularly if the tariffs became unrealistic and excessive in the context of a changed economic environment. Such changes would also have met the obligation under the License not to amend it without the agreement of the licensees as the latter had already given their consent by agreeing on the license terms. Yet, the Government chose not to use the alternatives provided under the license and resorted instead to the unilateral determination made under the emergency measures.\n\n230.\n\nEven assuming that the implementation of any such mechanism would have taken some time and that the Government needed to react quickly in confronting an emergency situation, which is a perfectly understandable concern, such measures could have been taken for a limited time span while reviews were carried out. It is this unilateral determination, not the license corrections required, that ultimately resulted in the inconsistency of the measures taken with the domestic legal order.\n\n*Liability under Argentine law*\n-------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion for the Tribunal to reach is that in considering the claims purely from the point of view of the Argentine legislation as one of the laws applicable to the dispute, the obligations which the Argentine Republic had and the commitments it undertook under the License were not observed. This is particularly significant in view that the License is expressly subject to Argentine law in some key respects, without prejudice to the effect that these legal arrangements have under the Treaty and international law. Liability is thus the consequence of such breach and there is no legal excuse under the Argentine legislation which could justify the non-compliance, as the very conditions set out by this legislation and the decisions of courts have not been met.\n\n232.\n\nYet, the Tribunal bears in mind that a major crisis indeed there was. While these unfortunate events do not in themselves amount to a legal excuse, neither would it be reasonable for the Claimants to believe they are not affected by some of the effects. The economic balance of the license was clearly affected by the crisis situation, and just as it is not reasonable for the licensees to bear the entire burden of such changed reality neither would it be reasonable for them to believe that nothing happened in Argentina since the License was approved. This is something the Tribunal will duly take into account in considering the compensation that follows such finding of liability and how the crisis period influences its determination.\n\n*The Treaty as the applicable law*\n----------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal must now examine the question of whether the breach of the License and its regulatory regime, in addition to its assessment under Argentine legislation, amounts to a breach of the Treaty guarantees.\n\n*1. The claim of expropriation*\n-------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe principal claim made in this arbitration is that the measures adopted since early 2000, and particularly those following in 2002 under the Emergency Law, have expropriated the Claimants' investments, both directly and indirectly, in a manner contrary to the protection granted under Article IV of the Treaty. The Claimants argue that their investment comprises the equity in TGS, the capital contributed to this effect, the rights under the Technical Assistance Agreement and the specific rights related to the tariff regime of the License. The deprivation, the Claimants maintain, has been permanent, not merely ephemeral, and no prompt, adequate and effective compensation has been paid. In the Claimants' view, compensation must be paid irrespective of the purpose of the measures41.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of February 17, 2000, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/santaelena award.pdf, paras. 71-72.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent has directly expropriated the rights to tariff adjustment and calculation they have under the License, as well as the right to be free from a tariff freeze, as all of it was expressly derogated by the Emergency Law. A transfer of revenues is also alleged to have taken place as a result. The Claimants also invoke in support of their argument on expropriation an OPIC \"Memorandum of Determinations\" of August 2, 2005, which concludes that expropriation in violation of international law has taken place with regard to this investment.\n\n236.\n\nSimultaneously, the Claimants maintain, the measures in question are \"tantamount to expropriation\", thus constituting an indirect or creeping expropriation unfolding in time and resulting in a cumulative substantial destruction of the value of the investment. This kind of measures includes various forms of regulatory action unreasonably interfering with the investor's property rights, the Claimants explain, just as the measures involve conduct inconsistent with legitimate expectation and with the assurances offered to induce the investment or the capacity for rational decision-making in the business.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent argues at the outset that the same measures complained of cannot give rise simultaneously to a claim of direct and indirect expropriation and that the wrong justification of the claim must lead to its rejection42. It is also argued as a preliminary point that in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction only equity participation was held to be an investment qualifying for protection, not other kinds of peripheral rights that the Claimants now untimely invoke in their argument on the merits43.\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Award of September 16, 2003, 44 *ILM* 404 (2005), paras. 20, 22.\n\nRemarks of Jorge Alberto Barraguirre, Hearing Transcript, Vol. 1, November 28, 2005, pp. 121-124.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the claim arguing that there has been no transfer of property rights to the benefit of the Government or the consumers and without redistribution there is no expropriation44; in these circumstances, if compensation for expropriation were paid there would be unjust enrichment of the service providers. The Respondent also asserts that temporary measures, particularly emergency measures, do not qualify as expropriation as they do not entail permanent deprivation of earnings or corporate rights and no such effects can be shown in the present dispute; that substantial deprivation of fundamental property rights must be established and that no such deprivation has taken place or been proven in this case; that losses must be significant, while the Claimants continue to benefit from earnings or the sale of shares; that the value of the investment would have been further reduced had the measures not been adopted; and that a mere contract violation cannot be turned into a Treaty claim.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding, Final Award of September 3, 2001, available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/LauderAward.pdf, para. 203.\n\n239.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the purpose of the measures is relevant to make a determination on an expropriation claim, particularly if such measures are adopted under the police power of the State and are proportional to the requirements of public interest. Moreover, the Respondent maintains, the Treaty does not protect legitimate expectations but only specific rights and in this case none of the measures questioned can be equated to those considered in other cases as being inconsistent with the guarantees offered to induce the investor or amounts to the destruction of the capacity for rational decision-making.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal is again grateful to counsel for the parties for having undertaken a thorough explanation of their views on the issue of expropriation, invoking in support of their respective views a wealth of decisions, opinions of writers and other authorities that allow understanding the parties' arguments in all their meaning and differences.\n\n241.\n\nThe first question the Tribunal must address is that of the protected investment. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal in the jurisdictional stage held that the dispute was one related to investment in equity and that nothing else can now be considered in the merits This, however, has to be understood in the context of a determination about whether minority shareholders had a right to claim independently, as the Respondent itself recalls. In that context, the issue was whether an investment in equity so allows. The Tribunal must also recall that the reference paragraph 30 of the Decision on Jurisdiction made to a definition of investment is related to the very broad definition of the Treaty as reproduced in paragraph 29 of that Decision. Accordingly that broad definition is the one governing this discussion.\n\n242.\n\nThe equity investment was the vehicle through which a complex business relationship was developed and which can be affected in other of its elements by the measures questioned. This is the case, for example, of the measures affecting the tariff regime envisaged in the License, which is the key factor determining the success or failure of the investment in the equity of TGS.\n\n243.\n\nThis discussion, in any event, turns out to be rather academic as the Tribunal is persuaded by the merit of the Respondent's argument on direct expropriation. In fact, the Tribunal does not believe there can be a direct form of expropriation if at least some essential component of property rights has not been transferred to a different beneficiary, in particular the State. In this case it can be argued that economic benefits might have been transferred to an extent from industry to consumer or from industry to another industrial sector, but this does not amount to affecting a legal element of the property held, such as the title to property.\n\n244.\n\nThe question of indirect or creeping expropriation is more complex to assess. The Tribunal has no doubt about the fact that indirect or creeping expropriation can arise from many kinds of measures and these have to be assessed in their cumulative effects. Yet, in this case, the Tribunal is not convinced that this has happened.\n\n245.\n\nThe list of measures considered in the *Pope & Talbot* case as tantamount to expropriation, which the Respondent has invoked among other authorities, is in the Tribunal's view representative of the legal standard required to make a finding of indirect expropriation. Substantial deprivation results in that light from depriving the investor of the control of the investment, managing the day-to-day operations of the company, arrest and detention of company officials or employees, supervision of the work of officials, interfering in the administration, impeding the distribution of dividends, interfering in the appointment of officials and managers, or depriving the company of its property or control in total or in part45.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada*, NAFTA (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Proceeding, Interim Award of June 26, 2000, para. 100.\n\n246.\n\nNothing of the sort has happened in the case of TGS or CIESA or any of the related companies, so much so that the Claimants' interests in these companies have been freely sold and included in complex transactions, some involving foreign companies too, as evidenced by the 2005 and 2006 agreements already described. The Tribunal must accordingly conclude that the Government of Argentina in adopting the measures complained of has not breached the standard of protection established in Article IV(1) of the Treaty.\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal must also point out that although the OPIC \"Memorandum of Determinations\" referred to above reaches a different conclusion on this matter, it responds to a different kind of procedure and context that cannot influence or be taken into account in this arbitration.\n\n248.\n\nThe question of devaluation has also been discussed by the parties in the context of its influence on a finding of expropriation, particularly in light of the meaning each attaches to the *Himpurna* case.46 However, as the Tribunal has explained above, this is not a dispute about devaluation, nor has so been claimed, but about allegedly breached rights under a regulatory framework and the License. This discussion thus does not alter the Tribunal's determination about expropriation.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd. v. Republic of Indonesia*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion does not mean that the measures discussed are free from legal consequences under other Treaty standards, as will be seen below, or free from liability for compensation arising from the damage they may have caused.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent's argument about the inappropriateness of claiming simultaneously a direct and an indirect expropriation, as the Claimants have done, is also persuasive. In fact, if a given measure qualifies as a form of direct expropriation it cannot at the same time qualify as an indirect expropriation, as their nature and extent are different. The converse is also true. This is not to conclude, like in *Generation Ukraine*, that the claim has to be rejected because the measures complained of were not described with precision and coherently, as here they have been competently substantiated.\n\n*2. The claim concerning the standard of fair and equitable treatment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that in addition to expropriation the Respondent has breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment established under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty on various counts: failing to act in good faith, abusing its rights, repudiating assurances given, altering regulatory approvals and conditions, and failure to provide a stable and predictable legal environment.\n\n252.\n\nOriginating in the obligation of good faith under international law, the Claimants explain, this particular standard has gradually acquired a specific meaning in light of decisions and treaties, including a treatment compatible with expectations of foreign investors,47 the observance of arrangements on which the investor has relied to make the investment48and the maintenance of a stable legal and business framework.49\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, 43 *ILM* 133 (2004), para. 115.\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding, Partial Award of September 13, 2001, available at http://www.mvestmentclaims.com/decisions/CME-Czech-PartialAward-13Sept2001.pdf, para. 611.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC) v.

The Respondent asserts that this view is confirmed by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission50 and the Chile-US Free Trade Agreement, in clarifying that fair and equitable treatment does not entail any treatment additional to or beyond that required by customary law,51 as well as by a number of NAFTA and ICSID decisions and the opinions of learned writers.\n\nFTC decision, NAFTA Free Trade Commission, Interpretation of NAFTA Article 1105(1), July 21, 2001, available at http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/NAFTA-Interpr-en.asp.\n\nChile-United States Free Trade Agreement of June 6, 2003, available at http://www.ustr.gov/assets/Trade Agreements/Bilateral/Chile FTA/Final Texts/asset upload file1 4004.pdf, Article 10.4.2.\n\n254.\n\nIn the Respondent's view what has been criticized by recent decisions is a kind of conduct that evidences inconsistency in State action,52 radical and arbitrary modification of the regulatory framework53 or endless normative changes to the detriment of the investor's business.54 None of that, the argument follows, is present in the instant case where the measures adopted were eminently reasonable in light of the economic crisis described and the changes in the economic conditions of the country.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, available at http://www.asil.org/ilib/MTDvChile.pdf, para. 164.\n\n*Tecmed*, para. 154.\n\n*OEPC,* pars. 184-186.\n\n255.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent maintains that devaluation was the result of market decisions and that the constant decisions of courts in other crises has reaffirmed the constitutionality of measures of this kind, most notably in the context of the United States' great depression. The *Thunderbird v. Mexico* decision has also been invoked by the Respondent in support of its view that the standard of fair and equitable treatment does not include the protection of legitimate expectation and it is not different from the international minimum standard55.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, p. 13.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent is right in arguing that fair and equitable treatment is a standard none too clear and precise. This is because international law is not too clear and precise either on the treatment due to foreign citizens, traders and investors or with respect to the fact that the pertinent standards have gradually evolved over the centuries. Customary international law, treaties of friendship, commerce and navigation, and more recently bilateral investment treaties, have all contributed to this development56.\n\nStephen Vasciannie, *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice*, BYIL, Vol. 70, 1999, para. 100\n\n257.\n\nThe evolution that has taken place is for the most part the outcome of a case by case determination by courts and tribunals, as evidenced among many other investment treaty and NAFTA decisions by the *TECMED*, the *OEPC* and the *Pope & Talbot* cases57. This explains that, like with the international minimum standard, there is a fragmentary and gradual development. Such development however partly hinges on the gradual formulation - both in cases and legal writings - of \u2018general principles of law' (as understood under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute) able to guide and \u2018discipline'58 the evaluation of state conduct under investment treaty standards.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003; *Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC) v. Republic of Ecuador*, London Court of International Arbitration Administered Case No. UN 3467, Final Award of July 1, 2004; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada*, NAFTA (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Proceeding, Interim Award of June 26, 2000.\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v.

But in other more vague circumstances, the fair and equitable standard may be more precise than its customary international law forefathers. This is why the Tribunal concludes that the fair and equitable standard, at least in the context of the Treaty applicable to this case, can also require a treatment additional to, or beyond that of, customary law. The very fact that recent FTC interpretations or investment treaties have purported to change the meaning or extent of the standard only confirms that those specific instruments aside, the standard is or might be a broader one.\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal is bound to interpret Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty \" *in good faith in* *accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of the object and purpose* \" as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal gives weight to the text of the Treaty's Preamble, which links the standard to the goal of legal stability: *\u2018fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for the investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.* '\n\n260.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concludes that a key element of fair and equitable treatment is the requirement of a \u2018 *stable framework for the investment* ', which has been prescribed by a number of decisions59. Indeed, this interpretation has been considered \u2018 *an emerging* *standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law* '60.\n\n*OEPC*, paras. 190-191; *CMS*, paras. 274-276; *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v.

As noted by the tribunal in *CMS* :\n\nIt is not a question of whether the legal framework might need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing circumstances, but neither is it a question of whether the framework can be dispensed with altogether when specific commitments to the contrary have been made. The law of foreign investment and its protection has been developed with the specific objective of avoiding such adverse legal effects61.\n\n*CMS*, para. 277.\n\n262.\n\nThe protection of the \u2018 *expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment* '62 has likewise been identified as a facet of the standard. The *Tecmed* approach has been consistently adopted by subsequent decisions63. *Tecmed* described such expectations as \u2018 *basic* '64, while in the context of NAFTA, tribunals have qualified them as \u2018 *reasonable and justifiable* '65. What seems to be essential, however, is that these expectations derived from the conditions that were offered by the State to the investor at the time of the investment66 and that such conditions were relied upon by the investor when deciding to invest67.\n\n*Tecmed*, para. 154.\n\n*MTD*, para. 114.; *OEPC*, para. 185; *Eureko B.V. v.

Argentina in the early 1990s constructed a regulatory framework for the gas sector containing specific guarantees to attract foreign capital to an economy historically unstable and volatile. As part of this regulatory framework, Argentina guaranteed that tariffs would be calculated in US dollars, converted into pesos for billing purposes, adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the US PPI and sufficient to cover costs and a reasonable rate of return. It further guaranteed that tariffs would not be subject to freezing or price controls without compensation. Foreign investors were specifically targeted to invest in the privatization of public utilities in the gas sector. Substantial foreign investment was undertaken on the strength of such guarantees, including the investment made by Enron in TGS.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it was in reliance upon the conditions established by the Respondent in the regulatory framework for the gas sector that Enron embarked on its investment in TGS. Given the scope of Argentina's privatization process, its international marketing, and the statutory enshrinement of the tariff regime, Enron had reasonable grounds to rely on such conditions.\n\n266.\n\nA decade later, however, the guarantees of the tariff regime that had seduced so many foreign investors, were dismantled. Where there was certainty and stability for investors, doubt and ambiguity are the order of the day. The long-term business outlook enabled by the tariff regime, has been transformed into a day-to-day discussion about what comes next. Tariffs have been frozen for almost five years. The recomposition of the tariff regime is subject to a protracted renegotiation process imposed on the public utilities that has failed to provide a final and definitive framework for the operation of business in the energy sector.\n\n267.\n\nThe Respondent might be right in distinguishing this case from the factual scenarios that recent decisions have faced, but this does not mean that Argentina's acts are consistent with the meaning of the protection under the Treaty. It is clear that the \u2018stable legal framework' that induced the investment is no longer in place and that a definitive framework has not been made available for almost five years.\n\n268.\n\nEven assuming that the Respondent was guided by the best of intentions, which the Tribunal has no reason to doubt, there is here an objective breach of the fair and equitable treatment due under the Treaty. The Tribunal thus holds that the standard established in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has not been observed and that to the extent that it results in a detriment to the Claimants' rights it will give rise to compensation.\n\n*3. The claim concerning the breach of the umbrella clause*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimants have also brought to this Tribunal a claim for an alleged breach of the obligations the Respondent entered into with regard to the investment, in light of the \"umbrella clause\" of Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty. This aspect of the claim is built on the premise that the protection envisaged is an expression of the obligation to observe the principle *pacta sunt servanda*. The Claimants cite in this context the view of Judge Higgins to the effect that such principle and acquired rights \"emphasize the protection that the private party has been given against either a later change of mind by the State or against the exercise of the State's regulatory powers\"69.\n\nRosalyn Higgins, *The Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments in International Law*, 176 Recueil des Cours 267, 347 (1982), as cited in Claimants' Memorial, para. 316.\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the clause applies to obligations arising from a contract or from broader undertakings contained in the State's own law and that the Respondent's measures breached every commitment made in the Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the License, with particular reference to the tariff regime and the commitment not to amend the License without TGS's consent.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this claim arguing that it did not undertake any specific obligation with regard to the investment or Enron in the Treaty, the investment legislation or the legislation regulating the License. In addition, it alleges that under customary law, violations of contracts cannot be equated with a treaty breach and thus do not engage the international responsibility of the State70, and that, as held in *SGS v. Pakistan*, contract claims do not qualify as BIT claims71. Moreover, the Respondent maintains the Tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines*, while disagreeing with some aspects of the *Pakistan* decision, still held that the umbrella clause only comprises obligations undertaken with respect to a specific investment and thus the clause does not extend to ordinary contractual breaches that must be taken to the contract forum.\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award of October 12, 2005, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Noble-Ventures-Final-Award.pdf, para. 53.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

The Respondent relies upon the *Noble Ventures v. Romania* decision insofar as it would limit the application of the umbrella clause to investment contracts. Claimants oppose such an interpretation because that decision, in their view, referred to contracts made with regard to an investment72.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the text of Article II(2)(c) reads \" *[e]ach party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments* \", a text which should be interpreted \" *in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\"* as indicated by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n274.\n\nUnder its ordinary meaning the phrase \u2018any obligation' refers to obligations regardless of their nature. Tribunals interpreting this expression have found it to cover both contractual obligations such as payment73 as well as obligations assumed through law or regulation74. \u2018Obligations' covered by the \u2018umbrella clause' are nevertheless limited by their object: \u2018 *with regard to investments* '.\n\n*Fedax N.V. v. Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Award of March 9, 1998, 37 *ILM* 1391 (1998), para. 29; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of January 29, 2004; 8 *ICSID Rep.* 518, paras. 127-128.\n\n*SGS v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* para. 166; *LG&E*, para. 175.\n\n275.\n\nThrough the Gas Law and its implementing legislation, the Respondent assumed \u2018 *obligations with regard to investments'* : tariffs calculated in US dollars converted to pesos for billing purposes, linked to the US PPI and sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return were intended to establish a tariff regime that assured the influx of capital into the newly privatized companies such as TGS and ensured the value of such investment. The dismantling of these guarantees would suffice to establish a violation of the obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants' investment.\n\n276.\n\nIn addition, the prohibition of price controls without indemnification and the prohibition of License amendments without consent, although contained in the License were also approved by decree75 and formed part of the implementing legislation that established the tariff regime. The obliteration of these commitments likewise entails a violation of obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants' investment.\n\nObligations undertaken in the License were initially approved by Decree 2255/92 (Model License) and later specifically ratified with regard to TGS by Decree 2458/92.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes accordingly that the breach of the obligations noted undertaken both under contract and law and regulation in respect of the investment have resulted in the breach of the protection provided under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c).\n\n*4. The claim about arbitrariness and discrimination*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimants assert that there has also been a breach of Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty because the measures adopted are both arbitrary and discriminatory. The claim of arbitrariness is based on the argument that such measures destroyed the rights and reasonable expectations of the Claimants, lacked proportionality and were in violation of the law. The claim of discrimination relies on the view that the measures fell disproportionately on the largely foreign-owned gas sector. A long list of specific measures is given by the Claimants in respect of each of these aspects.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this claim asserting that the measures were consistent with the law and aimed at continuing the operational income and earnings of the companies, while at the same time being proportionate to the purpose sought, reasonable and, in any event, lacking in any intention to breach the rule of law or affect judicial propriety, as required by numerous judicial and arbitral decisions.\n\n280.\n\nNeither is there discrimination, the Respondent maintains, because the regulated gas sector is very different from other sectors operating in a competitive market, such as banking, and the entities involved are far from being in a similar or even comparable situation, thus not being discriminated if treated differently in light of each individual or sector requirement. Least of all is there any capricious, irrational or absurd differential treatment of the Claimants, who are not even among those who have suffered the most severe consequences of the measures adopted.\n\n281.\n\nAfter examining the detailed arguments of the parties and their supporting authorities and decisions, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimants' view that there is here arbitrariness or discrimination. The measures adopted might have been good or bad, a matter which is not for the Tribunal to judge, and as concluded they were not consistent with the domestic and the Treaty legal framework, but they were not arbitrary in that they were what the Government believed and understood was the best response to the unfolding crisis. Irrespective of the question of intention, a finding of arbitrariness requires that some important measure of impropriety is manifest, and this is not found in a process which although far from desirable is nonetheless not entirely surprising in the context it took place.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches a similar conclusion in respect of discrimination. There are quite naturally important differences between the various sectors that have been affected, so it is not surprising either that different solutions might have been or are being sought for each, but it could not be said that any such sector has been singled out, in particular either to apply to it measures harsher than in respect of others, or conversely to provide a more beneficial remedy to one sector to the detriment of another. The Tribunal does not find that there has been any capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimants as compared to other entities or sectors.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the Respondent has not breached the protection provided under Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty.\n\n*5. The claim about failure to give full protection and security*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nLastly, the Claimants argue that there has been a failure to give full protection and security to the Claimants' investment, as required under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty. The Claimants rely to this effect on the broader interpretation of this requirement made particularly in *CME*, where the standard was related not just to physical security but also to the legal protection of the investment.\n\n285.\n\nThe Respondent believes differently, arguing first that the standard only relates to physical protection and security, as evidenced in *AAPL* and *AMT* where installations were destroyed, and asserting next that *CME* does not mean that the interpretation it made of the standard is the accepted definition under international law, so much so that it was at the same time contradicted by the opposite conclusion in *Lauder*.\n\n286.\n\nThere is no doubt that historically this particular standard has been developed in the context of physical protection and security of the company's officials, employees or facilities. The Tribunal cannot exclude as a matter of principle that there might be cases where a broader interpretation could be justified, but then it becomes difficult to distinguish such situation from one resulting in the breach of fair and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.\n\n287.\n\nIn this case no failure to give full protection and security to officials, employees or installations has been alleged. The argument made in general about a possible lack of protection and security in the broader ambit of the legal and political system is not in any way proven or even adequately developed. The Tribunal accordingly rejects this claim and finds that no breach of Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has taken place.\n\n*The alternative plea of emergency*\n-----------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nIn case the Tribunal would find that a breach of the Treaty has taken place, the Argentine Republic has pleaded in the alternative exemption from liability in light of national emergency or state of necessity under domestic law, general international law and the Treaty, all of it based on the severity of the crisis that affected the country as from 2000.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent explains in detail the severity that characterized the crisis affecting the country, which threatened in its view the very existence of the State and its independence. The Respondent explains in particular that the significant decrease of the Gross Domestic Product, consumption and investment during the crisis period, together with deflation and the reduction in value of Argentine corporations, resulted in widespread unemployment and poverty, with dramatic consequences in health, malnutrition and social policies. In addition, public institutions were no longer functioning.\n\n290.\n\nWith a view to overcome such difficulties there was an urgent need to resort to emergency, described by the Respondent as a severe form of necessity, which materialized in the 2002 Emergency Law. The Respondent explains in this respect that the Emergency Law was not the cause of the unfolding economic emergency but the normative consequence of a situation that had become manifest in world financial markets. The measures adopted, the Respondent maintains, were the remedy recommended by distinguished economists and led to the gradual recovery that is noticeable at present.\n\n*1. Necessity and emergency under the Argentine Constitution*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the Argentine Constitution provides for various kinds of emergency measures, including most prominently economic emergency, which in this case was declared by Congress, and that as a public act on emergency measure benefits from a presumption of legality, subject to constitutional control by the judiciary. The emergency legislation, the Respondent maintains, meets the requirements laid down by judicial decisions to the extent that there exists a state of necessity, the rules are aimed at attending to public interest, the remedy introduced is proportional to the emergency and its time frame is reasonable and related to the causes of the emergency. So too, the Respondent asserts, the measures enacted by the Government acting on powers delegated by Congress observe the legal requirements of emergency as provided under the Constitution.\n\n292.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Respondent has not demonstrated that the degree of threat required to invoke the defense of necessity has been met, particularly because the existence of the State has not been imperiled as if it had faced a military threat, nor has it demonstrated that the derogation of the specific guarantees and obligations disputed was justified.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined above the situation of the measures complained of in the context of the Argentine legislation. While there can be no doubt that emergency has been continuously invoked and recognized in Argentina, precisely because of that the courts have been careful in stating the conditions under which emergency may be exercised and legally validated. In the context of the present emergency, the Tribunal is mindful of the specific requirements laid down in *Provincia de San Luis*, and these, as concluded, have not been met by the emergency legislation. It follows that the very constitutional provisions that were subject to judicial control and led to the definition of those conditions cannot be invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of the measures adopted if they do not comply with the conditions indicated.\n\n*2. The plea of state of necessity under customary international law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent maintains in this respect that state of necessity is consolidated under international law as a concept precluding wrongfulness of the measures adopted in its context and exempting the State from international responsibility. The *Neptunus* case and the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* judgment, as well as Article 25 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, are invoked in support of this conclusion.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent argues in particular that it has not contributed to the situation of necessity as most of the intervening factors were exogenous; that the measures adopted were the only means to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril because otherwise the situation would have gone out of control; that no essential interest of other States beneficiaries of the obligation or of the international community as a whole have been seriously impaired; and that the Claimants or TGS have not been treated differently from other investors in this sector.\n\n296.\n\nIn answering to arguments advanced by the Claimants, the Respondent distinguishes the *Himpurna* case from its own situation on the ground that in that case the State company PLN had expressly waived in the contract the possibility of invoking *force majeure* in justification of non performance and that the alleged events had not been proven, thus explaining the decision of the Tribunal not to admit economic emergency. So too, the Respondent distinguishes *Socobelge* where the financial situation of Greece never got to be considered by the Permanent Court of International Justice.\n\n297.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes in particular that in the view of experts Argentina had no other option than to undertake the pesification of the contractual relations as every other remedy was unviable76 and that, as noted, Argentina did not contribute to the situation of necessity because the main difficulties originated in external shocks, including the Asian and Russian crises, devaluation in Brazil and strengthening of the US dollar. An expert for Argentina concludes that \"the Argentine currency board was not sustainable and had to be abandoned given the external and other shocks that hit the economy [...] Also, the only really feasible and desirable exchange rate regime after the collapse of the peg was a floating exchange rate regime such as the one adopted by the local economic authorities in Argentina; alternatives such as dollarization were undesirable and/or unfeasible.\"77\n\nExpert Opinion of Nouriel Roubini of February 24, 2005, para. 50.\n\n*Idem*.\n\n298.\n\nFollowing the *Gould* case, the Respondent concludes that in view of the existence of a state of necessity damage caused is not attributable to the State as it originates in \"social and economic forces beyond the power of the state to control through the exercise of due diligence.\"78 Compensation thus is not due, the Respondent maintains.\n\n*Gould Marketing Inc., as successor to Hoffman Export Corporation v. Ministry of National Defense of Iran*, 3 Iran-US C.T.R. 147, submitted as Respondent's Legal Authority no. 228.\n\n299.\n\nWhile the Claimants share the Respondent's view that Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility reflects customary international law in this matter, they believe the case has not been proven. Specifically the Claimants maintain that Argentina has not demonstrated that it was threatened by a grave and imminent peril, that the measures adopted were the only way to safeguard against that peril, that the obligation in question does not exclude the defense of necessity and that it did not contribute to the situation of necessity. The *Himpurna* and *Socobelge* cases are relied on by the Claimants in support of their assertions.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants emphasize that, contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the crisis finds its origins in endogenous factors which in the view of another expert are almost entirely the result of Argentina's own policy failures,79 particularly the failure to implement structural reforms in the 1990s ensuring fiscal discipline, labor market flexibility, open foreign trade and the maintenance of the credibility of the currency board. The Claimants also argue that options other than pesification were available and thus this measure was not the only way to address the crisis; among the options discussed there was the structural reforms indicated, the agreed restructuring of its debt, dollarization and devaluation without pesification. Such alternative plans have worked in other countries, such as Uruguay, the expert explains.\n\nExpert Opinion of Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards of April 27, 2005, paras. 33-82.\n\n301.\n\nThe expert opinion of Professor Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards summarizes its conclusions on the following main points: Argentina itself primarily caused its economic crisis by making policy mistakes prior to 2001 and a series of additional mistakes in 2001; external shocks played a limited role in the Argentine economic crisis; and the country had a number of options available throughout the 1990s and during 2000 and 2001, and even after devaluation Argentina did not have to pesify.80 A rebuttal opinion by Professor Nouriel Roubini was introduced by the Respondent in opposing the Claimants' views and its expert's analysis.81\n\n*Id.*, paras. 126-137.\n\nExpert Opinion of Nouriel Roubini of June 24, 2005.\n\n302.\n\nThe conclusion the Claimants reach, as indicated in Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility, is that even in the case of state of necessity the preclusion of wrongfulness is without prejudice to, first, the compliance with the obligation concerned and, next, the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the measures adopted, thus not allowing for the permanent repudiation of rights or to ignore the necessary compensation.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal's understanding of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility to the effect that it reflects the state of customary international law on the matter, is not different from the view of the parties in this respect. This is not to say that the Articles are a treaty or even a part of customary law themselves; it is simply the learned and systematic expression of the development of the law on state of necessity by decisions of courts and tribunals and other sources along a long period of time. Article 25 states:\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n*(a)* Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n*(b)* Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n*(a)* The International obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n*(b)* The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.82\n\nArticle 25, ILC's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n304.\n\nThere is no disagreement either about the fact that state of necessity is a most exceptional remedy subject to very strict conditions because otherwise it would open the door to elude any international obligation. Article 25 accordingly begins by cautioning that the state of necessity \"may not be invoked\" unless such conditions are met. Whether in fact the invocation of state of necessity in the Respondent's case meets those conditions is the difficult task the Tribunal must now undertake.\n\n305.\n\nThe first condition Article 25 sets out is that the act in question must be the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. The Tribunal must accordingly establish whether the Argentine crisis qualified as affecting an essential interest of the State. The opinions of experts are sharply divided on this issue, ranging from those that consider the crisis had gargantuan and catastrophic proportions to those that believe that it was not different from many other contemporary situations of crisis around the world.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that there was a severe crisis and that in such context it was unlikely that business could have continued as usual. Yet, the argument that such a situation compromised the very existence of the State and its independence so as to qualify as involving an essential interest of the State is not convincing. Questions of public order and social unrest could be handled as in fact they were, just as questions of political stabilization were handled under the constitutional arrangements in force.\n\n307.\n\nThis issue is in turn connected with the existence of a grave and imminent peril that could threaten that essential interest. While the government had the duty to prevent the worsening of the situation and could not simply leave events to follow their own course, there is no convincing evidence that the events were out of control or had become unmanageable.\n\n308.\n\nIt is thus quite evident that measures had to be adopted to offset the unfolding crisis. Whether the measures taken under the Emergency Law were the \"only way\" to achieve this result and no other alternative was available, is also a question on which the parties and their experts are profoundly divided, as noted above. A rather sad world comparative experience in the handling of economic crises, shows that there are always many approaches to address and correct such critical events, and it is difficult to justify that none of them were available in the Argentine case.\n\n309.\n\nWhile one or other party would like the Tribunal to point out which alternative was recommendable, it is not the task of the Tribunal to substitute for the governmental determination of economic choices, only to determine whether the choice made was the only way available, and this does not appear to be the case.\n\n310.\n\nArticle 25 next requires that the measures in question do not seriously impair the interest of State or States toward which the obligations exists, or of the international community as a whole. The interest of the international community does not appear to be in any way impaired in this context as it is rather an interest of a general kind. That of other States will be discussed below in connection with the Treaty obligations. At that point it will also be discussed whether the Treaty excludes necessity, which is another condition peremptorily laid down under the Article in comment.\n\n311.\n\nA further condition that Article envisages is that the State cannot invoke necessity if it has contributed to the situation of necessity. This is of course the expression of a general principle of law devised to prevent a party taking legal advantage of its own fault. Although each party claims that the factors precipitating the crisis were either endogenous or exogenous, the truth seems to be somewhere in between with both kind of factors having intervened, as in the end it has been so recognized by both the Government of Argentina and international organizations and foreign governments.\n\n312.\n\nThis means that to an extent there has been a substantial contribution of the State to the situation of necessity and that it cannot be claimed that the burden falls entirely on exogenous factors. This has not been the making of a particular administration as it is a problem that had been compounding its effects for a decade, but still the State must answer as a whole.\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal must note in addition that as held in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* decision, with reference to the work of the International Law Commission, the various conditions discussed above must be cumulatively met, which brings the standard governing the invocation of state of necessity to a still higher echelon. In light of the various elements that have been examined, the Tribunal concludes that the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law have not been fully met in this case.\n\n*3. The plea of necessity under Article IV(3) of the Treaty*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent also justifies the invocation of necessity in the terms of Article IV(3) of the Treaty. This Article provides:\n\nNationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.83\n\nArticle IV(3) of the Argentina-U.S. BIT.\n\n315.\n\nThe Respondent, following the decision in *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* in that it held that the essential interest of the State cannot be reduced to questions of the existence of the State but extends also to other matters such as a grave danger to ecological preservation,84 asserts that in the present case, with every more reason, the fact that human life was endangered in the crisis context justifies the inclusion of this type of event under the terms of Article IV(3), and concludes that accordingly the invocation of necessity is not excluded by the Article in comment, thereby meeting the requirement that Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility also envisages to this effect.\n\n*Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia), International Court of Justice, Judgment of September 25, 1997, para. 53.\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent also relies to this effect on the expert report of Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter and Professor William Burke-White, where it is concluded that the measures adopted by Argentina are fully consistent with the terms of Article IV(3).85\n\nLegal Opinion of Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White of March 2, 2005, paras. 58-59.\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimants oppose this other justification on the ground that Article IV(3), far from reducing Argentina's obligations, adds to them by requiring national treatment and most favored nation treatment of the investors as compared to the treatment of other companies in light of the measures adopted to offset any losses. It is also argued that the decisions in *AMT* and *AAPL* upheld the liability of the host State in spite of situations of war and civil disturbance being invoked under the provisions of the respective applicable treaties.\n\n318.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, Article IV(3) applies only to the measures adopted in response to a loss, such as compensation, but not to the measures that cause the loss and, moreover, do not apply to economic emergencies but only to \"war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events\". In any event, the Claimants conclude, this Article does not exempt Argentina from liability and the duty to pay compensation.\n\n319.\n\nAn expert opinion of Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez is relied upon by the Claimants in support of their arguments, as the expert concluded that the Article in question provides further assurances to foreign investors and is not \"a further exception permitting derogations from the treaty.\"86\n\nLegal Opinion of Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez of April 20, 2005, para. 70.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that the only meaning of Article IV(3) is to provide a minimum treatment to foreign investments suffering losses in the host country by the simultaneous interplay of national and most favored nation treatment, and this is only in respect of measures the State \"adopts in relation to such losses\", that is corrective or compensatory measures.\n\n321.\n\nWhile there is no reason to exclude from this Article economic emergency measures in given circumstances of particular gravity, it still would not allow derogation from rights under the Treaty as it refers to a different matter. Even less so can it be read as a general escape clause from treaty obligations and thus does not result in excluding wrongfulness, liability and eventual compensation. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that state of necessity cannot be justified under this Article in the terms that the Respondent has invoked it.\n\n*4. The plea of necessity under Article XI of the Treaty*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe discussion of Article XI of the Treaty has been particularly complex in this proceeding given the wealth of arguments of the parties and of authorities and materials brought to the attention of the Tribunal. The Tribunal is once more grateful to counsel for the parties and to the experts that have written learned opinions, in particular Dean Anne-Marie Slaughter, Professor William Burke-White and Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez.\n\n323.\n\nArticle XI of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\nThis Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security interests.87\n\nArticle XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT.\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent, relying on the opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White, asserts that public order and national security exceptions have to be interpreted broadly in the context of this Article, including economic security and political stability; moreover, this Article was understood to be self-judging to the extent that each party will be the sole judge of when the situation requires measures of the kind envisaged by the Article, subject only to a determination of good faith by tribunals that might be called upon to settle a dispute on this question. In the Respondent's view, the gravity of the crisis faced amply justifies resorting to such measures which can only be considered as adopted in good faith.\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent also explains that in application of this Article Argentina has been able to maintain public order, has protected its essential security interests and has recomposed with great difficulty the relations with the international economic system, all of which while treating foreign investors like any other investor.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent assigns particular significance to the self-judging character of this Article, which the Respondent maintains has been reaffirmed by the interpretation of the United States in a number of bilateral investment treaties and statements before Congress, all of which allow Argentina to benefit from the same understanding on the basis of reciprocity88. The experts assert that \"Argentina and the United States negotiated and signed a BIT that allowed either party to take measures otherwise inconsistent with their obligations under the treaty if that party deemed it necessary to protect its national security interests.\"89\n\nLegal Opinion of Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White of July 1, 2005.\n\nLegal Opinion of Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White of March 2, 2005, para. 63.\n\n327.\n\nThe Claimants do not share the same understanding, and neither does Professor Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. It is first argued that Article XI is not self-judging and that judicial review is not limited to a good faith determination but has to examine the facts and whether they qualify under the requirements of state of necessity. It is also maintained that a self-judging clause is an extraordinary exception that has to be clearly stated, as has been done in Article XXI of the GATT and confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the *Nicaragua* case in rejecting an argument of the United States similar to that of Argentina here, just as it has been expressly included in some bilateral investment treaties, most notably the U.S.-Russia BIT Protocol, but nothing of the sort was done in the Treaty here applicable.\n\n328.\n\nThe expert opinion of Professor Alvarez summarized its conclusions on the meaning of Article XI stating that this essential security/public order clause \"(1) is not self-judging; (2) does not apply to \u2018economic emergencies', except in the most extraordinary and so far unprecedented circumstances; and (3) even when it does apply (for example, in the event of war or insurrection), is not the equivalent of a \u2018denial of benefits' or termination clause in a treaty, and so does not negate state responsibility to pay compensation for actions that harm investors.\"90\n\nLegal Opinion of Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez of April 20, 2005, para. 8.\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimants do not believe that exchanges between the U.S. Government and Congress in different contexts and to a very limited extent could be taken to mean that a self-judging interpretation was intended for the Treaty here applied.91 In fact it is asserted that the opposite is true because at the time the U.S. Government explained that the Treaty \"contains an absolute right to international arbitration of investment disputes.\"92\n\n*Id.*, paras. 16-17.\n\nLetter of Submittal of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, January 13, 1993.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that, in any event, Article XI does not apply to economic emergencies but only to internal security, just as international peace and security were interpreted to mean the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, nor does it relieve Argentina from paying compensation. A self-judging interpretation, the Claimants conclude, would result in creating a broad and sweeping exception to the obligations under the Treaty and would eviscerate the very purpose and object of this kind of treaty.93\n\nLegal Opinion of Jos\u00e9 E. Alvarez of 20 April 2005, para. 54.\n\n331.\n\nIn examining this discussion, the Tribunal must first note that the object and purpose of the Treaty is, as a general proposition, to apply in situations of economic difficulty and hardship that require the protection of the international guaranteed rights of its beneficiaries. To this extent, any interpretation resulting in an escape route from the obligations defined cannot be easily reconciled with that object and purpose. Accordingly, a restrictive interpretation of any such alternative is mandatory.\n\n332.\n\nWhile there is nothing that would prevent an interpretation allowing for the inclusion of economic emergency in the context of Article XI, to interpret that such a determination is self-judging would be definitely inconsistent with the object and purpose noted. In fact, the Treaty would be deprived of any substantive meaning.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not define what is to be understood by essential security interest, just as it does not contain either a definition concerning the maintenance of international peace and security. The specific meaning of these concepts and the conditions for their application must be searched for elsewhere. In respect of international peace and security this task is rendered easier by the fact that the parties themselves agreed that its meaning is to be found in the context of the obligations under the Charter of the United Nations, as provided in Article 6 of the Protocol to the Treaty. The situation is more complex in respect of security interests because there is no specific guidance to this effect under the Treaty. This is what makes necessary to rely on the requirements of state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, so as to evaluate whether such requirements have been met in this case.\n\n334.\n\nThe expert opinion of Dean Slaughter and Professor Burke-White expresses the view that the treaty regime is different and separate from customary law as it is *lex specialis*94. This is no doubt correct in terms that a treaty regime specifically dealing with a given matter will prevail over more general rules of customary law. Had this been the case here the Tribunal would have started out its considerations on the basis of the Treaty provision and would have resorted to the Articles on State Responsibility only as a supplementary means. But the problem is that the Treaty itself did not deal with these elements. The Treaty thus becomes inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as the conditions for the operation of state of necessity are concerned. As concluded above, such requirements and conditions have not been fully met in the instant case.\n\nLegal Opinion of Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White of July 1, 2005, paras. 43-47.\n\n335.\n\nAs explained by Dean Slaughter, the position of the United States has been gradually evolving towards the support of self-judging clauses in respect of national security interests and some bilateral investment treaties reflect this change, albeit not all of them. Yet, this does not necessarily result in the conclusion that such was the intention of the parties in respect of the Treaty here relevant. Truly exceptional and extraordinary clauses such as a self-judging provision normally must be expressly drafted to reflect that intent, as otherwise there can well be a presumption about it not having that meaning in view of its exceptional nature. In the case of the Treaty nothing was said to this effect and the elements invoked in support of a self-judging character originate for the most part in congressional discussions in the United States concerning broader issues or indirect interpretations.95\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 19-20.\n\n336.\n\nThe discussion noted about the GATT and the *Nicaragua* decision, just as the *Oil Platforms* case, confirm that the language of a provision has to be very precise in order to lead to a conclusion about its self-judging nature and in all those cases language differences turned out to be crucial for the rejection of arguments favoring such exceptional character. So too, the International Court of Justice held in the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros* case, referring to the conditions defined by the International Law Commission, that \"the State concerned is not the sole judge of whether those conditions have been met.\"96\n\n*Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros*, paras. 51-52.\n\n337.\n\nNot even if this was the interpretation given to the clause today by the United States would this necessarily mean that such interpretation governs the Treaty. What is relevant is the intention the parties had in signing the Treaty and this does not confirm the self-judging interpretation. Even if this interpretation were shared today by both parties to the Treaty, it would still not result in a change of its terms. States are of course free to amend the Treaty by consenting to another text, but this would not affect rights acquired under the Treaty by investors or other beneficiaries.\n\n338.\n\nAs an English court has recently held in respect of a claim of non-justiciability relating to a State challenge to the *OEPC* award, the fact that a treaty is concluded between States cannot derogate from rights that belong to private parties, in the instance concerning dispute settlement, and as a consequence the doctrine of non-justiciability could not apply.97\n\n*Republic of Ecuador v. Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC)*, Queen's Bench Application of April 29, 2005, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Occidental-Ecuador-QueensBenchApplication-29Apr2005.pdf, para. 85.\n\n339.\n\nIn light of this discussion, the Tribunal concludes that Article XI is not self-judging and that judicial review in its respect is not limited to an examination of whether its invocation or the measures adopted were taken in good faith. The judicial control must be a substantive one as to whether the requirements under customary law or the Treaty have been met and can thereby preclude wrongfulness. As the Tribunal has found above that the crisis invoked does not meet the customary law requirements of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, thus concluding that necessity or emergency are not conducive to the preclusion of wrongfulness, there is no need to undertake a further judicial review under Article XI as this Article does not set out conditions different from customary law in this respect.\n\n340.\n\nJudicial determination of the compliance with the requirements of international law in this matter should not be understood as if arbitral tribunals might be wishing to substitute for the functions of the sovereign State, but simply responds to the duty that in applying international law they cannot fail to give effect to legal commitments that are binding on the parties and interpret the rules accordingly, unless this derogation is expressly agreed to98.\n\n*See* discussion in Charles Leben, *L'\u00e9tat de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 dans le droit international de l'investissement*, CAHIERS DE L'ARBITRAGE, 2005/3, pp. 47-52.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal explained above that it would consider the requirement of Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility as to the act not seriously impairing an essential interest of the State towards which the obligation exists in the context of the Treaty obligations. In light of the discussion above about changing interpretations, it does not appear that the invocation by Argentina of Article XI, or state of necessity generally, would be taken by the other party to mean that such impairment does arise.\n\n342.\n\nBe that as it may, in the context of investment treaties there is still the need to take into consideration the interests of the private entities who are the ultimate beneficiaries of those obligations, as explained by the English court case in *OEPC* noted. The essential interest of the Claimants would certainly be seriously impaired by the operation of Article XI or state of necessity in this case.\n\n*5. Temporality and Compensation*\n---------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThere are still two other aspects of state of necessity the Tribunal needs to discuss. There is first the question that necessity is a temporal condition and, as expressed in Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility, its invocation is without prejudice to \"(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists\". Confirmed by international decisions, this premise does not seem to be disputed by the parties, although the Respondent's argument to the effect that one thing is the temporal nature of the emergency and another the permanent effects of its measures, discussed above, does not seem to be easily reconciled with the requirement of temporality. This in turn results in uncertainty as to what will be the legal consequences of the end of the Emergency Law.99\n\nWitness Testimony of Gustavo Simeonoff, Hearing Transcript Vol. 3, November 30, 2005, pp. 481-482.\n\n344.\n\nThe second question is that Article 27 also provides that necessity is without prejudice to \"(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question\". Again confirmed by international decisions, this other premise has been much debated by the parties as noted above. The Respondent does not share this premise because, as was also noted above, the record shows that eventually there would be no compensation for past losses or adverse effects originating in the emergency measures in the context of renegotiations undertaken.100\n\n*Id.*, p. 493.\n\n345.\n\nThe Respondent's view appears to be based on the understanding that Article 27 would only require compensation for the damage that arises after the emergency is over and not for that taking place during the emergency period. Although that Article does not specify the circumstances in which compensation should be payable because of the range of possible situations, it has also been considered that this is a matter to be agreed with the affected party101, thereby not excluding the possibility of an eventual compensation for past events. In the absence of a negotiated settlement between the parties, this determination is to be made by the Tribunal to which the dispute has been submitted.\n\nJames Crawford, *op. cit.,* p. 190.\n\nD. Remedies and Compensation\n----------------------------\n\n*1. The Parties' Submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimants request relief under three heads. Firstly, the Claimants submit that under Article IV of the Treaty the expropriation they have suffered requires the payment of full compensation in accordance with the fair market value of the expropriated investment. The Claimants also explain that their damages experts (\"LECG\") have used two dates to this effect in their calculations: August 31, 2000, at which time the first injunction concerning the US PPI had been just issued, and December 31, 2001, the date just before the enactment of the Emergency Law. Full compensation is, according to Claimants, also to be paid for the other Treaty breaches claimed, including fair and equitable treatment.\n\n347.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants claim the management fees due under the Technical Assistance Agreement (TAA), arguing that they constitute a \" *delayed compensation and should be included in computations of historical profitability or damages.* \"102 Thirdly, the Claimants require that compensation be paid for the loss of revenue derived from the unavailability of US PPI adjustments for 2000-2001.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 677.\n\n348.\n\nUnder these three heads, the Claimants' methods and related estimations of damage are as follows. To calculate the fair market value of the expropriated investment, the Claimants explain that LECG used three methods: the Discounted Cash Flow approach (DCF), book value, and unjust enrichment.103 Under DCF, the experts value the equity damage of the Claimants as of August 31, 2000 at US$243,775,916. With a valuation date of December 31, 2001, the Claimants' damages are estimated at US$272,722,850 and updated through November 2004 at US$382,016,802. Using the book value approach these figures are respectively US$337,549,800 and US$472,823,217. The unjust enrichment approach results in amounts for December 31, 2001, ranging from US $579,475,694 to US $582,018,216, depending on whether a \"purchase price\" or a \"wealth transfer\" variant is adopted.\n\nThe DCF and the Book Value methodologies are used to calculate what LECG identifies as \u2018Damage to Claimants as Equity Holders' or \u2018Equity Damage' to which management fees and PPI damages are subsequently added. The Unjust Enrichment approaches seem not to differentiate between these items.\n\n349.\n\nRegarding damages related to management fees under the TAA, the Claimants contend that DCF is the only valid method given that the expected future cash flow from management fees to Enron is not reported in TGS financial statements. LECG estimates damages to Enron under this head at US$34.8 million of December 2001, and US$48.7 million updated to November 2004.\n\n350.\n\nFinally, Claimants estimate damages from outstanding PPI adjustments at US$ 15.8 million based on the sum of the adjustments denied. LECG notes that this loss - while included in the August 2000 valuation - was written off from TGS books and is thus not taken into account for the valuation at December 2001.\n\n351.\n\nThe experts evaluate the overall damages to Claimants as of August 31, 2000 at US$278,722,689, and updated through November 2004 at US$495,217,600. With a valuation date of December 31, 2001, damages are estimated at US$323,399,817, which updated through November 2004 amount to US$453,002,615. Using the book value approach these figures are US$388,226,768 and US$543,809,030, respectively.\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimants also request pre-award interest at commercially reasonable rates, compounded quarterly, as they also request the award of all costs and expenses of the arbitration, including legal fees.\n\n353.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the claim for compensation on various grounds. Firstly, it makes the following three objections of general nature: (i) that the claim is illusory given the towering return on investment obtained by the Claimants prior to the crisis and the current stock market value of TGS; (ii) that the damages were the result of the aggressive financial policy of TGS and CIESA, in particular their high leverage and TGS' indebtedness in foreign currency; and (iii) that country risk included in the calculation of tariffs has already compensated Claimants' alleged losses.\n\n354.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent disagrees with a number of methodological assumptions underpinning the Claimants' valuation. The Respondent argues that (i) Enron's participation in TGS is not 35.5% but should be reduced to 19.5% considering the debt taken by CIESA on behalf of the Claimants; and (ii) that both the regulated and the nonregulated business should be considered together for the purpose of valuation since damages to the regulated business cannot be estimated without accounting for the return obtained in the same period by the non-regulated business.\n\n355.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the use of DCF to calculate the value of equity damage as a matter of principle and formulates specific objections to the results obtained by the Claimants. The inputs taken into account are also discussed by the Respondent's experts, as will be examined further below.\n\n356.\n\nThe Respondent also objects to the payment of compensation for the fees of the Technical Operator, among other reasons because the TAA was transferred to Petrobras for an undisclosed amount in 2004.\n\n357.\n\nLikewise, the Respondent opposes the claim for PPI damages arguing that this ignores the existence of the agreements signed in January and June 2000 suspending PPI adjustments and never challenged by the Claimants. If any damage were to be awarded on this ground, it should cover only marginal benefits derived from the July agreement.\n\n358.\n\nThese various submissions by the parties and their experts will be examined below in connection with the specific issues concerning valuation and compensation.\n\n*2. The Applicable Standard of Reparation*\n------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Treaty does not specify the damages to which the investor is entitled in case of breach of the standards of treatment different from expropriation, *i.e.*, fair and equitable treatment or the breach of the umbrella clause. Absent an agreed form of restitution by means of renegotiation of contracts or otherwise, the appropriate standard of reparation under international law is compensation for the losses suffered by the affected party, as was established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Case* :\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.104\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w*, Judgment No. 13 (Claim for Indemnity - The Merits) of September 13, 1928, available at: http://www.worldcourts.com/pcii/eng/decisions/1928.09.13 chorzowl/, para. 47.\n\n360.\n\nVarious tribunals have applied this principle in deciding damages for breach of \"fair and equitable treatment.\"105 As noted by *SD Myers*, the silence of the treaties, in that case of NAFTA, indicates the intention of the drafters \" *to leave it open to tribunals to determine a measure of compensation appropriate to the specific circumstances of the case*.\"106 The Tribunal added that: \" *whatever precise approach is taken, it should reflect the general* *principle of international law that compensation should undo the material harm inflicted by a breach of an international obligation*.\"107\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding, Partial Award of November 13, 2000, paras. 311-315; *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States*, (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award of August 30, 2000, para. 122; *MTD*, para. 238.\n\n*S.D. Myers*, para. 309.\n\n*Id.*, para. 315.\n\n361.\n\nThe present Tribunal finds that the appropriate approach in the instant case is that of compensation for the difference in the \u2018fair market value' of the investment resulting from the Treaty breaches. The notion of \u2018fair market value' is generally understood as the price at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and an hypothetical willing and able seller, absent compulsion to buy or sell, and having the parties reasonable knowledge of the facts, all of it in an open and unrestricted market.\n\n362.\n\nFair market value is indeed the applicable Treaty guideline for measuring damages in cases of expropriation. However, and as other tribunals in the past108, this Tribunal is faced with the problem of whether a standard mainly related to expropriation, such as fair market value, can be applied to situations not amounting to expropriation.\n\n*Marvin Feldman v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1), Award of December 16, 2002.\n\n363.\n\nOn occasions, the line separating indirect expropriation from the breach of fair and equitable treatment can be rather thin and in those circumstances the standard of compensation can also be similar on one or the other side of the line. Given the cumulative nature of the breaches that have resulted in a finding of liability, the Tribunal believes that in this case it is appropriate to apply the fair market value to the determination of compensation.109\n\n*See* also *CMS*, para. 410. In the absence of guidance regarding the standard of compensation for the breach of fair and equitable treatment in the US-Argentina BIT, the tribunal in the case of *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of July 16, 2006, para. 424 concluded that: \" *compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate.* \"\n\n*3. The Tribunal's finding*\n---------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to express its appreciation to the expert appointed by it, Mr. Luis Hern\u00e1n Paul, who has assisted the Tribunal in understanding essential technical information to arrive at the conclusions that follow. The Tribunal also expresses its appreciation to LECG, Dr. Fabi\u00e1n Bello and the experts for GSCSA, all of whom have provided important views and comments in support of their respective findings. The Tribunal has also considered with particular attention the comments made by the parties to both the preliminary and the final report of the Tribunal's expert.\n\n365.\n\nIn analyzing the parties' contentions on damages the Tribunal will proceed as follows. Firstly, it will address the arguments of general nature raised by the Respondent -described in paragraph 353. Secondly, it will address Claimants' claims following the approach proposed by the Claimants' experts and consisting in dividing damage claims into the following categories: (i) damages as equity holders - covering the loss in value of the Claimants' equity (*equity damage*) and the loss in value derived from the suspension of the PPI adjustments (*PPI damages*); and (ii) damages as technical operator (*operator damages*).\n\n366.\n\nIn conducting this analysis, the Tribunal will first deal with methodological issues before proceeding to calculate the quantum of the compensation for each of the Claimants' claims. It will conclude with the calculation of consolidated damages.\n\n*A. Respondent's general arguments opposing liability*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i) Historical return on investments*\n-------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nThe Respondent and both Mr. Bello and GSCSA have argued against compensation being awarded in this case because the historical return that the Claimants obtained on the investment was allegedly significantly higher than that considered in the determination of tariffs in connection with the cost of capital. According to the Respondent, the Claimants' actual capital contribution to TGS was minimal since most of the funds originated in the loan made by the Chase Manhattan Bank to CIESA. In addition, GSCSA suggests that there are numerous errors in the Claimants' calculations relating to the rate of return on investments, dividends and fees.\n\n368.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent's estimates of Claimants' returns on equity are flawed because they miscalculate the initial contribution and inflate TGS' and Claimants' earnings. Moreover, these estimates are irrelevant for damage calculation since damages are a direct result of the measures introduced since 2002 on a forward-looking basis.110\n\nLECG Expert Report of May 2005, para. 82.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal must reject Respondent's arguments. Firstly, as noted by the Claimants, their claims refer to the impact of the measures on the value of their investments. The calculation of such value is based on reasonable estimates of future demand, revenue and expenditures and excludes consideration of past performance or returns. Historical return on investment is therefore irrelevant for determining damages.\n\n370.\n\nSecondly, LECG is right in observing that differences between the estimated rate of return and the actual return are inherent to the price-cap system under which TGS operates. Under such system recouping extra profits between tariffs reviews will depend on the company's efficiency. Without analyzing the calculations presented by both parties at this stage, the Tribunal notes that even if Claimants' actual returns were higher than those estimated by the ENARGAS, such returns will not disallow claims for compensation of Treaty breaches. Neither historic nor estimated returns have been retained as a valid ground to oppose compensation under international law.\n\n*ii) The question of leverage*\n------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nAs noted above under \u00b6\u00b6 158-167, the Respondent has also raised the issue of CIESA's and TGS' reliance on financial leverage as an objection to liability. The Respondent and its experts, in particular Mr. Bello, argue that TGS' aggressive leverage policy considerably increased TGS vulnerability to changing economic conditions. Such vulnerability was compounded by TGS' \"double leverage\" following CIESA's own recourse to debt. TGS' declaration of default and its subsequent loss in value is therefore directly linked to financial policy decisions and cannot be attributed to Respondent's measures.\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimants note that TGS' financial policies were reasonable and followed normal standards for the gas transportation industry.111 In the absence of the Respondent's measures, TGS leverage would not have represented a potential liquidity or financial problem for the firm since historical performance and cash flows perspectives were sufficient to cover the typical financial ratio covenants considered by lenders.112 Finally, Claimants observe that CIESA's financing is irrelevant for damage computation since damages should be computed only once by looking at Claimants' stake in TGS.\n\n*Id.*, para. 64.\n\n*Idem.*\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants' approach. TGS' leverage was reasonable by industry standards and close to that advised by the regulator. The difference between the optimal leverage considered by ENARGAS and the actual leverage of TGS was not significant: respectively 36.7% as compared to 40.8% in RQT I (1996), and 46% as compared to 49.8% in RQT II (2001).113 It may also be noted that none of the debt holders expressed any concern regarding the level of leverage before the measures were taken.\n\n*Id.*, para. 63; Expert Opinion of Fabi\u00e1n Bello of February 28, 2005, para. 28.\n\n374.\n\nThe argument made by the Respondent as to the need to take into account the market capitalization of TGS shows that the value of TGS' stock was constantly and significantly positive before the measures were adopted, thus suggesting that the stock market did not consider such leverage as endangering the company prior to the measures.\n\n375.\n\nIt was only after the pesification of tariffs that the company defaulted on its debt and the stock exchange price decreased dramatically.114 Consequently, the decrease in value was generated by the measures and not by the leverage.\n\n*See* GSCSA Expert Report of June 2005, para. 138, for stock exchange price.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that CIESA's debt in this context is irrelevant. However, it will play an important role in defining the actual investment of the Claimants in TGS, as will be analyzed below.\n\n*iii) Country risk*\n-------------------\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal has extensively considered in its examination of liability above under \u00b6\u00b6 119-121; 148-150 the question of whether the country risk premium reflected in the tariff includes the risk of devaluation or the risk of tariff freeze and pesification, which the Respondent has raised in opposition to any claim of liability concerning such measures. According to the Respondent, any finding to the contrary would result in granting the Claimants double compensation for the same risk.\n\n378.\n\nAs mentioned, the Tribunal believes that the \u2018country risk' does not include the risk of freeze and pesification of tariffs, which was separately and specifically protected under the Regulatory Framework. Claimants have therefore not been compensated for these measures. Consequently, the valuation will consider the effect of freeze and pesification of the tariffs on the investment and this shall be reflected in the resulting compensation.\n\n*B. Claimants' claims regarding damages*\n----------------------------------------\n\n*i) Equity damage: methodological issues*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThe equity damages correspond to the loss in value of Claimants' investment in TGS derived from the measures, in particular from the *pesification* of tariffs. In estimating these damages, the Tribunal recalls that \" *compensation should undo the material harm inflicted by a breach of an international obligation*.\"115 In this case, as noted above, the breach concerns the fair and equitable treatment and the umbrella clause.\n\n*S.D. Myers*, para. 315.\n\n380.\n\nTo \" *undo the material harm* \" in this case, the Tribunal considers that it needs to compare the value of Claimants' investment before the measures were adopted and its value at present. To determine the value of the investment at these periods, the Tribunal will apply the principle of fair market value, as described above.\n\n381.\n\nThe parties disagree, however, on the appropriate method for establishing the fair market value. While the Claimants have relied to this effect on the DCF and other methods (*i.e.*, book value and unjust enrichment), the Respondent has favored the stock exchange valuation of the shares. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Fabi\u00e1n Bello, has also explained that market capitalization offers an additional method with which DCF assessments can be verified and corrected. In the instant case, shares in TGS are normally traded in both the Buenos Aires and New York stock exchanges. Claimants have rejected the use of the stock market value alleging principally (i) the illiquidity of TGS share; (ii) the effects of thin markets like Buenos Aires, namely, the disconnection between stock prices and real values and the volatility of share values due to erratic macro economic performance.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the use of book value or unjust enrichment in this case because these methodologies do not provide an adequate tool for estimating the market value of TGS's stake. The book value of TGS stake is by definition valid for accounting purposes but, as noted by LECG, fails to incorporate the expected performance of the firm in the future.116 The unjust enrichment method does not provide a value of the company; it computes damages by looking at the extent of unfair enrichment by the Government. The estimation of the unfair enrichment would then be determined on the basis of the price paid for the license or the wealth transferred to the entity benefiting from the enrichment.\n\nLECG Expert Report of May 2005, para. 157.\n\n383.\n\nWith regard to stock market value, the Tribunal accepts Claimants' point that when markets are illiquid or the volume of transactions is limited, market capitalization might provide distorted valuation indications. However, it is still possible to rely on this approach if longer periods of time are taken into consideration so as to determine relevant averages as suggested by the Tribunal's expert.\n\n384.\n\nIn view of the fact that TGS is a \"going concern\", the Tribunal believes that its fair market value should include the measure of its future prospects.117\n\nThis accords with established international practice. Such an approach was adopted in the following decisions: *Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Award in Resubmitted Case of June 5, 1990, 1 ICSID Reports (1993); *Liberian Eastern Timber Corp. (LETCO) v. Republic of Liberia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2), Award of 31 March 1986, 2 ICSID Reports (1994), pp. 372-377; *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award of August 30, 2000 available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid. Consideration of future prospects also features in the following decisions of the US-Iran Tribunal: *Starett Housing Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. ITL 32-24-1 of December 19, 1983 and *Phillipps Petroleum Company Iran v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. 425-39-2 of June 29, 1989.\n\n385.\n\nSince DCF reflects the companies' capacity to generate positive returns in the future, it appears as the appropriate method to value a \"going concern\" as TGS.118 Moreover, there is convincing evidence that DCF is a sound tool used internationally to value companies119, albeit that it is to be used with caution as it can give rise to speculation. It has also been constantly used by tribunals in establishing the fair market value of assets to determine compensation of breaches of international law.120\n\nThe DCF method is widely endorsed, both by financial institutions and international jurists. *See* for example *Legal Framework for the Treatment of Foreign Investments:* Volume II: Guidelines (Washington D.C., The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank) (1992).\n\nLECG Expert Report of May 2005, para. 159, no. 131.\n\n*See* for example: *Amco (Resubmitted Case)*, pp. 616-617; *LETCO*, pp. 372-377; and *CMS*, para. 411.\n\n386.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal is persuaded that the DCF method offers a reliable approach in this case. The Tribunal finds, in addition, that Mr. Bello's initial submission of verifying DCF results in accordance with the valuation that market capitalization might reflect is a useful tool to which the Tribunal will have recourse.\n\n387.\n\nIn the present case there is yet another aspect that must be considered. Market transactions have taken place in respect of the Claimants' participation in TGS, both in connection with the swap that took place with Petrobras and the later sale of shares to an investment fund. Willing sellers and willing buyers in this case are thus no longer hypothetical but real enough, a situation that has turned to be meaningful in the Tribunal's findings. In fact, these transactions and in particular the sale of the Claimants' 15.2% stake in TGS to D.E. Shaw and the option to purchase the remaining 4.3% participation in TGS are an accurate reflection of the current market value of the company.\n\n388.\n\nLECG uses DCF for establishing both the value before the measures were taken and the current value of the Claimants' participation in that business, the difference between one and the other being the estimated losses, subject to some adjustments. While the Tribunal finds nothing wrong in that approach, which is commonly used and has been applied by other tribunals,121 it involves some degree of uncertainty in the assumptions taken into account. Because there are in this case specific transactions concerning the Claimants' participation in TGS, the Tribunal considers that the real value obtained in these transactions better reflects the current value of such participation. This is a value which is certain and arises from market transactions. Moreover, such transactions were specifically made with the intention of mitigating losses.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005.\n\n389.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will apply DCF to estimate the value of TGS and of Claimants' investment (*i.e.*, their equity participation in TGS) before the measures were adopted, in particular, before pesification took place. To estimate the current value of TGS and of Claimants' investment, the Tribunal will use the sale transaction with D.E. Shaw. Both results would then be contrasted with the stock market value. Next, the Tribunal will establish the difference between these two values to calculate the damages suffered by the Claimants as shareholders of TGS. Finally, the Tribunal will consider *operator damages* and *PPI damages* (if any) to establish the overall compensation to the Claimants' for the Treaty breaches incurred by the Respondent.\n\n390.\n\nBefore moving to the quantum of equity damages, the Tribunal will address the Respondent's disagreements with regard to two important issues for the estimation of the equity damage: (i) the question of the Claimants' actual participation in TGS, including the discussion of CIESA's debt; and (ii) the question of regulated and non-regulated business.\n\n*a) The question of the Claimants' actual participation in TGS and the incidence of CIESA's debt*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nOne of the most difficult questions that the Tribunal has had to address is that concerning the true participation of the Claimants in TGS, namely whether it amounts to a 35.5%, as the Claimants argue, or only to a 19.5%, as the Respondent believes. As noted, this difference arises from the fact that the Claimants' participation in TGS was in part financed by a loan that CIESA took on their behalf. The Tribunal must note for the sake of clarification that these figures have been used by the parties so as to simplify the arguments made; in fact, each figure is the aggregate result of various shareholdings, some direct and some indirect.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the financing of the parent company's (*i.e.*, Enron) final investment (*i.e.*, TGS) through the indebtedness of the holding company (*i.e.*, CIESA) is a normal investment practice. Such practice will as a rule not affect the determination of the value of the shareholding for compensation purposes. In fact, because the parent company shall normally be liable for such debt, it would be entitled to recover the entire equity interest. In the present case, however, the situation is different. While the parent company at first guaranteed CIESA's debt and was liable for it, it then became the debt of CIESA alone. Eventually the parent company assumed and swapped its share of this debt for its own equity in TGS thereby diluting its final investment. The approach to compensation must therefore also be different.\n\n393.\n\nIndeed, the swap executed with Petrobras in connection with CIESA's debt restructuring in 2005 transformed Enron's initial indirect participation of 27.65% in TGS into a direct participation of 11.65% in that company.122 In exchange, the Claimants' liability for CIESA's debt was proportionally reduced.123\n\nThe 7.85% remaining direct interest of Claimants in TGS (through Enron's subsidiaries other than CIESA) was kept aside the swap transaction but was later included in the sale and option agreement entered into by Enron with D.E. Shaw.\n\nThe swap comprised two stages. First, EACH and EPCA, Enron's subsidiaries, transferred to a trustee indicated by Petrobras their 40% stake in CIESA; Petrobras in turn transferred to Enron's subsidiaries 7.35% of its direct stake in TGS. Second, EACH and EPCA would transfer their remaining 10% stake in CIESA to Petrobras; Petrobras in turn, approved the transfer by CIESA of 4.3% of its stake in TGS to Enron's subsidiaries. This second stage is awaiting ENARGAS approval.\n\n394.\n\nUpon completion of the swap Enron is to hold a direct stake of 19.5% in TGS (the initial 7.85% direct participation plus 11.65% following the swap). However, Enron sold shares representing 15.2% of TGS to the investment fund D.E. Shaw in January 2006. Subject to the completion of the second stage of the swap, leaving Enron an additional direct participation of 4.3%, D.E. Shaw also has the option of purchasing this additional stake.\n\n395.\n\nWhile this second stage is pending Enron remains proportionally liable for CIESA's debt. The Tribunal assumes, however, the success of the second stage of the swap leading to the extinction of the remaining liability. The Tribunal will accordingly consider the effects of the swap agreement as a whole.\n\n396.\n\nBefore entering into the analysis of the effects of the circumstances mentioned above, the Tribunal wishes to recall that the disposal of Enron's participation in TGS does not affect its jurisdiction to decide in this case. As discussed above, ICSID jurisdiction is determined on the date the arbitration is instituted and subsequent changes in their ownership of TGS does not affect jurisdiction.124\n\n*CSOB*, para. 31; *Vivendi*, paras. 60-62.\n\n397.\n\nHow do Enron's guarantees and assumption of CIESA's debt affect the determination of its participation in TGS and eventually the calculation of damages?\n\n398.\n\nFirstly, following the swap operation as a whole, Enron's initial indirect participation of 27.65% in TGS is reduced to 11.65%. Enron is further released from its obligations as guarantor of CIESA's debt. The 11.65% therefore represents the net asset value of Claimants' participation in CIESA, *i.e.*, the book value of Enron's assets in CIESA (which represented 27.65% of TGS stake) less liabilities (50% of CIESA's debt). The pre-existing 7.85% TGS stake directly owned by Enron should be added to this value to obtain the net asset value of Enron's overall participation *i.e.*, 19.5%. This stake corresponds to the sale agreed with D.E. Shaw.\n\n399.\n\nSecondly, CIESA's original debt should be taken into account when determining the value of Enron's investment prior to the measures. Claimants are correct in affirming their right to claim for their initial 35.5% participation in TGS. However, when valuing that stake, one cannot ignore the underlying debt burden if the latter is linked to the investor by the guarantee and subsequently serves to dilute the very same stake. As a matter of accounting principle therefore, comparing the current value of Enron's investment (as determined by the sale to D.E. Shaw) requires calculation of the net asset value of the Claimants' investment as of December 2001 obtained by deducting Claimants' participation in CIESA's debt.\n\n400.\n\nIt can then be concluded that Argentina will compensate the Claimants for the full value of their investment, which for the reasons explained does not include the portion of the investment financed by CIESA's indebtedness.\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal will accordingly use the 35.5% participation in TGS as the starting point of valuation, will deduct from such amount the Claimants' share in CIESA's liabilities, for which they no longer have any responsibility, and attain a net value, which is to be compared with the net present value of the sale to D.E. Shaw.\n\n*b) The question of the regulated and non-regulated business*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nAs noted above under \u00b6\u00b6 173-181, the parties have discussed the question whether valuation should take into account only the damages affecting the regulated business of TGS, as argued by the Claimants, or should off-set against any such losses the positive results of the non-regulated business, as argued by the Respondent. For the reasons explained, the Tribunal believes that both kinds of business should be kept separate and distinct. Accordingly, only the regulated business of TGS will be taken into account in the considerations that follow.\n\n*ii) Equity damage: the quantum of compensation*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to estimating the quantum of compensation for equity damages. In light of the considerations made above, only the regulated business of TGS will be taken into account to this effect. As noted, pesification of tariffs beginning in 2002 is the central factor in determining compensation as it has the higher incidence on the difference in value in December 31, 2001, before the measures were adopted, and the net present value.\n\n404.\n\nAs concluded above, the Tribunal will compare the value of the Claimants' participation in the regulated business of TGS before pesification and the current value of such participation. While the first value will be established using DCF, the current value will be based on the sale price to D.E. Shaw on January 18, 2006, taking into account only the value attributable to the regulated business.\n\n*The DCF value at December 31, 2001*\n------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal will start from the premise that the figures and assumptions used by LECG in their expert valuation of damages at December 31, 2001 are correct. The Tribunal notes that while two dates have been discussed by the Claimants as relevant to valuation (August 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001), most of the experts' work has dealt with the latter date. While another ICSID tribunal has used August 17, 2000 as the appropriate date to this effect,125 the Tribunal finds appropriate to follow in this case the experts' approach as the most serious damages arose in connection with the Emergency Law.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005.\n\n406.\n\nThere are, however, specific comments and criticism made by the Respondent and its experts, as well as by the Tribunal's expert, to the LECG figures, criticism that has been taken into account by the Tribunal to reach a conclusion in this respect. The valuation done by LECG has been tested under different scenarios so as to check for accuracy and reasonableness. In this respect, the Tribunal finds that a number of variables require adjustment, with particular reference to the tariff base, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") and the period over which tariff adjustment should realistically take place. These adjustments will be explained next.\n\n407.\n\nSuch adjustments reflect the reality of the crisis that took place in Argentina and the specific influence it has in connection with valuation and compensation, a matter which, as the Tribunal has explained, necessarily has to be reflected in this context. It is here where the difference with a normal business scenario will become evident.\n\n*The tariff base*\n-----------------\n\n408.\n\nThe tariff base used by LECG for December 31, 2001, or US$1,789 m., has been criticized by Mr. Bello as being excessive in light of the work done by ENARGAS and the participating consultants in preparation for the RQT II, which gave a lower end amount. The Respondent's expert considers that the base suggested by the Claimants should be reduced by US$225 m.\n\n409.\n\nTaking into consideration this criticism and other adjustments that had been considered by ENARGAS, the Tribunal's expert proposed as the appropriate tariff base an amount of US$1,669.4 m.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal's expert has accepted the reductions made by the ENARGAS consultants, with the exception of the exclusion of the working capital, which he considers must be included in the tariff base because it is as necessary as the investment in fix assets in order to develop the business. The Tribunal considers this to be a reasonable proposition and will accordingly follow its expert best estimate for a tariff base in the amount of US$1,669 m., a figure which is lower than that suggested by LECG and higher than that suggested by the Respondent.\n\n*The WACC*\n----------\n\n411.\n\nThe experts also disagreed about the appropriate WACC that should be applied in this case. While LECG has used a WACC of 12.24% for December 31, 2001, GSCSA has discussed a WACC of 14.86%. The Tribunal's expert considers it is appropriate to use a higher premium for risk than those used by LECG and proposes a 12.6% WACC, based on the WACC considered by ENARGAS for RQT II (10.4%) plus an adjustment for inflation.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the ENARGAS figure constitutes an objective and realistic calculation since it would have been the actual cost of capital applied by the regulator in the calculation of tariffs if the RQT II had not been aborted. While the ENARGAS did not reach a final determination on this matter, the figures discussed at the time reflected the options available and its most likely outcome. The adjustment for inflation is necessary to make it consistent with the nominal values used by LECG.\n\n413.\n\nIn light of these considerations the Tribunal considers that the figure proposed by the Tribunal's expert is reasonable and should also be retained for the calculation of compensation.\n\n*Period of tariff adjustment*\n-----------------------------\n\n414.\n\nLECG applied the whole tariff adjustment beginning in 2002 in a single year, using to this end an increase of 144%. The Tribunal believes this is not a realistic scenario in a crisis context and has accordingly, as argued by Mr. Bello, chosen to extend the period of tariff adjustment to six years, resulting in an increase of 20.8% for each year of such period with a total adjustment of 211%.\n\n415.\n\nSuch change is not significant in respect of the effect on demand that could result from one or the other choice because of the stable contractual commitments used in the gas transportation industry, and thus its effect on compensation will not be significant either. Yet, the Tribunal considers reasonable to allow for a longer period over which the tariff adjustment will take place. Tariff adjustment over a period of six years allows in fact for a better spread of the WACC indicated as the average return of the business.\n\n*Efficiency adjustment*\n-----------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe experts also discussed the question of the application of an efficiency factor in the determination of tariffs (Factor X). While for Mr. Bello this factor should be considered and would result in a lower tariff adjustment, LECG has explained that it is implicit in the cash flow estimates on which the initial tariff adjustment is based.\n\n417.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, whether this factor is taken into account in an explicit or an implicit manner, the end result will not be different. The Tribunal will accordingly retain the figures used to this effect by LECG.\n\n*Percentage attributable to the regulated business*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nIn determining the value of the regulated and the non-regulated business of TGS, LECG, following the same approach as the ENARGAS, has used the percentage each business has in the total fixed assets of the company, which results in 86% for the regulated business and 14% for the non-regulated business in 2001. In LECG's view, this percentage is the same resulting from the earnings of each business before taxes. The Respondent insists that such separation is artificial and unviable for damage calculation.\n\n419.\n\nThe Tribunal's expert has considered more reliable to this effect the use of the operational income for each business, as reflected in TGS' statements, which results in 88% for the regulated business and 12% for the non-regulated business for 2001. The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this approach.\n\n*Value of the regulated business in 2001*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal, as explained above, will use for establishing the value of the regulated business of TGS at December 31, 2001, the figures given by LECG with the following adjustments: the tariff base is reduced from US$1,789 m. to US$1,669 m.; tariff adjustment will spread over a period of six years with an annual increase of 20.8% and a total of 211%; WACC is increased from 12.24% to 12.6% and the participation in the regulated business is increased from 86% to 88%.\n\n421.\n\nThe value resulting from the above adjustments in light of DCF is US$1,574 m., which, after deducting the debt of the regulated business or US$934 m., yields an asset value of US$639.7 m. The Claimants' 35.5% participation is thus US$227.1 m.\n\n422.\n\nBecause of the reasons explained before, the Tribunal will take into consideration the situation of the Claimants' participation in CIESA's debt. CIESA's total debt at December 31, 2001 amounts to US$223.3 m.; the Claimants' participation in this debt is 50%, which if considered only in the percentage attributable to the regulated business (88%) results in an amount of US $98.1 m.\n\n423.\n\nThe total net value of the Claimants' participation in the regulated business at December 31, 2001 is, therefore, US$227.1 m. minus US$98.1 m. corresponding to their share in the debt, or a net figure of US $129 m.\n\n*Verification using stock exchange value*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted above that the value of market capitalization is a relevant element to verify the outcome of the DCF method so as to establish whether the variables used in the latter reflect reasonable assumptions. The use of market capitalization is intended only as a reference value and not as valuation tool in itself.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal has first concluded in this respect that to use the stock value of December 2001 would result in grave distortions since at that point the unfolding crisis had led to wide speculation. In fact, as explained by GSCSA, the stock market was used to obtain and transfer dollars by means of the purchase of American Depository Receipts (ADR's).126 Arbitrage of currencies to bypass the *\"corralito\"* by means of ADR transactions became a common practice at the time, which badly affected the reliability of stock market prices. It should be noted that the average stock market value of TGS for December 2001 (US$867 m.) was paradoxically higher than that of the precedent months November 2001 (US$749 m.) and October 2001 (US$781m.). It was also higher than the average for the period September-November 2001 (US$835 m.). The Tribunal will accordingly exclude the figures for the month of December.\n\nGSCSA Expert Report of June 2005, para. 136.\n\n426.\n\nApplying the percentages determined above, the stock value of the regulated business of TGS ranges from US$658.1 m. for November 2001 and US$734.3 for the period September-November 2001.These figures are not too different from those resulting from LECG's analysis (US$768 m.). Because the Tribunal has used a lower tariff base for the reasons explained, the difference increases in respect of the figures used by the Tribunal (US$639.7 m.), but it is still within an acceptable range and does not result in a disproportionate outcome.\n\n427.\n\nStock exchange prices for TGS would result systematically in values higher than those determined by the Tribunal's expert applying DCF, not only considering the averages for 2001 but also the result of longer periods of time. If, for example, the average for 19992001 is used, the value of the regulated business is US$1,094 m. The same holds true for any average corresponding to 2001. As noted, if December 2001 is used as a reference point, values will also be higher.\n\n428.\n\nThe Tribunal is accordingly satisfied that the figures resulting from DCF do not show unreasonable differences with those resulting from the verification done in light of the stock market value.\n\n*Current value of the regulated business*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that the transactions with respect to the sale of TGS shares to D.E. Shaw provide an accurate and realistic base for the estimate of the current fair market value of the company. Having a market transaction of such characteristics is then preferable, in the instant case, to the use of DCF that implies a number of uncertainties derived from assumptions on the future that may turn out to be true or not.\n\n430.\n\nD.E. Shaw bought the Claimants' 15.2% in TGS for US$114.6 million. It further took an option to purchase the Claimants' remaining 4.3% participation in TGS. Although the approval of this transaction is still pending, for the sake of a complete calculation the Tribunal includes the purchase price included in the \u2018Option Agreement' of US$33.9 m. The total current value is accordingly of US$148.5 m.\n\n431.\n\nThe participation of the regulated and the non-regulated business in this last figure has now to be determined. Applying the same criterion of the operational earnings used for 2001, this time for 2005, as reflected in TGS' statement for that year, the regulated business has a 42% participation in the total business, while the non-regulated business has 58%.\n\n432.\n\nIn its comments to the final report of the Tribunal's expert, the Claimants have argued that the approach taken by the expert as to the allocation of 42.5% of the 2006 transaction equity value to the regulated segment assumes that also only 42.5% of TGS' outstanding debt as of 2005 corresponds to that regulated segment. In the Claimants' view, this result does not reflect the reality because the vast majority of that debt had been contracted prior to 2002 to finance the regulated sector business. So as to avoid an implicit cross-subsidy between the regulated and the non-regulated business, the Claimants assert that the same debt allocation of 88% made in 2001 should be applied in 2005, while 42.5% is used for the allocation in respect of the firm value.\n\n433.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined with great attention this argument as it also believes that the correct principle to apply is that there should be no cross-subsidies between those segments. However, the Tribunal must also note that unrealistic results would emerge from the Claimants' proposals noted above. In fact, if the allocation proposed by the Claimants for 2001 is kept, only US$16.5 m. out of the equity value of US$753.9 m., that is about 2% of the equity value implied in the D.E. Shaw transaction could be attributed to the regulated business in 2005, while 98% would be allocated to the non-regulated sector. In light of current valuation of other business operating in the regulated area of gas transportation, this is not a reasonable outcome.\n\n434.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants' experts had suggested for the allocation of participation in 2001 the asset value of the regulated and non-regulated segments. This was also the approach considered by ENARGAS for the determination of tariffs. If this same approach is followed in 2005, not only for the debt but also for the firm value as Claimants request, the results obtained do not seem quite reasonable. In fact, it is estimated that 85% (percentage of assets attributable to the regulated business in light of the financial statements for 2005) of the total equity value resulting from the D.E. Shaw transaction would pertain to the regulated business under this scenario.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal does not question that the different methodological approaches discussed above might be conceptually valid. Given that such approaches lead to extreme results of 2% in one scenario and 85% in the other, both arising from the arguments of the same party, the Tribunal believes that the suggestion made by the Tribunal's expert is more balanced and realistic. Moreover, the allocation of debt between one segment and the other was never explicitly argued before the Tribunal.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes accordingly that it will keep the allocation suggested by the Tribunal's expert. It follows that of the total current value of US$148.5 m., the value of the regulated business is US$62.5 m. as at January 2006. Expressing this value in 2001 currency value the Claimants' participation amounts to US$38.6 m.\n\n*Verification of the current value using stock exchange value*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nIf extrapolated, the 2006 transaction would result in a value of US$761.5 m. for the whole of TGS' business. This is less than the stock exchange value of the company at the time, which was US$855 m. The Tribunal does not believe, however, that this difference reflects an abnormal result and may well be explained by the fact that the price of the sale was agreed in 2004 and came to be executed in 2006.The stock market value of TGS fluctuated in 2004 between US$589 m. and US$869 m, and thus the value of US$761.5 m. falls well within this range.\n\n438.\n\nThe difference between the value of the Claimants' participation in the regulated business of TGS in 2001 US$129 m., prior to the measures, and the value of the 2006 transaction expressed in 2001 currency US$38.6 m., results in an amount of US$90.4 m. in respect of the pesification of tariffs.\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to decide on the operator and PPI damages to finally add up all relevant concepts to estimate overall compensation for the Claimants.\n\n*i) Operator damages*\n---------------------\n\n440.\n\nThe Claimants have requested the award of damages relating to the Technical Assistance Agreement (\"TAA\") between TGS and EPCA, dated 28 December 1992127. Under its terms, EPCA receives compensation for its role as \"Technical Operator\" of TGS' gas transportation system, and its annual compensation is the higher of: (1) US$3 million, or (2) 7% of TGS' EBIT minus US$3m. The Claimants' experts have calculated that the after-tax value of the TAA to Enron was US$46.4 million as of December 2001.128\n\nClaimants' Exhibit n. 40.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 87; Claimants' Reply, paras. 672-677.\n\n441.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the substantial reduction of TGS' revenue stream caused by the freeze of tariffs damaged the Technical Operator.129 Moreover, the Claimants allege that their returns as Technical Operator are a form of delayed return from the risks it took under the privatization.130\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 674.\n\n*Id.,* para. 677.\n\n442.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the claim concerning the TAA explaining that such fees could not be considered a part of delayed compensation to be counted as damages because the Agreement was devised to remunerate specific know-how made available to TGS for a limited duration. In addition, since 2000, the operator fees are not included in the calculation of tariffs as decided by ENARGAS.131 Finally, the Respondent argues that the TAA was transferred to Petrobras for an undisclosed amount in 2004.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 40-50; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 810-816.\n\n443.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent's arguments to the effect that the TAA claim should not be admitted. The Claimants have not proven convincingly that the fees under the TAA are a form of delayed compensation and therefore should be included in computations of profitability or damages. While the Claimants' damages experts have included this claim in the losses suffered by the Claimants related companies,132 the TAA nor any other contemporaneous document show that the management fees were deferred compensation for Claimants' investment. To the contrary, Article 2.5 of the TAA refers to \"compensation for the *performance* by Enron Argentina of its obligations *hereunder* \" (emphasis added).\n\nLECG Expert Report of November 2005, para. 205; and of May 2005, para. 104.\n\n444.\n\nThe Tribunal must also note in reaching its conclusion in respect of this claim that the TAA was transferred to Petrobras on July 15, 2004, which transfer was approved by Enargas in 2004. Claimants refer to a \"transfer of the fee to Petrobras,\"133 but have not produced a copy of the transfer agreement nor have they quantified the amount that Petrobras would have paid for the transfer.\n\nClaimants' Reply, para. 673.\n\n*ii) PPI Damages*\n-----------------\n\n445.\n\nThe freeze of tariff adjustment in accordance with the US PPI for 2000 and 2001 also needs to be measured in the context of valuation. While the freeze also has effects after 2001, these are included in the damage arising from pesification.\n\n446.\n\nLECG has calculated the Claimants' damage arising from this claim in the amount of US$ 15.8 m. at December 2001. The Respondent contested this claim late in the proceedings in its second comments to the expert report (letter of 9 November 2006) by arguing that the existence of the agreements signed in January and June 2000 suspending PPI adjustments, although not challenged by the Claimants, was ignored. In addition, according to the Respondent, if any damage was to be awarded on this ground, it should only include marginal benefits derived from the July agreement.\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no merit in Respondent's arguments. TGS and other Licensees agreed on suspension of the PPI adjustments in January and June 2000 on the basis that the amounts not collected as a result of the suspension would be recouped later and with interests. With the abolition of the PPI adjustments by Law 25,561 such recouping is no longer available.\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondent has failed to provide an alternative calculation on the basis of its allegations. Thus, LECG calculation as used by the Tribunal's expert will be applied by this Tribunal in the determination of compensation.\n\n*C. The amount of overall compensation*\n---------------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nThe amount of equity damages in respect of the pesification of tariffs calculated of US$90.4 m. needs to be increased by the damages corresponding to the freeze of tariffs in accordance with the US PPI, calculated at US$15.8 m.\n\n450.\n\nIt follows that the damage for pesification US$90.4 m. plus the damage for freeze of tariffs US$15.8 m. results in a total amount of damages of US$106.2 m. As, for the reasons explained above, the Tribunal will not be considering compensation for the damages of the Technical Operator, this last figure is the total amount of damages awarded, subject only to the application of interest as determined below.\n\n*D. Interest*\n-------------\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimants' experts calculated the amount of damages at 31 December 2001 and then proceeded to update such value to the date of submission of their initial Report, *i.e.*, November 2004, using their WACC. In addition, the Claimants expressly requested the application of interest at \"commercially reasonable rates\" (*i.e.*, compound interest on a quarterly basis) through the date of the award so as to compensate for \"the time value of money and the lost opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return.\"134\n\nClaimants' Memorial, para. 378.\n\n452.\n\nWhile the experts' technical approach is many times used for the updating of a value, and was also suggested by the Tribunal's expert, the Tribunal believes that once the amount of damage and compensation has been determined at a given date it is more appropriate that such amount should bear interest as from such date. Moreover, any risk of double recovery is thereby avoided. The Tribunal will therefore order the payment of interest at the 6 month average LIBOR rate plus 2 per cent for each year, or proportion thereof, for the period beginning on January 1, 2002 and, as requested by the Claimants, until the date of dispatch of the Award. Interest shall be compounded semi-annually. The Tribunal considers this to be a reasonable interest for the period envisaged.\n\n*E. Costs*\n----------\n\n453.\n\nConsidering the decisions regarding the various issues in this case, each party shall bear the legal costs incurred by it in connection with the present arbitration and the arbitration costs shall be borne in equal shares by the parties.\n\nNOW THEREFORE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL DECIDES AND AWARDS AS FOLLOWS\n\n1. The Respondent breached its obligations to accord the investor the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty.\n\n2. The Respondent shall pay the Claimants compensation in the amount of US$106.2 million.\n\n3.

Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 11 April 2001, arbitration proceedings were instituted under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the ICSID Convention) in respect to a dispute between Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. (the Claimants) and the Argentine Republic (the Respondent).\n\n2.\n\nOn May 22, 2007, in accordance with Rule 48(1)(b) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) dispatched a certified copy of the English and Spanish versions of the Award (the Award) rendered in the present case on May 22, 2007 by the Tribunal composed of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna (President, Chile), Mr. Pierre-Yves Tschanz (Swiss), and Professor Albert Jan van de Berg (Dutch).\n\n3.\n\nOn June 25, 2007, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Centre received from the Claimants a Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision of the Award (the Request).\n\n4.\n\nOn July 5, 2007, the Centre received the prescribed lodging fee, and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic.\n\n5.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a), the Secretary-General registered the Request.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to present any observations it may have had in connection with the Request no later than July 31, 2007.\n\n7.\n\nOn July 31, 2007, the Respondent presented its observations on the Request.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3), the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not be necessary to meet with them to consider the Request, and that the Parties did not need to file additional documents either.\n\n**II. Relevant Provisions in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"(2) The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\"\n\n10.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 49(1) provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) Within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered, either party may request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or the rectification of, the award. Such a request shall be addressed in writing to the Secretary-General. The request shall:\n\n(a) identify the award to which it relates;\n\n(b) indicate the date of the request;\n\n(c) state in detail:\n\n(i) any question which, in the opinion of the requesting party, the Tribunal omitted to decide in the award; and\n\n(ii) any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified; and\n\n(d) be accompanied by a fee for lodging the request.\"\n\n**III. Considerations**\n-----------------------\n\n***A. Position of the Claimants***\n----------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision of the Award is based upon the premise that the Claimants have consistently requested throughout the arbitration proceeding that the Tribunal order the Respondent to compensate Claimants for all damages, including interest. In the Award, however, the Tribunal only awarded interest \"until the date of dispatch of the Award,\" thereby omitting any reference to post-award interest. Accordingly, \"the Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal rectify the Award and/or issue a supplementary decision clarifying that the portion of the Award ordering Argentina to pay interest on the amount awarded shall continue until the date the Award is paid.\"\n\n12.\n\nIn support of their Request, the Claimants explain that interest is an incidental or additional claim, which the Tribunal is bound to determine in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention. While \"compensatory\" or pre-award interest compensates a party for the loss of the use of money between the time of the damaging act and the date of the award, \"moratory\" or post-award interest compensates such loss from the date of the award until it is paid in full.\n\n13.\n\nIn addition to the current tendency of most countries to enact legislation empowering courts to award post-award interest, the International Law Commission (ILC), in Article 38(2) of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, expressly acknowledges that \"[i]nterest runs from the date when the principle sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\"1\n\n*Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001,* Report of the International Law Commission, *Yearbook of International Law Commission* 2001, approved by United Nations General Assembly, Fifty Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), Article 38(2).\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that the rules of most arbitral institutions empower an arbitral tribunal to order the payment of post-award interest, as this fully compensates the prevailing party, discourages frivolous appeals by the losing party and encourages the prompt implementation of the award.\n\n15.\n\nIn a review of modem case law, the Claimants contend that awards which include both compensatory and post-award interest are consistent with the jurisprudence of ICSID, UNCITRAL, ICC and many other tribunals, which have awarded postaward interest.2\n\nSee *PSEG Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award of January 19, 2007, available online at, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/pdf/ARB025-Award.pdf; *Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Ministry of Post, Tel. & Tel.,* \"a sum paid or payable as compensation for temporary withholding of money,\"3 the relief requested naturally included interest until the date of payment.\n\n*McCollough & Co., Inc. v. Ministry of Post, Tel. & Tel.,* 11 Iran-US Cl. Trib. Rep. 3, 28 n. 21 (citing cases).\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that a request for post-award interest was made in the Claimants\u2019 Opening Statement at the hearing on the merits, wherein counsel for the Claimants requested that the Tribunal:\n\n\"[I]ssue an award finding liability, awarding damages to claimants in the amount requested by claimants, updating the damages from the 2001 U.S. Dollar figure to date, add the cost [of] capital or appropriate interest rate and awarding arbitration costs to claimants.\"4\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 1, November 28, 2005, p. 84.\n\n18.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 understanding, while the request that damages be *updated* referred to pre-award interest, the additional request to add an *appropriate interest rate was* a clear reference to post-award interest.\n\n19.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants also contend that while there are two paragraphs in their Memorial which refer to pre-award interest,5 such reference was neither implicitly nor explicitly to the exclusion of the general \"interest\" claimed in the Prayers. A request for \"interest\" in general terms, the Claimants submit, has previously resulted in tribunals awarding post-award interest in addition to preaward interest,6 even in a case where only pre-award interest was requested.7\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, paras. 378, 382.\n\nSee *Tecmed* above; *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award of December 8, 2000, 41 ILM 896 (2002); *6 ICSID Rep.* 89 (2004).\n\nSee *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, available online at, http://www.asil.org/ilib/MTDvChile.pdf.\n\n20.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants submit that they consistently requested \"interest\", which by definition included both pre and post-award interest, and that the jurisprudence of comparable tribunals has concluded that post-award interest should be awarded even in cases in which the prevailing party only requested preaward interest.\n\n***B. Position of the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn the Observations of the Argentine Republic on Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision, Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Reject Claimants\u2019 Request, and\n\n(b) Order Claimants to pay all expenses and costs arising out of this proceeding.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent opposes Claimants\u2019 Request since in its view the Claimants seek to reopen a substantive debate about a matter already decided by the Tribunal. The specific rectification requested by the Claimants is not concerned with clerical, arithmetical or similar errors as envisaged by Article 49(2) of the Convention, least with minor technical errors of the kind addressed in various ICSID decisions confronted with rectification requests.8 Consequently, the Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 Request is inadmissible.\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification of the Award of October 12, 2005 issued on May 19, 2006; *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v.

In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Request purports to reopen a debate on a question pertaining to the merits that the Tribunal has already decided, and thus, the Request should be held inadmissible in the light of the applicable rules and ICSID jurisprudence on the matter.9\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA* above, paras. 18, 19, 25.\n\n24.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal previously decided the question and thus awarded interests until the date of the Award, as this is what had been requested by the Claimants. The issue of interest was specifically contemplated by the Tribunal,10 which stated its interpretation of the petitions made on the subject of interest, with which the Claimants are currently not in agreement.\n\nAward of May 22, 2007, paras. 352, 451, 452, and Relief, item 3.\n\n25.\n\nThe current case at bar, the Respondent contends, is not even a question of implicit consideration by the Tribunal, such as in the cases of *Genin11* and *Aguas del Aconquija,12* but involves an explicit and deliberate decision by the Tribunal to only award interest for the period prior to the Award.\n\n*Alex Genin and others v. Republic of Estonia,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Supplementary Decisions and Rectification of the Award of April 4, 2002, available online at, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/genin-sp.pdf, para. 14.\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA.* above, para. 17.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent provides the Tribunal with a number of ICSID cases where requests for rectification have been rejected on the ground that they went beyond the kind of error envisaged in Article 49(2) of the Convention, concerning issues of interpretation of the parties\u2019 positions in those cases, questions of evidence or an alleged misstatement of a point of law.13\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3); *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2); *Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1).\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimants\u2019 contention that a request for postaward interest was made in the Memorials or at the hearing on the merits. In its reading of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, the Respondent submits that the Claimants only requested pre-award interest,14 and not merely a \"brief mention\", as the Claimants now argue, but in a detailed manner. The Respondent emphasizes that post-award interest was not mentioned once in the Memorials, and that even if post-award interest is mandatory under United States law, as the Claimants put forth, this is irrelevant to an arbitration conducted under international law.\n\nMemorial, paras. 378, 382.\n\n28.\n\nThe interpretation the Claimants have given to their petition of interest in the Opening Statement at the hearing on the merits, as noted above in paragraph 17, is far from correct according to the Respondent. No distinction was made between pre and post-award interest, which the Respondent submits is further confirmed by the corrected English version of the transcript. The Claimants\u2019 discussion of an updating of damages until the date of the hearing, and the request to add to that amount \"an appropriate interest rate\", are related to the same petition, and not to different petitions on interest,15 just as it was put forth in the Claimants\u2019 Closing Statement at the hearing.16\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 1, November 28, 2005, p. 84.\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 9, December 8, 2005, p. 1470.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the current issue concerning post-award interest is negated by the fact that the Claimants did not request this type of interest and, as held in *Genin,* there can be no such omission in such circumstances. What was requested was decided, and whether the Claimants agree with the decision or not is certainly not a minor technical error of the kind provided for in Article 49(2) of the Convention.\n\n30.\n\nThe illustrative cases invoked by the Claimants where post-award interest was granted in spite of interest only being requested in general terms, or even one case where post-award interest was allowed in spite of only a pre-award interest request, are not, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, indicative that all tribunals should take the same view, nor that such awards are correct. The Respondent contends that the current case at bar is distinguishable because a request for interest in general terms was not made by the Claimants, but rather expressly requested only as pre-award interest.\n\n31.\n\nMoreover, for a tribunal to decide a question that has not been submitted to it will lead to an award which is *ultra petita,* and hence, subject to annulment on the ground that a tribunal has exceeded its powers. Along this same line, the Respondent highlights the Claimants\u2019 reference to the decision of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal which only awarded pre-award interest, as this is what had been requested by the Claimant.17 Accordingly, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 characterization of this decision as distinguishable from our case at bar and submits that this decision is highly relevant in our current discussion as the situation is identical.\n\n*Exxon, Corp. v. National Iranian Oil Co.* Case No. 154, Chamber Three, Award No. 322-154-3, Iran-US Cl. Trib., Award of 28 October 1987.\n\n32.\n\nWith regard to expenses and costs, given that the Respondent considers the Request to be inadmissible, the Respondent requests that the Claimants be held fully responsible for all expenses and costs arising out of the current proceeding.\n\n**IV. Findings of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes first to explain what was before it in the light of the pleadings, petitions and record of this case. The Prayers for Relief as made in both the Claimants\u2019 Memorial and Reply, requested, insofar as interest is concerned, that the Tribunal \"order that the Argentine Republic compensate Claimants for all damages they have suffered, plus interest compounded quarterly.\" The relief requested in the Request for Arbitration was worded in similar terms.18 These prayers did not specify whether the interest requested should be ordered until the date of the award or the date of payment of the compensation. In view of this fact, the Tribunal examined the explanations given by the Claimants for their request of interest as this context will usually provide the rationale for interpreting the Prayers for Relief. The record indeed provided additional information on the request for interest. Section VII.G-7, captioned \"Compound Interest\" opens with a paragraph as follows:\n\n\"Claimants are entitled to interest at commercially reasonable rates... Pre-award interest compensates a successful claimant for two forms of loss: the time value of money and the lost opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return.\"19\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 52(f).\n\nMemorial, para. 378\n\n34.\n\nThe last sentence of the last paragraph of this Section in the same Memorial (paragraph 382, just before the Prayer of Relief in paragraph 384) states:\n\n\"Pre-award interest in this case should be compounded quarterly through the date of the award.\"20\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 382.\n\n35.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply is silent on interest, except for a reference to Claimants\u2019 damages claim \"plus interest\"21 and a repetition of the Prayer for Relief \"plus interest compounded quarterly\".22\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, paras. 644, 678.\n\n*Ibid., para.* 680(2).\n\n36.\n\nNeither Claimants\u2019 Memorial nor their Reply mentions post-award interest.\n\n37.\n\nAnother source contained in the record to which the Tribunal also turned is the transcript of the hearing on the merits. The version of the transcript produced by the court reporter, Mr. David Kasdan, a most experienced professional, indicates that in their Opening Statement the Claimants requested that the Tribunal \"issue an award finding liability, awarding damages to claimants in the amount requested by claimants, updating the damages from the 2001 U.S. Dollar figures to date, add the cost ever [over, of] capital or appropriate interest rate and awarding arbitration costs to claimants.\"23\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 1, November 28, 2005, p. 84.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed out, however, that the version of the transcript corrected by the Claimants includes a correction to the effect that the damages should be updated from the 2001 U.S. Dollar figures to date, but deletes that the Tribunal should \"add\" the cost of capital or appropriate interest rate and inserts instead that such updating should be made \"at the cost [of] capital or an appropriate interest rate.\"24 This correction was in line with the conclusions of the Claimants in their Closing Statement, where it is requested \"... updating the damages from the dollar amounts in U.S. dollars of 2001 to the present date, using either the WACC or an appropriate interest rate...\"25\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 1, November 28, 2005, p. 84, corrected version, emphasis in the original correction.\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 9, December 8, 2005, p. 1470.\n\n39.\n\nAfter carefully examining these elements of the record, the Tribunal reached the conclusion contained in the Award to the effect that, as it had been requested, interest was awarded \"until the date of dispatch of the Award\".26\n\nAward para. 452 and Relief, item 3.\n\n***A. Findings of the Tribunal on the merits of the Request***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOn the basis of this background the Tribunal can now turn to the consideration of the rectification and supplementary decision requested by the Claimants on this matter.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal must note at the outset that it does not disagree with the Claimants\u2019 discussion of the role of interest in updating compensation and the value of money along a certain period of time, just as it does not disagree with the Claimants\u2019 view that tribunals have an inherent authority to recognize this role of interest, as confirmed by an extensive arbitration practice which the Claimants invoke. This recognition is normally effectuated by either using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) or interest.\n\n42.\n\nThe issue lies in a different proposition, namely whether this can be done by a tribunal in the absence of a request to that effect. The Tribunal concluded and now reiterates that, just as it must decide a matter that has been duly submitted and petitioned, the same is conversely true that this cannot be done if not requested, as this would amount to an excess of power which, as the Respondent explains, can result in a decision that is *ultra petita* and thus subject to the sanction of an annulment.\n\n43.\n\nIn this case it is quite evident that pre-award interest was expressly requested, but not so with respect to post-award interest. If not expressly requested, the next question for the Tribunal is whether post-award interest can be considered as having been impliedly requested.\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimants, as noted above, submit in their Request the distinction between \"compensatory\" and \"moratory\" interest, the first related to pre-award interest and the second to post-award interest. Assuming that such a distinction is to be retained, the fact is that interest in this case was requested only in the context of compensation, and thus falls squarely in the first category identified by Claimants. The updating of compensation to \"the present date\" as requested by Claimants can be understood, as the Respondent argues, until the date of the closing of the hearing, or at the most, as the Tribunal decided, until the date of dispatch of the Award in light of Claimants\u2019 reference to \"pre-award\" interest. It is definitely not related to a future date, as in that case it would have been for example indicated by referring to the date of complete payment of the Award.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal has also examined the text of the ILC\u2019s Article 38(2) of the Articles on State Responsibility, where, as the Claimants rightly recall, it is indicated that interest runs \"until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\"27 Yet, the Commentary to this Article explains that the actual calculation of interest by way of reparation, \"raises a complex of issues concerning...the terminal date (date of settlement agreement or award, date of actual payment)...\", and that there is no uniform approach to such issues. It is then concluded that \"[i]n practice the circumstances of each case and the conduct of the parties strongly affect the outcome.\"28\n\nSee *Articles* above.\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text, and Commentaries,* (ed., Cambridge University Press) (2002), Commentary 10 to Article 38(2), pp. 238-239.\n\n46.\n\nEqually pertinent is the explanation of the Commentary to the effect that:\n\n\"(12) Article 38 does not deal with post-judgment or moratory interest. It is only concerned with interest that goes to make up the amount that a court or tribunal should award, i.e. compensatory interest. The power of a court or tribunal to award post-judgment interest is a matter of its procedure.\"29\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 239.\n\n47.\n\nIt is apparent from the above that the ILC did not retain the distinction between compensatory and moratory interest in connection with Article 38(2) of the Articles and, therefore, the Article in question does not support the argument of the Claimants as to post-award interest in this context.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the reference made in both the Opening and Closing Statements to the updating of compensation should be understood as having included, and certainly not having excluded, a request for post-award interest. This is the context in which it was first stated in the original transcription that the Tribunal should \"add\" to such updating the cost of capital or an appropriate interest.\n\n49.\n\nAny doubt, however, has now been clarified by the corrections to which the Government of Argentina points out, where \"at\" was substituted for \"add\", thus reinforcing the view that either the WACC or an appropriate interest were conceived as an element of the updating until the \"present date\", not to follow that date. Even if this amendment of the record of the hearing was attributed to a clerical error, the Closing Statement made the same choice of words, thus showing that this was so stated by the Claimants.\n\n50.\n\nThe same conclusion holds true in light of the copies of the Powerpoint presentations the Claimants made in connection with both the Opening and the Closing Statements, in the last page of which it is requested as a Prayer that the Tribunal issue an Award \"...c. updating damages from 2001 USS to date at the cost of capital or an appropriate interest rate.\"\n\n51.\n\nThere was little room, if any at all, for the Tribunal to reach a conclusion different from that of the Award. There was no ground, as there is no ground now, to consider that the record contained an implied request for post-award interest.\n\n52.\n\nThe arbitral awards referred to by Claimants grant post-award interest because the claimants in those cases requested post-award interest. Amongst the numerous cases mentioned by Claimants there is only one case in which the arbitral tribunal awarded post-award interest although claimant had requested pre-award interest only.30 However, the arbitral award in that case offers no reasoning whatsoever why the tribunal was minded to grant the claimant more than it actually requested.\n\nSee *MTD* above.\n\n53.\n\nClaimants also refer to *Exxon, Corp. v. National Iranian Oil Co31* As Claimants rightly state, that case is not on point, inasmuch as the tribunal awarded interest only until the date of the award, although the claimant had requested post-award interest. Claimants, however, rely on the concurring opinion in that case by Judge Charles N. Brower, who indicated: \"Presumably this Claimant, like every other claimant, would prefer to recover interest to the date of actual payment.\" In light of the record of the case at bar, however, the Tribunal believes that it cannot arrive at its conclusions by second-guessing what a party might or not have preferred.\n\nSee *Exxon* above, Concurring Opinion of Judge Charles N. Brower, para. 4, as cited in Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision, Footnote 50.\n\n54.\n\nClaimants justify the mention of \"pre-award\" interest only by stating:\n\n\"The only reason Claimants mentioned pre-award interest specifically is because in the US, for example, judges have discretion to calculate a higher level of pre-judgment interest, whereas post-judgment interest is mandatory and set by statute (and thus, is not normally a matter that needs to be briefed and requested separately). Given this traditional distinction in certain domestic legislation, Claimants deemed it relevant specifically to mention pre-award interest, but this lone reference to pre-award interest was not to the exclusion of post-award interest, which would be an illogical construction of Claimants\u2019 Memorials and Prayers and the request in their opening statement.\"32\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision, Footnote 45.\n\n55.\n\nIt was mentioned before that the reference to \"pre-award\" interest is not a \"lone reference\" and that the Tribunal infers the opposite from Claimants\u2019 written and oral submissions. Claimants\u2019 written and oral submissions do not mention or indicate in any manner that Claimants\u2019 reference to pre-award interest is made for reasons of domestic law. International arbitrators, deciding on the basis of the ICSID Convention over a BIT claim, cannot be required to presume that a claimant addresses interest from that perspective.\n\n***B. Conclusions of the Tribunal***\n------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nInsofar as the Request concerns a request for a supplementary decision, the Tribunal must conclude that there was no claim, either express or implied and within the meaning of Article 46 (\"incidental or accidental claims\") of the ICSID Convention or otherwise, for post-award interest, and hence none could be awarded.\n\n57.\n\nInsofar as the Request concerns a request for rectification, the Tribunal does not consider that there was a clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the Award. Even if the Claimants could establish that there was an error, which they have not, such error, as the Respondent has noted, would by no means be a minor technical error of the kind envisaged by Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. While the Respondent has petitioned that such request be declared inadmissible on this ground, the Tribunal does not consider this to be appropriate as the Claimants are entitled to have their views examined.\n\n58.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have not succeeded in this proceeding, the Tribunal is of the view that they believed in good faith that there was room for elucidation of an aspect of the Award in respect of which they had a different understanding. Accordingly, the Tribunal will order that each party bears its own legal costs, but that the Claimants pay in full the costs of this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Centre and the Members of the Tribunal.\n\n**V.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 February 2008, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application in writing (the \"Application for Annulment\") requesting the annulment of the Award of 22 May 2007 (the \"Award\"), rendered by the tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") in the arbitration proceeding between Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. (the \"Claimants\") and Argentina.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for Annulment was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), having regard to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and considering that on 25 October 2007, the Tribunal rendered its decision on a request by the Claimants under that provision for rectification and/or a supplementary decision of the Award.\n\n3.\n\nIn the Application for Annulment, Argentina seeks annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(b) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(c) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n4.\n\nThe Application for Annulment also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n5.\n\nThe Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 7 March 2008, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., a national of Australia, Judge Patrick L. Robinson, a national of Jamaica, and Judge Per Tresselt, a national of Norway. On the same date the parties were informed that Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn 18 June 2008, the Claimants filed a request to lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the award, or alternatively, to condition a continuation of the stay on Argentina's posting adequate security (the \"Claimants' Request\"). By letter of 20 June 2008, the Committee invited Argentina to submit its written observations on the Claimants' Request no later than 7 July 2008. By the same letter, the Committee confirmed that the oral arguments on this matter would take place during the first session and informed the parties that the Committee would make a decision on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n8.\n\nBy a letter dated 30 June 2008, the Committee asked the parties whether they would agree to retain the services of an assistant, Dr. Christopher Staker, in addition to the Secretary of the Committee. Argentina and the Claimants agreed to Dr. Staker's appointment by letters dated 2 and 8 July 2008, respectively.\n\n9.\n\nIn compliance with the Committee's instructions, on 7 July 2008, Argentina filed its observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"Argentina's Observations\").\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as scheduled with the agreement of the parties, on 14 July 2008, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris. Prior to the start of the session, the Secretariat distributed to the parties copies of the declarations, signed by each Member of the Committee, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2). During the first session, several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. Subsequently, the parties addressed the Committee with their respective arguments concerning the question of the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award. During the session, the Committee put questions to the parties, and offered the parties an opportunity to file within fourteen days certain additional materials on which they sought to rely. At the same time, the Committee decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until it had taken a decision.\n\n11.\n\nBy a letter dated July 25, 2008 with attachments, Argentina presented certain additional materials and information to the Committee.\n\n12.\n\nBy a letter dated 28 July 2008 with attachments, the Claimants in turn presented certain additional materials and information to the Committee.\n\n13.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication, and have taken into consideration the parties' entire written and oral arguments and submissions on the matter.\n\n**B. The parties' contentions**\n-------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAs outlined above, the Claimants have requested that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention be lifted, or alternatively, that if the Committee continues the stay, it be conditioned on Argentina's providing financial security. The Claimants' Request argued, *inter alia* :\n\n(a) that prior ICSID annulment committees have determined that a primary factor to consider when evaluating whether to continue a stay is whether the State seeking annulment will promptly comply with the award if it is not annulled;1\n\n(b) that there is a substantial risk that Argentina will not comply voluntarily with the Award if its Application for Annulment is unsuccessful and that it will use the period of the continued stay to divert assets that would otherwise be available to the Claimants to satisfy the Award, as:\n\n(i) senior executive and judicial officers and the Attorney General have stated that Argentina will not comply voluntarily with ICSID awards, but will challenge them before the International Court of Justice or before the Argentine courts;\n\n(ii) in particular, notwithstanding that Argentina has an obligation under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention to pay voluntarily ICSID award rendered against it, Argentina has erroneously taken the position that an investor seeking recognition or enforcement of an ICSID award against Argentina must, pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, follow the procedures under Argentine law for the enforcement of final judgments;\n\n(iii) despite the letter of undertaking that Argentina submitted in the *CMS* annulment proceedings, Argentina had still not paid the award in that case nine months after the decision of the *ad hoc* committee, and even diverted funds away from New York after CMS was granted a temporary restraining order by a United States court;\n\n(iv) there is grave doubt as to the enforceability in Argentina of ICSID awards pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, since while under Argentine law international treaties are superior to local laws, they are (save for certain human rights treaties) subordinate to the Argentine Constitution, and a recent Argentine Supreme Court decision2 supports the doctrine that Argentine Courts may review and vacate ICSID awards; and\n\n(v) despite its strong economic recovery, Argentina remains in default of its international financial obligations and is deemed a credit risk by major credit evaluation agencies;\n\n(c) that given that a stay of enforcement interferes with the investor's right to an immediately payable and enforceable award:\n\n(i) such a stay is an extraordinary measure not to be granted lightly,\n\n(ii) there is a negative presumption with regard to a stay of enforcement; and\n\n(iii) Argentina bears the burden of proving that a stay of enforcement of the Award is required;\n\n(d) that scholarly commentary and many ICSID *ad hoc* committees make clear that the posting of security when a provisional stay is continued is a \"counterbalancing right\" to the negative effect of the stay on the award creditor;3\n\n(e) that Argentina will not suffer irreparable harm if the stay of enforcement is discontinued or if it is required to post security given its economic recovery, and that Argentina clearly has the resources to post security;\n\n(f) that security is generally considered a remedy granted to the award creditor during an annulment process to ensure that the creditor does not suffer additional damages if enforcement of the award is stayed during the course of the annulment proceeding;\n\n(g) that a continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award without security would harm the Claimants since:\n\n(i) this would prevent payment of the compensation awarded to the Claimants, which was due on the date that the Award was dispatched to the parties;\n\n(ii) the Tribunal did not grant the Claimants post-award interest and the value of the Award will therefore continue to decline for every day that it is not paid;\n\n(iii) the Claimants have already initiated enforcement procedures in the United States prior to the coming into effect of the provisional stay, and would be prejudiced by a continued stay of those efforts already initiated;\n\n(h) that any argument that security would place the Claimants in a \"better position\" than if annulment had not been sought is erroneous and has been consistently rejected since it was advanced in the *MINE* case;4 and\n\n(i) that Argentina faces no risk of non-recoupment if the award is annulled, given the Claimants' proposal that if the stay is lifted any amounts recovered be held in escrow pending a decision on the Application for Annulment, or that if the stay is continued on condition of the provision of security by Argentina, the security be held in escrow pending a decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\nThe Claimants referred to *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution, June 1, 2005 (\"MTD Stay Decision\") \u00b6 29; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Hidronor,* Fallos 327-1881.\n\nThe Claimants referred *inter alia* to C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2001) at 1058 \u00b6 478, 1060 \u00b6\u00b6 483-4; P.D.

Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Interim Order No. 1 on Guinea's Application for Stay of Enforcement of the Award, August 12, 1988 (\"MINE Stay Decision\") \u00b6 22.\n\n15.\n\nArgentina opposed the Claimants' Request and sought a continuance of the stay of enforcement without any requirement for the provision of security by Argentina. Argentina's Observations *inter alia* argued:\n\n(a) that no *ad hoc* committee in any case has failed to grant a stay of enforcement of the award pending annulment proceedings;\n\n(b) that requiring a guarantee to maintain the stay of enforcement of the award is contrary to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, as well as to its spirit, and that no provision of the ICSID Convention allows conditioning the stay of enforcement of the Award on the posting of a guarantee;\n\n(c) that failure to stay enforcement of the award would cause harm to Argentina, which is a developing country with high rates of poverty, extreme poverty and social exclusion, and where despite the improved economic situation the effects of the recent economic crisis are still visible;\n\n(d) that failure to stay enforcement of the award would cause harm to the investment arbitration system under the ICSID Convention, as it would make an award full of irregularities enforceable;\n\n(e) that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Claimants to recover the amount of the Award if it were annulled, given Enron's bankruptcy;\n\n(f) that the Claimants cannot argue that a continuation of the stay would cause the Claimants harm as this is a remedy specifically provided for in the ICSID Convention;\n\n(g) that the Tribunal did not grant the Claimants post-award interest because the Claimants did not request it, and that Argentina should not have to bear the consequences of the Claimants' failure to do so;\n\n(h) that in the Argentine legal system, Argentina's international obligations, including awards issued by ICSID tribunals, have supremacy over laws enacted by Congress, and this is an adequate guarantee of compliance with the Award in the event that it is not annulled;\n\n(i) that Argentina has historically complied with decisions of international tribunals;\n\n(j) that the text of the ICSID Convention does not provide for the possibility of requiring a party seeking annulment to post a guarantee, that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention indicate that its negotiators dismissed a proposal to empower an *ad hoc* committee to require the posting of security as a condition for granting a stay, and that previous ICSID cases have incorrectly imported such a possibility from commercial arbitration practice;\n\n(k) that requiring a party to a dispute to provide a guarantee would impair the effective use of the protection contained in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention in the event of an irregular award, especially in the case of developing countries, while there is no doubt that in the absence of an award annulment system States would not have ratified the ICSID Convention;\n\n(l) that previous ICSID cases in which security has been made a condition of a continuation of a stay of enforcement had characteristics that this case does not have;\n\n(m) that no matter how a bank guarantee is provided, its provision would be detrimental to Argentina, since the commission that a bank would charge for providing such a guarantee would be exorbitant, and the freezing of the amount of the Award during the annulment proceeding would be detrimental to Argentina;\n\n(n) that requiring a guarantee as a condition for continuing a stay of enforcement would place the Claimants in a much more favourable position than they are now, and than they were prior to the filing of the Application for Annulment;\n\n(o) that the provision of a guarantee would penalise the party that applies for annulment;\n\n(p) that the posting of a bank guarantee is unnecessary since the Argentine domestic legal system already guarantees compliance with the Award;\n\n(q) that Argentina has not failed to comply with the award in the *CMS* case, since:\n\n(i) Article 53 of the ICSID Convention does not establish an obligation of voluntary payment by Argentina;\n\n(ii) under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, award creditors must meet the formal requirements that any person should follow in Argentina to obtain compliance with a final judgment of a local court; and\n\n(iii) CMS refused to follow that procedure; and\n\n(r) that the Claimants have presented no new fact that was not previously argued by the claimant in the *Azurix* Stay Decision,5 in which the *ad hoc* committee ordered a continuation of the stay of enforcement without any condition of security.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, December 28, 2007 (\"Azurix Stay Decision\").\n\n16.\n\nAs noted above, Argentina and the Claimants supplemented their written filings with oral submissions on 14 July 2008, and both parties subsequently provided additional materials and information.\n\n**C. Relevant ICSID Convention Articles and ICSID Arbitration Rules**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nArticle 27(1) of the ICSID Convention states:\n\n*No Contracting State shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.*\n\n18.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n*(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n19.\n\nArticles 53 to 55 of the ICSID Convention provide:\n\n***Article 53***\n\n*(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n*(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.*\n\n***Article 54***\n\n*(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.*\n\n*(2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.*\n\n*(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.*\n\n***Article 55***\n\n*Nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.*\n\n20.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules applies to the present case and provides:\n\n***Stay of Enforcement of the Award***\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.*\n\n**D. The BIT**\n--------------\n\n21.\n\nArticle VII of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment6 (the \"BIT\") provides, in relevant part:\n\n*ARTICLE VII*\n\n\u2026\n\n*2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.*\n\n*3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to**consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:*\n\n*(i) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such convention:...*\n\n\u2026\n\n*6. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement.*\n\n\u2026\n\nSigned 14 November 1991; entered into force 20 October 1994.\n\n**E. The Committee's views**\n----------------------------\n\n***(i) Applicable principles***\n-------------------------------\n\n***(a) Whether a stay may be subject to conditions***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe use of the word \"may\" in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention makes clear that it is a matter within the discretion of the *ad hoc* committee whether or not to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision on an application for annulment.\n\n23.\n\nHowever, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules expressly states whether an *ad hoc* committee may, in the exercise of this discretion, grant a request for a stay subject to conditions, such as a condition that the party seeking the stay provide security for the enforcement of the award in the event that annulment is not granted.\n\n24.\n\nIn previous decisions, *ad hoc* committees have proceeded on the basis that they may do so, and indeed on several occasions have done so. However, previous decisions have merely assumed that an *ad hoc* committee has the power to grant a stay subject to conditions. Given that the existence of such a power is expressly disputed by Argentina in this case, the Committee considers that it must carefully examine the question. Having considered the arguments and authorities of the parties, the Committee concludes as follows.\n\n25.\n\nThe terms of the ICSID Convention are the source of the Committee's power to modify or grant a stay. The question whether the Committee can make a stay conditional on the provision of security is therefore a matter of interpretation of that Convention. In its interpretation of the ICSID Convention, the Committee is guided by Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\").7 These provisions reflect the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation as they already existed at the time that the text of the ICSID Convention was adopted.8 It is therefore immaterial to the interpretation of the ICSID Convention whether or not a particular Contracting State to the ICSID Convention is also a party to the Vienna Convention. Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention state:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.*\n\nVienna, May 23, 1969; 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\nE.g., *Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia / Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002,* p. 625, at pp. 645-646, para. 37.\n\n26.\n\nAs to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the Committee notes that the text of the ICSID Convention is silent on the question whether or not an *ad hoc* committee can make a stay conditional on the provision of security. The Committee does not view that silence as necessarily meaning that the power does not exist. The Committee considers that a discretionary power to allow or deny a remedy may implicitly include a power to allow the remedy subject to conditions,9 and that such an interpretation would be consistent with the objects and purposes of Article 52(5), which is designed to enable the *ad hoc* committee to balance the rights of the parties pending annulment proceedings.\n\nCompare MTD Stay Decision \u00b6 26; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 35: \"Since a stay is not automatic, the [Committee] could grant the request subject to conditions, including a condition that an appropriate bond be provided\".\n\n27.\n\nAs regards Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, the Committee notes that *ad hoc* committees have previously been called upon to exercise their power under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention on eleven known occasions.10 On each of those occasions, a continuation of the stay was ordered. On five of those occasions, the continuation of the stay was ordered on condition that the State seeking the stay provided security for the payment of the award in the event that annulment was not granted, in the form of a bank guarantee.11 On five of those occasions, a continuation of the stay was ordered without any such condition.12 On one of those occasions, the parties agreed that the State seeking a stay would post a bank guarantee in exchange for a waiver of the right by the award creditor to bring enforcement proceedings pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings.13\n\n(1) *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

As noted above, the existence of this power has generally merely been assumed. In only one of the previous decisions is it indicated that the State seeking the stay had argued that the Committee had no power to include a condition of security,14 and in that instance the *ad hoc* committee did not decide the question, but declined for other reasons to make security a condition.15 From this the Committee considers it likely that in the other ten previous decisions, the States concerned did not argue that the *ad hoc* committee lacked the power to include a condition of security, or at least, did not argue this forcefully or as a primary argument.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 20\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.\n\n29.\n\nAdditionally, of the five previous decisions in which the *ad hoc* committee included a requirement of security, it appears that in three of these cases the requisite security was in fact provided by the State concerned,16 while in two of these cases the State did not provide the security, and the *ad hoc* committee consequently terminated the stay.17 The Committee further takes into account that although there are now eleven decisions given over a period of more than a decade proceeding on the basis that an *ad hoc* committee may require security as a condition of a stay, the Committee has not been pointed to any other instance in which an ICSID Contracting State has expressed concern in any forum that these decisions in this respect exceed the *ad hoc* committee's power under Article 52(5).\n\nCompliance by Indonesia with the condition of security in the Amco I Stay Decision is noted in Amco I Annulment Decision \u00b6 8. Compliance by Indonesia with the condition of security in the Amco II Stay Decision is noted in *Amco Asia Corporation and others v.

Article VI of the New York Convention states: \"If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been made to a competent authority referred to in article V(1)(e), the authority before which the award is sought to be relied upon may, if it considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the award and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award, order the other party to give suitable security.\"\n\n31.\n\nThe Committee finds that it is not clear why the power to recommend provisional measures contained in the Preliminary Draft was omitted from later drafts. Nor is it clear why the ICSID Convention differs in this respect from the New York Convention. The Committee notes that the power of a Tribunal to order provisional measures, contained in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, is not included in the list in Article 52(4) of provisions that are applicable *mutatis mutandis* in annulment proceedings. On the other hand, the Committee notes that ICSID Arbitration Rule 53 appears to be sufficiently broadly worded to confer on an *ad hoc* committee the power to recommend provisional measures, contained in ICSID Arbitration Rule 39. On the basis of the limited material before it, the Committee is not satisfied that the effect of the differences between the final text of Article 52(5) on the one hand, and the Preliminary Draft and New York Convention on the other, is to exclude the possibility of an *ad hoc* committee requiring security as a condition of a stay. Even if it were the case that an *ad hoc* committee lacks the power under Article 47 to recommend provisional measures, a matter which the Committee finds that it is not called upon to decide, this would not mean that Article 52(5) must be interpreted one way rather than another. The Committee merely notes that, contrary to what is suggested by Argentina, the lack of a power to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 could arguably support the conclusion that Article 52(5) must be given a broader, rather than a narrower interpretation, since the *ad hoc* committee's power to balance the rights of the parties pending the annulment proceedings would depend solely on Article 52(5).\n\n32.\n\nUnder Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, in addition to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, recourse may also be had to other supplementary means of interpretation, as is clear from the word \"including\" in that provision. The Committee considers that amongst other supplementary means of interpretation are jurisprudence, including decisions and awards of ICSID tribunals and *ad hoc* committees, and doctrine.\n\n33.\n\nAs regards previous ICSID decisions, as noted above, in ten out of the eleven previous decisions under Article 52(5), the *ad hoc* committee proceeded on the basis that it had the power to include a condition of security, while the other previous decision left this question open. Although the previous decisions may not have examined the question in any detail, and may not constitute a subsequent practice for the purposes of Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, the Committee considers that weight must nonetheless be given to the fact that there is now what amounts to a *jurisprudence constante* to the effect that a stay may be made conditional on the provision of security. While the Committee is not bound by these previous decisions, it considers that it should take into account the possible effect on the stability and predictability of the ICSID system if it were to depart from a consistent line of previous decisions.\n\n34.\n\nAs regards doctrine, the Committee has not been referred to any publicist expressing the view that there is no power under Article 52(5) to make a stay conditional on security; on the contrary, the Committee has been referred to doctrine affirming the existence of this power.21\n\nSchreuer (*op. cit*) at 1060 \u00b6\u00b6 483-484.\n\n35.\n\nHaving regard to all of these matters, the Committee finds that under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention it may make a continuation of a stay of enforcement conditional on the provision of security by the party requesting the stay.\n\n36.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that where a stay of enforcement is requested under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, three alternative outcomes are possible. First, the *ad hoc* committee could decide not to grant the request. Secondly, the *ad hoc* committee could decide to grant the request subject to the provision of security or to compliance with some other condition by the party requesting the stay. Thirdly, the *ad hoc* committee could decide to grant the request unconditionally.\n\n37.\n\nThe Committee will therefore proceed to consider which of these three outcomes is required in this case, having regard to all of the circumstances. In contrast perhaps to *ad hoc* committees in previous decisions, the Committee does not adopt the approach of considering first whether a stay should be ordered, and only then, if that question is answered affirmatively, of considering whether the stay should be subject to a condition of security. This is because the question whether or not security will be provided is itself one of the circumstances that must be taken into account with other relevant circumstances in determining whether the stay should continue.22 The Committee considers that for this reason, the issue of continuation of the stay and the issue of security must inherently be considered together.\n\nCompare MINE Stay Decision \u00b6 26.\n\n***(b) Factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the Committee's discretion***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 52(5) provides no express guidance on the matters to be taken into account in the exercise of the Committee's discretion under that provision, or on the relative weight that they should be given. As one *ad hoc* committee has said:\n\n*No indication is given as to what kind of circumstances require a stay; therefore the Committee is free to evaluate the arguments of the Parties in view of the particularities of each case*.23\n\nNevertheless, mindful that the discretion must not be exercised arbitrarily, the Committee considers that it must first seek to identify what considerations are relevant in the application of Article 52(5). For this purpose, the Committee has taken into account previous decisions of *ad hoc* committees under Article 52(5). The Committee notes however that these previous decisions, to the extent that they merely apply Article 52(5) to the circumstances of a particular case, are of less assistance than a line of previous decisions which consistently affirm a legal principle or rule.24\n\nMitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 23; also CDC Stay Decision \u00b6 8.\n\nCompare Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6 24; Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 23.\n\n39.\n\nEither party to an ICSID dispute has the right to request annulment of an award pursuant to Article 52. Article 52(1) sets out the limited grounds upon which annulment may be sought, which are directed to defined grave injustices. Article 52 of the ICSID Convention is an integral part of the ICSID dispute settlement regime to which all Contracting States have agreed, and without this safeguard some States parties might not have accepted the ICSID Convention.25\n\nMitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 40.\n\n40.\n\nWhile it is the case that until recently annulment proceedings have been infrequent, they should not be regarded as *per se* exceptional so as to create a presumption against a stay of enforcement, or in favour of conditioning any stay on the provision of security.26 The systemic importance of the annulment procedure is not obviated or reduced in its application simply because a party to a specific case has sought annulment, or because a Contracting State has generally stated an intention to seek annulment of other or all adverse ICSID determinations to which it is a party.27\n\nCompare Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6 31.\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6 31.\n\n41.\n\nFurthermore, Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award* *except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed**pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention* [emphasis added].\n\nAs was observed in the *Azurix* Stay Decision, the ICSID Convention thereby explicitly recognizes that the award creditor's rights are subject to a stay if an *ad hoc* committee considers that the circumstances so require. The Committee agrees that the award creditor's rights are to this extent themselves qualified *by the Convention*. The Committee therefore does not accept the argument that because a stay interferes with the award creditor's right to payment of an award, a stay of enforcement under Article 52(5) should be regarded as exceptional or, if ordered, should normally be counterbalanced by a condition of security.28\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n42.\n\nThe Committee further finds it significant that a stay of enforcement of the award pending annulment proceedings has been granted in all cases in which it has been requested. The Committee also notes that under some but by no means all national laws a stay of enforcement pending an appeal from a judicial decision is almost automatic.29\n\nCompare Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 28.\n\n43.\n\nThese several considerations lead the Committee to conclude that upon an application for annulment, in general, a requested stay should be granted under Article 52(5) if requested, unless the Committee finds that there are very exceptional circumstances why this should not occur, notwithstanding the possibility of making the stay conditional on the provision of security.30\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6 22.\n\n44.\n\nOn the other hand, as there is no requirement in the Convention that security be provided as a condition for a stay, the Committee does not accept that an award creditor has a \"counterbalancing right\" to security in any case where a continuation of a stay is ordered.31 In this regard, the Committee also is in agreement with the *Azurix* Stay Decision that to require that security be provided as a matter of course in all but the exceptional case would risk compromising the important confidence-balancing function for Contracting States served by the annulment procedure.32 Where a State is the applicant for annulment, a further relevant factor for the Committee is that, because security ordinarily would only be sought against a developing country, it would risk introducing into the ICSID system the unacceptable suggestion of discrimination between States, whether *de jure* or *de facto*, as to terms for security imposed on Article 52(5) applications.33 The absence of any presumption in favour of a condition of security is perhaps confirmed by the fact that of the eleven known previous decisions granting a stay under Article 52(5), a condition of security was imposed in five and agreed by the parties in one, while in the other five a request for such a condition was not granted.\n\nSee Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6 31.\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6 32; also Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 40.\n\n45.\n\nNor does the Committee accept the contention that a general requirement for security in return for a stay is desirable as a means of deterring frivolous or dilatory annulment applications,34 given that any such general requirement would penalise all applications, whether frivolous or dilatory or not.35\n\nCompare CDC Stay Decision \u00b6 20 quoting Schreuer (*op. cit*) at 1060 \u00b6 484 (to the effect that security \"may... serve as a possible deterrent to requests for annulment that are motivated primarily by a desire to delay and, possibly, to avoid compliance\"); Repsol Stay Decision \u00b6 9.\n\nCompare Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 40.\n\n46.\n\nIn deciding an application under Article 52(5), the Committee considers that it must consider all of the circumstances of a case as a whole, and that a number of circumstances cumulatively may lead to a particular conclusion, even if none of those circumstances alone would have necessarily done so.36 The Committee is of the view that relevant considerations include the following.\n\nCompare MINE Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28; Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 28; CDC Stay Decision \u00b6 22.\n\n47.\n\nThe fact that an annulment application is dilatory may be a circumstance militating against a continuation of a stay,37 as may the fact that an application for a stay is dilatory.38 However, in the absence of particular reasons and evidence for concluding otherwise, the Committee must assume that any application for annulment is made in good faith, and that the application for a stay is a justified exercise of the applicant's procedural rights of defence.39\n\nMitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 26; MTD Stay Decision \u00b6 28.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 17.\n\nCompare MINE Stay Decision \u00b6 17; MTD Stay Decision \u00b6 28; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 37.\n\n48.\n\nFurthermore, unless there is some indication that the annulment application is dilatory, it is not for the Committee to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to succeed.40\n\nMitchell Stay Decision \u00b6 26; CDC Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; MTD Stay Decision \u00b6 28; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 37.\n\n49.\n\nIn the *MTD* Stay Decision and *CMS* Stay Decision it was said that a respondent seeking a remedy under the Convention should demonstrate for its part that it will comply with the Convention, and that if there is any doubt in that regard the *ad hoc* committee may order the provision of a bank guarantee as a condition of a stay.41 In this regard the Committee is more attracted to the approach under which the relevant enquiry is whether in all the circumstances it may be said that there is sufficient doubt as to whether there will be compliance with ICSID Convention obligations on a final award in the event that it is not annulled. The Committee also agrees with the *Azurix* Stay Decision that there is no positive obligation on the applicant for the stay to establish the absence of doubt, but rather, that it is for the party opposing the stay to establish the circumstances of sufficient doubt.42 The *Azurix* Stay Decision referred to some examples of circumstances which might suffice to establish such doubt.43 A failure by a State seeking annulment to put in place laws implementing the obligations under Article 54(1) may be one factor giving rise to such doubts. So might other factors, such as a party seeking annulment making it clear in one way or another that it will not comply with its obligations under a final award.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 29; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 38.\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6 37.\n\nAzurix Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 39, 44.\n\n50.\n\nDifficulty, in the event that the award is annulled, of recoupment of amounts paid under the award, or of security provided, may be a factor militating in favour of a stay, or against the provision of security.44 However, if there are legitimate concerns as to the risk of non-recoupment, the Committee should also consider whether these concerns can be addressed by the inclusion of appropriate conditions for the continuation or non-continuation of a stay, such as a condition that any recovered moneys or security provided be held in escrow pending the annulment proceedings.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28; Wena Stay Decision \u00b6 7(a); Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28; CDC Stay Decision \u00b6 18; MTD Stay Decision \u00b6 29; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 38.\n\n51.\n\nThe hardship to an award debtor of providing security, either because of the cost of obtaining a bank guarantee or the consequences of freezing the amount due for the duration of the annulment proceedings, is a further reason why security should not be ordered as a matter of course.45 However, if there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the award in the future the Committee considers that hardship to the party seeking the stay should not normally be a factor of significance, any more than hardship could be a factor excusing non-compliance with the award itself if not annulled.46 Nevertheless, it may be admitted that exceptional circumstances (such as has been suggested where the provision of security would have \"\u2018catastrophic', immediate and irreversible consequences\" for a party's ability to conduct its affairs,47 or would *severely* affect the interests of the party48) might be a matter that can be taken into account with other relevant factors.\n\nCompare MINE Stay Decision \u00b6 22; Mitchell Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 42.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 27.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 27.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 28.\n\n52.\n\nThe Committee's approach is further that hardship to the award creditor should not normally be a factor of significance where there is no established serious risk of non-compliance with the award by the award debtor in the future, or other reason militating in favour of a condition of security. As noted above, because Article 52(5) expressly provides that an award creditor's rights are subject to a stay if an *ad hoc* committee considers that the circumstances so require, the postponement of the right to payment of the award caused by a stay cannot, by definition, *per se* constitute prejudice.49 Indeed, a condition of security will often place the award creditor in a better position than it would have been in if annulment proceedings had not been brought, since the award creditor would not otherwise have had the benefit of such security.50 However, the Committee does not exclude the possibility that in exceptional circumstances sufficient prejudice to the award creditor beyond mere delay may be shown.51\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 36 and CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 50 (noting that delay caused by a stay is \"incidental to the Convention system of annulment\"); Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.

None of the previous eleven decisions under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention has addressed this issue.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants argue that under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention and Article VII(6) of the BIT, Argentina has an obligation to pay an award voluntarily, and that Argentina erroneously takes the position that award creditors must initiate procedures under Article 54 and present an award to an Argentine local court. According to the Claimants, it is only when a State has already failed to comply with and is already in default of its obligation under Article 53 that it may be necessary for an award creditor to resort to enforcement proceedings under Article 54. The Claimants contend that Article 54 provides award creditors with the possibility of enforcing awards against recalcitrant award debtors, and that Article 54 is not the normal means of enforcement of an award.\n\n56.\n\nArgentina on the other hand takes the position that Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention complement each other and have to be read in conjunction. According to Argentina, Article 53 of the ICSID Convention establishes the final and binding nature of ICSID Awards while Article 54 establishes the way in which ICSID Awards have to be complied with. Argentina submits that Article 53 of the ICSID Convention \"does not establish an obligation of *voluntary* payment by the State\".55 Rather, it is said that under Article 54, Argentina is required to treat an ICSID award as if it were a final judgment of a court in Argentina. This means that to receive payment, an award creditor has to comply with the same formalities applicable to final judgments of local courts.56\n\nArgentina's Observations \u00b6 116 (emphasis in original).\n\nTranscript of the hearing of July 14, 2008 (\"Transcript\"), pp. 89-92.\n\n57.\n\nArgentina submits that the obligation of a State under Article 54 to treat an ICSID award as if it were a final judgment of a court of that State means that if a State pays final judgments rendered against it without the need for further action by the judgment creditor, it is obliged under Article 54 to do the same in respect of ICSID awards given against it. On the other hand, if under the law of a particular State there is a formality to be complied with by a judgment creditor in order to enforce a judgment given against that State, then an ICSID award creditor has to follow the same procedure to enforce an ICSID award given against that State.57\n\nTranscript, pp. 97-99.\n\n58.\n\nArgentina claims that it has appointed its administrative courts as the authority to be appointed under Article 54(2) of the ICSID Convention, so that the procedure would be for an award creditor of an ICSID award given against Argentina to take the award before the appointed court. However, Argentina maintains that the procedure would thereafter be an administrative procedure rather than a judicial procedure, which would entail the Congress being asked to appropriate funds in order to pay the award.58 Argentina submits that even where a person has a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Argentina, it is necessary to comply with the process of appropriation of funds, unless the case is one for which funds have already been appropriated,59 and that many States have such a process for payment of final local judgments.60 Argentina adds that in principle Congress has a legal obligation to appropriate the necessary funds, but that there might be situations where sufficient funds were not available during the current budgetary term, so that an appropriation would be made for the following term.61\n\nTranscript, pp. 95-97.\n\nTranscript, pp. 97-98.\n\nTranscript, p. 99.\n\nTranscript, pp. 98-99.\n\n59.\n\nThe parties produced to the Committee certain correspondence from Argentina which confirms that Argentina has taken the same position in other ICSID cases. Thus, while the Claimants argue that Argentina has failed to pay the award in the *CMS* case62 ten months after the *CMS* Annulment Decision63 was given, Argentina denies that it failed to comply with its obligations under the ICSID Convention in that case. According to Argentina, CMS \"refused to follow the procedure provided for in the Argentine Republic for compliance with final judgements, and the company has simply demanded that the money be transferred to an account abroad\".64\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award, May 12, 2005.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 25, 2007.\n\nArgentina's Observations \u00b6 119\n\n60.\n\nIn addressing this difference between the Parties, the Committee will first consider the effect of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, and will then consider the effect of Article VII(6) of the BIT, the latter treaty having been concluded after the ICSID Convention. In addressing the disputed interpretation to be given to these provisions, the Committee is again guided by the principles in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n*The effect of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention states that \"Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\". The first sentence of Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention states that \"Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\". The Committee notes that nothing in the language of these provisions suggests that these two obligations are related, and in particular, that there is nothing in the language to suggest that the obligation in the second sentence of Article 53(1) must be read as being subject to an award creditor invoking enforcement mechanisms established pursuant to the obligation in the first sentence of Article 54(1).\n\n62.\n\nThe Committee further notes that these two obligations are addressed to different subjects. It is clear from its context that the word \"party\" in the second sentence of Article 53(1) refers to a party to an award, who will be, on the one hand, a Contracting State or a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, and, on the other hand, a national of another Contracting State. That provision therefore expressly requires each party to an award to \"comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\". On the other hand, the first sentence of Article 54(1) is addressed to \"each Contracting State\" to the ICSID Convention, whether or not that Contracting State is a party to the award in question, and is not addressed to any party to an award other than a Contracting State. The effect of the obligation imposed on Contracting States by this provision is to ensure that any ICSID award can be enforced by either party to the award in the territory of any ICSID Contracting State. In other words, if an award is given against an investor in favour of a Contracting State or a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, Article 54(1) ensures that the Contracting State or constituent subdivision or agency can enforce the award in the territory of any Contracting State, including but not limited to its own territory or the territory of the investor's national State. Conversely, if an award is given against a Contracting State or a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State in favour of an investor, Article 54(1) ensures that the investor can enforce the award in the territory of any Contracting State, including but not limited to the territory of the State that is, or the State of, the award debtor. However, Article 54(1) does not state that a party to an award must use the enforcement machinery established pursuant to this provision as a condition of the award being complied with. Nor does it state that a Contracting State or a constituent subdivision or agency that is an award debtor is entitled to decline to comply with the terms of the award until the enforcement machinery that exists under that Contracting State's own national law is used by the award creditor.\n\n63.\n\nThe wording of Article 53(1) must also be considered in the light of the wording of the ICSID Convention as a whole. Of particular significance is the wording of Article 27(1) of the ICSID Convention, which states.\n\n*No Contracting State shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.*\n\n64.\n\nThe purpose of Article 27(1) is explained in paragraph 33 of the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention as follows:\n\n*When a host State consents to the submission of a dispute with an investor to the Centre, thereby giving the investor direct access to an international jurisdiction, the investor should not be in a position to ask his State to espouse his case and that State should not be permitted to do so. Accordingly, Article 27 expressly prohibits a Contracting State from giving diplomatic protection, or bringing an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State have consented to submit, or have submitted, to arbitration under the Convention, unless the State party to the dispute* *fails to honor the award rendered in that dispute**.* [Emphasis added.]\n\n65.\n\nThe words *\"to* *abide by and comply with**the award rendered in such dispute\"* in Article 27(1) mirror the wording of the second sentence of Article 53(1). The Committee considers that it is clear when these two provisions are examined together that the failure of a State to abide by and comply with an award, as required by Article 53(1), is a breach of the ICSID Convention, entitling the national State of the award creditor to give diplomatic protection or bring an international claim. If a Contracting State was entitled to require an award creditor to use enforcement mechanisms established under Article 54(1) as a precondition to compliance with the award, the Committee considers that the final words of Article 27(1) would have reflected the language of Article 54(1), rather than that of Article 53(1). The Committee accepts the argument of the Claimants that to sustain that the recognition and enforcement process in Article 54 must precede compliance with an award would be as unreasonable as asserting that compliance is dependent on a previous exercise of diplomatic protection under Article 27.\n\n66.\n\nThe Committee further notes that the first sentence of Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention is expressed to require Contracting States to enforce only the *pecuniary* obligations imposed by an award. If the interpretation were accepted that there is no obligation to comply with an award unless and until the judgment creditor avails itself of enforcement mechanisms established pursuant to Article 54, the result could be that there would never be an obligation to comply with non-pecuniary obligations in an award.\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee further takes into account that in legal systems generally, judgment debtors and award debtors are under a legal obligation to pay judgments and awards given against them. It is not generally the case that judgment debtors and award debtors have a legal entitlement to decline to comply with a judgment or award unless and until enforcement proceedings are taken against them; on the contrary, enforcement procedures exist to deal with the case of judgment debtors and award debtors who are in default of their legal obligation to comply with the judgment or award.\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee further considers that it would be inconsistent with the purpose of the ICSID Convention if an award creditor had to bring proceedings pursuant to national law enforcement mechanisms established under Article 54(1) as a prerequisite for compliance with the award by the award debtor. The ICSID dispute settlement mechanism was intended to be an international method of settlement,65 and it would run counter to this intention for compliance with a final award to be subject, ultimately, to the provisions and mechanisms of national law. The Committee considers that it would inherently undermine confidence in the ICSID system if a State against which an award has been given could make its own compliance with the award subject to the award creditor availing itself of the mechanisms under that State's national law for enforcement of final judgments of courts.\n\nICSID Convention, preambular paragraphs 3-4; Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n69.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that under a good faith interpretation of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, that provision imposes on Argentina, in the event that the Award is not annulled, an obligation under international law vis-\u00e0-vis the United States to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award, without the need for action on the part of the Claimants pursuant to the enforcement machinery under Argentine law to which Article 54 of the ICSID Convention refers.\n\n70.\n\nFor the purposes of Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, the Committee finds that this interpretation appears to be confirmed by subsequent State practice in the application of the ICSID Convention. According to material provided by the Claimants, only four ICSID cases have reached the stage of enforcement before local courts, and in each of these cases the courts were those of a third State, rather than the courts of the State against which the award had been rendered.66 Argentina has not sought to contradict this information. The Committee has not been pointed to any case in which an award creditor has brought proceedings for recognition and enforcement of an award in the legal system of the State against which the award was given.67\n\nE. Baldwin, M. Kantor, M. Nolan, \"Limits to Enforcement of ICSID Awards\", *Journal of International Arbitration*, Vol. 23 No. 1, pp. 1-24 (2006), indicates that enforcement proceedings were brought in France in respect of the arbitral awards in *S.A.R.L. Benvenuti & Bonfant v. People's Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2) and *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v. Senegal* (ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1), that enforcement proceedings were brought in the United States of America in respect of the arbitral award in *Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation v. Republic of Liberia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2), and that enforcement proceedings were brought in the United Kingdom in respect of the arbitral award in *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6).\n\nCounsel for the Claimants did however say that a counsel in another ICSID case had told him that \"They were at that time on an administrative internal proceeding, not before a local court, but just a budgetary allocation of money in order to receive the money, but they never were asked to go to local courts.\" (Transcript, pp. 222-223.)\n\n71.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee has not been provided with any material to demonstrate that any State other than Argentina shares Argentina's interpretation of the interrelationship of Article 53(1) and Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention. In its letter of 25 July 2008, Argentina claims that another State shares its interpretation and invites the Committee to request that other State to confirm this. However, the Committee considers that it is not for the Committee to call upon another State to express its view on a contested legal issue, and in the absence of any evidence, the Committee cannot assume that the other State in question has a particular position on this issue. The Committee has been provided with evidence that the United States of America disagrees with Argentina's interpretation, in the form of a letter submitted by the United States in another ICSID case, but the Committee considers that little if any weight can be attached to evidence of the view of a single ICSID Contracting State.\n\n72.\n\nFor the purposes of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, the Committee does not consider that the meaning of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention when interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is in any way ambiguous or obscure or that it in any way leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. The Committee does not therefore consider it necessary to resort to supplementary means of interpretation to determine the meaning of Article 53(1), although supplementary means of interpretation may confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants have referred the Committee to various passages in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, in which it is stated *inter alia* that:\n\n*... Article 53 [of the ICSID Convention] established the principle that the parties were bound to abide by and should comply with the terms of the award. Article 54 set forth the procedure for enforcement of the awards in the courts of the Contracting States,* *should a party fail to comply with Article 53*...68\n\n*... the question of the enforcement of awards has been included in the draft Convention mainly* *for the benefit of the developing countries who were thus given a means to enforce awards in their favor against foreign investors**.69*\n\n*... for the purposes of ensuring compliance with an arbitral award between States, section 14 [which, as amended, became Article 53] would have been sufficient but, since one of the parties to a dispute brought before the Center would be a private individual, Section 15 [which, as amended, became Article 54] was necessary* *to give a State the means of enforcing an award in its favor against an individual**. The Article had been included with a view to meeting the possible needs of developing countries in disputes with private investors.*70\n\nMemorandum of the Meeting of the Committee of the Whole, February 23, 1965 (Doc. SID/65-6, February 25, 1965), in *History of the ICSID Convention*, Vol. II-2, at 989 (emphasis added).\n\n*History of the ICSID Convention*, Vol. II-1, at 379 (emphasis added).\n\n*History of the ICSID Convention*, Vol. II-1, at 424 (emphasis added).\n\n74.\n\nThe Committee notes that previous decisions of *ad hoc* committees have not discussed directly the relationship between Article 53(1) and Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention. In the *CMS* and *Azurix* cases, the two previous Article 52(5) decisions involving Argentina, the *ad hoc* committees ultimately were simply not satisfied that Argentina had evinced an intention not to comply with the award.71\n\nSee CMS Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 47 (last sentence) and 50; Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n75.\n\nThe Committee notes that the *MINE* Stay Decision and *Amco II* Stay Decision made the point that where an *ad hoc* committee grants a stay of enforcement, the obligation under Article 53 is *pro tanto* suspended,72 and only then went on to state, in a separate subsequent paragraph, that the obligation under Article 54 is also suspended.73 The Committee finds that these decisions thereby appear to reflect an understanding that the obligations under Articles 53 and 54 are separate and independent.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 9; AMCO II Stay Decision \u00b6 10.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 10; AMCO II Stay Decision \u00b6 11.\n\n76.\n\nFurthermore, the *MINE* Stay Decision stated that:\n\n*It should be clearly understood... that State immunity may well afford a legal defense to forcible execution, but it provides neither argument nor excuse for failing to comply with an award.**In fact, the issue of State immunity from forcible execution of an award will typically arise if the State party refuses to comply with its treaty obligations. Non-compliance by a State constitutes a violation by that State of its international obligations and will attract its own sanctions.*74\n\nThis passage appears to manifest an understanding that where an award creditor has to resort to measures under Article 54, a course of action which may give rise to issues of State immunity under Article 55, there will have been a failure by the award debtor to comply with its obligations under Article 53.\n\nMINE Stay Decision \u00b6 25. See also CDC Stay Decision \u00b6 19: \"... while the Convention preserves sovereign immunity it expressly obligates the award-debtor nonetheless to pay the award and, in default of meeting such obligation, subjects the defaulting state to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice\".\n\n77.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee takes into account the statement in the *MTD* Stay Decision and *CMS* Stay Decision that \"final awards under the ICSID Convention are directly enforceable, upon registration and without further jurisdictional control, as final judgments of the courts of the host State\",75 that \"the point for the Committee is to be satisfied that the State Party has taken appropriate steps in accordance with its constitutional arrangements to give effect to Article 54\"76 and that \"Where it has done so, subsequent compliance by that State with a final award will be a matter of legal right under its own law, as well as under international law\".77 These passages make no mention of a separate and independent obligation under Article 53. The Committee notes further that these decisions state that \"The effect of the stay is that the award is not subject to enforcement proceedings under Article 54 of the Convention pending the outcome of the annulment application\", without mentioning any separate obligation under Article 53 that is suspended by the stay.78 However, the Committee finds that little if any weight can be given to this aspect of these decisions, given that these decisions do not take an express view on the question, let alone a considered and reasoned view, and given that the interpretation of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is not in any way ambiguous or obscure and does not lead to a result that is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 31; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 40.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 32; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 41.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 32; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 41.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 26; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 35.\n\n78.\n\nThus, the Committee considers that the matters referred to in paragraphs 70 to 76 above confirm the conclusion in paragraph 69 above as to the correct interpretation of the second sentence of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*The effect of Article VII(6) of the BIT*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee next considers the effect of Article VII(6) of the BIT, the second sentence of which states that \"Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement\". The Committee considers that the plain wording of Article VII(6) makes clear that this provision imposes two separate obligations on the two Parties to the BIT, the first being \"to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award\", and the second being \"to provide in its territory for its enforcement\". The use of the word \"and\" linking the wording of these two obligations indicates that these obligations are separate and independent. The first of these obligations is a reciprocal undertaking between the two Contracting Parties speedily to comply with awards made by arbitral tribunals established within the scope of Article VII of the BIT. The second obligation is likewise a reciprocal undertaking between the two Contracting Parties, requiring each of them to provide procedures in their domestic law for the enforcement of such awards. However, Article VII(6) contains no specific language detailing the requirements of enforcement, nor specifying any limitations as to the circle of persons to which domestic enforcement procedures would apply. The assumption must then be that it is for each of the Contracting Parties to establish appropriate provisions in its national law, and to ascertain that the corresponding legislation of the other Contracting Party would satisfy the standards which it expected.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee notes certain similarities between, on the one hand, the first of the obligations imposed by this provision of the BIT and the second sentence of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, and, on the other hand, the second of the obligations imposed by this provision of the BIT and the first sentence of Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee finds however that the corresponding provisions are not identical. The first obligation imposed by the second sentence of Article VII(6) of the BIT is one that applies to the United States and to Argentina, the Parties to the BIT (as is clear from the first preambular paragraph of the BIT), while the second sentence of Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention applies to the parties to the award. Furthermore, there are differences in the way that the respective obligations are worded. However, in the Committee's view, the similarities in question do confirm the conclusion that the two obligations imposed by the second sentence of Article VII(6) of the BIT, like the two obligations under the second sentence of Article 53(1) and the first sentence of Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention respectively, are separate and independent.\n\n81.\n\nThe Committee further considers that if the second sentence of Article VII(6) of the BIT imposed no obligation on a State Party that is an award debtor to give effect to the award except where enforcement proceedings are brought pursuant to the second of the stated obligations in that provision, then the wording of the first obligation in that provision would be otiose. On the other hand, if the first obligation is interpreted to mean that a State Party against which an award has been given must carry out without delay the provisions of the award, without the need for enforcement action by the award creditor pursuant to the second obligation, this would not make the second obligation redundant. The second obligation would still serve the function, for instance, of ensuring that where an award is given in favour of a State Party to the BIT and against an investor who is a national of the other State Party, the State Party who is the award creditor could enforce the award against the award debtor in the territory of the other State Party.\n\n82.\n\nNeither of the parties has referred the Committee to any other matters that would be relevant to the interpretation of the second sentence of Article VII(6) of the BIT. The Committee therefore concludes that under a good faith interpretation of Article VII(6) of the BIT in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, Argentina has a treaty obligation towards the United States pursuant to the first obligation under that provision, in the event that the Award is not annulled, to carry out without delay the provisions of the Award without the need for enforcement action by the Claimants pursuant to the second obligation under that provision.\n\n*The Committee's findings*\n--------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThere is some disagreement between the Claimants and Argentina as to what would be required in order for the Claimants to enforce the Award in Argentina under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. There was disagreement as to whether the procedure would be an administrative or a judicial procedure, as to what it would cost and how long it would take, and as to the possibility of the Argentine courts overturning or revising the Award on grounds of inconsistency with Argentine law. In view of the Committee's finding that the Claimants are entitled under Article VII(6) of the BIT and Article 53 of the ICSID Convention to payment from Argentina without activating enforcement procedures under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, it is not necessary for the Committee to make findings on these differences.\n\n84.\n\nIn the present case, the representative of Argentina emphasised that Argentina would comply with its international commitments under the ICSID Convention. However, Argentina's Observations state clearly Argentina's position that \"Article 53 of the Convention does not establish an obligation of *voluntary* payment by the State\",79 and that Argentina is claiming \"that *all* creditors of ICSID awards meet the formal requirements that any person should follow in Argentina to obtain compliance with a final judgment of a local court\".80 In oral argument, Argentina confirmed its position that in accordance with Article 54 \"any... Award creditor has to comply with the formalities applicable to final judgments of local courts\".81\n\nArgentina's Observations \u00b6 116 (emphasis in original).\n\nArgentina's Observations \u00b6 117 (emphasis added).\n\nTranscript, p. 92.\n\n85.\n\nThe position stated by the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Nacion* (Attorney-General), speaking with the authority of the Argentine Republic at the hearing of the stay application, appears to be that in the event that the award is not annulled Argentina would not comply with the Award forthwith, but would instead look to the Claimants to bring proceedings for the enforcement of the Award under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. For the reasons stated the Committee finds such a position to be in apparent non-compliance with Argentina's international law treaty obligations owed to the United States under Article VII(6) of the BIT and under Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(b) Other alleged circumstances said by the Claimants to give rise to a risk of non-compliance with the Award by Argentina***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants argue that a number of other circumstances give rise to a risk of future non-compliance with the Award by Argentina.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Argentina has sought annulment of all ICSID awards given against it. The Committee finds that there is no indication that Argentina is acting in a merely dilatory manner in this case, that it is not for the Committee to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to succeed, and that the evidence presented does not establish that Argentina is acting other than in good faith in bringing the Application for Annulment (see paragraphs 47-48 above).\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that seven ICSID awards have been given against Argentina, and that none has ever been paid by Argentina. The Claimants add that Argentina has gone so far as to divert assets away from New York to avoid their attachment pursuant to a United States court order obtained by CMS to enforce the award in the *CMS* case.\n\n89.\n\nThe Committee notes that the reason why Argentina has so far not complied with the *CMS* award appears to be because of Argentina's position on the interpretation and interrelationship of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention. The Committee therefore considers that the Claimants' argument concerning Argentina's non-compliance with the *CMS* award adds nothing to the arguments already considered by the Committee in paragraphs 54 to 85 above.\n\n90.\n\nAs regards Argentina's alleged diversion of assets away from New York to prevent their attachment in satisfaction of the *CMS* award, the Committee further notes that the assets in question belonged to a province of Argentina which was not alleged to be involved in the events to which the claim in the *CMS* case related. The Committee is unable to conclude on the basis of the material before it that the diversion of these assets away from New York, if this occurred, is demonstrative of any intention on the part of Argentina, if the stay is continued, to take steps that would frustrate or impede the future execution of the award in the event that it is not annulled. Indeed, ultimately the Claimants appear merely to argue that this incident demonstrates that Argentina would \"have the opportunity\" to do so, and that the Claimants are prejudiced by this.82 However, the fact that a party could take a course of action cannot of itself establish that there is any real risk that it will do so.\n\nTranscript, p. 225.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants then argue that Argentina is in default of other international obligations, and state that Argentina owes US$ 20 billion to unpaid bondholders. However, the Committee is unable to make findings as to whether Argentina is in breach of its legal obligations to others who are not parties to the present proceedings, let alone whether the circumstances of any such breach are such that they establish a risk of Argentina not complying with the Award in this case if it is not annulled.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants additionally refer to certain public statements of executive and judicial officials of Argentina to the effect that ICSID awards may be submitted for review to national courts or the International Court of Justice. To the extent that these public statements reflect the position of Argentina on the interrelationship between Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, they add nothing to the arguments already considered by the Committee in paragraphs 54 to 85 above. In any event, the Committee notes Argentina's submissions that under Argentine law, only the President, the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Attorney-General may make statements that are binding on Argentina, and that media reports of statements of officials are frequently inaccurate. The Committee finds that Argentina has expressed its position to the Committee through its duly authorised representatives, and that in the present case the Committee has no need to resort to media reports in order to ascertain Argentina's intentions.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants place further reliance on the Argentine Supreme Court decision in *Cartellone v. Hidronor*,83 which decided that arbitral awards may be challenged in certain circumstances by Argentina's judiciary, and on the fact that this case was invoked by domestic courts as grounds for ordering the suspension of the arbitration proceedings in the *National Grid* case.84 The Committee considers however that as neither the *Cartellone* or the *National Grid* cases involved arbitrations under the ICSID Convention, the circumstances of these cases are not indicative of Argentina's intentions with respect to awards rendered against it in proceedings under the ICSID Convention.\n\nCorte Suprema de Justicia, June 1, 2004, *Cartellone c. Hidronor*, Fallos 327-1881.\n\nAn UNCITRAL arbitration administered by ICSID.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that it is doubtful whether ICSID Conventions are enforceable under Argentine national law. For the reasons given in paragraph 83 above, the Committee finds that it is not required to consider whether Argentina's national law complies with Article 54, although it notes that previous decisions appear to have considered that it does.85 For present purposes it is sufficient that the Committee has found that Argentina has expressed the intention to adopt a course of action which the Committee finds would be contrary to Argentina's obligations under Article VII(6) of the BIT and Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nCMS Stay Decision \u00b6 45; Azurix Stay Decision \u00b6 38.\n\n***(c) Other alleged circumstances invoked by the Parties***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants argue that under the terms of the Award they are not entitled to post-award interest, so that the present value of the award will diminish during the period of the stay. The Claimants further argue that they initiated enforcement procedures in the United States before the provisional stay was issued. The Claimants contend that both of these circumstances militate in favour of lifting the stay or requiring security as a condition of a continuation of the stay.\n\n96.\n\nThe Committee does not consider either of these circumstances to be a factor militating against a continuation of the stay or in favour of a condition of security, given the express wording of Article 52 and given the fact that delay caused by a stay pending annulment proceedings is \"incidental to the Convention system of annulment\".86 The Committee does not consider that the application of Article 52(5) can be affected by the question of whether or not the award creditor was awarded post-award interest, or whether or not the award creditor has already initiated enforcement proceedings under Article 54.\n\nMTD Stay Decision \u00b6 36; CMS Stay Decision \u00b6 50.\n\n97.\n\nArgentina claims that the likelihood of the award being annulled in the present case is high, given the similarities between the Award in this case and the award in the *CMS* case, which was partially annulled. For the reasons given above, the Committee finds that it is not for it to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not the Application for Annulment is likely to succeed (see paragraph 48 above).\n\n98.\n\nArgentina then contends that providing security would cause it hardship due to its current economic situation. The Claimants argue that on the contrary, Argentina's economic crisis has now ended and that Argentina is in a position to provide security without hardship. For the reasons given above, the Committee considers that where there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the award, hardship to the party seeking annulment is not normally a consideration relevant to the exercise of the power under Article 52(5), other than in the most exceptional cases. The Committee is not satisfied on the material before it that such sufficiently exceptional circumstances pertain in this case.\n\n99.\n\nArgentina additionally submits that there is a risk that it may not be able to recoup any security provided in the event that the Award is annulled, even under the Claimants' proposal. The Committee notes that the Claimants propose that if the stay is lifted, payment of the award may be made into an escrow account pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding, and alternatively, that if the stay is continued on condition that Argentina provides security, the amount of the award should be deposited into an escrow account as security, or an equivalent bond from an international bank should be provided. The Claimants argue that under these proposals, Argentina would be under no risk of non-recoupment if the Award is ultimately annulled. For obvious reasons, the Committee would not be minded to decline to continue the stay, or minded to continue the stay on condition that security is provided, unless provisions were either agreed between the parties, or ordered by the Committee in default of agreement, which secured the recoverability of any moneys paid under the award, or of any security provided, in the event that annulment is granted. The Committee considers that it should be possible for appropriate provisions to be agreed or ordered that would remove any risk of nonrecoupment.\n\n100.\n\nArgentina further maintains that the Claimants have sought unilaterally to amend the terms of the Award by having post-judgment interest awarded in an order of a United States court for recognition and enforcement of the award, notwithstanding that post-award interest was expressly not awarded by the Tribunal. The Claimants counter that consistently with Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, an ICSID award is enforced in the United States as if it were a final judgment, and that when an ICSID award is converted into a United States judgment, it accrues post-judgment interest like any other United States judgment. The Committee finds that Argentina has not demonstrated the relevance of this circumstance to the exercise of the Committee's discretion under Article 52(5). In the circumstances, the Committee finds that it need not determine whether the Claimants have acted inconsistently with the Award in obtaining post-judgment interest in the order of the United States court. However, the Committee notes that it has not been referred to any authority to suggest that there is anything inconsistent with the ICSID Convention, or with the Award in this case, for a party enforcing an award under Article 54 of the Convention to avail itself of provisions under the relevant national law for postjudgment interest, even if the award debtor would not be liable to pay interest if it complied with an award under Article 53 without enforcement proceedings under Article 54.\n\n***(iii) The Committee's conclusions***\n---------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee is satisfied that at the time of the first hearing in these annulment proceedings, it was Argentina's intention, in the event that the Award is not annulled, not to pay the Award forthwith but to require the Claimants to bring proceedings for the enforcement of the Award under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. The Committee is therefore satisfied that Argentina did at that time have an intention to engage in conduct that would amount to non-compliance with its obligations under Article VII(6) of the BIT and Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, in the event that the Award is not annulled.\n\n102.\n\nAlthough the Committee has found Argentina's stated position as to its obligations to pay on a final award to be incorrect, the Committee accepts that Argentina has acted consistently with its own good faith interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Committee does not assume that Argentina will continue to maintain its position following the conclusions on that issue made in these reasons. In any event, upon these findings, Argentina must be given an opportunity to consider its position going forwards. The Committee affords Argentina this opportunity, whilst continuing the stay without any condition that Argentina provide security. Argentina may be content to state that it now accepts the position that it is obliged to make payment of the award in the event that it is not annulled, or to the extent that it is not annulled, without the need for any enforcement action by the Claimants. The Committee would be minded, absent contrary arguments and evidence, to consider such a formal indication by Argentina as sufficing to dispel doubts that Argentina will comply with its obligations under Article 53 in the future. On the other hand, in the absence of any indication by Argentina that it has changed its position to accord with that which the Committee has found as to the extent of the obligations under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, the Committee would be minded, again absent contrary arguments and evidence, to consider that there is a risk of noncompliance by Argentina with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention if the Award is not annulled.\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee regards 60 days as sufficient time for Argentina to reconsider its position on the extent of its obligations to pay on the final award if annulment is refused in this matter. However, the Committee makes no directions as the making of any response on these matters by Argentina. The Committee merely indicates that after 60 days from the date of this decision it would, upon the application of the Claimants, be prepared to reconsider the issue of continuance of the stay and the issue of security by reference to the circumstances then existing. The Committee notes that in no event would it be minded to lift the stay of enforcement of the award or to make security a condition of a continuation of the stay without arrangements being put in place to ensure that any amounts recovered by, or any security provided to, the Claimants would be recoverable by Argentina in the event that the Award is annulled.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n**Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee extends the stay of enforcement of the Award.**\n\n**In accordance with Rule 54(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, at any time after 60 days from the date of this decision the Claimants may apply to request a modification or termination of the stay.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Second Request to Lift Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2009-05-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimants\u2019 Second Request to Lift Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application in writing (the \"Application for Annulment\") requesting the annulment of the Award of May 22, 2007 (the \"Award\"), rendered by the tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") in the arbitration proceeding between Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. (the \"Claimants\") and Argentina.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for Annulment contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of May 22, 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., a national of Australia, Judge Patrick L. Robinson, a national of Jamaica, and Judge Per Tresselt, a national of Norway.\n\n4.\n\nOn June 18, 2008, the Claimants filed a request to lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the award, or alternatively, to condition a continuation of the stay on Argentina\u2019s posting of adequate security.\n\n5.\n\nHaving received the parties\u2019 written observations on the Claimants\u2019 request and having heard the parties on the matter at the first session of the Committee held on July 14, 2008, on October 7, 2008, the Committee issued its \"Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\" (the \"First Stay Decision\").\n\n6.\n\nIn the First Stay Decision, the Committee found, *inter alia'.*\n\n(a) that where a stay of enforcement is requested under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the *ad hoc* committee may decide not to grant the request, or may grant the request subject to the provision of security or to compliance with some other condition by the party requesting the stay, or may decide to grant the request unconditionally;1\n\n(b) that in general, a stay should be granted under Article 52(5) if requested, unless the Committee finds that there are very exceptional circumstances why this should not occur, notwithstanding the possibility of making the stay conditional on the provision of security;2\n\n(c) that an award creditor has no \"counterbalancing right\" to security in any case where a continuation of a stay is ordered, and that to require that security be provided as a matter of course in all but the exceptional case would risk compromising the important confidence-balancing function for Contracting States served by the annulment procedure;3\n\n(d) that in deciding an application under Article 52(5), the Committee must consider all of the circumstances of a case as a whole;4\n\n(e) that a relevant consideration in this respect is whether the party opposing the stay has established circumstances of sufficient doubt as to whether there will be compliance with ICSID Convention obligations on a final award in the event that it is not annulled;5\n\n(f) that Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention imposes on Argentina, in the event that the Award is not annulled, an obligation under international law to abide by and comply with the terms of the Award, without the need for action on the part of the Claimants pursuant to the enforcement machinery under Argentine law to which Article 54 of the ICSID Convention refers;6\n\n(g) that under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment7 (the \"BIT\"), Argentina has a treaty obligation pursuant to the first obligation8 in the second sentence of Article VI 1(6), in the event that the Award is not annulled, to carry out without delay the provisions of the Award, without the need for enforcement action by the Claimants pursuant to the second obligation9 in that sentence;10\n\n(h) that at the time of the first hearing in these annulment proceedings, it was Argentina\u2019s intention, in the event that the Award is not annulled, not to pay the Award forthwith but to require the Claimants to bring proceedings for the enforcement of the Award under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, and that this would amount to non-compliance with Argentina\u2019s obligations under Article VIl(6) of the BIT and Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention;11\n\n(i) that the Committee nonetheless accepted that Argentina had acted consistently with its own good faith interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, that the Committee did not assume that Argentina would continue to maintain that position following the conclusions of the Committee in the First Stay Decision, and that Argentina should be given an opportunity to consider its position going forwards;12 and\n\n(j) that 60 days was sufficient time for Argentina to reconsider its position.13\n\nIn the First Stay Decision, the Committee therefore decided to extend the stay of enforcement of the Award, but further decided that at any time after 60 days from the date of the First Stay Decision, the Claimants could apply to request a modification or termination of the stay.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 36.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 43.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 44.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 46.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 49.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 69, 78.\n\nSigned November 14, 1991; entered into force October 20, 1994.\n\n*\"Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay the provisions of any such award\".*\n\n*\"Each Party undertakes...to provide in its territory for its enforcement.*\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 82.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 85, 101.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 102.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 103.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of December 17, 2008, the Claimants requested the Committee to end the stay of enforcement of the Award, or in the alternative, to condition such a stay on Argentina\u2019s provision of adequate financial security in the form of a bank guarantee or its monetary equivalent. That letter maintained that although the Committee had afforded Argentina 60 days to reconsider its position, Argentina had failed to do so.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of December 19, 2008, the parties were advised that the Committee was minded to accept the Claimants\u2019 letter of December 17, 2008 as an application for alternative orders, and Argentina was invited to comment upon this proposal. The parties were also advised that upon the Committee\u2019s acceptance of the proposal, the parties would be directed to exchange submissions.\n\n9.\n\nBy a letter of December 30, 2008 with attachments, Argentina requested leave of the Committee to develop its position on evidence and arguments which were not originally before the Committee, and requested that a hearing be held to discuss new reasons that should dispel doubts that Argentina will comply with its obligations under the ICSID Convention. Arguments in this respect were presented in the letter.\n\n10.\n\nBy a letter of January 7, 2009, the Claimants maintained that Argentina\u2019s letter of December 30, 2008, instead of simply commenting on the Committee\u2019s proposal to treat the Claimants\u2019 request as a formal application, constituted a \"full-blown anticipatory reply submission\". The letter requested the Committee to treat Argentina\u2019s letter as its further contentions in support and to decline any further exchange of submissions. The letter further opposed Argentina\u2019s request for leave to develop its position on additional evidence and arguments. The letter then responded to the points raised in Argentina\u2019s letter, and stated that the Claimants considered a further hearing to be unwarranted.\n\n11.\n\nBy a letter from the Centre dated January 8, 2009 the parties were informed that the Committee agreed to grant the requested hearing.\n\n12.\n\nBy a letter of February 20, 2009, Argentina provided a number of additional documents which it stated would be used at the hearing.\n\n13.\n\nFollowing other exchanges concerning the timing and modalities, on March 9, 2009, a hearing was held in Paris at which the parties presented oral submissions on this second application by the Claimants to lift the stay of enforcement of the Award, or to condition the continuation of the stay on Argentina\u2019s provision of adequate financial security.\n\n14.\n\nAt the conclusion of that hearing, the Chairman announced orally the Committee\u2019s decision. The Chairman recalled the terms of paragraph 103 of the First Stay Decision, which stated:\n\n*The Committee notes that in no event would it be minded to lift the stay of enforcement of the award or to make security a condition of a continuation of the stay without arrangements being put in place to ensure that any amounts recovered by, or any security provided to, the Claimants would be recoverable by Argentina in the event that the Award is annulled.*\n\nThe Chairman stated that the Committee had concluded that this necessary part of the application for the stay to be lifted had not yet been satisfied. The Chairman announced that in the circumstances the Committee had decided, without taking any view on the other issues that had been raised, to adjourn the matter of the lifting of the stay to give the Claimants an opportunity to bring forward a proposal, on notice to Argentina, which would make provision to ensure that any amounts recovered by or any security provided to the Claimants would be recoverable by Argentina in the event that the Award is annulled. The Chairman went on to state that such provision should:\n\n*... eliminate the risk of third party execution or garnishee so that Argentina would not in fact recover the monies. The Committee takes the view that it is no function of establishing an account for escrow to give some third party a windfall fund to execute against..., and... the possibility of third party benefit is to be eliminated.*\n\n15.\n\nIn a letter dated March 30, 2009 with attachments, the Claimants presented three proposals addressing the issues in paragraph 103 of the First Stay Decision. That letter also commented on the concern expressed by Argentina that because Enron Corp is in bankruptcy, there is a risk that any secured funds could potentially be attached by Enron\u2019s creditors.\n\n16.\n\nBy a letter dated April 7, 2009 with attachments, Argentina responded to the matters raised in the Claimants\u2019 letter of March 30, 2009.\n\n17.\n\nBy a letter dated April 13, 2009 with attachments, the Claimants addressed Argentina\u2019s letter of April 7, 2009.\n\n18.\n\nBy a letter dated April 21, 2009 with attachments, Argentina responded to the Claimants\u2019 letter of April 13, 2009.\n\n19.\n\nBy a letter dated April 27, 2009, the Claimants replied to Argentina\u2019s letter of April 21,2009.\n\n20.\n\nAt the hearing on March 9, 2009, Argentina remarked that it appeared from Enron\u2019s website that its name had been changed to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., and the Committee requested Enron\u2019s counsel to confirm this. In their letter of March 30, 2009, counsel for the Claimants confirmed that Enron\u2019s name had indeed been changed to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp, in March 2007. In its letter of April 7, 2009, Argentina requested that the name of the case be changed to reflect Enron\u2019s change of name. In their letter of April 13, 2009, counsel for the Claimants said that the Claimants did not oppose the request by Argentina for the case name to be changed.\n\n**B. The parties\u2019 contentions**\n-------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia'.*\n\n(a) In substance, Argentina contends that it has no obligation voluntarily to pay an award rendered against it and submits that a successful claimant in ICSID proceedings must initiate Article 54 enforcement procedures in Argentina in order to collect an award. The First Stay Decision concluded that this position is incorrect.\n\n(b) The First Stay Decision gave Argentina 60 days to reconsider its stated position as to its obligations to pay on any final award. The First Stay Decision did not give Argentina leave to \"appeal\" the Committee's decision to reject Argentina\u2019s position, and Argentina should not be permitted to bring further arguments on its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(c) Argentina has refused to change its position and in fact has reiterated that it considers the First Stay Decision to be incorrect.14 In the *Vivendi* case, the *ad hoc* committee required Argentina to commit itself unconditionally to effect payment of the Award, to the extent that it is not annulled,15 but Argentina refused to provide this assurance and instead has continued to erroneously assert that parties must institute enforcement actions in Argentina in order to collect an award.16\n\n(d) Given Argentina\u2019s continued disregard of its Article 53 obligation to voluntarily pay this and other final ICSID awards against it, there is a serious risk of Argentina\u2019s non-compliance in the event the Award is not annulled.\n\n(e) Argentina\u2019s concern that, because Enron is in bankruptcy, there is a risk that any secured funds could potentially be attached by Enron\u2019s creditors, is unfounded. The Enron bankruptcy is nearing its conclusion. The transactions within the bankruptcy relating to the disposition of the proceeds of this ICSID claim and Award were settled by the bankruptcy court several years ago.\n\n(f) While creditors of Argentina could potentially attach such funds, this possibility is the result of Argentina\u2019s own malfeasance and defaulting on its obligations, and this is not a legitimate reason to absolve Argentina of the obligation to provide security as a condition of continuing the stay.\n\n(g) Just over a month before the Award was issued, Enron changed its name to Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. As a result of the bankruptcy transactions, managerial control of this ICSID claim vested in the \"CIESA/TGS Manager\", who has continued to engage Enron\u2019s counsel to represent the Claimants, and they are empowered to make representations on behalf of Enron regarding this ICSID claim, including enrolment and enforcement matters, which were obviously matters contemplated at the time the bankruptcy settlements were approved.\n\n(h) In any event, it would be acceptable to the Claimants to name Ponderosa, a solvent Delaware entity in good standing, as the sole beneficiary of any security, which would eliminate Argentina\u2019s concerns. Because the amount of the Award did not exceed Ponderosa\u2019s claimed loss, Enron has no real financial interest in the Award.\n\n(i) The claimants have three proposals:\n\n(i) The first proposal (referred to below by the Committee as \"Proposal 1\") would require Argentina, as a condition for continuation of the stay, to open an escrow account into which it would place escrowed funds in an amount to be directed by the Committee. Argentina would grant to the Claimants a security interest in all of Argentina\u2019s right, title and interest in the escrow account and the escrow funds. Control of the escrow funds would remain exclusively in the hands of the escrow agent in the name of the \"Republic of Argentina\", and no other person. There would be specific instructions as to fund distribution upon the Committee\u2019s final decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\n(ii) The second proposal (referred to below by the Committee as \"Proposal 2\") would require Argentina, as a condition for continuation of the stay, to secure from a bank of its choice, including Banco de la Nacion Argentina (\"BNA\"), an irrevocable standby letter of credit payable to the Claimants in an amount to be directed by the Committee, callable on in whole or in part by the Claimants upon presentment of the outcome of the Committee\u2019s final decision on the Application for Annulment. The Claimants argue that there is no evidence in the record that a letter of credit would cost anything to Argentina, that BNA as the State-owned bank would surely not charge the State itself an exorbitant fee to issue such a letter, and would presumably not require collateral, and that in any event, any costs payable to BNA would be charged by a fully-owned State entity to the State itself, having no real economic effect on the Argentine economy.\n\n(iii) The third proposal (referred to below by the Committee as \"Proposal 3\") would involve a lifting of the stay, upon the Claimants giving an irrevocable commitment to Argentina that any enforcement actions that may be initiated against Argentina during the pendency of the annulment proceeding would be brought only in the name and on behalf of Ponderosa, and upon Ponderosa undertaking to reimburse Argentina in full of any amounts collected by Ponderosa from any enforcement actions initiated against Argentina during the pendency of the annulment proceeding.\n\n(j) Obviously it would be impossible to remove *any* possibility that other creditors could attempt attachment, and if this was the standard, no security would ever be required of any non-compliant State in any ICSID annulment proceeding. The possibility of attachment by other creditors against whom Argentina has already defaulted ranks very low on the scale of equities in determining whether and in what form security should be required at this stage.\n\nReferring to *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Argentine Republic\u2019s Memorial on the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, November 7, 2008 \u00b6\u00b6 121, 127-128, 130, 132.\n\nReferring to *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award rendered on 20 August 2007, 4 November 2008 *(\"Vivendi* Stay of Enforcement Decision\") \u00b6 46.\n\nReferring to *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Letter from Argentina to Claudia Frutos-Peterson, 28 November 2008 (available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/Vivendi-ArgentinaLetter28Nov2008.pdf).\n\n22.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia'.*\n\n(a) There is additional support for Argentina\u2019s position that an ICSID award creditor may be required to follow the enforcement procedures under Argentine law to which Article 54 of the ICSID Convention refers.17\n\n(b) The only thing that the award creditor has to do is complete the formalities applicable to compliance with final judgments of local courts, if any apply in the State in question, which in the case of Argentina are essentially before administrative authorities, in this case the Ministry of Economy, within the context of an enforcement judicial proceeding, in which the judge restrains himself to checking compliance with the award.\n\n(c) Article 27 of the ICSID Convention constitutes the best proof of Argentina\u2019s position on recognition and enforcement.\n\n(d) In other cases, compliance by States with ICSID awards has taken six months or a year, and lawyers for claimants have accepted that there are procedures that States must go through to execute payments.\n\n(e) For purposes of execution of the Award, the issue of Enron\u2019s bankruptcy status is not a mere formality. Creditors may attach assets that were attached or obtained by Enron during the annulment proceeding, which assets may never be recouped by Argentina even if it prevailed in the annulment.\n\n(f) Serious doubts remain as to the ability of the Claimants\u2019 counsel, under the arrangements within Enron\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings regarding this ICSID claim, to cause Enron to renounce certain rights it may have as to the execution of the Award.\n\n(g) The costs of setting up the escrow arrangement or letter of credit in the Claimants\u2019 first two proposals would be so high as to render them impracticable.\n\n(h) BNA is an Argentine commercial banking institution created by the Argentine legislature, which operates independently from and is not controlled by Argentina. Under Article 25 of its charter, it is prohibited from lending to the Federal Government, except when a special guarantee is constituted that allows for the automatic reimbursement of the money, which in this case would mean that Argentina would have to constitute an escrow account for the total amount of the award.\n\n(i) Each of Proposals 1 and 2 creates unacceptable risks of attachment. In the event that Argentina prevails in the annulment proceeding, Argentina will have the right to receive back the property in the escrow account, or collateral funds returnable to it. Judgment creditors of Argentina will accordingly argue that they have a right to attach Argentina\u2019s right to receive the property in the event that Argentina prevails in the annulment proceeding.\n\n(j) Requiring Argentina to incur such exorbitant costs in order to run the risk of losing probably millions of dollars even if it prevailed in the annulment is not justified. Even if Argentina\u2019s position is not shared, at the end of the day all that Argentina is requiring is that ICSID award creditors follow a formal procedure almost exclusively before administrative authorities, something that has been successfully required by other States.\n\nReferring to Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1966 (United Kingdom), section 1(8); Chile, Resolution No. 1891 of the Ministry of Justice, 9 July 2008 (ordering payment of the award rendered against Chile in *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7); *Vivendi* Stay of Enforcement Decision \u00b6 41; *Campania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Letter from Stanimir A. Alexandrov and Marinn F. Carlson, counsel for claimants, to Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Secretary to the *ad hoc* Committee, 8 December 2008; Lucy Reed, Jan Paulsson and Nigel Blackaby, A Guide to ICSID Arbitration 103 (2004).\n\n**C. The Committee\u2019s views**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Committee found that at the time of the First Stay Decision, in the event that the Award is not annulled, it was Argentina\u2019s intention not to pay the Award forthwith but to require the Claimants to bring proceedings for the enforcement of the Award under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.18 The First Stay Decision found that this would amount to non-compliance with Argentina\u2019s obligations under Article Vll(6) of the BIT and Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention.19\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 85, 101.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 101.\n\n24.\n\nIn its letter of December 30, 2008 and at the oral hearing on March 9, 2009, Argentina presented arguments that challenged the Committee\u2019s decision in this respect. However, nothing in the First Stay Decision suggested that Argentina would be given an opportunity to reopen matters decided by the Committee in that decision in the event that the Claimants were to make a further application to lift the stay or to require security as a condition for continuation of the stay. The Committee considers that it would be wrong in principle for it to reopen matters that were dealt with in the First Stay Decision, and it declines to do so.\n\n25.\n\nFor completeness the Committee also notes that two more recent decisions in ICSID annulment proceedings are, contrary to Argentina\u2019s submissions, consistent with the Committee\u2019s conclusion in the First Stay Decision on this issue.\n\n(1) In the *Vivendi* case, the *ad hoc* committee stated that:\n\n*In the opinion of the Committee, it would be contrary to the interpretation provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to pretend that any organ of the host State can extend an administrative certification function to exercise any possible control over the enforcement process of pecuniary obligations under a finally binding ICSID award. Such activity would contradict the declared objectives of the ICSID Convention. Any possible intervention by a judicial authority in the host State is unacceptable under the ICSID Convention, as it would render the awards simply a piece of paper deprived from any legal value and dependent on the will of state organs.20*\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee went on in that decision to note that *\"Argentina\u2019s legal position in this respect... does not conform entirely with the Committee\u2019s understanding of the interrelationship between Articles 53 and 54\".21*\n\n(2) Subsequently, in the *Sempra* case, the *ad hoc* committee concluded that:\n\n... a *State Party against which an award has been made must (like a foreign investor party) abide by and comply with an ICSID award without the award creditor having to submit to any agency of the State Party to enforce the award as envisaged by Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.... The very fact that the Committee has found that Argentina is under a duty, unconditionally and in good faith, to \"abide by and comply with\u2019\u2019 the Award according to Article 53, together with Argentina\u2019s repeated and uncompromising affirmation that it has no such obligation in the absence of the award creditor submitting the award to a procedure within the State party\u2019s domestic judicial system under Article 54, must necessarily lead to the conclusion that Argentina is not willing to comply with its obligations under Article 53 unless Sempra first seeks enforcement under Article 54.22*\n\n*Vivendi* Stay of Enforcement Decision \u00b6 36.\n\n*Vivendi* Stay of Enforcement Decision \u00b6 45.\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 5, 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 52-53 (\"Sempra Stay of Enforcement Decision\").\n\n26.\n\nIn the First Stay Decision the Committee also found that a relevant consideration in deciding whether or not to grant a stay, or whether or not to make any stay conditional on the provision of security, is whether the party opposing the stay has established circumstances of sufficient doubt as to whether there will be compliance with ICSID Convention obligations on a final award in the event that it is not annulled.23\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n27.\n\nThe First Stay Decision concluded that:\n\n*... in the absence of any indication by Argentina that it has changed its position to accord with that which the Committee has found as to the extent of the obligations under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, the Committee would be minded, again absent contrary arguments and evidence, to consider that there is a risk of non-compliance by Argentina with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention if the Award is not annulled.24*\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 102.\n\n28.\n\nAs noted above, the Committee said that it would not assume that Argentina would continue to maintain its position following the reasons in the First Stay Decision, and that Argentina was to be given an opportunity to reconsider its position.25 In the event, upon this new application to lift the provisional stay, Argentina has not suggested that it has changed its position in the light of the Committee\u2019s reasons in the First Stay Decision. At the hearing on March 9, 2009, counsel for Argentina stated that:\n\n*What we state is that, again, Article 53 establishes an obligation to comply with ICSID awards. And we say that they are voluntary in the sense that the debtor does not have to be forced to comply with an ICSID award. What we state is that the ICSID creditor as [sic] to follow the formalities applicable under domestic law for compliance with final judgments of local courts. This is what Article 54 requires.26*\n\nIn the letter of April 7, 2009, Argentina\u2019s legal representatives appear to have maintained this position, stating that:\n\n*Even if Argentina\u2019s position regarding the way in which ICSID awards are to be complied with were not shared, which is the case of this ad hoc Committee, at the end of the day all that Argentina is requiring is that ICSID creditors follow a formal procedure almost exclusively before administrative authorities...*\n\nOn the basis of the material before it, the Committee is satisfied that Argentina has not changed its position that if the Award in this case is not annulled, Argentina will not comply with the Award without requiring the Claimants to bring proceedings for the enforcement of the Award under the provisions of Argentine law that give effect to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 102.\n\nTranscript, March 9, 2009, p. 7.\n\n29.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee is satisfied that presently there is a high risk of non-compliance by Argentina with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention if the Award is not annulled.\n\n30.\n\nArgentina maintains that the cost to it of providing security would be prohibitive. In the First Stay Decision, the Committee found that if there is a serious risk of non-compliance with the award in the future, hardship to the award debtor in providing security should not normally be a factor of significance, any more than hardship could be a factor excusing non-compliance with the award itself if not annulled.27 However, the Committee left open the possibility that such hardship may be one factor to be taken into account with other factors in exceptional circumstances, such as where the provision of security would have \"\u2018catastrophic\u2019, immediate and irreversible consequences\" for a party\u2019s ability to conduct its affairs, or would *severely* affect the interests of the party.28\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 51.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 51.\n\n31.\n\nArgentina relies on evidence of Mr Daniel Marx, a partner in a financial advisory firm based in Argentina and former Secretary of Finance of Argentina, to the effect that the cost to Argentina of either Proposal 1 or Proposal 2 would be prohibitive. The Claimants have sought to dispute this.\n\n32.\n\nIn light of the reasons which follow, the Committee finds that it is not necessary for it to determine what would realistically be the cost to Argentina of either Proposal 1 or Proposal 2, or to determine whether that cost could be considered to be so high as to constitute exceptional circumstances of the kind referred to in paragraph 30 above.\n\n33.\n\nA further argument raised by Argentina is that there is a risk, in view of Enron\u2019s bankruptcy, that any security provided by Argentina or any amounts recovered by the Claimants on the award may be subject to attachment by Enron\u2019s creditors. The Committee is satisfied that there would be no risk of attachment by Enron\u2019s creditors under any of the Claimants\u2019 proposals, in particular given the terms of the proposed escrow agreement in Proposal 1 and given that under Proposal 3 any enforcement of the Award would be undertaken only in the name and on behalf of Ponderosa.\n\n34.\n\nArgentina also questions the authority of the CIESA/TGS Manager and the Claimants\u2019 counsel to make representations on Enron\u2019s behalf in relation to the Claimants\u2019 proposals. On the basis of the material before it and the submissions of the Claimants, the Committee is satisfied as to the authority of CIESA/TGS Manager and the Claimants\u2019 counsel in this respect.\n\n35.\n\nArgentina additionally argues that the Claimants\u2019 proposals create unacceptable risks of attachment by other creditors of Argentina.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under Proposal 1, control of the escrowed funds would remain exclusively in the hands of the escrow agent, and neither Argentina nor any other person would have any right to withdraw any amount from the escrow account. The Claimants say that this should resolve any concerns regarding potential attachment by third parties. Under Proposal 3, any funds recovered would be held in the name of Ponderosa pending the decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\n37.\n\nArgentina for its part relies on a letter from the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, which states in relevant part as follows:\n\n*The first and third proposals by Enron/Ponderosa - i.e., the creation of an escrow or the agreement by Enron/Ponderosa to hold any seized assets in an account pending resolution of the annulment proceeding - each create unacceptable risks of attachment to the [Argentine] Republic. In the event the Republic prevails in the annulment proceeding, the Republic will have the right to receive back the property in the escrow and/or the Enron/Ponderosa account. Judgment creditors of the Republic will accordingly argue that they have a right to attach the Republic's \"right to receive\" the property in the event the Republic prevails in the annulment proceeding.*\n\n*Judgment creditors have in fact relied on this theory in obtaining attachments against the Republic. In CVI v. Republic of Argentina, 443 F3d 214 (2d Cir. 2006)...., the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the judgment creditor CVI was entitled to attach the Republic's right, in the year 2023, to receive the Brady bond principal collateral in the event such collateral is not collected by Brady bondholders. In 2008, CVI obtained attachments of, inter-alia, \"contractual rights [of the Republic] to direct the release of* or to receive assets *constituting unclaimed payments on debt securities held by the Bank of New York pursuant to the Trust Indenture and/or the Terms.\"...*\n\n*Judgment creditors would invoke the above authority in seeking to attach the escrowed property, notwithstanding the statement in the letter that the risk of attachment is eliminated by the fact that \"[c]ontrol of the escrowed funds shall remains [sic] exclusively in the hands of the escrow agent,\" and that the Republic shall have no \"control over the use of, or any right to withdraw any amount from\" the accounts while the annulment proceedings are pending.... So long as the Republic has a \"right to receive\" the funds in the event it succeeds in the annulment, the rationale of the above decisions would be relied upon by judgment creditors in seeking to attach that right. In the CVI cases, fiscal agents and trustees controlled the subject accounts, and the courts nevertheless authorized attachments based on the Republic\u2019s property interest in the accounts.*\n\n*In the context of the proposed issuance of a letter of credit, if the Republic is required (as would be likely) to post as collateral funds returnable to it in the event the Republic prevails in the annulment proceedings, such funds would similarly be at risk for attachment as described above29*\n\nThe position of Argentina suggests that under any of the proposals, amounts paid into the escrow account by Argentina, or given as collateral by Argentina for a bank guarantee, or obtained by Ponderosa in enforcement proceedings, might never be recovered by Argentina if the Award is annulled.\n\nThis letter also cited the case of *Abkco Industries Inc v. Apple Films Inc,* 350 NE 2d 899, 39 NY 2d 670, 385 NYS 2d 511 (Court of Appeals of New York, 1976), in which, according to the letter, \"the New York Court of Appeals... held that the defendant\u2019s *right to receive* funds pursuant to a film licensing agreement constituted attachable \u2018property\u2019 of the defendant, even though the funds were not in the hands of the defendant and payment depended upon the performance of a third party\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants did not seek to deny that such attachment by third party creditors of Argentina could be possible. Rather, in a footnote in their letter dated March 30, 2009, counsel for the Claimants stated that:\n\n*To be sure, creditors of Argentina could potentially attach such funds, but this possibility is the result of Argentina\u2019s own malfeasance and defaulting on its obligations, and should not be considered by the Committee as a legitimate reason to absolve Argentina of the obligation to provide security here as a condition of continuing the stay. Claimants\u2019 proposals herein nonetheless attempt to address this concern as well.*\n\n39.\n\nIt appears to the Committee from the material before it that under the law in certain jurisdictions in the United States, and possibly elsewhere as well, a third party creditor could apply to attach Argentina\u2019s conditional interest in sums that would be held by the escrow agent or Ponderosa under Proposals 1 or 3, or by a bank as collateral under Proposal 2.\n\n40.\n\nPonderosa is established under the laws of Delaware and has its principal place of business in Texas.30 The draft escrow agreement attached to the March 30, 2009 letter from the Claimants\u2019 representatives for purposes of Proposal 1 provides that the governing law of the escrow agreement would be that of the State of New York. It further provides that the escrow funds would be invested as directed by the Claimants in one or more specified types of investments, including direct obligations of the United States of America and obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest.\n\nAward \u00b6 1.\n\n41.\n\nThe Committee considers that the circumstances of the present case are exceptional in that Argentina presently is party to a significant number of investment treaty arbitration proceedings brought by various claimants, to the extent that the Committee considers there to be a very high risk that if any of the Claimants\u2019 proposals were implemented, other claimants, including those with unsatisfied ICSID awards for payment of monetary amounts, could actively seek to execute against the funds that would be held by the escrow agent or Ponderosa in the event that the Award is annulled. On the basis of the material before it, the Committee is satisfied that there is a very high risk under the Claimants\u2019 proposals that Argentina\u2019s conditional interest in the sums held by the escrow agent or by Ponderosa, or by a bank providing a bank guarantee, could be attached by third party creditors of Argentina.\n\n42.\n\nThe Committee does not accept the Claimants\u2019 argument that this possibility is not a legitimate reason for absolving Argentina from the obligation to provide security, as *\"this possibility is the result of Argentina\u2019s own malfeasance and defaulting on its obligations\".* In arbitration proceedings, the tribunal only has jurisdiction with respect to the specific case for which it has been constituted. The same is true of an *ad hoc* committee in annulment proceedings. The Committee considers that it would undermine confidence in the ICSID system if an award subject to annulment proceedings might be used by strangers to the arbitration proceedings as a procedural vehicle to secure enforcement of their own unrelated claims against the respondent, such that amounts recovered by a claimant on the award, or security provided as a condition of a continuation of a stay, would be irrecoverable by the respondent in the event that the award is annulled. While it may be impossible in all situations to remove *all* risk of such irrecoverability, the Committee considers that where that risk is very high, as it is in this case, that fact will militate strongly against lifting the stay or against requiring security to be provided as a condition of any continuation of the stay. Both a stay of enforcement of an award pending annulment proceedings, as well as a condition of security for such a stay, are interim measures in annulment proceedings. Like interim measures in general, they are intended to be provisional and to have effect pending the final decision of the *ad hoc* committee. It would be inconsistent with that purpose if such measures were to have an irreversible effect for one of the parties.\n\n43.\n\nAgainst this, the Committee has given weighty consideration to the effect that it may have on confidence in the ICSID system if a stay of enforcement is continued in force throughout annulment proceedings, notwithstanding that there is a high risk of non-compliance by the respondent State with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention if the Award is not annulled.\n\n44.\n\nIn balancing the competing considerations, the Committee has also taken into account that in the *Sempra* Stay Decision, the *ad hoc* committee ultimately decided to impose a condition of security, not for the full amount of the award, but for a portion of the award as a \"tangible demonstration of good faith\" on the part of Argentina.31 However, it is not clear to the Committee what is the basis in principle for such a condition of only partial security. Furthermore, the Committee considers that the risk in this case of irrecoverability would apply to partial security in the same way as it would to security for the full amount of the Award.\n\n*Sempra* Stay of Enforcement Decision \u00b6\u00b6 110-112.\n\n45.\n\nThe Committee must reach its decision on the basis of all the circumstances of the case as a whole.32 In addition to the matters above, the Committee takes into account that the oral hearing in these annulment proceedings is due to be held as early as July 2009, and that the final decision on annulment might be expected by the end of 2009. The Committee also notes that there has been no suggestion by the Claimants that they are aware of any immediate prospect of enforcing the Award in a State other than Argentina under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention that would be lost if the stay of enforcement is not lifted before the decision on the Application for Annulment. Another consideration is that a condition of security will often place the award creditor in a better position than it would have been in if annulment proceedings had not been brought, since the award creditor would not otherwise have had the benefit of such security.33\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 46.\n\nFirst Stay Decision \u00b6 52.\n\n46.\n\nIn the light of all of the circumstances of this particular case as a whole, on balance, the Committee considers that at this stage it is appropriate to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the conclusion of the annulment proceedings without any condition of security. The Committee considers that this case has exceptional features, and its conclusion should not be understood as detracting in any way from the importance of the consideration referred to in paragraph 43 above.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n**The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee decides that pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the stay of enforcement of the Award will continue in effect for the duration of these annulment proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATED REFERENCES** |\n|  | **Case Law** |\n| *AES* Jurisdiction Decision | *AES Corporation v.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 February 2008, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\" or \"ICSID\") an application in writing (the \"Application for Annulment\") requesting the annulment of the Award of May 22, 2007 (the \"Award\"),1 rendered by the tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") in the arbitration proceeding between Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. (the \"Claimants\") and Argentina.\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, May 22, 2007 (\"Award\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for Annulment was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), having regard to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and considering that on 25 October 2007, the Tribunal rendered its decision on a request by the Claimants under that provision for rectification and/or a supplementary decision of the Award.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application for Annulment sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(b) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(c) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n4.\n\nThe Application for Annulment also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n5.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request for Annulment and sent a copy to the Claimants.\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 March 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n7.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, the Centre informed the parties of the ensuing recommendation to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the appointment of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., from Australia, Judge Patrick Lipton Robinson from Jamaica and Judge Per Tresselt from Norway, to the *ad hoc* Committee, each of whom was designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by their respective countries.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Dr. Griffith Q.C., Judge Robinson and Judge Tresselt. On the same date the parties were informed that Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n9.\n\nOn 29 May 2008, the Centre informed the parties of the designation of Dr. Griffith Q.C. as President of the Committee.\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 June 2008, the Claimants filed a request to lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, or alternatively, to condition a continuation of the stay on Argentina's posting adequate security (the \"Claimants' Request\").\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 20 June 2008, the Committee invited Argentina to submit its written observations on the Claimants' Request no later than 7 July 2008. By the same letter, the Committee confirmed that the oral arguments on this matter would take place during the first session and informed the parties that the Committee would make a decision on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n12.\n\nBy a letter dated 30 June 2008, the Committee asked the parties whether they would agree to retain the services of an assistant, Dr. Christopher Staker, in addition to the Secretary of the Committee. Argentina and the Claimants agreed to Dr. Staker's appointment by letters dated 2 and 8 July 2008, respectively.\n\n13.\n\nIn compliance with the Committee's instructions, on 7 July 2008, Argentina filed its observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, the first session of the Committee was held at the premises of the World Bank in Paris. Prior to the start of the session, the Secretariat distributed to the parties copies of the declarations, signed by each Member of the Committee, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2).\n\n15.\n\nOn 7 October 2008, the Committee issued its \"Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award\".\n\n16.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, Argentina filed a Memorial on Annulment.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter of December 17, 2008, the Claimants requested the Committee to end the stay of enforcement of the Award, or in the alternative, to condition such a stay on Argentina's provision of adequate financial security in the form of a bank guarantee or its monetary equivalent.\n\n18.\n\nBy a letter of December 30, 2008, with attachments, Argentina requested leave of the Committee to develop its position on evidence and arguments which were not originally before the Committee, and requested that a hearing be held to discuss new reasons that should dispel doubts that Argentina will comply with its obligations under the ICSID Convention.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, the Claimants filed a Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n20.\n\nOn 9 March 2009, the Committee held a hearing in Paris on the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n21.\n\nOn 11 March 2009, Argentina requested an extension to file its Reply on Annulment due to the religious holidays. The Committee granted the requested extension and decided that the Reply on Annulment would be due on April 17, 2009.\n\n22.\n\nOn March 27, 2009, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the Committee and the parties were informed that due to a redistribution of the Centre's workload Mr. Ucheora Onwuamaegbu, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would be appointed as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n23.\n\nOn March 30, 2009, the Claimants confirmed a change of name of the first Claimant from Enron Corporation to Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation. On April 7, 2009 Argentina requested the Secretariat that the case name be changed to reflect the Claimant's name change. On April 13, 2009 the Claimants confirmed that they did not oppose the requested name change.\n\n24.\n\nOn April 17, 2009, Argentina filed a Reply on Annulment.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, the Centre proceeded to change the name of the case to *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3)-Annulment Proceeding.\n\n26.\n\nOn May 20, 2009, the Committee issued its \"Decision on the Claimant's Second Request to Lift the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award\".\n\n27.\n\nOn June 16, 2009, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n28.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the Committee and the parties were informed that due to a redistribution of the Centre's workload Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would be appointed as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n29.\n\nIn response to the Chairman's request that each party file a skeleton list of its arguments and issues, Argentina filed a document dated July 20, 2009, and the Claimants filed a document dated July 24, 2009.\n\n30.\n\nOn July 29-31, 2009, the hearing on the Application for Annulment (the \"hearing\") was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. Present at the hearing were:\n\n\u2014 the members of the Committee: Dr Gavan Griffith Q.C., President; Judge Patrick Lipton Robinson and Judge Per Tresselt;\n\n\u2014 the representatives of the Claimants: Mr R. Doak Bishop, Mr Craig S. Miles, Ms Kerrie Nanni and Mr David Weiss of King & Spalding; and Dr Guido Santiago Tawil, Dr Hector Mar\u00eda Huici and Dr Federico Campolieti of M. & M.

By letter of August 24, 2009, in accordance with the same request made by the President, the Claimants reiterated their request that the Committee require Argentina to pay all costs and fees associated with this proceeding, including the Claimants' reasonably incurred legal expenses, which were detailed in an attachment to that letter, totalling USD 1,219,073.44.\n\n34.\n\nIn accordance with leave granted by the Committee to the parties at the hearing, both parties filed written post-hearing briefs dated October 1, 2009, after the *ad hoc* annulment committee in the *Azurix* case had rendered its decision on annulment on September 1, 2009.2\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/12 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 1, 2009 (\" *Azurix* Annulment Decision\").\n\n35.\n\nThe Committee declared the proceeding closed on June 21, 2010.\n\n36.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication and have taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony before them.\n\n**B. The dispute**\n------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe background facts relating to the dispute between the Claimants and Argentina that were the subject of the Award, as found by the Tribunal, are in summary as follows.\n\n38.\n\nFrom 1989, the Government of Argentina undertook a program of privatization of State-owned companies, including in the gas transportation and distribution sectors. With a view to restructuring the Argentine economy, currency convertibility was introduced in 1991 and the Argentine peso was fixed at par with the United States dollar.\n\n39.\n\nNew rules governing gas transportation and distribution were introduced in 1992 by the Gas Law and the implementing regulations embodied in the Gas Decree. Two major transportation companies were created, one of which was Transportadora de Gas del Sur (\"TGS\").\n\n40.\n\nIn order to facilitate the process of privatisation, a Standard Gas Transportation License or \"Model Licence\" was approved by Decree 2255/92 including the applicable Basic Rules; all such rules were embodied in the License actually signed by TGS and the Government of Argentina and approved by Decree 2458/92. An \"Information Memorandum\" concerning the privatization of Gas del Estado, the former State-owned transportation and distribution company, together with a \"Pliego\" explaining the bidding rules and the legal and contractual arrangements, were provided to prospective investors so as to organize the bidding process.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants' position was that in making the decision to invest in TGS upon its privatisation, they relied specifically on the conditions offered by these legislative and regulatory enactments, including the conditions that tariffs would be calculated in US dollars, that tariffs would be subject to semi-annual adjustment according to changes in the US Producer Price Index (\"PPI\" or \"US PPI\"), that there would be no price freeze applicable to the tariff system or that if one was imposed the licensee had a right to compensation, that the license would not be amended by the Government in full or part except with the prior consent of the licensee, that the licence would be for 35 years with the possibility of a 10-year extension, and that the license would not be withdrawn except in case of specific breaches.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants' investment in TGS following its privatisation evolved over time. Originally, in 1992, EPCA, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron, was a member of a consortium of four companies that was awarded 70% of the shares in TGS. In order to comply with the requirement that an Argentine company should hold the shares in TGS, the consortium incorporated an Argentine company (\"CIESA\") to hold this 70% shareholding in TGS. Each of the four members of the consortium acquired a 25% interest in CIESA, and consequently, through CIESA, an indirect 17.5% interest in TGS. Through a number of subsequent transactions involving the Claimants and related companies, there were changes in the percentage of TGS that represented the Claimants' investment and in the structure of that investment, and there was some disagreement between the parties in this respect.\n\n43.\n\nThroughout the 1990s the regulatory system for the gas transportation sector operated without difficulties, with periodic modification of tariffs to reflect changes in the cost of natural gas and the adjustment of tariffs, both up and down, following the variations in the US PPI. A quinquiennial tariff revision was approved by ENARGAS, the government regulatory agency for the gas sector, for the period 1997-2002.\n\n44.\n\nIn late 1999, however, an economic, social and political crisis in Argentina evidenced its early symptoms. Following meetings between Government officials and industry representatives in late 1999 and early 2000, an agreement was signed in January 2000, postponing the PPI adjustment due on January 1, 2000, for six months, and providing that the deferred increase would be recovered with interest in the period 1 July 2000- 30 April 2001.\n\n45.\n\nHowever, in July 2000, a second agreement suspended PPI adjustments for a further two years, from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2002. This agreement provided that the differences would be placed in an interesting-bearing stabilization fund and that tariff increases would resume at the end of the suspension period, including recovery of the deficits originating in these arrangements.\n\n46.\n\nArgentina's position was that these agreements were the outcome of genuine consent by the parties, while the Claimants asserted that licensees were pressured by the Government into giving their consent.\n\n47.\n\nIn August 2000, the Argentine Ombudsman (\" *Defensor del Pueblo de la Naci\u00f3n* \") obtained a judicial injunction suspending the second of these agreements. On the basis of this injunction, ENARGAS directed the licensees to suspend all PPI adjustments and rejected all requests for adjustment made thereafter. As a result, no PPI adjustments were made after 1999.\n\n48.\n\nThe economic crisis in Argentina continued to expand thereafter. On January 6, 2002, Argentina enacted Law No. 25,561, or the \"Emergency Law\", which has featured in many claims brought by foreign investors against Argentina.\n\n49.\n\nThe Emergency Law eliminated the right to calculate tariffs in US dollars, converting tariffs to pesos at the fixed rate of exchange of one dollar to one peso. In addition, the Emergency Law authorised the Government to devalue the peso, which a few days later was fixed at a new rate of exchange of 1.40 pesos per dollar for certain transactions (mainly banking transactions) and the free market rate for all other transactions. A month later, the free market rate applied to all transactions and PPI adjustments were definitely abolished.\n\n50.\n\nThe Emergency Law also directed the Government of Argentina to begin a renegotiation process of public utility contracts affected by these measures. Gradually the Government conditioned the right of participation in this process on the abandonment of all claims (by the Licensees or their shareholders), either totally or partially according to the nature of the claim, before local courts or arbitral tribunals. Various bodies in charge of renegotiation were set up over time and the deadlines established were regularly extended.\n\n51.\n\nWhile the renegotiation process succeeded in respect of a number of public utility contracts and sectors, it made little progress in the gas transportation and distribution industry, and there was no negotiated settlement with TGS.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants' position was that these measures led to TGS being unable to secure international financing and led to a loss of revenue and decreased the value of the \"regulated\" business of TGS. The business of TGS consisted of both the \"regulated\" sector of gas transportation and the \"non-regulated\" sector of production of liquified natural gas (LNG). Argentina's position was that TGS must be considered as a business as a whole, that the revenues of the non-regulated sector in fact significantly increased in US dollars in the period 1993-2004, and that TGS benefited from the devaluation, since its costs were pesified while international prices increased at a time when TGS was the principal exporter of LNG in Argentina.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants maintained that the various measures complained of resulted in the violation of specific commitments made to the investors referred to in paragraph 41 above, which commitments had been determinative of the decision to invest in TGS. The Claimants maintained that the measures complained of amounted to breaches of the guarantees provided under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment3 (the \"BIT\"), namely the guarantees that:\n\n(a) each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments (Article II(2)(c) of the BIT);\n\n(b) investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (Article IV(1) of the BIT);\n\n(c) investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT);\n\n(d) investments shall enjoy full protection and security (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT) (Article II(2)(b) of the BIT);\n\n(e) neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.\n\nSigned November 14, 1991; entered into force October 20, 1994.\n\n54.\n\nThe position of Argentina was principally based on the argument that the legal and regulatory framework governing the privatisation provided only for the right of the licensee to a fair and reasonable tariff and that the right to the calculation of the tariffs in US dollars was a feature that could last only as long as the Convertibility Law was in force, but not if this law was abandoned at some point in time.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina also argued that if investors relied on the information conveyed by private consulting firms, such as that contained in the Information Memorandum, this could not be attributed to the Government which expressly disclaimed any responsibility for such information.\n\n56.\n\nArgentina further argued that the Government had the duty to take into account the interests of the consumers in regulating a national public service such as the transportation of gas, a function which is within the ambit of discretionary Government powers.\n\n57.\n\nArgentina additionally maintained that the Government's responsibility is excluded both under the Argentine legislation and jurisprudence on emergency, and under the rules of customary international law and BIT provisions governing the state of necessity.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately found that Argentina had breached its obligations to accord the Claimants the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT. The Tribunal awarded the Claimants compensation in the sum of USD 106.2 million.\n\n59.\n\nArgentina now asks the Committee to annul this Award.\n\n**C. The grounds for annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n60.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n61.\n\nArgentina identifies a number of matters which it claims are grounds for annulment, relating to the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings, to its findings relating to the applicable law, to its consideration of evidence, as well as to the Tribunal's calculation of the damages. Argentina relies on three of the five grounds of annulment provided for in the ICSID Convention, namely those under sub-paragraphs (b), (d) and (e) of Article 52(1). Before addressing Argentina's grounds specific to the present case, the Committee first considers generally the role of an *ad hoc* committee in annulment proceedings and the scope of the grounds of annulment in the subparagraphs of Article 52(1) that are relied on by Argentina.\n\n62.\n\nApplications for annulment have become an increasingly common feature in ICSID arbitration proceedings, and there is now a considerable body of case law on ICSID annulment proceedings. Two of the most recent annulment decisions are those given in the *MCI* case4 and the *Azurix* case.5 At the time of the oral hearing on Argentina's application for annulment in the present case, the decision on annulment in the *Azurix* case, in which Argentina was also the applicant for annulment, had not yet been given but was anticipated imminently. In the circumstances, both parties were given leave to file subsequent post-hearing written submissions on the *Azurix* Annulment Decision once it was given, and both parties filed such written submissions dated 1 October 2009.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/6 (Annulment Proceeding), Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009 (\" *MCI* Annulment Decision\").\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision.\n\n**(b) The role of an** ***ad hoc*** **annulment committee**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nAn ICSID award is not subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the ICSID Convention.6 In annulment proceedings under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* committee is thus not a court of appeal, and cannot consider the substance of the dispute, but can only determine whether the award should be annulled on one of the grounds in Article 52(1).7\n\nICSID Convention, Article 53(1).\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 24; *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 41.\n\n64.\n\nAs was for instance stated in the *MTD* Annulment Decision, annulment has a limited function since a committee:\n\n*... cannot substitute its determination on the merits for that of the Tribunal. Nor can it direct a Tribunal on a resubmission how it should resolve substantive issues in dispute. All it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal: it can extinguish a* res judicata *but on a question of merits it cannot create a new one. A more interventionist approach by committees on the merits of disputes would risk a renewed cycle of tribunal and annulment proceedings of the kind observed in* Kl\u00f4ckner *and* AMCO *.*8\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007 (\" *MTD* Annulment Decision\") \u00b6 54; quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 42.\n\n65.\n\nThe Committee is also in agreement with the *MCI* Annulment Decision that:\n\n... *the role of an ad hoc committee is a limited one, restricted to assessing the legitimacy of the award and not its correctness.... The annulment mechanism is not designed to bring about consistency in the interpretation and application of international investment law. The responsibility for ensuring consistency in the jurisprudence and for building a coherent body of law rests primarily with the investment tribunals. They are assisted in their task by the development of a common legal opinion and the progressive emergence of \"* une jurisprudence constante *\"...*9\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 24.\n\n66.\n\nNotwithstanding this, in relation to matters which fall within the competence of an *ad hoc* committee to decide, it is in the Committee's view to be expected that the *ad hoc* committee will have regard to relevant previous ICSID awards and decisions, including other annulment decisions, as well as to other relevant persuasive authorities. Although there is no doctrine of binding precedent in the ICSID arbitration system, the Committee considers that in the longer term there should develop a *jurisprudence constante* in relation to annulment proceedings.10\n\nSee for example *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, January 29, 2004 (\" *SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision\") \u00b6 97; *AES Corporation v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 26, 2005 (\" *AES* Jurisdiction Decision\"), \u00b6 33; *Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award, December 8, 2008 (\" *Wintershall* Award\"), \u00b6 178; *MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 24 (noting that the responsibility for ensuring consistency in the jurisprudence and for building a coherent body of law rests primarily with the investment tribunals rather than annulment committees).\n\n**(c) Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b))**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThis ground of annulment will exist where the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction, for instance because the dispute is not covered by the arbitration agreement. This ground of annulment may also exist where the tribunal disregards the applicable law or bases the award on a law other than the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.11\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 136, and the earlier case law there cited.\n\n68.\n\nHowever, there is a distinction between *non-application* of the applicable law (which is a ground for annulment), and an *incorrect application* of the applicable law (which is not),12 although this is a distinction that may not always be easy to draw.\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 42 and *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, 137, and the earlier case law there cited.\n\n69.\n\nAdditionally, it is an express requirement of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention that:\n\n*the error must be \"manifest\", not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough.*13\n\nThe Committee agrees with the *Azurix* Annulment Decision that even in cases where it is claimed that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction, the *ad hoc* committee will annul the decision only where the tribunal has *manifestly* exceeded its power: in cases where there is any uncertainty or doubt as to whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction, that question falls to be settled by the tribunal itself in exercise of its *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, and Article 52(1)(b) does not provide a mechanism for *de novo* consideration of, or an appeal against, a decision of a tribunal under Article 41(1) after the tribunal has given its award.14\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 47 quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 48; also *MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51, 55; *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-69.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 63-68.\n\n**(d) Serious departure from fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs was stated in the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision:\n\n*... [u]nder Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure,\" that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision.*15\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (\" *Vivendi* Annulment Decision\") \u00b6 83, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n71.\n\nFor this ground of annulment to be established, the rule of procedure in question must be \"fundamental\".16 Furthermore, the departure from that rule of procedure must be \"serious\" in the sense that it \" *must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed* \",17 or in the sense that it was \" *such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide* \".18\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 50; *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989 (\" *MINE* Annulment Decision \") \u00b6\u00b6 5.05 and 5.06; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v.

On the other hand, while a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions* (\" *pretensiones\"*) submitted to it, it is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions.19\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n\n73.\n\nFurthermore, even in cases where a tribunal has failed to deal with a question submitted to it, the appropriate remedy may not be an application for annulment, but rather, an application to the tribunal for a supplementary decision, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.20\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n74.\n\nIt is generally accepted that this ground of annulment only applies in a clear case when there has been a failure by the tribunal to state any reasons for its decision on a particular question, and not in a case where there has merely been a failure by the tribunal to state correct or convincing reasons. In the *MINE* Annulment Decision it was said that:\n\n*[T]he requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph 1(e)...*\n\n*In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.*21\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.08-5.09, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 53.\n\n75.\n\nFurthermore, the tribunal's reasons \" *may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision* \".22\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 81, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 54; also *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.*\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article (52)(l)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that* *contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.*23\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 55.\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee further agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in the *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision, which considered that:\n\n*It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal\u2019s decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the ad hoc committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions can be explained by the ad hoc Committee itself.*24\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 83, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 54.\n\n**D. Indirect claims**\n----------------------\n\n**(a) Background**\n------------------\n\n78.\n\nProceedings were originally commenced in this case by a request for arbitration received by the Centre from the Claimants on February 26, 2001. That request for arbitration concerned a claim different to the one addressed in the Award, namely that the imposition of stamp taxes by certain Argentine provinces on operations of TGS violated the BIT.25 This original claim is referred to below as the \"Stamp Tax claim\".\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, January 14, 2004 (\"First Jurisdiction Decision\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 25; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (Ancillary Claim), August 2, 2004 (\"Second Jurisdiction Decision\") \u00b6 8; Award \u00b6 4.\n\n79.\n\nOn January 15, 2003, Argentina raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal in respect of the Stamp Tax claim.26 Argentina contended *inter alia* that the claim was inadmissible on the ground that the Claimants did not have the rights upon which they based their claim, as the measures complained of directly affected only TGS, a corporation incorporated in Argentina, and that the Claimants were only indirectly affected as minority shareholders in TGS.27\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 13.\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 34.\n\n80.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, the Claimants then filed before the Centre a new request for arbitration against Argentina.28 On April 25, 2003, the Tribunal decided to accept this new request for arbitration as a claim ancillary to the Stamp Tax claim and to have both cases proceed on separate tracks until the Tribunal has decided on jurisdiction in respect of both claims.29 Although the new claim was originally referred to as the \"ancillary claim\", it was this claim which was ultimately the subject of the Award.\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 16; Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 1; Award \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 17; Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 4; Award \u00b6 5-6.\n\n81.\n\nArgentina also filed jurisdictional objections in relation to the ancillary claim. Argentina argued *inter alia* that the Claimants lacked *ius standi* because the dispute concerned contractual rights that appertained to TGS and not the Claimants, that an indirect claim such as that asserted by the Claimants was in violation of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and that the dispute did not arise directly out of an investment as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.30\n\nSecond Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 14.\n\n82.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, the Tribunal rendered a decision confirming its jurisdiction in respect of the Stamp Tax claim (the \"First Jurisdiction Decision\").31 Subsequently, on August 2, 2004, the Tribunal gave a decision affirming its jurisdiction in respect of the ancillary claim (the \"Second Jurisdiction Decision\").32\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision.\n\nSecond Jurisdiction Decision.\n\n83.\n\nOn December 8, 2005, the Tribunal issued a procedural order embodying the parties' agreement on the discontinuance of the Stamp Tax claim.33 As noted above, the Tribunal subsequently produced the Award dealing with the ancillary claim which Argentina now seeks to have annulled.\n\nAward \u00b6 32.\n\n84.\n\nArgentina seeks annulment of the Award:\n\n(a) under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion that the Claimants could bring a claim in respect of alleged violations of rights which belonged not to them, but to TGS;34\n\n(b) under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal exceeded manifestly its powers in exercising jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims, all of which are grounded on alleged interference with rights under the License, which did not confer any rights on the Claimants and to which TGS, rather than the Claimants, was a party.35\n\nThe Committee notes that this ground of annulment does not appear to be contained in Argentina's Application for Annulment. However, as the Claimants have not objected on that basis and have made submissions in response to this ground of annulment, the Committee has considered and decided it.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 24-29.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(a) While an investment in shares is protected under the BIT and shareholders have an independent claim from that of the company if events affect their rights *as shareholders*, and while the Claimants are thus protected investors under the BIT and their investment in TGS is thus a protected investment, the Claimants cannot as shareholders pursue an individual action against third parties as a result of a claimed violation of rights that did not belong to them but to TGS.\n\n(b) In the First Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal failed to analyze this issue.\n\n(c) The Second Jurisdiction Decision also failed to resolve the issue, arguing that such issue had already been discussed in the First Jurisdiction Decision.36\n\n(d) In the Award, the Tribunal stated that this issue had already been solved in its decisions on jurisdiction,37 when in fact this was not the case.38 When determining Argentina's responsibility, the Tribunal only referred to the rights of TGS under the Licence.39\n\n(e) The Tribunal also did not deal with Argentina's argument based on Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal did not eliminate or resolve the issue of multiple claims.\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(f) A tribunal's partial or total lack of jurisdiction is an \"excess of powers\" under Article 52(1)(b),40 and an excess of powers is always \"manifest\" if it relates to matters of jurisdiction.41\n\n(g) The Tribunal did not have jurisdiction over this case because the Claimants were requesting damages for alleged violations of rights that did not belong to them but to TGS. The legal and contractual rights of TGS, including the rights of TGS under the Licence were not indirectly controlled by the Claimants, and therefore neither TGS, nor its assets, nor its legal and contractual rights, are investments of the Claimants under Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty. The Claimants' investment in Argentina only consisted of their indirect non-controlling shareholding in TGS. The Claimants were not entitled to bring ICSID proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the rights of TGS, but only in respect of alleged violations of the BIT in respect of their own investment, *i.e.* their indirect non-controlling shareholding in TGS.\n\n(h) Neither general international law nor the BIT defines shareholder rights, and domestic law (the *lex societatis*) must be resorted to in order to establish which rights a shareholder has.42 All legal systems draw a distinction between the corporation and its shareholders, and \"corporate identity\" is only disregarded when it has been used for fraudulent purposes.43\n\n(i) It is wrong to reject the application of the *Barcelona Traction* case to investment treaty arbitrations, since if an investment treaty is silent on the issue of indirect claims,44 the matter should be resolved by reference to general principles of international law.\n\n(j) If shareholders were allowed to sue and to obtain compensation for the infringement of rights of the corporation, problems would arise, including the risk of double recovery, if the corporation filed its own claims before the national courts of the host State or if the corporation came to an agreement with the host State, or if the corporation had creditors or had to pay local taxes for the amounts obtained as a result of the litigation. The Tribunal did not resolve this issue on the basis of legal provisions,45 as it was obliged to, but relied upon equity considerations, which amounts to a manifest excess of its powers.46\n\n(k) The Tribunal's conclusion that a shareholder may claim directly for measures that affected the rights of the company leaves Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention with no *effet utile*, contrary to what had been negotiated by the States in drafting the Convention.47\n\n(l) Even if the BIT allowed the filing of indirect claims, such claims would not be admissible in ICSID proceedings as the \"outer limits\" of ICSID jurisdiction are set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and \"are not subject to the parties' disposition\".\n\n(m) The Claimants are in fact indirect shareholders of TGS, increasing the risk of double recovery, since different shareholders in different positions of the shareholding chain might make simultaneous claims. The Tribunal's solution to this problem, to require a claiming shareholder to have been \"invited by the Government... to participate in the investment\",48 is not supported by domestic, international, or any other law, and is uncertain. The Tribunal invented a rule that is not part of the applicable law and that does not resolve the problem of multiple claims.49 The *Azurix* case is distinguishable since the Claimants in the present case did not and do not have a controlling shareholding in the local company.\n\n(n) If the Tribunal considered that the Claimants could claim for the damage to their indirect shareholding in TGS, it could not simultaneously distinguish between TGS's regulated and unregulated activities. The Tribunal failed to provide any grounds for its decision to consider only regulated activities.\n\n(o) Argentina has successfully renegotiated public utility contracts in a number of sectors, and TGS is renegotiating the terms of its License with the Argentine Government, but decisions such as the Award have increased transaction costs and are impeding the renegotiation process.\n\n(p) Any future increase of TGS's tariffs would necessarily entail a double recovery.\n\nReferring to Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 15.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 152, 211 and 241.\n\nReferring to Second Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 27-32; First Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 88, 103, 106, 166, 265-266, 275-276, 375, 378, 389, 402, 403, 438-439.\n\nRelying on *Kl\u00f4ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH et al v.

The Tribunal also examined the language of the BIT,51 and considered and rejected Argentina's argument that a shareholder may only assert claims to the extent that its rights *qua* shareholder were affected,52 Argentina's arguments based on the *Barcelona Traction* case53 and Argentina's arguments concerning minority shareholders.54\n\n(b) There was no need for the Second Decision on Jurisdiction to repeat the reasoning included in the First Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n(c) The Tribunal was not required to determine the extent to which the Claimants could file a claim under the License instead of the BIT, but in any event, the Tribunal did examine the difference between a BIT claim and a contract claim.55\n\n(d) Since the Claimants did not assert claims for breach of contract, it was not necessary for the Tribunal to make such a determination. The Tribunal's finding that Argentina breached the BIT was not based upon breaches of the License, although this was certainly a factor in the Tribunal's analysis of Argentina's overall conduct relative to the BIT standards.\n\n(e) The Tribunal was not required to address Argentina's arguments concerning the hypothetical risk of double recovery, but in any event, did address this issue.56\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(f) The dispute before the Tribunal was not for breach of contractual rights belonging to TGS but for damages arising from Argentina's violations of the BIT and the resulting harm to the Claimants' investment in TGS. It is immaterial that TGS might have had its own claims against Argentina.\n\n(g) Because Article 25 does not define \"investment,\" that task was \"left largely to the terms of bilateral investment treaties or other instruments on which jurisdiction is based.\" The Tribunal evaluated Claimants' investment and determined that it satisfied the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT, which the Tribunal found includes \"the channelling of investments through locally incorporated companies, particularly when this is mandated by the very legal arrangements governing the privatization process in Argentina\".57\n\n(h) The Tribunal's decision is consistent with more than 22 other ICSID cases, where the tribunals have unanimously found jurisdiction to exist in the same or similar circumstances.58 Argentina cites no relevant authority to show that the Tribunal could not accept jurisdiction in this case.\n\n(i) The *Barcelona Traction* case does not require that domestic law regarding corporations be transplanted to cases involving indirect claims under a BIT. The *Barcelona Traction* case, in which no investment treaty was involved, itself recognized the developments occurring in international law on investment protection, especially investment protection treaties, which may accord direct protection to shareholders.59\n\n(j) The BIT, as *lex specialis*, specifically allows shareholders to assert an action for damage caused by violations of the BIT by explicitly defining \"investments\" to include those \"owned directly or *indirectly* \" and listing \"a company\" and \"shares in a company\" as well as \"rights conferred by law or contract\".60\n\n(k) Governments often require foreign investors to make their investment in a project through a locally-incorporated company, at times with other shareholders such as local nationals, and foreign investors would have no real protection under BITs and international law if they could not bring a BIT action for damages to their investment.61\n\n(l) It is not the case that, since neither investment treaties nor international law regulate the rights of shareholders, rights related to shares in a corporation must be determined by reference to domestic law.62\n\n(m) The *Barcelona Traction* case has been heavily criticised.63\n\n(n) The case law of the European Court of Human Rights relied upon by Argentina is irrelevant to this case because the BIT provides protection for both direct and indirect rights, because the European Court decisions are limited to the *lex specialis* regime of the European Court, and because the European Court has a pronounced policy of deferring to municipal law. By contrast, no such rule of deference to municipal law or harmonization is contained in either the BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\n(o) Argentina's acts and omissions may amount to both violations of the BIT and breaches of the License, but Claimants are not barred from bringing their own BIT claims simply because Argentina's acts and omissions also breached the License.64 The claims made against Argentina were not contractual claims relating to the License; they were claims for Argentina's specific violations of the BIT, and are therefore not correctly described as \"indirect claims\".65\n\n(p) The Tribunal did not base its decision to allow the Claimants' claims to proceed on the fact that Argentina invited the Claimants to invest but on the text of the BIT.\n\n(q) Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not applicable in the current case because TGS was not a party to the arbitration, and the Tribunal therefore rightly concluded that Article 25(2)(b) was irrelevant.66\n\nReferring to First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 37, citing *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v.

It is the first three of these that are relevant to Argentina's present ground of annulment dealing with \"indirect claims\". (The fourth jurisdictional objection, relating to the forum selection clause in the Licence is the subject of consideration in paragraphs 128-150 below, while the fifth jurisdictional objection, that the dispute had already been submitted to the local courts of Argentina, is not relevant to the present annulment proceedings.)\n\n90.\n\nThe first jurisdictional objection of Argentina was that the Claimants lacked *ius standi* because the dispute concerned contractual rights that appertained to TGS and not the Claimants, and that therefore only TGS was entitled to bring such claims.68 The second jurisdictional objection was that an indirect claim such as that asserted by the Claimants was in violation of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, and the third was that the dispute did not arise directly out of an investment as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention.69\n\nSecond Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16 and 17.\n\nSecond Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 14.\n\n91.\n\nAt paragraph 15 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal said that:\n\n*Since these arguments have already been discussed in the Stamp Tax Decision* [that is, the First Jurisdiction Decision] *, and the situation in respect of this dispute is not different, the Tribunal will address them briefly and devote more attention to certain aspects that the Argentine Republic has emphasized in respect of this particular dispute.*\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal described the parties' positions on the first three jurisdictional objections in paragraphs 16-22 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, and the Tribunal gave its decision and reasons in paragraphs 25-52.\n\n93.\n\nAt paragraph 25, the Tribunal said that although decisions of other ICSID tribunals are not binding precedents, \" *the conclusions of the Tribunal follow the same line of reasoning, not because there might be a compulsory precedent but because the circumstances of the various cases are comparable, and in some respects identical* \".\n\n94.\n\nContrary to what Argentina has argued in the present annulment proceedings, the Committee considers that there is no reason why a tribunal cannot state sufficient reasons for its decision by referring to, and expressing agreement with, the reasoning in a previous ICSID case, or indeed, the reasoning in any other arbitration or judicial decision, or for that matter the reasoning in a commentary or publication or in any other source. Where a tribunal does so, the Committee sees no reason why the tribunal must itself repeat at length the reasoning contained in that other source. There is nothing to prevent a tribunal from agreeing with, and incorporating by reference as its own, reasoning found in any other source, provided that it is ultimately sufficiently clear what are the tribunal's reasons. The fact that a prior decision or other source is not binding on the tribunal in no way prevents the reasoning in it from being adopted by the tribunal as its own, if the tribunal upon its own consideration finds that reasoning to be correct.\n\n95.\n\nThere are no rigid or formulaic requirements as to the form or method by which a tribunal must state its reasons. The question will always be whether, in a given case, the tribunal's reasons are sufficiently capable of being discerned such as to satisfy the standard of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, as elaborated in paragraphs 72-77 above. In some cases, where a tribunal says no more than that it reaches a particular conclusion for the reasons given in a previous similar but not identical case, the basis of the tribunal's decision may in all the circumstances be sufficiently apparent. In other cases it may not. Provided that the tribunal's own reasons are sufficiently apparent, it is not necessary for a tribunal in adopting the reasoning of the earlier decision to distinguish specifically between those passages in the earlier decision that it adopts as its own reasoning, and those passages in the earlier decision that it considers inapplicable to its own decision.\n\n96.\n\nAt paragraph 26 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal said that it could have relied on its jurisdictional findings in the First Jurisdiction Decision, that it nonetheless examined anew the jurisdictional arguments of the parties, but that \" *The parties have not really made any new argument in this respect and, therefore, the Tribunal sees no basis for changing any of the conclusions already reached in the Stamp Tax Claim* \". The Committee's views in the previous paragraph apply *mutandis mutatis* to the circumstance where a tribunal adopts its own reasoning in a previous decision in the case dealing with another matter that is similar but not identical.\n\n97.\n\nAt paragraph 27 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal then said that:\n\n*It follows that the Tribunal is persuaded that again in this case the Claimants have* ius standi *to claim in their own right as they are protected investors under the Treaty. The Claimants\u2019 right to bring an action on their own has been firmly established in the Treaty and there are no reasons to* *hold otherwise in connection with this dispute. Neither is this situation contrary to international law or to ICSID practice and decisions.*\n\nAt the end of the first sentence of this paragraph there is a footnote reference to paragraphs 62-63 of the *Azurix* Jurisdiction Decision.\n\n98.\n\nIn the subsequent paragraphs of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal sets out additional reasoning, considering and rejecting certain specific arguments of Argentina.\n\n99.\n\nThe Committee considers it clear from paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision that the Tribunal rejected Argentina's argument concerning indirect claims for the same reason that similar arguments were rejected in the First Jurisdiction Decision and in certain prior ICSID decisions. In paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision the Tribunal did not specify what were the relevant prior ICSID decisions (other than the *Azurix* Jurisdiction Decision) but it is similarly apparent that the Tribunal was referring to prior ICSID decisions to which the First Jurisdiction Decision referred and with which it agreed.\n\n100.\n\nIn the First Jurisdiction Decision, the argument of Argentina is described by the Tribunal at paragraphs 34-37. At paragraphs 38-39 it said that \" *for the sake of brevity* \" it would not repeat \" *The reasoning supporting the... holdings* \" in other ICSID cases on a range of identified questions relevant to Argentina's argument. Some of the other decisions in question are cited in footnotes 7 and 8 of the decision.70 From paragraph 24 of the decision and accompanying footnote reference 3, it is furthermore apparent that the prior decisions relied upon included, in addition to the *Lanco* Jurisdiction Decision and *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision,71 the *Vivendi* Award and *Vivendi* Annulment Decision. At paragraph 40 the Tribunal noted that while those prior decisions were not binding, the Tribunal \" *believes that in essence the conclusions and reasons of those decisions are correct* \".\n\nThese decisions being *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award, June 27, 1990; *AMT* Award; *Goetz* Award; *Lanco* Jurisdiction Decision; *Genin* Award; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, November 21, 2000; *Vivendi* Annulment Decision. Also *CME* Partial Award; *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision.\n\nWhich were cited in paragraph 38 of the First Jurisdiction Decision: see previous footnote.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal then stated at paragraph 39, as a general proposition, that:\n\n*It is sufficient for the purpose of the present case to emphasize that there is nothing contrary to international law or the ICSID Convention in upholding the concept that shareholders may claim independently from the corporation concerned, even if those shareholders are not in the majority or in control of the company.*\n\nA statement of this proposition supported by reasons is contained in the *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision at paragraphs 43-48. The Committee is satisfied that those paragraphs in the *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision provide sufficient reasons for that general conclusion.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the particular BIT with which this case was concerned did in fact have this effect of permitting BIT claims by minority shareholders.72\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 41 (\" *The Tribunal will accordingly discuss with particular attention the situation of these claims under the Bilateral Investment Treaty in view of the existence of facts that are specific to this particular case* \").\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal began by noting that \" *As the ICSID Convention did not attempt to define \u2018investment\u2019, this task was left largely to the parties to bilateral investment treaties or other expressions of consent* \", and the Tribunal turned to the definition of \"investment\" in Article I(1) of the BIT as the relevant definition for the purposes of this case.73 The Committee cannot fault the Tribunal's approach in this respect.74\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 42.\n\nSee, for instance, Report of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, March 18, 1965: *\"No attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4))* \".\n\n104.\n\nLooking at the definition in Article 1(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal found that it was very broad, that \" *this definition does not exclude claims by minority or non-controlling shareholders* \", and that there was not \" *anything unreasonable in this definition that would make it incompatible with the object and purpose* *of the ICSID Convention* \".75 The Tribunal then proceeded to reject a number of specific arguments of Argentina that were said to militate against this conclusion.76 The Tribunal ultimately concluded that \" *the claim in the present case is admissible under the Bilateral Investment Treaty or, stated in another way, that the Claimants have* jus standi *under this Treaty in their capacity as protected investors* \".77\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 45-56.\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 57.\n\n105.\n\nIn brief, the reasoning of the Tribunal in the First Jurisdiction Decision could be summarised as being that under customary international law and the ICSID Convention it is possible for a BIT to confer on shareholders the right to bring a claim of the kind brought by the Claimants in the present case, that the plain wording of Article 1 of the BIT would allow such a claim in the present case, and that the Tribunal did not accept any of Argentina's arguments for giving the BIT a more restrictive interpretation.\n\n106.\n\nSimilar reasoning is, in effect, stated again in the Second Jurisdiction Decision. In this latter decision, the Tribunal found that the broad definition of \"investment\" in Article I(1) of the BIT would allow the type of claim brought in the present case,78 and that such an interpretation was consistent with the treaty interpretation rules in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,79 and the Tribunal then went on to deal with and reject certain arguments of Argentina for giving the BIT a more restrictive interpretation.80\n\nSee Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Vienna, May 23, 1969; 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (\"Vienna Convention\"). See Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 32.\n\nSee Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 33 *et seq*.\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee considers that when the Second Jurisdiction Decision is read in the light of the First Jurisdiction Decision, and in particular in the light of the other ICSID decisions with the reasoning of which the Tribunal expresses agreement, its reasoning is enough that it \" *enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion* \".81 The specific argument raised by Argentina was materially similar to an argument that had been raised and rejected in previous ICSID cases, with the reasoning of which the Tribunal expressly agreed. Those previous cases included the *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision and *Azurix* Jurisdiction Decision, both of which involved the very same BIT (albeit in the latter case, the claimant was a majority shareholder). Argentina has not established that the reasoning in this body of prior ICSID case law was insufficient or contradictory. The Committee is simply not persuaded that the Tribunal committed an annullable error by failing to provide greater reasoning than it did.\n\nSee paragraph 74 above.\n\n108.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal did not address the issue of \"which rights a shareholder may claim for\", and therefore did not address Argentina's argument that while a shareholder may be able to claim for alleged violations of his or her rights *qua* shareholder, a shareholder cannot claim for alleged violations of rights belonging, not to the shareholder, but to the company.\n\n109.\n\nThe Committee considers it clear from paragraph 34 of the First Jurisdiction Decision, and from paragraph 17 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, that the Tribunal clearly understood that this was the argument of Argentina. It is also clear from paragraph 35 of the First Jurisdiction Decision, and from paragraph 18 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision, that the Tribunal understood that the Claimants' answer to this argument was that they were \"not claiming for or on behalf of TGS, but in their own right as United States investors with investments qualifying under the Treaty\". The Committee considers it abundantly clear from the Tribunal's findings in the First Jurisdiction Decision at paragraphs 42, 44 and 49-65, and in the Second Jurisdiction Decision at paragraphs 28, 30-31 and 34, that the Tribunal accepted the argument of the Claimants in this respect, and that the Tribunal consciously rejected the argument of Argentina that the Claimants could only claim in respect of their rights *qua* minority shareholders in TGS.\n\n110.\n\nIn its submissions before this Committee, Argentina has argued that the Tribunal failed to deal with various specific issues and arguments raised in Argentina's pleadings before the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal was not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to this issue.82 The Committee recalls the standard of review on annulment in relation to an alleged failure by the Tribunal to state reasons for its decision.83 The Committee finds that it cannot be said that the Tribunal's reasoning was frivolous, and it is not for the Committee to determine whether the Tribunal's reasoning was convincing or correct. It is not the role of an annulment committee to examine meticulously the reasoning of the tribunal on a given issue to check that every point raised by a party has been given a clear answer.\n\nSee paragraph 72 above.\n\nSee paragraphs 72-77 above.\n\n111.\n\nThis claim of Argentina must accordingly be rejected.\n\n**(d) Manifest excess of powers as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee's views**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nFor the reasons given in paragraphs 103-104 above, the Committee considers it clear that the Tribunal found that the Claimants' \"investment\" for purposes of Article I(1) of the BIT was not confined to its rights *qua* minority shareholder in TGS. The Committee finds it necessarily implicit that the Tribunal considered that TGS was merely a vehicle through which the Claimants' investment in the privatisation of the gas industry was channelled, and that the Claimants had *ius standi* to bring a BIT claim in respect of any measure of Argentina affecting that investment. This is for instance clearly implicit in paragraph 56 of the First Jurisdiction Decision,84 and in the Second Jurisdiction Decision at paragraphs 2885 and 44.86 The Committee considers that it was necessarily implicit that the Tribunal accepted the Claimants' argument, referred to in paragraph 109 above, that were \"not claiming for or on behalf of TGS, but in their own right as United States investors with investments qualifying under the Treaty\".\n\n\" *The conclusion that follows is that in the present case the participation of the Claimants was specifically sought and that they are thus included within the consent to arbitration given by the Argentine Republic. The Claimants cannot be considered to be only remotely connected to the legal arrangements governing the privatization, they are beyond any doubt the owners of the investment made and their rights are protected under the Treaty as clearly established treaty-rights and not merely contractual rights related to some intermediary. The fact that the investment was made through CIESA and related companies does not in any way alter this conclusion*.\"\n\n\" *Foreign investors, such as the Claimants, were specifically invited to participate in the privatization process, various companies were set up in Argentina to this effect and investments were channeled into TGS through this network of corporate arrangements. It is simply not tenable to try now to dissociate TGS from those other companies and the investors and argue that the Claimants do not have* ius standi *. This is one of the essential features of the Treaty and the protection it extends to foreign investors*.\"\n\n\" *There are specific foreign investors, who were invited by the Argentine Government to participate in the privatization process and required to organize locally incorporated companies to channel their investments. At all times this was a foreign investment operation*.\"\n\n113.\n\nArgentina's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in allowing the Claimants to bring an \"indirect\" claim as shareholders is similar to the argument that it raised in the annulment proceedings in the *Azurix* case, which was dealt with in paragraphs 57-130 of the *Azurix* Annulment Decision under the heading \"derivative claims\".\n\n114.\n\nFor the same reasons that were given in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision, which the Committee considers to be correct, the Committee is of the view that:\n\n(a) No issue arose in the present case as to the *ius standi* of the Claimants to bring a claim on TGS's behalf or in respect of TGS's rights. The issue was whether the Claimants had *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging a violation of the BIT in respect of their own investment and, if so, whether, in the circumstances of the case the provisions of the BIT had been violated in respect of the Claimants' investment.87\n\n(b) It is not the Committee's function to reach its own conclusion on the correct interpretation of the BIT and ICSID Convention in respect of these questions, but to determine whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in reaching the conclusion that it did.88\n\n(c) In addressing this question, the Committee must itself consider the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention, which fall to be interpreted in accordance with customary international law rules of treaty interpretation as codified in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.89\n\n(d) The *Barcelona Traction* case concerned customary international law rules of diplomatic protection rather than investment treaty arbitration, and except where norms of *ius cogens* are involved, a treaty is capable of modifying the rules of customary international law that would otherwise be applicable as between the States parties to the treaty. Hence the starting point in determining the effect of the treaty is the terms of the treaty itself, rather than the principles of customary international law that may or may not be displaced by the treaty provisions.90\n\nCompare *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 76-80.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 82.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 82-84.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 86-90.\n\n115.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT relevantly provides that:\n\n*1. For the purposes of this Treaty,*\n\n*a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to: literary and artistic works, including sound recordings, inventions in all fields of human endeavor, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law...*\n\n116.\n\nIn *Azurix*, the claimant had established a company under Argentine law (ABA) for the specific purpose of entering into a concession agreement with an Argentine province in the context of the privatisation of the water and wastewater services industry. The tribunal in that case had found that Azurix had *ius standi* to bring a claim in respect of alleged violations of the BIT with respect to rights under that concession. The tribunal rejected Argentina's argument that as rights under the concession belonged to ABA and not to Azurix, only ABA and not Azurix could bring such a claim. In the *Azurix* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee found that the tribunal in that case did not manifestly exceed its powers in so deciding.91\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 91-130.\n\n117.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix* found that under the broad definition of \"investment\" in the BIT, ABA itself was an \"investment\" of Azurix, since ABA is a company (Article I(1)(a)(iii)) owned and controlled directly or indirectly by Azurix (Article I(1)(a), chapeau); that Azurix's \" *interests in the assets* \" of ABA were also an \"investment\" (Article I(1)(a)), and that the legal and contractual rights of ABA, including the rights of ABA under the concession, being indirectly controlled by Azurix through its majority shareholding in ABA (Article I(1)(a), chapeau), would similarly be \"investments\" of Azurix for the purposes of the BIT (Article I(1)(a)(v)).92\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision especially \u00b6 94.\n\n118.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in that case further concluded that:\n\n*In this case there was clearly a dispute between Azurix and Argentina, and that dispute concerned an alleged breach of rights conferred by the BIT with respect to what the Tribunal found was, for the purposes of the BIT, an investment of Azurix. In its ordinary meaning, here there was an investment dispute between Azurix and Argentina.*93\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision especially \u00b6 97.\n\n119.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in that case considered this interpretation to be consistent with international law principles of treaty interpretation as embodied in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as well with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.94 The Committee considers the legal reasoning in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision on the issue of \"derivative claims\" to be correct, and adopts that reasoning. The Committee does not consider it necessary to deal specifically with each of Argentina's legal arguments that were already dealt with in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision especially \u00b6\u00b6 83-129.\n\n120.\n\nThe circumstances of the present case are materially similar to those in the *Azurix* case with only one difference. Azurix indirectly owned 90% of ABA. In contrast, in the present case it appears not to have been disputed that the Claimants only ever had a minority interest in TGS,95 even if the precise extent of the Claimants' interests in TGS changed over time, and was the subject of some disagreement.96\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 21.\n\nSee First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 47-61.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal took the view that the Claimants \"owned\" an \"investment\" for purposes of Article I of the BIT, even if that investment may have been owned \"indirectly\", having been channelled through a corporate structure that included TGS.97 The Committee considers it plain that the Claimants invested in Argentina, and that in ordinary parlance it must be said that any conduct of Argentina affecting TGS's rights under the Licence affected the Claimants' investment. Thus, notwithstanding that the Claimants were only minority shareholders in TGS, the Committee does not accept that the Tribunal's conclusions with respect to the *ius standi* issue are manifestly inconsistent with an interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention in accordance with the principle in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n*See* First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 56; Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n122.\n\nAs to Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, the Committee does not consider the relevant provisions of the BIT or Articles of the ICSID Convention to be ambiguous or obscure. However, Argentina in effect argues that the interpretation referred to above leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n123.\n\nArgentina argues that there is a risk of double recovery if both a company and a shareholder can bring a claim in respect of a violation of the rights of the company. This argument was dealt with in paragraphs 113 to 128 of the *Azurix* Annulment Decision. Argentina now argues additionally that the risk of double recovery is increased if a minority shareholder could bring a BIT claim, particularly an indirect minority shareholder that is several steps removed in the shareholding chain, since many different shareholders in different positions of the chain might make simultaneous claims. The Committee considers that the reasoning in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision is as applicable to claims by indirect minority shareholders as it is to claims by majority shareholders. The Committee concludes that, even if resorted to, the principles in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention would not require a different interpretation of the BIT and ICSID Convention to that resulting from the application of Article 31.\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee rejects Argentina's argument that the Tribunal did not resolve this issue of double recovery on the basis of legal provisions,98 but relied upon equity considerations. At paragraph 212 of the Award, the Tribunal indicated that if a situation of double recovery were potentially to arise, \"able government negotiators or regulators would make sure that no such double recovery or effects occur\". In so stating, the Tribunal did not decide the dispute based on equitable considerations rather than on the basis of the applicable law. The Tribunal clearly decided the case on the basis of the relevant provision of the BIT. In effect, the Tribunal decided that a particular interpretation of the BIT was not absurd or unreasonable on the basis that it gave rise to potential problems of double recovery, first, because such problems had not in fact arisen in practice, and secondly, because even if they were to arise, there existed pragmatic ways of dealing with them.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 212.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee further rejects Argentina's argument that the Tribunal \"invented a rule that is not part of the applicable law\" when it referred to the fact that the Claimants had been \"invited by the Government... to participate in the investment\".99 The Tribunal found, as a matter of law, that on the correct interpretation of the BIT, the Claimants had standing to bring a BIT claim in respect of conduct affecting its investment in Argentina, notwithstanding that the Claimants had only a minority shareholding in TGS. The Tribunal acknowledged that while a minority shareholder might bring such a claim, there must nonetheless be \"a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected company\".100 The Tribunal considered that that cut-off point had not been reached in this case, in circumstance where \" *The Claimants cannot be considered to be only remotely connected to the legal arrangements governing the privatization* \".101 The circumstances referred to in paragraphs 54-55 of the First Jurisdiction Decision are the *facts* on which this conclusion of the Tribunal was based.\n\nReferring to First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 54.\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 52.\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 56.\n\n126.\n\nArgentina has also argued that if the Tribunal considered that the Claimants could claim for the damage to their indirect shareholding in TGS, it failed to provide any grounds for its decision to consider only regulated activities. The Committee considers that the question of any distinction between regulated and unregulated activities could not be relevant to the Claimants' *ius standi* to bring a claim in respect of alleged violations of the BIT in respect of their investment. The question of any such distinction could be relevant only to the measure of damages awarded. The issue of *quantum* of damages is addressed in paragraphs 413-415 below.\n\n**(e) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n127.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in determining that the Claimants had *ius standi* to bring the claim. The Committee rejects this ground of annulment.\n\n**E. Forum clause**\n-------------------\n\n**(a) Background**\n------------------\n\n128.\n\nIn the proceedings before the Tribunal, Argentina argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction due to the existence of a forum selection clause in the Licence, which provided for disputes to be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Argentine courts. The Tribunal rejected this argument.\n\n129.\n\nArgentina now seeks annulment of the Award:\n\n(a) under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal exceeded manifestly its powers in deciding that it had jurisdiction notwithstanding the express clauses on the election of the forum;102 and\n\n(b) under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal \"seriously contradicted itself\" by allowing the Claimants to make claims based on the License while at the same time stating that the forum selection clause in the License did not prevent it from exercising jurisdiction over those claims.103\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.\n\nThe Committee notes that this ground of annulment is not contained in Argentina's Application for Annulment, and appears to have been stated for the first time in paragraph 109 of Argentina's Memorial on Annulment. However, as the Claimants have not objected on that basis and have made submissions in response to this argument, the Committee has considered and decided it.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal lacked jurisdiction due to the existence of a forum selection clause in the Licence, which provided that \"For all purposes connected with this License as it relates to the Grantor, the Licensee submits itself to the courts with jurisdiction over administrative law matters of the City of Buenos Aires\" and that \"Federal courts shall have jurisdiction over disputes with other parties concerning the License\".\n\n(b) The Bidding Terms and the Gas Law also provided for the jurisdiction of local authorities.\n\n(c) All of the Claimants' claims for breaches of the Treaty were related to the License between the Federal State and TGS, regardless of the fact that the Claimants disguised them as claims under the BIT.104 The Tribunal itself recognised in the Award that the claims were based on the License and the regulatory framework.105\n\n(d) Treaty tribunals should decline their jurisdiction when the investor brings a cause of action based on a contract before a treaty tribunal and the contract contains a forum selection clause in favour of a different court or tribunal.106 Dispute settlement provisions in bilateral investment treaties do not override forum selection clauses in contracts.107\n\n(e) The Tribunal awarded the Claimants compensation calculated on the basis of the income TGS would supposedly have obtained under the License rather than on the basis of any causality theory linking the alleged damages to the purported breaches of the BIT. It therefore cannot be held that the claim is independent from the Licence. It was contradictory of the Tribunal to award compensation based on the Licence but to find that the forum selection clause in the Licence did not prevent it from exercising jurisdiction.\n\n(f) The Claimants could not seek to benefit from the License without being subject to the limitations thereof, including the forum selection clause.108 Either the Claimants were entitled to make claims based on the Licence and were bound by the forum selection clause, or were not entitled to make claims based on the Licence in which case they lacked *ius standi*.\n\n(g) The fact that this matter was decided by the Tribunal does not prevent the matter from being considered by the Committee in order to determine whether the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers in the terms of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nReferring to Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 51.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 166.\n\nRelying on Zachary Douglas, \"The Hybrid Foundations of Investment Treaty Arbitration\", (2004) 74 *British Yearbook of International Law* 151, 245-246 (2004) (\"Douglas\"); *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 98.\n\nRelying on *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction of 6 August 2003 (\" *SGS v. Pakistan* Jurisdiction Decision\"), \u00b6 161; *SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 143, 155; Douglas, 287; *TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award of 13 November 2008 (\" *TSA* Award\"), Concurring Opinion of arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab \u00b6 5.\n\nRelying on Douglas, 243; *SGS v Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 155.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) Argentina raised a similar jurisdictional objection in relation to the Stamp Tax Claim which was rightly rejected by the Tribunal in the First Jurisdiction Decision.109\n\n(b) The Tribunal similarly, in its Second Jurisdiction Decision, correctly rejected Argentina's argument based on the forum selection clause in the Licence on the basis that \"the essence of the claims... relates to alleged violations of the Treaty rights\".110\n\n(c) The Claimants were not parties to the Licence and therefore could not be bound by the forum selection clause in it.\n\n(d) In any event, the issue is not whether the claim touches on a contract with a forum selection clause, but rather, the fundamental basis of the claim. If the \"fundamental basis of a claim\" is a treaty, a forum selection clause in a contract cannot bar the application of a treaty standard.111 Other annulment committees have reached the same conclusion,112 as have other Tribunals including in cases involving Argentina.113\n\n(e) Argentina does not point to a single decision that holds otherwise. Neither the *SGS v. Pakistan* Jurisdiction Decision nor *SGS v.* *Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision stands for the proposition that exclusive forum clauses exclude ICSID jurisdiction over BIT claims.\n\n(f) There is no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning: the Claimants made claims for damage to their investments caused by Argentina's violation of the BIT, and thus the Claimants were not bound by the forum selection clause in the Licence.\n\n(g) Argentina misinterprets the Tribunal's words and ignores the very concept of \"investment.\" It was Claimants who were targeted by Argentina in the 1990s with a view to attracting foreign investors, and who invested in Argentina's privatization process.\n\n(h) Although the Claimants' claim does involve Argentina's dismantling of the guarantees granted under the License and the Regulatory Framework, that does not mean that the Claimants made a contractual claim for breach of the License. The same facts may be analyzed very differently under international law than under municipal law. The fact that an act or omission by a State constitutes a breach of contract does not necessarily imply that there is a breach of a BIT or of international law.\n\nReferring to First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nReferring to Second Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.\n\nRelying on *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 101.\n\nReferring to *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 31; *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 113.\n\nReferring to *Lanco* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; *Vivendi II* Jurisdiction Decision; *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 76; *AES* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 92-96; *Azurix* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 79.\n\n**(c) The Committee's views**\n-----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nArgentina raised a similar argument based on the forum selection clause in relation to the Stamp Tax Claim. In respect to this argument, the Tribunal said in the First Jurisdiction Decision that:\n\n*The Tribunal is mindful of the various ICSID decisions that have recently discussed this very issue, particularly those in* Lanco, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija *(Award and Annulment),* Wena, CMS *and* Salini *. In all these cases the tribunals have upheld jurisdiction under the Convention to address violations of contracts which, at the same time, constitute a breach of the pertinent bilateral investment treaty. The Tribunal will not repeat those considerations.*114\n\nFirst Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 91 (footnotes omitted).\n\n133.\n\nArgentina's argument was considered and rejected by the Tribunal in the Second Jurisdiction Decision, in which the Tribunal said that:\n\n*49. The distinction between these different types of claims has relied in part on the test of the triple identity. To the extent that a dispute might involve the same parties, object and cause of action it might be considered as a dispute where it is virtually impossible to separate the contract issues from the treaty issues and drawing from that distinction any jurisdictional conclusions.*\n\n*50. However, as the Annulment Committee held in* Vivendi *,* *\"A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action; it requires a clear showing of conduct which is in the circumstances contrary to the relevant treaty standard\". The tribunal also held in* CMS *, referring to this line of decisions, that \"as contractual claims are different from treaty claims, even if there had been or there currently was a recourse to the local courts for breach of contract, this would not have prevented submission of the treaty claims to arbitration\".*\n\n*51. In this case, although there are no doubt questions concerning the Contract between the parties, the essence of the claims, like in the Stamp Tax Claim, relates to alleged violations of the Treaty rights. Having the Tribunal* [sic] *concluded that there are no reasons to change the conclusions on jurisdiction reached in the Stamp Tax Claim Decision, the distinction between contract-based claims and treaty-based claims looses* [sic] *to a great extent its significance in the present phase of the case.*115\n\nSecond Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 49-51 (footnotes omitted), referring to *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Final Award, September 3, 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 161, 163; *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 113; *CMS* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 80; *Azurix* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 89.\n\n134.\n\nThe Committee considers it to be self-evident, in the words of the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision quoted by the Tribunal, that \" *A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action* \". Conduct of a host State may simultaneously amount to a breach of a contract and a breach of a treaty, or may amount to a breach of the former but not of the latter, or to a breach of the latter but not the former.\n\n135.\n\nThe terms of a contract and the terms of a treaty are unlikely to be identical, and in any event, even if they were, the contract would be governed by the municipal law of one State or another while the treaty would be governed by public international law. The contract would fall to be interpreted in accordance with municipal law rules of contract interpretation while the treaty would fall to be interpreted in accordance with international law rules of treaty interpretation. The principles for determining whether or not particular conduct on the part of a party to the contract gives rise to liability for breach of contract are the applicable municipal law rules, while the principles for determining whether particular conduct gives rise to responsibility for breach of the treaty are those found in public international law.\n\n136.\n\nThus, a determination of the question whether or not there has been a breach of contract will not answer the question whether or not there has been a breach of the treaty, and vice versa. The fact that one forum has exclusive jurisdiction to determine one of these questions is not logically inconsistent with another forum having jurisdiction to determine the other of these questions. In the present case, the BIT provided expressly for ICSID arbitration of alleged violations of the BIT. This is not logically inconsistent with any contractual clause giving exclusive jurisdiction to the national courts over claims for breaches of contract.\n\n137.\n\nArgentina nevertheless seeks to argue that where an ICSID claim is brought in respect of an alleged breach of a treaty which is based on rights under a contract, the claimant cannot seek to benefit from the contract without being subject to the limitations thereof, including any forum selection clause in the contract.\n\n138.\n\nIn support of this position, Argentina relies on a number of authorities.\n\n139.\n\nThe first is the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision, which was quoted by the Tribunal. In *Vivendi*, in the paragraph relied upon by Argentina, the *ad hoc* committee said that \" *In a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract* \".116 However, the *ad hoc* committee then went on to cite an example of a case brought before a mixed commission in which the claim was indeed for breach *of contract*.117 The *ad hoc* committee then went on to say:\n\n*101. On the other hand, where \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. At most, it might be relevant\u2014as municipal law will often be relevant\u2014in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty.*\n\n*102. In the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.*\n\n*103. Moreover the Committee does not understand how, if there had been a breach of the BIT in the present case (a question of international law), the existence of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract could have prevented its characterisation as such. A state cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty*.118\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 98.\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 98-100, referring to *Woodruff* case, American-Venezuelan Mixed Commission, 1903, *Reports of International Arbitral Awards,* vol. IX, p. 213.\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 101-103 (footnote omitted).\n\n140.\n\nThe Committee finds that this decision directly contradicts Argentina's position.\n\n141.\n\nThe next authority relied on by Argentina is the *SGS v. Pakistan* Jurisdiction Decision. In the paragraph of that decision relied upon by Argentina, the tribunal said that:\n\n*We believe that Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement is a valid forum selection clause* so far as concerns the Claimant's contract claims which do not also amount to BIT claims *, and* *it is a clause that this Tribunal should respect.*119\n\nThe tribunal then concluded that:\n\n*... the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to claims submitted by SGS and based on alleged breaches of the PSI Agreement which do not also constitute or amount to breaches of the substantive standards of the BIT.*120\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 161 (emphasis in original).\n\n*SGS v. Pakistan* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 162.\n\n142.\n\nThe Committee considers that the suggestion in these quotes is that a breach of contract may also amount to a breach of the BIT, and that where this is the case, a forum clause in the contract will not preclude an ICSID tribunal from determining a claim for breach of the BIT. The Committee considers that this decision therefore also directly contradicts Argentina's position.\n\n143.\n\nA further authority relied on by Argentina is the *SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision. However, the Committee notes that in that case the tribunal said that:\n\n*Provided the facts as alleged by the Claimant and as appearing from the initial pleadings fairly raise questions of breach of one or more provisions of the BIT, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the claim.*121\n\nThe tribunal went on to say that in that particular case, the dispute was on its face about the amount of money owed under a contract,122 and that that case could be distinguished from *SGS v. Pakistan* which was said to arguably raise a breach of the BIT independent of a breach of contract, and the *Vivendi* case where \"the claim presented by the Claimant went beyond the scope of the concession agreement and involved allegations which, if proved, were capable of amounting to breaches of a BIT\".123 The Committee does not consider that this decision clearly supports Argentina's position.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 157.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 159.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 158-159.\n\n144.\n\nArgentina next relies on the concurring opinion of arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab to the *TSA* Award. The Tribunal notes that this concurring opinion states that:\n\n*... where what is contended in the treaty claim is mainly that the contract has been violated and that this violation* *constitutes in turn and by another name (figuring in the treaty) a treaty violation, such a nominal trick does not suffice to transform the contract claim into a treaty claim or to create a parallel treaty claim. To use the terminology of Vivendi II, \"where \u2018the fundamental basis of the claim\u2019\" is the contract, however, many more layers of claims one tops it with, it remains a contract claim, which has to be settled according to the terms of the contract and in the forum chosen in that contract*.124\n\n*TSA* Award, Concurring Opinion of arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab \u00b6 5\n\n145.\n\nThis quote would indeed appear to support the position of Argentina. However, the Committee notes that this concurring opinion went on to state that on the evidence in that case, certain statements of officials of Argentina provided:\n\n*...* prima facie *evidence that the termination of the concession contract and consequent action by the Argentinian government may have been motivated, not only by TSA\u2019s alleged grave breaches of the concession contract, but also by other considerations which seem to fall within the purview of the BIT guarantees*.125\n\nThe concurring opinion then concluded that:\n\n*These considerations, independent of the alleged violations of the contract, are, in my view, sufficient* prima facie *to constitute the subject-matter of a treaty claim, and consequently to bring the jurisdictional clause of the BIT into play.*126\n\n*TSA* Award, Concurring Opinion of arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab \u00b6 9.\n\n*TSA* Award, Concurring Opinion of arbitrator Georges Abi-Saab \u00b6 9.\n\n146.\n\nThus, even this concurring opinion would seem to acknowledge that a forum selection clause in a contract will not deprive an ICSID tribunal of jurisdiction to determine a claim for an alleged violation of a treaty based on a breach of that contract, if the conduct giving rise to the breach is \" *independent of the alleged violations of the contract,... sufficient* prima facie *to constitute the subject-matter of a treaty claim* \". Furthermore, in the *TSA* Award itself, the Tribunal found that the exclusive jurisdiction clause in that case was \" *not such as to exclude recourse to a remedy under the BIT in cases where a dispute arises about acts which might constitute breaches of both the Concession* *Contract and the BIT* \".127 The Committee finds that overall, the *TSA* case does not provide clear support for Argentina's position.\n\n*TSA* Award, \u00b6 62.\n\n147.\n\nAs explained above, even in cases where it is claimed that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction, the *ad hoc* committee will annul the decision only where the tribunal has *manifestly* exceeded its power.128 The Committee finds that it has not been established that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in finding, for the reasons that it did, that it had jurisdiction over the alleged breaches of the BIT, notwithstanding the forum selection clause.\n\nSee paragraph 69 above.\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee also finds for the reasons above that it has not been established that there is anything contradictory in the Tribunal's reasoning in this respect.\n\n149.\n\nIn considering this ground of annulment, the Committee has been required to apply the standard of review under Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee would merely add that quite apart from this standard, it can see no obvious error at all in the Tribunal's approach as to the applicable principles.\n\n150.\n\nThe Committee concludes that this ground of annulment must therefore be rejected.\n\n**F. Procedural issues**\n------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n151.\n\nArgentina argues that three separate procedural matters in the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal amounted to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n152.\n\nThe first concerns the Tribunal's decision to admit, over the objections of Argentina, a witness statement of Mr Patricio Carlos Perkins that had been submitted by the Claimants.129\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 66.\n\n153.\n\nThe second concerns the Tribunal's decision to admit, over the objections of Argentina, the expert report of Mr. Alberto Bianchi submitted by the Claimants.130\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n154.\n\nThe third concerns the Tribunal's decision, on 22 March 2007, to close the proceedings, notwithstanding that, according to Argentina, certain issues remained unresolved.131\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 69.\n\n**(b) Admission of the evidence of Mr. Perkins**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Background***\n--------------------\n\n155.\n\nIn a letter to the President of the Tribunal dated 1 April 2005, Argentina requested that written witness testimony of Mr Perkins, which had been submitted with the Claimants' ancillary claim, be dismissed from the arbitration.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to this letter, Mr Perkins had in 1992 been appointed by the Argentine Privatisation Committee as executive director of the Gas del Estado SE privatisation project. The letter suggested that it was not legitimate or ethical for Mr Perkins now to give testimony in favour of the recipient of a license in the privatisation process as to what was the intention of the Privatisation Committee that appointed him to that office. The letter added that Mr Perkins was an engineer, and noted the duty of confidentiality under section 2.3.1.4 of the Code of Professional Ethics in Surveying, Architecture, and Engineering (*C\u00f3digo de \u00c9tica Profesional de la Agrimensura, la Arquitectura y la Ingenier\u00eda*).\n\n157.\n\nThe letter further stated that a government-owned company then subject to a privatisation process, Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (\"YPF\"), had entered into an agreement with the consulting company Patricio C. Perkins & Asociados S.A. for the latter to provide \" *professional consulting services for the management of the Argentine gas and business privatization project* \". Section 11 of this agreement was said to contain a confidentiality clause, entitled *\"Intellectual Property\u2014Confidentiality\u2019,* which provided that *\"any and all acts, information, investigations, conclusions, recommendations and reports performed, conducted, prepared or obtained under this agreement are exclusively owned by YPF* \u2019, and which further provided that the consulting company agreed \" *to maintain the professional secrecy in connection with any data, information, investigations, conclusion, recommendation or report obtained by the company\u2019s personnel in the course of execution of\u2019* the agreement. The letter stated that Mr Perkins' testimony in these proceedings violated this clause.\n\n158.\n\nThe letter additionally stated that a further circumstance was that the funds used to pay Mr Perkins for these services had been obtained under a World Bank programme to promote privatisations, and that Mr Perkins was now testifying against the country to which he rendered those services before a World Bank agency. The letter claimed that behaviour such as that of Mr Perkins had adversely affected the reputation of privatised companies in Argentina, and sought the exclusion of Mr Perkins' testimony from the case \" *[n]otwithstanding the civil or criminal actions that the Argentine Republic may bring against Mr. Perkins* \u2019.\n\n159.\n\nBy a letter dated 11 April 2005, from the Secretary of the Tribunal, counsel for the Claimants were invited to present any observations on Argentina's letter.\n\n160.\n\nBy a letter dated 11 April 2005, the Claimants presented observations opposing Argentina's request. That letter stated that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to ascertain whether Mr Perkins' appearance in these proceedings violated ethical principles or alleged contractual obligations alien to the matters under discussion, and that Argentina could submit claims to other appropriate venues. The letter further stated that an identical challenge had been made by Argentina in the *CMS* and *LG&E* cases, and that in the *CMS* case Argentina's challenge had been rejected and Mr Perkins was permitted to provide testimony. The letter went on to state that the information disclosed by Mr Perkins in his witness statement was in the public domain and that Argentina had failed to indicate what confidential information had been revealed by him; that the Code of Conduct for Engineers was inapplicable as Mr Perkins had not been hired to provide engineering services and that in any event it was not the Tribunal's duty to enforce that Code of Conduct; that only YPF (now a private company) could seek enforcement of the confidentiality clause in its contract with Mr Perkins; that that confidentiality clause had not in any event been breached as it related to intellectual property rights; and that Mr Perkins had not provided a witness statement \"against Argentina\" or \"in favour of\" the Claimants but had given impartial and objective testimony. The letter claimed that Argentina was illegitimately seeking to intimidate Mr Perkins so as to affect the impartiality and objectiveness of his testimony.\n\n161.\n\nBy a letter dated 22 April 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties that the Tribunal considered that there was no reason to exclude Mr Perkins' testimony from the proceeding. It stated that \" *The question concerning confidentiality raised by the Respondent is a matter that can only be dealt with in the context of the contract between Mr. Perkins and the Republic of Argentina or its agencies* \". It further stated that \" *The above considerations are without prejudice to the question of the value of evidence which the Tribunal will weigh in due course* \". The letter concluded with an invitation to the parties not to discuss decisions made by tribunals in different cases which were governed by considerations of confidentiality, and stated that this case would be decided by the Tribunal on its own merits and circumstances.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants subsequently addressed a letter to the Secretary of the Tribunal dated October 24, 2005, to which was attached a letter received by Mr Perkins from the Argentine Attorney-General's Office. The letter from the Claimants stated that in the letter to Mr Perkins, \" *the Government of Argentina attempts to bully and intimidate the witness by threatening him with civil and criminal prosecution if he testifies at the hearing in this case* \u2019. The Claimants' letter stated that the Government of Argentina had previously published the names of witnesses within Argentina. The letter contended that Argentina, having failed in its attempt to exclude the testimony of Mr Perkins, was seeking to coerce Mr Perkins so as to improperly influence his impartiality and objectiveness in favour of Argentina. The letter requested an order of provisional measures pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, requiring Argentina to withdraw its letter to Mr Perkins and to declare that it would not bring civil or criminal proceedings against him for providing testimony in this matter, and requiring Argentina not to take any actions that would further exacerbate the dispute.\n\n163.\n\nBy a letter dated 31 October 2005 from the Secretary of the Tribunal, Argentina was invited to present any observations on the Claimants' letter.\n\n164.\n\nBy a letter dated 3 November 2005, Argentina requested that the Claimants' request be dismissed. This letter stated *inter alia* that the Tribunal was not competent to issue orders but only to make recommendations, that the Claimants had failed to meet the second and third requirements of ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, and that Argentina was not aggravating the dispute by ensuring that the agreement entered into with Mr Perkins was honoured.\n\n165.\n\nBy a letter dated 10 November 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the parties that:\n\n*The Tribunal, after considering the Claimant\u2019s letter of October 24, 2005, and the Respondent's letter of November 3, 2005, does not consider it appropriate to issue an Order on Provisional Measures in this matter.*\n\n*The Tribunal wishes to remind the parties that this is an issue that has already been decided upon by the Tribunal (Tribunal's letter to the parties of April 22, 2005). In that occasion, the Tribunal informed the parties that the question concerning Mr. Perkins\u2019 eventual obligations with the Republic of Argentina is a matter that can only be dealt with in the context of the contract between Mr. Perkins and the Argentine Republic or its agencies and not before this Tribunal.*\n\n*The Tribunal decides accordingly to admit Mr. Perkins\u2019 testimony. This is without prejudice to the question of the evidentiary value of such testimony which the Tribunal will weigh in due course.*\n\n*The Tribunal also expects the Argentine Republic to facilitate the participation of Mr. Perkins in this proceeding in accordance with the Article 22 of the Convention.*\n\n166.\n\nAt paragraph 141 of the Award, the Tribunal considered the written statement of Mr Perkins on a particular point. In paragraph 142 of the Award, the Tribunal then stated:\n\n*The Tribunal would have wished that Mr. Perkins had been examined and cross-examined on this and other aspects of his testimony, and also to put questions to him, but his participation in the hearing on the merits was regrettably prevented by an injunction issued by an Argentine judge on November 24, 2005 at the request of the Government. The Tribunal makes no inference of this situation, but decided in Procedural Order No. 5, dated December 2, 2005, that the witness\u2019 written statement was admissible and that, moreover, Mr. Perkins enjoyed and continues to enjoy the immunities provided under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n***(ii) Arguments of the parties***\n-----------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal took into account the evidence of Mr Perkins as a \"key official in the privatization process\"132 which in view of the existence of a confidentiality clause and the injunction of the Argentine court, was provided illegitimately. The use of evidence that has been illegitimately obtained has been harshly criticised.133\n\n(b) The Tribunal's decision to reject the Claimants' request acknowledged that the injunction obtained from an Argentine court had been legitimate as it stated that *\"Mr. Perkins\u2019 eventual obligations with the Republic of Argentina is a matter that can only be dealt with in the context of the contract between Mr. Perkins and the Argentine Republic or its agencies and not before this Tribunal* \u2019.\n\n(c) The Tribunal thereby seriously damaged Argentina's right to defence, which is \"an essential part of the right to a fair trial.\u2019134\n\n(d) The Tribunal thereby also violated the principle of equality of the parties, which constitutes one of the main characteristics of the process in which a decision needs to be reached.135\n\n(e) The admission of this evidence \"implied preventing Argentina from exercising its right to fair treatment\u2019.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 141.\n\nReferring to Hugh Thirlway, \"Dilemma or chimera?

The Committee finds that the only issue before it concerns the admission into evidence by the Tribunal of the witness statement of Mr Perkins.\n\n170.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) provides that \" *The Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value* \". Neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules contains specific rules on the admissibility of evidence. Accordingly, the issue of the admissibility of Mr Perkins' witness statement in these proceedings was one for the Tribunal to decide. It is not a matter for the Committee to decide in annulment proceedings. The only basis for the Committee to intervene would be if Argentina establishes that the Tribunal, in admitting Mr Perkins' witness statement, in the relevant circumstances seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n171.\n\nThe Committee notes that there is no suggestion that Mr Perkins' witness statement was not provided voluntarily and no suggestion that he did not voluntarily agree that the statement would be used in these proceedings.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee notes also that at the time that Mr Perkins gave his witness statement and at the time that the Claimants submitted it to the Tribunal, the injunction of the Argentine court had not been given. The submission of the witness statement therefore cannot have been in violation of that injunction. There has been no suggestion that the injunction purported to bind the Tribunal, to prevent the Tribunal from considering the witness statement in its deliberation of the case.\n\n173.\n\nThe Committee notes further that the agreement containing the confidentiality clause was between \"YPF SOCIEDAD AN\u00d3NIMA... acting on behalf of the Under-Department of Fuels\u2019 and \"Patricio C. Perkins y Asociados S.A.\u2019. It would appear from the submissions of the Claimants, that were not contradicted by Argentina, that YPF is now a private company. There does not appear to have been any detailed discussion before the Tribunal as to whether the rights under that agreement now legally belong to YPF as a private company, or to the Under-Department of Fuels on whose behalf YPF was acting in entering into the agreement. The Claimants in their letter dated 11 April 2005, argued that only YPF could seek enforcement of the confidentiality clause in its contract with Mr Perkins. However, the Tribunal did not decide this issue. The Tribunal's decision as expressed in the letter of 22 April 2005 was that \" *The question concerning confidentiality raised by the Respondent is a matter that can only be dealt with in the context of the contract between Mr. Perkins and the Republic of Argentina or its agencies* \u2019.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal did not in any way indicate what attitude it would take in the event that a court having jurisdiction over the matter did determine that Mr Perkins' testimony was in violation of his confidentiality obligations. There has been no suggestion that this issue has ever been determined by a court. Although an Argentine court subsequently issued an injunction preventing the Claimants from testifying, this injunction was of an interlocutory nature (a \"precautionary measure\"), and did not determine the merits of the claim of breach of confidentiality. According to the Claimants, the merits of this claim have yet to be determined.\n\n175.\n\nThe situation with which the Tribunal was faced was thus this. Argentina claimed that Mr Perkins' witness statement was made in violation of his confidentiality obligations under the agreement with YPF, and possibly other confidentiality obligations such as under the Code of Professional Ethics. The Claimants denied that this was the case. The Tribunal considered that it could not determine whether or not there was a breach of such confidentiality obligations. The Tribunal did not state what it would have done if a competent court were to have decided that there *was* a breach of confidentiality obligations. As there was no such decision by a competent court, it is purely speculative to consider what the Tribunal might have done.\n\n176.\n\nIn circumstances where there was no such decision of a competent court, the Tribunal decided to admit the witness statement. After it had so decided, the Argentine court issued the injunction to Mr Perkins. Mr Perkins himself complied with that injunction and did not testify at the hearing, and as noted above, that injunction did not purport to bind the Tribunal. The Tribunal evidently considered that this interlocutory measure of an Argentine court addressed to Mr Perkins did not provide any reason why the Tribunal should not consider the witness statement of Mr Perkins that had by that time already been submitted to it.\n\n177.\n\nArgentina cites numerous authorities for the general proposition that the principle of equality of the parties, the right to defence, and right to fair treatment are fundamental rules of procedure. However, Argentina cites no authority for the proposition that it would amount to a serious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to admit the witness statement of a witness in the circumstances described in the preceding two paragraphs.\n\n178.\n\nTribunals might reach different conclusions on whether or not evidence should be admitted in such circumstances. Regardless of which view a tribunal may take, its decision will not amount to an annullable error unless one of the grounds of annulment in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is established. Regardless of which view a tribunal may take on the issue in the circumstances of the present case, the Committee is not satisfied that the decision could without more constitute a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee is not required to reach any view on issues of admissibility of evidence in ICSID proceedings in circumstances other than the specific circumstances of this case, and does not do so.\n\n**(c) Admission of the expert report of Mr Bianchi**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Background***\n--------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe minutes of the first session of the Tribunal, held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on 5 December 2001, recorded in its paragraph 16 an agreed timetable for the filing of the parties' pleadings and stated at paragraph 19.1:\n\n*It was agreed that after the submissions stipulated in paragraph 16 above, no other documents shall be submitted by the parties unless an extraordinary situation arises and it is agreed by both parties or the Tribunal. The Tribunal may request additional documents if necessary for the conduct of the litigation.*\n\n181.\n\nIn accordance with the applicable procedural schedule, Argentina filed its Rejoinder on the merits on July 7, 2005.\n\n182.\n\nOver three months later, by a letter dated October 20, 2005, the Claimants stated that:\n\n*With its Rejoinder on the Merits, Argentina introduced for the first time several new expert reports that deal with* *issues already addressed in Claimants\u2019 Memorial, and which therefore should have been filed by Argentina together with the Counter-Memorial*.\n\nThe letter stated that by waiting to file these documents with its Rejoinder, Argentina had violated ICSID Arbitration Rule 24137 and had tried unfairly to restrict the Claimants' fundamental right to due process by denying them the ability to rebut these reports. The letter went on to say that accordingly, \" *in the exercise of its fundamental rights* \" the Claimants were enclosing with the letter two new expert reports to rebut the reports filed with Argentina's Rejoinder. One of the two new reports submitted with that letter was by Mr Bianchi.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 24 provides: \"Supporting documentation shall ordinarily be filed together with the instrument to which it relates, and in any case within the time limit fixed for the filing of such instrument\".\n\n183.\n\nBy letters to the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 24 and 26 October 2005 respectively, Argentina objected to the submission by the Claimants of these new reports and accompanying documentation. In the latter letter, Argentina stated that the submission of the new reports by the Claimant was untimely as it was only one month prior to the hearing on the merits, that the Claimants had had the possibility of defending themselves in their Memorial and Reply and would have the opportunity to do so again at the hearing, that Argentina had not introduced any new issue in its Rejoinder, that the filing of these reports would mean that the Claimants would have three opportunities to present evidence while Argentina would have only two, that it had taken the Claimants over three and a half months to produce these two reports when Argentina's Rejoinder had been prepared in 60 days, and that exhibits to the new reports included documents that the Claimants could have filed earlier.\n\n184.\n\nBy a letter to the parties dated November 10, 2005, the Secretary of the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The Tribunal... decides that it will consider the new Claimants\u2019 expert reports but only to the extent that they refer or directly relate to the new expert reports submitted by the Respondent with its Rejoinder....*\n\n*The additional documentation that the Claimants have submitted will be considered on the same conditions and requirements referred to above. The Respondent may raise* *specific objections to this documentation during the hearing.* *The Tribunal will take a decision on the relevance of this documentation at the hearing.*\n\n***(ii) Arguments of the parties***\n-----------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Claimants waited three and a half months to produce the new reports, until only one month before the hearing on the merits, when Argentina had produced its Rejoinder in 60 days.\n\n(b) Neither the Claimants nor the Tribunal established the existence of any \"extraordinary situation\u2019 as required by paragraph 19.1 of the minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal.\n\n(c) Mr Bianchi's report was a deciding factor for the Tribunal as far as the exercise of police power in emergency situations is concerned.138\n\n(d) The Tribunal violated Argentina's right of defence and the equality of treatment between the parties, by providing the Claimants with three opportunities to produce evidence when Argentina only had two.\n\n(e) Inequitable treatment on the part of the Tribunal constitutes a serious violation of a core rule of procedure in the terms of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 219.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) Professor Bianchi's expert report was submitted in response to the report of Argentina's expert, Professor Comadira, which raised new issues for the first time in Argentina's Rejoinder. Professor Comadira's expert report should have been submitted with Argentina's CounterMemorial, allowing Claimants an opportunity to properly rebut it in their Reply, and there is no reason why Argentina could not have submitted it at that time.\n\n(b) If the Tribunal had not allowed Claimants to submit Professor Bianchi's expert report, Claimants' right of due process would have been seriously affected by Argentina's strategy of withholding evidence until the last possible moment. Allowing submission of Professor Bianchi's expert report was absolutely necessary in order to treat the parties equally and fairly.\n\n(c) Argentina cross-examined Professor Bianchi for an hour during the hearing on the merits.\n\n(d) Under the ICSID Convention tribunals have a discretion whether or not to allow expert reports upon request of either party, and the Tribunal's decision to accept Professor Bianchi's expert report was within the exercise of that discretion.\n\n(e) Even without Professor Bianchi's expert report, the Tribunal would have reached the same conclusion based on Argentine case law. Argentina cannot show any material effect on the outcome of the case.\n\n(f) Argentina gives no indication of what fundamental rule of procedure was breached or how such a departure from the rule was serious or would have \"caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed\u2019.\n\n***(iii) The Committee's views***\n---------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) has been quoted above. ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(2) provides that \" *The Tribunal may extend any time limit that it has fixed* \u2019. ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3) provides that \" *Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides* \u2019.\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee has no doubt that under these provisions, a tribunal has the power to accept the filing by a party of an expert report after the deadline fixed for such filing, if the tribunal considers that there are good reasons for so doing.\n\n189.\n\nIn this case, as indicated in the letter dated 10 November 2005, the Tribunal decided to accept the filing of the new expert reports and supporting documents of the Claimants, and it is clear that the Tribunal did so having considered the views of the Claimants expressed in their letter dated 20 October 2005, and the views of Argentina expressed in the letters dated 24 and 26 October 2005. The reason for the late submission of the new expert reports was that they were intended to respond to expert reports of Argentina that had only been submitted at the stage of Argentina's Rejoinder. Consistently with this, the letter dated 10 November 2005 states that the Tribunal would consider the new expert reports submitted by the Claimants \" *only to the extent that they refer or directly relate to the new expert reports submitted by the Respondent with its Rejoinder* \".\n\n190.\n\nArgentina maintains that the Claimants did not produce the new expert reports until three and a half months after Argentina's Rejoinder, by which time there was only one month before the hearing on the merits. Argentina also complains that the result of the Tribunal's decision was that the Claimants had three opportunities to produce evidence when Argentina only had two.\n\n191.\n\nHowever, the Committee notes that Argentina raised these points in its letter of October 26, 2005, and they were taken into account by the Tribunal. In deciding any procedural request by one party that is opposed by the other, the Tribunal will have to balance all of the relevant competing considerations raised by each party and reach a decision. As was observed in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision:\n\n*A decision by a tribunal whether or not to exercise a discretionary power that it has under a rule of procedure is an* exercise *of that rule of procedure, and not a* departure from *that rule of procedure. It is only where the exercise of that discretion, in all of the circumstances of the case, amounts to a serious departure from another rule of procedure of a fundamental nature that there will be* *grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.139*\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 210.\n\n192.\n\nThere is no reason for thinking that the Tribunal did not, in reaching its decision. give full consideration to all of the views that had been expressed by both parties. The Committee does not consider it inconsistent with any fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to give one party an opportunity to present specific additional evidence on a particular point where the tribunal finds that there are circumstances that justify this. If Argentina considered that as a result of the Tribunal's decision it needed more time to prepare for the oral hearing or an opportunity to submit further evidence to respond to new matters in Mr Bianchi's report, it could have made an appropriate application to the Tribunal. The decision on any such application would have been of course a matter within the Tribunal's discretion. It is not for an annulment committee to second guess how a tribunal exercises its discretion, unless a particular exercise of discretion amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n193.\n\nThe Committee considers that no tenable basis has been advanced by Argentina for suggesting that the way that the Tribunal exercised its discretion in the circumstances was inconsistent with any principle of equality of the parties or right of defence or fair treatment.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee notes that Argentina has also argued that the Tribunal's decision was contrary to paragraph 19.1 of the minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal, which recorded the parties' agreement at the First Session that no further evidence would be submitted after conclusion of the written pleadings except in \" *extraordinary circumstances* \". Argentina argues that in its letter of October 20, 2005, the Claimants did not assert the existence of any such extraordinary circumstances, and that the Tribunal did not in its decision make any finding of extraordinary circumstances.\n\n195.\n\nAlthough Argentina includes this argument under the heading of breach of the principle of equality of the parties and denial of the right of defence, the Committee has additionally considered the argument as an alleged breach of the principle in ICSID Arbitration Rule 20(2). *140* The Committee does not doubt that the principle of party autonomy is a fundamental rule of procedure, and paragraph 19.1 of the minutes of the First Session records an *agreement* of the parties on a procedural matter.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 20(2): \"In the conduct of the proceeding the Tribunal shall apply any agreement between the parties on procedural matters, except as otherwise provided in the Convention or the Administrative and Financial Regulations.\"\n\n196.\n\nThe Committee considers however that there is no reason for concluding that the Tribunal did not consider the circumstances to be \" *extraordinary* \" within the meaning of paragraph 19.1 of the minutes of the First Session. It is true that the failure of the Claimants or the Tribunal to mention paragraph 19.1 may suggest that the Tribunal did not in fact expressly address its mind to its terms. However, even if this were so, the Committee is satisfied that the circumstances that were considered by the Tribunal to justify allowing submission of the new expert reports were such as to fall within the definition of \"extraordinary\" as that phrase was used in paragraph 19.1. The Committee considers that in context, the word \"extraordinary\" in that paragraph means \"outside the usual course of events\" such as to justify a departure from what would otherwise be the applicable time limit. A claim by one party that new issues have been raised in evidence in the other party's rejoinder requiring further evidence in rebuttal is not the usual course of events. The Committee therefore does not consider that the Tribunal's decision was inconsistent with paragraph 19.1, whether or not the Tribunal expressly considered it.\n\n197.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal's decision were inconsistent with paragraph 19.1, for the reasons given above, the Committee does not consider that there was any inconsistency with the principle of equality of the parties or right of defence. Even if there may in that event have been a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (the principle of party autonomy), in the Committee's view, in all of the circumstances, it was not a *serious* departure justifying annulment of the Award. A \"serious\" departure \" *must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide* \".141 The Committee is not satisfied that any departure from the principle of party autonomy was serious, or that Argentina has been deprived of the benefit that that principle was intended to provide.\n\nSee paragraph 71 above.\n\n198.\n\nIt follows that this ground of annulment must be rejected.\n\n**(d) Closure of the proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n***(i) Background***\n--------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn a letter to the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 26 November 2006, the Claimants made reference to a meeting between representatives of the parties on 17 May 2006, and noted a disagreement between the parties as to the discussion that occurred at that meeting.\n\n200.\n\nIn a letter dated 18 January 2007, Argentina referred to the disagreement between the parties as to what had occurred at an informal meeting, stating that Argentina had \" *advised the tribunal to use all the technology available to detect who is lying and who is not* \", noted that the President of the Tribunal \" *states that it is not necessary to analyse the meaning of a meeting that was held between the parties, in view of previous considerations* \", said that because of a \" *new situation* \" Argentina \" *want[ed] to air* \" what transpired at the meeting, and maintained that Argentina had a \" *right to receive a reasonable reply on this issue* \".\n\n201.\n\nBy a letter to the parties dated March 22, 2007, the Secretary of the Tribunal stated:\n\n*On behalf of the Arbitral Tribunal, I write to inform you that the proceeding is declared closed as of today\u2019s date in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.*\n\n202.\n\nBy a letter to the Secretary of the Tribunal dated April 26, 2007, Argentina expressed its \" *profound concern as regards to the circumstances in which the proceedings were closed* \". It noted that the proceedings were closed only 14 days after Argentina had challenged the President of the Tribunal in the *Sempra* and *Camuzzi* cases,142 and only 6 days after Argentina had in those other cases presented its reasons for the challenge. The letter noted that the effect of the closure of the proceedings in the present case was that Argentina could no longer propose the disqualification of an arbitrator under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. The letter stated that Argentina objected to the closing of the proceedings in these circumstances. The letter further stated that in addition, the Tribunal had \" *not taken any decision with regard to the serious accusation made by the Argentine Republic in its note dated January 18, despite the fact that said note expressly requested a decision in this regard* \".\n\nProfessor Francisco Orrego-Vicu\u00f1a, who was President of the Tribunal in the present case, was also the president of the tribunal in *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16) and is the president of the tribunal in *Camuzzi International S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/2).\n\n203.\n\nBy a letter dated March 22, 2007, the Secretary of the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The President of the Tribunal, after having consulted with the Tribunal\u2019s members, has asked me to inform you of the following: The Tribunal, after having carefully examined the Respondent\u2019s letter of April 26, 2007 and the Claimant\u2019s letter of May 4, 2007, wishes to inform the parties, as a matter of courtesy, that the closing of the proceedings in this case was decided only in consideration to the advanced stage of deliberations and the fact that final translations and editing of the award were well under way.*\n\n***(ii) Arguments of the parties***\n-----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) There was still a request filed by Argentina on January 18, 2007 pending resolution as regards serious actions committed by ENRON representatives, which were extremely relevant for the present arbitration.\n\n(b) In spite of the seriousness and importance of the requests and claims made by Argentina, the Tribunal failed to make a decision in this regard and closed the proceeding, thus affecting Argentina's right to defence. Considering and assessing evidence is a crucial aspect of the fair and impartial assessment of the procedure. Failing to settle such a serious claim filed by Argentina warrants the annulment of the Award.\n\n(c) Closure of the proceedings only 14 days after Argentina Republic had proposed the disqualification of the President of the *Enron* tribunal in the *Sempra* and *Camuzzi* cases, and only 6 days after Argentina had explained in writing the grounds for such disqualification proposal, and even though a decision on Argentina's request was pending, made it impossible for the Tribunal to analyze the Claimants' attitude at the meeting held at the Argentine Treasury Attorney General's Office, in which the Claimants' attorneys stated that, if they received USD 40 million they would abandon this arbitration proceeding, when they demanded the payment of USD 453 or 639 million, depending on the calculation method.\n\n(d) Failing to settle such serious requests filed by Argentina before closing the proceedings was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in terms of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.143\n\nReferring to Schreuer Commentary at 645.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal's decision to close the proceedings was adopted 6 years after the case was filed and 15 months after the hearing on the merits and the post-hearing briefs were submitted.\n\n(b) Argentina had ample time to file a challenge to one of the arbitrators but never did so. This case had no relationship with the *Sempra* or *Camuzzi* cases, and if Argentina considered it appropriate to challenge the President of the Tribunal in this case, it could have done so earlier, or even after closure of the proceedings based on Rule 38(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Argentina's voluntary decision not to challenge an arbitrator cannot be used later as a valid ground for annulment.144\n\n(c) There were no \"pending requests\" at the time that the Tribunal decided to close the proceedings. Argentina's letter to the Tribunal dated January 8, 2007, merely requested the Tribunal to decide the truth of what was said in a settlement meeting that occurred long after the merits hearing had concluded, and it is hard to argue that there was any other pending request in the letter.\n\n(d) Since the parties did not settle the dispute, what occurred at settlement discussions long after the hearing on the merits was concluded was irrelevant to the proceeding.\n\n(e) It is not a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to decline to consider an issue that it considers to be irrelevant, merely because one of the parties considers it to be important.145\n\nReferring to *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 230.\n\nReferring to *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 244.\n\n***(iii) The Committee's views***\n---------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Committee finds that Argentina has not articulated clearly why the closure of the proceedings on March 22, 2007, amounted to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n207.\n\nArgentina's submissions appear to suggest that the closure of the proceedings deprived Argentina of any further opportunity to challenge any of the members of the Tribunal. However, Argentina does not clearly state that it would have challenged any of the members of the Tribunal but for the closure of the proceedings, or on what basis it would have brought such a challenge. Nor does Argentina address the question of why, if it had wanted to challenge any of the members of the Tribunal, it could not have done so earlier, before the proceedings were closed.\n\n208.\n\nThere is at best a very vague implication in Argentina's submissions that but for the closure of the proceedings on March 22, 2007, Argentina might have sought to challenge the President of the Tribunal on the same grounds as it had sought to challenge him in the *Sempra* or *Camuzzi* cases two weeks earlier. However, such a vague implication cannot be sufficient justification for annulment of an award. In the absence of any clear statement by Argentina that it would have challenged a member of the Tribunal, and that the closure of the proceedings prevented it from so doing, there is simply no basis for the Committee to consider whether closure of the proceedings prevented such a challenge.\n\n209.\n\nEven if there were such a clear statement by Argentina, it would be necessary for the Committee to consider whether Argentina could have brought such a challenge earlier, before the proceedings were closed. Argentina makes no submissions on this issue. There would also be a question of whether or not, as the Claimants argue, Argentina could have sought to reopen proceedings under Rule 38(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In the absence of details from Argentina as to the precise basis and circumstances of any challenge that it would have wished to make, it is not possible for the Committee to consider these questions.\n\n210.\n\nOn the basis of the material and arguments before it, the Committee therefore concludes that there can be no suggestion that the closure of proceedings on 22 March 2007, amounted to a serious departure from any fundamental rule of procedure on the basis that it prevented Argentina from challenging a member of the Tribunal.\n\n211.\n\nAs regards the allegations that had been made by Argentina concerning the meeting of representatives of the parties, the Committee notes that in order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the departure from such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.146 Argentina does not in its submissions explain how the Tribunal's decision to close the proceedings without expressly taking action in response to Argentina's letter of 18 January 2007, may have affected the outcome of the Award. Furthermore, for a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e), it is necessary for Argentina to establish the fundamental rule of procedure from which it is claimed that the Tribunal departed. There is no fundamental rule of procedure requiring a tribunal to undertake enquiries into the circumstances of a meeting between representatives of the parties whenever one party requests this. For a tribunal to decline to do so cannot in the Committee's view in any sense be considered inconsistent with any principles of equality or right of defence.\n\nSee paragraph 71 above.\n\n212.\n\nThe Committee considers this ground of annulment to be manifestly unfounded.\n\n**G. Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n213.\n\nIn its Application for Annulment, Argentina contends that to the extent that the Tribunal was correct to resort to sources of law outside the BIT, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention required the Tribunal to apply the law of Argentina, which it failed to do, thereby manifestly exceeding its powers, a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.147 Argentina also contends that the Award does not state the reasons on which it is based and does not provide reasons for its interpretation of the Licence and failed to analyse Argentina's arguments, a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.148\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 32-38.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 70 *et seq*.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*Interpretation of the Licence*\n\n*Generally*\n\n(a) The Tribunal said that it had analysed the extent to which Argentina's obligations were fulfilled in terms of Argentine law since \"the License is expressly subject to Argentine law in some key aspects\", but groundlessly and in manifest excess of power concluded that those obligations were not fulfilled.149\n\n*PPI adjustments*\n\n(b) The Tribunal expressed no grounds for its conclusions that Argentina guaranteed that the tariffs would be \" *adjusted semi-annually in* *accordance with the US PPI* \",150 and that \" *such understanding was also* *the Government\u2019s view at the time and for almost a whole decade\".151* nor analyzed the arguments put forward by Argentina.\n\n(c) The Tribunal stated that Decree 669/2000 confirmed the existence of the \"right\" to PPI-based adjustment since it referred to the adjustment as a \"legitimately acquired right\", but the Claimants could not in 1992 have had an expectation based on a decree issued in 2000.\n\n(d) The Tribunal derived rights from the Information Memorandum152 notwithstanding it was not prepared by the Argentine State153 and contained an express disclaimer that the Government of Argentina made no representation as to the accuracy, reliability or the completeness of the information it contained.154\n\n(e) The Tribunal made no analysis whatsoever of Argentina's arguments regarding the PPI matter,155 and said that it \"is persuaded\" by the Claimants' approach without explaining why.156\n\n(f) The Tribunal took in isolation one Article of the Licence (which referred to the PPI) and did not pay any attention to other provisions that provided context for it.\n\n(g) The Tribunal took into account the Bianchi Report, which was presented in violation of the rules of procedure.157\n\n(h) The Tribunal had no power to grant damages for the suspension of the PPI in 2000 and 2001 due to the Suspension Agreements, before the Emergency Law was enacted,158 as they were voluntary agreements; this finding contradicted a separate finding of the Tribunal that the question of the Trust Fund and its operation, to which TGS had agreed, \" *cannot be a matter of complaint before it* \".159\n\n(i) The Tribunal incorrectly found that the licensees only agreed to the suspension of the PPI-adjustment due to the fact that the amounts that would not be collected as a result of the suspension would be recovered later.160\n\n*Tariff calculation in US dollars*\n\n(j) The Tribunal did not give reasons for rejecting Argentina's argument that Article 18(2) of the Licence, which prohibited the Grantor to change the licence except with express agreement of the Licensee, was a prohibition applying specifically to the Executive branch as the grantor of the Licence, and which did not apply to Legislative branch which adopted the Emergency Law, or the Judicial branch, which issued the injunction of 17 August 2000.161\n\n(k) The Tribunal failed to consider certain arguments of Argentina, gave no reasons for rejecting certain arguments of Argentina, \"counter-argued\" against alleged arguments of Argentina which Argentina in fact never raised, discarded terms that were expressly agreed upon in the Licence, and gave no reasons for certain factual conclusions, thereby acting in an arbitrary fashion, failing to settle issues raised by the parties, and giving merely frivolous reasons.162\n\n(l) The Tribunal stated that \" *the Gas Decree and the Basic Rules of the License unequivocally refer to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars* \", when the Gas Law makes no mention of tariffs calculations in US dollars.\n\n(m) The English version of the Award does not mention the Gas Law, such that the Spanish and English versions contradict each other.\n\n(n) The Tribunal did not provide reasons for rejecting the expert opinion of Professor Comadira, and the Tribunal did not even mention his report in Chapter IV of the Award.\n\n*The issue of TGS\u2019s and CIESA\u2019s financing policy*\n\n(o) The Tribunal did not decide on this allegation of Argentina and discarded Argentina's arguments without analysing them, and violated the principle of equality between the parties because it did consider the Claimants' arguments.163\n\n(p) The Tribunal's finding that no claim was made by ENARGAS that the policy followed by TGS might be contrary to the regulatory framework or the License164 was false and contradictory.\n\n*Rejection of the theory of* \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \"\n\n(q) By applying the concept of *force majeure* in compliance with Article 23 of the ILC Articles in its analysis of the theory of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" under Argentine law, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, which was Argentine law.\n\n(r) The Tribunal did not analyse Professor Comadira's report on unforeseeability in Argentine law.\n\n(s) The Tribunal did not apply the relevant domestic law, did not deal with the point in the Comadira Report as to the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary risk, and did not analyse the relevant point in the Roubini Report or the case law of the Argentine Supreme Court.\n\n*Liability under Argentine law*\n\n(t) The Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in relation to Argentina's liability under domestic law.165\n\n(u) Professor Comadira's evidence as to the legality of the challenged measures under internal law were discarded for no reasons and remained unanalysed.\n\n(v) The acceptance and use of Alberto Bianchi's report to support this core part of the Award constituted a serious violation of a rule of procedure.166\n\n(w) The Tribunal's analysis of the consistency between the challenged regulations and the internal law is faulty and leads to the nonapplication of the applicable law.167\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 231.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 101-102, 264.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 102.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6

paragraphs 187-198 above.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 218-232.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*Interpretation of the Licence*\n\n*Generally*\n\n(a) Argentina's claim is a disguised appeal on the merits of the case, and Argentina impermissibly seeks to reargue the merits of the issues.\n\n*PPI adjustments*\n\n(b) Argentina's claim seems to be an alleged inadequacy of reasons rather than their absence, which is not a basis for annulment, the requirement to provide reasons not being a duty to provide reasons that convince the losing party.168\n\n(c) In relying on a binding contractual provision (the Licence) in order to ascertain whether there was a right to the PPI tariff adjustment, the Tribunal satisfied the requirement of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, and its decision is consistent with other arbitration awards.169\n\n(d) The Tribunal further supported its decision by pointing to the provisions of the Gas Regulatory Framework, on which the License's provisions were based, and provided additional reasons based on the Government's previous practice, the terms of Decree 669/00, and the representations made in the Information Memorandum.170\n\n(e) The Tribunal did not state that Claimants based their investment decision on the terms of Decree 669/00, but simply pointed out that the Government's own statements in the decree confirmed the Tribunal's reading of the Gas Regulatory Framework.171\n\n(f) The Tribunal cited the Information Memorandum as an element that also confirmed, rather than established, the Tribunal's conclusion,172 and whether it was legally binding is irrelevant. The Tribunal acknowledged that the Information Memorandum was prepared by private consultants and it contained a disclaimer regarding the Government's liability, but stated that if an error had been made in the statements in the Information Memorandum it would not have passed unnoticed by the Government, which had a duty to issue a clarification.173\n\n(g) The Tribunal correctly found that the Claimants were entitled to compensation based on the terms of the 2000 and 2001 suspension agreements as the Tribunal found that they were executed \"in January and June 2000 on the basis that the amounts not collected as a result of the suspension would be recouped later and with interests\".174\n\n*Tariff calculation in US dollars*\n\n(h) The Tribunal devoted almost 50 paragraphs to analyzing the US dollar tariff issue,175 and its reasoning provides a coherent basis for its decision on this issue.\n\n(i) The Regulatory Framework granted a right to calculate the tariff in US dollars, and the same reasoning was followed by tribunals in other cases.176\n\n(j) The Tribunal analyzed and rejected Argentina's position regarding Section 18 of the License,177 as did the Tribunal in the *Sempra* Award.178\n\n(k) Any discrepancy between the English and Spanish versions of the Award should have been made by Argentina the subject of the procedure under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(l) The Tribunal has full discretion to assess the probative value of any evidence produced by the parties,179 and the fact that the Award contains reasons different from those argued by Argentina's expert demonstrates the Tribunal's implicit rejection of the latter's position.\n\n(m) The Tribunal's statement that in the context of a long period of economic turmoil, investors would not have been attracted to participate in the privatization process unless specific guarantees were provided in respect of the stability of their agreement,180 is fully supported by the evidence in the record, and other tribunals on the same fact also reached the conclusion that US dollar tariffs were one of the main features of the Regulatory Framework.181\n\n(n) The Tribunal duly dealt with Argentina's argument related to an alleged incompleteness of the Gas Regulatory framework.182\n\n(o) The Tribunal provided reasons for its interpretation of the Privatisation Committee minutes183 that was identical to the conclusion reached in the *Sempra* Award,184 and even if its interpretation were inaccurate, that would not provide grounds for annulment.\n\n(p) The Tribunal did analyse Argentina's argument regarding \"country risk\",185 and its findings are consistent with at least two other awards.186\n\n*The issue of TGS\u2019s and CIESA\u2019s financing policy*\n\n(q) The Tribunal dealt with the financing policy issue in two different sections of the Award and expressly rejected Argentina's argument,187 and in doing so, gave its reasons.\n\n*Rejection of the theory of* \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \"\n\n(r) The Tribunal applied the BIT (which is also part of Argentina's domestic law) as *lex specialis*, complemented by customary international law where necessary, and these sources prevail over the law of the host State which plays a limited role in adjudicating the merits of a treaty dispute.188 Article 23 of the ILC Articles was a valid source of law.189\n\n(s) After identifying the requirements for application of the theory, the Tribunal simply found that those conditions were not met in the present case.190\n\n*Liability under Argentine law*\n\n(t) The Award includes an in-depth analysis of Claimants' rights under Argentine law and the subsequent impact of Argentina's measures on those rights,191 followed by a determination of the applicable standards for emergency situations established by the Argentine Supreme Court,192 followed by a finding that those requirements had not been met.193\n\n(u) The Tribunal did not apply the Civil Code, but supported its findings with the Gas Law, the Regulatory Framework and the License, which are part of Argentine administrative and regulatory law.194\n\n(v) Even if the Tribunal erred by applying the wrong law, which it did not, this would not constitute a manifest excess of power, since the outcome of the case would not have been different.\n\n(w) Some Argentine case law which the Tribunal is said by Argentina not to have considered was not submitted as evidence to the Tribunal during the merits phase and therefore have no place in annulment proceedings,195 and these cases were distinguishable and did not alter the basic principles in the case law cited by the Tribunal.\n\n(x) It is sufficient that the Tribunal examined the parties' submissions on Argentine law and stated reasons since a more detailed review of the Tribunal's application of Argentine law is beyond the scope of this annulment proceeding.196\n\nReferring to *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 79;

Such grounds for annulment will similarly exist where the tribunal purports to apply a law other than the law applicable under Article 42, or where while purporting to apply the law applicable under Article 42, the tribunal manifestly applies a different body of law.*202\n\nSee, for instance, *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 136.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 136 (footnotes omitted).\n\n219.\n\nThe Committee further agrees with earlier case law to the effect that \" *while* *non-application by the tribunal of the law applicable under Article 42 may be a ground for annulment, the* incorrect application *by the tribunal of the applicable law is not* \".203 Only failure to apply the applicable law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of power on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 51(1)(b) of the Convention.204\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 137.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment, May 16, 1986 (\" *Amco I* Annulment Decision\"), \u00b6 23, cited with approval in *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 85, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 137.\n\n220.\n\nThe Committee additionally agrees that its task of distinguishing between, on the one hand, \" *failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment* \", and, on the other hand, \" *misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal* \", is one that must be approached with caution.205 The Committee cannot accept any suggestion that where a tribunal errs in articulating or applying the applicable law, it thereby ultimately fails to apply the applicable law and thus manifestly exceeds its powers. Such an argument, if accepted, and even if confined to cases where an error of law by the tribunal is manifest, would obliterate the distinction which an annulment committee is required carefully to maintain between non-application of the applicable law and alleged error in applying the applicable law. An error of law, like an error of fact, is not of itself a ground of annulment.206 This being the case, in circumstances where it has not been established that the tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, there will normally be no occasion for an *ad hoc* committee to enquire whether or not the tribunal may have erred in its articulation or application of the applicable law, or whether the tribunal may have made an error of fact.\n\n*Amco I* Annulment Decision \u00b6 23, cited with approval in *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 85, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 137.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.08-5.09, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 53 and *MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 84; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 121.\n\n221.\n\nThe scope of the ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention (failure to state reasons) has been considered above.207 The Committee reiterates that a tribunal is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of the questions that it decides; that this ground of annulment only applies in a clear case when there has been a failure by the tribunal to state any reasons for its decision on a particular question, and not in a case where there has merely been a failure by the tribunal to state correct or convincing reasons; and that \" *the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law* \" *.*\n\nSee paragraphs 72-77 above.\n\n222.\n\nArticle 48(3) of the ICSID Convention states that \"The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based\". Article 52(1)(e) provides for a ground of annulment in cases where the award \"has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\". As has been noted, pursuant to these provisions, a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions (\"pretensiones\")* submitted to it, but is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions. Similarly, the Committee considers that the tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the *questions*. This requires the tribunal to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or did not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision*, but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons*.\n\n223.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n224.\n\nThe claim brought by the Claimants in this case was for alleged violations of the BIT. In the Award, the Tribunal found that there were breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was responsible, and determined an amount of compensation that Argentina was to pay the Claimants in respect of those breaches of the BIT. The Committee considers that in relation to such a claim, the applicable law is that identified in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision as follows:\n\n*Each of [the] claims in this case was for an alleged breach of the BIT. The BIT is an international treaty between Argentina and the United States. By definition, a treaty is governed by international law, and not by municipal law. It is a fundamental principle that \"* [a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty *\". In any claim for breach of an investment treaty, the question whether or not there has been a breach of the treaty must therefore be determined, not through the application of the municipal law of any State, but through the application of the terms of the treaty to the facts of the case, in accordance with general principles of international law, including principles of the international law of treaties.* *Bearing in mind that an investment treaty, whether bilateral or multilateral, is itself a source of international law as between the States parties to that treaty, the applicable law in any claim for a breach of that treaty can thus be said to be the treaty itself specifically, and international law generally.*\n\n*Furthermore, in arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention, the tribunal also must comply with the terms of the ICSID Convention, which is also an international treaty to be interpreted and applied in accordance with general principles of international law, including principles of the international law of treaties.... [I]n a claim for breach of an investment treaty, the application by the tribunal of the* *terms of the investment treaty and of international law as the applicable law is foreseen by the words* ''and such rules of international law as may be applicable\" *in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention*.208\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 146-147 (footnotes omitted).\n\n225.\n\nThe Committee reaches the same conclusion as in the *Azurix* case that in the present case, the law applicable under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention to the Claimants' claims of breaches of the BIT was \" *the ICSID Convention,... the BIT and... applicable international law\"209*\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award 14 July 2006 \u00b6 67 (*Azurix* Award); approved in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 148.\n\n226.\n\nAs the *ad hoc* committee then went on to say in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision:\n\n*In some cases, it may be an express term of the investment treaty that the host State is required to comply with specified provisions of its own municipal law. In such cases, a breach by the host State of municipal law may thus amount to a breach of the treaty. Although municipal law does not as such form part of the law applicable to a claim for breach of a treaty, in such cases it may be necessary to determine whether there has been a breach of municipal law as a step in determining whether there has been a breach of the treaty....*\n\n*However, even in this situation, municipal law would not thereby become part of the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention for purposes of determining whether there was a breach of Article II.2(c) of the BIT.* *Rather, any breach of municipal law that might be established would be a fact or element to which the terms of the BIT and international law would be applied in order to determine whether there was a breach of Article II.2(c).*210\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 149, 151.\n\n227.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considered the law applicable to the dispute in paragraphs 203 to 209 of the Award. The Tribunal said, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*The Respondent is right in arguing that domestic law is not confined to the determination of factual questions. It has indeed a broader role, as it is evident in this very case from the pleadings and arguments of the parties that have relied heavily on the Gas Law and generally the regulatory framework of the gas industry, just as they have relied on many other rules of the Argentine legal system, including the Constitution, the Civil Code, specialized legislation and* *the decisions of courts. The License itself is governed by the legal order of the Argentine Republic and it must be interpreted in its light....*\n\n*While on occasions writers and decisions have tended to consider the application of domestic law or international law as a kind of dichotomy, this is far from being the case. In fact, both have a complementary role to perform and this has begun to be recognized....*\n\n*The Tribunal must also note that in examining the Argentine law as pertinent to various issues disputed by the parties, it finds that there is generally no inconsistency with international law as far as the basic principles governing the matter are concerned. The Tribunal will accordingly apply both Argentine law and international law to the extent pertinent and relevant to the decision of the various claims submitted.*211\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 206-207, 209.\n\n228.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is unclear from these paragraphs precisely what role the Tribunal considered that it was required to accord to international law and to domestic law respectively in resolving the dispute before it. It therefore becomes necessary to consider the Tribunal's reasoning in the parts of the Award where the Tribunal ultimately gives its decision on the claimed violations of the BIT.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the conduct for which Argentina was responsible constituted violations of two provisions of the BIT, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" clause, and the \"umbrella\" clause.\n\n230.\n\nIn relation to the fair and equitable treatment clause, the key paragraphs of the Award stating the reasons for finding a breach of this provision were paragraphs 264 to 267, in which the Tribunal said:\n\n*264. The measures in question in this case have beyond any doubt substantially changed the legal and business framework under which the investment was decided and implemented. Argentina in the early 1990s constructed a regulatory framework for the gas sector containing specific guarantees to attract foreign capital to an economy historically unstable and volatile. As part of this regulatory framework, Argentina guaranteed that tariffs would be calculated in US dollars, converted into pesos for billing purposes, adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the* *US PPI and sufficient to cover costs and a reasonable rate of return. It further guaranteed that tariffs would not be subject to freezing or price controls without compensation.* *Foreign investors were specifically targeted to invest in the privatization of public utilities in the gas sector. Substantial foreign investment was undertaken on the strength of such guarantees, including the investment made by Enron in TGS.*\n\n*265. The Tribunal observes that it was in reliance upon the conditions established by the Respondent in the regulatory framework for the gas sector that Enron embarked on its investment in TGS. Given the scope of Argentina\u2019s privatization process, its international marketing, and the statutory enshrinement of the tariff regime, Enron had reasonable grounds to rely on such conditions.*\n\n*266. A decade later, however, the guarantees of the tariff regime that had seduced so many foreign investors, were dismantled. Where there was certainty and stability for investors, doubt and ambiguity are the order of the day. The long-term business outlook enabled by the tariff regime, has been transformed into a day-to-day discussion about what comes next. Tariffs have been frozen for almost five years.* *The recomposition of the tariff regime is subject to a protracted renegotiation process imposed on the public utilities that has failed to provide a final and definitive framework for the operation of business in the energy sector.*\n\n*267. The Respondent might be right in distinguishing this case from the factual scenarios that recent decisions have faced, but this does not mean that Argentina\u2019s acts are consistent with the meaning of the protection under the Treaty. It is clear that the \u2018stable legal framework\u2019 that induced the investment is no longer in place and that a definitive framework has not been made available for almost five years.*\n\n*268. Even assuming that the Respondent was guided by the best of intentions, which the Tribunal has no reason to doubt, there is here an objective breach of the fair and equitable treatment due under the Treaty. The Tribunal thus holds that the standard established in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has not been observed and that to the extent that it results in a detriment to the Claimants\u2019 rights it will give rise to compensation.*\n\n231.\n\nThese paragraphs contain no reference to any liability on the part of Argentina under *Argentine* law. There is no suggestion that the finding of liability for breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT was premised on any finding that Argentina was in breach of, or liable to the Claimants or TGS or any other person, under Argentine domestic law. Rather, the Committee considers it clear from these paragraphs that the basis of the Tribunal's decision was essentially that:\n\n(a) as a matter of *fact*, Argentina constructed a regulatory framework for the gas sector containing specific guarantees to attract foreign capital to an economy historically unstable and volatile (paragraph 264);\n\n(b) as a matter of *fact*, Enron undertook investment in Argentina (by investing in TGS) on the strength of those guarantees, and had reasonable grounds to rely on those guarantees (paragraphs 264-265);\n\n(c) as a matter of *fact*, a decade later those guarantees were dismantled (paragraphs 266) and the \"stable legal framework\" that induced the investment was no longer in place (paragraph 267);\n\n(d) as a matter of *law*, this amounted to a violation by Argentina to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause (paragraphs 267-268).\n\n232.\n\nFrom a reading of these paragraphs, it is in the Committee's view apparent that on the reasoning adopted by the Tribunal, Argentine domestic law was not relevant to the Tribunal's decision in respect of the claimed violation of the fair and equitable treatment clause, except in relation to the finding referred to at (a) in the previous paragraph. That is to say, in determining whether the Claimants were attracted to invest in Argentina by particular guarantees provided for in the regulatory framework for the gas sector, it was necessary to determine whether the alleged guarantees (including the semi-annual US PPI adjustments and the calculation of tariffs in US dollars) were indeed part of the regulatory framework at the time that the investment was made. If the regulatory regime did include these particular guarantees, it would in the Committee's view follow from the Tribunal's reasoning that any subsequent measures taken by Argentina to dismantle those guarantees in circumstances where the Claimants had reasonably relied on them when making their investment (other than measures taken in accordance with the mechanisms provided for in the regulatory framework and Licence itself212) would amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause, even if those measures were entirely lawful under Argentine domestic law, and even if those measures gave rise to no liability on the part of Argentina under Argentine domestic law. In those circumstances, the measures, although lawful under Argentine law, would in international law be contrary to the protections afforded by the BIT.\n\nSee for instance Award \u00b6\u00b6 104, 143-144, 228-230.\n\n233.\n\nIn relation to the umbrella clause, the key paragraphs of the Award stating the reasons for finding a breach of this provision were paragraphs 274 to 276, in which the Tribunal said:\n\n*274. Under its ordinary meaning the phrase \u2018any obligation\u2019 refers to obligations regardless of their nature. Tribunals interpreting this expression have found it to cover both contractual obligations such as payment as well as obligations assumed through law or regulation. \u2018Obligations\u2019 covered by the \u2018umbrella clause\u2019 are nevertheless limited by their object: \u2018with regard to investments\u2019.*\n\n*275. Through the Gas Law and its implementing legislation, the Respondent assumed \u2018obligations with regard to investments\u2019: tariffs calculated in US dollars converted to pesos for billing purposes, linked to the US PPI and sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return were intended to establish a tariff regime that assured the influx of capital into the newly privatized companies such as TGS and ensured the value of such investment. The dismantling of these guarantees would suffice to establish a violation of the obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment.*\n\n*276. In addition, the prohibition of price controls without indemnification and the prohibition of License amendments without consent, although contained in the License were also approved by decree and formed part of the implementing legislation that established the tariff regime.* *The obliteration of these commitments likewise entails a violation of obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment.*\n\n*277. The Tribunal concludes accordingly that the breach of the obligations noted undertaken both under contract and law and regulation in respect of the investment have* *resulted in the breach of the protection provided under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c). [Footnotes omitted.]*\n\n234.\n\nAgain, these paragraphs contain no suggestion that the finding of liability for breach of the umbrella clause was premised on any finding of liability under Argentine law. Again, the Committee considers it clear enough that the basis of the Tribunal's decision that:\n\n(a) as a matter of *fact*, through the Gas Law and its implementing legislation, Argentina assumed obligations with regard to the Claimants' investment (paragraph 275);\n\n(b) as a matter of *fact*, Argentina subsequently dismantled those guarantees, and this suffices to establish a violation of the umbrella clause (paragraphs 275-276); and\n\n(d) as a matter of *law*, this amounted to a violation by Argentina to a breach of the umbrella clause (paragraphs 276-277).\n\n235.\n\nFrom a reading of these paragraphs, it is once more in the Committee's view apparent that on the Tribunal's reasoning, Argentine domestic law was relevant to the Tribunal's decision only in relation to the finding referred to at (a) in the previous paragraph. That is to say, in determining whether Argentina assumed particular obligations with regard to the Claimants' investment through the Gas Law and its implementing legislation, it was necessary to determine whether the alleged obligations (including the semi-annual US PPI adjustments and the calculation of tariffs in US dollars) were indeed once part of the Gas Law and its implementing legislation. If so, it would in the Committee's view follow from the Tribunal's reasoning that any subsequent measures taken by Argentina to dismantle those obligations (other than measures taken in accordance with the mechanisms provided for in the regulatory framework and Licence itself213) would amount to a breach of the umbrella clause, even if those measures were entirely lawful under Argentine domestic law, and even if those measures gave rise to no liability on the part of Argentina under Argentine domestic law. Again, in those circumstances, the measures, although lawful under Argentine law, would in international law be contrary to the protections afforded by the BIT.\n\nSee for instance Award \u00b6\u00b6 104, 143-144, 228-230.\n\n236.\n\nThe Committee further notes that, as discussed above, in determining the issue referred to in paragraphs 231(a) and 234(a) above, it was on the Tribunal's reasoning not necessary for the Tribunal to find that the Gas Law and its implementing legislation conferred rights or guarantees specifically *on the Claimants*, but only to find that guarantees had been given and obligations undertaken with respect *to the Claimants\u2019 investment214*\n\nSee paragraphs 112-117 above.\n\n237.\n\nIt is beyond the mandate of the Committee to determine whether or not the Tribunal's reasoning was correct. The role of the Committee is confined to the grounds of annulment in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and as noted above, even if the Tribunal erred in law, this would not be a ground of annulment. The Committee does however note that it is well established that conduct for which a State is responsible may constitute a breach of international law, including a breach of an investment protection treaty, even where the conduct gives rise to no liability on the part of the State under domestic law.215\n\nSee for instance *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 143-147.\n\n238.\n\nWhile the Committee considers the reading of the above paragraphs of the Award to be sufficiently clear, it notes that the Tribunal made certain statements that could be read as inconsistent with it. At paragraph 210 of the Award, the Tribunal said that \" *It is now necessary to examine the Argentine law governing contracts in order to determine whether liability exists under the domestic legal order* \". At paragraph 230 it said that the unilateral nature of the measures taken by Argentina \" *resulted in the inconsistency of the measures taken with the domestic legal order* \". At paragraph 231 it further said that:\n\n*The inescapable conclusion for the Tribunal to reach is that in considering the claims*  *purely from the point of view of the Argentine legislation as one of the laws applicable to the dispute,* *the obligations which the Argentine Republic had and the commitments it undertook under the License were not observed. This is particularly significant in view that the License is expressly subject to Argentine law in some key* *respects, without prejudice to the effect that these legal arrangements have under the Treaty and international law.* *Liability is thus the consequence* *of such breach and*  *there is no legal excuse under the Argentine legislation which could justify the non-compliance,* *as the very conditions set out by this legislation and the decisions of courts have not been met.*216\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n239.\n\nAt paragraph 233, the Tribunal added that it \" *must now examine the question of whether the breach of the License and its regulatory regime,*  *in addition to its assessment under Argentine legislation,* *amounts to a breach of the Treaty guarantees* \".217\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n240.\n\nAt first blush, these passages could be read as suggesting that the Tribunal, in contradiction to the discussion above, considered that Argentina would only be liable for a breach of the BIT if Argentina was liable under Argentine law in respect of the measures taken. However, the Committee considers it to be sufficiently clear on a closer reading of the Award that this is not the case.\n\n241.\n\nThe section of the Award dealing with liability under Argentine law (paragraphs 211-212) begins by referring to Argentina's argument that the guarantees were as a matter of Argentine law owed to TGS and not the Claimants, and that there was a risk of double recovery if both the company and the shareholders could claim in respect of the measures adopted by Argentina.218 The Tribunal's response was to say that \" *this question has already been decided in the decision on jurisdiction and it shall not be discussed again here* \".219 Argentina's challenge to the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction, including the Tribunal's response to Argentina's argument with respect to double recovery, has been considered by the Committee above.220 For the reasons there given, the Committee considers it clear that the Tribunal found that the right of the Claimants to bring an ICSID claim was not limited to violations of their rights *qua* shareholders under Argentine law, but extended to any breach of the protections accorded by the BIT to the Claimants' \"investment\" as defined in the BIT. This reference to the decision on jurisdiction in paragraph 211 of the Award, in the section of the Award dealing with liability under Argentine law, would thus appear to confirm again that Argentina's liability for a breach of the BIT did not in the Tribunal's view require a prior finding of liability under Argentine law.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 211-212.\n\nAward \u00b6 211.\n\nSee paragraphs 112-127 above.\n\n242.\n\nThe remainder of the section of the Award dealing with liability under Argentine law is concerned with the principles of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" and \"state of emergency\" under Argentine law. The Tribunal found that neither of these principles applied in the present case, without however stating clearly what difference it would have made to the BIT claim if Argentina had been entitled to invoke either of them. The fact that the Tribunal considered Argentina's arguments concerning these principles suggests that the Tribunal considered that if they had been applicable, they might have precluded liability for breach of the BIT.\n\n243.\n\nIn its Memorial on Annulment, Argentina states that in the proceedings before the Tribunal, it argued as follows:\n\n*What Argentina... stated is that the Licence agreed to by TGS could not be unilaterally modified by the Executive branch, but that nonetheless it was expressly subject to regulation by Congress. This original agreement\u2014this is, the possibility that the contract and the legal framework could be modified by a subsequent law\u2014should have been part of the legitimate expectations of Enron and Ponderosa when investing in TGS. Therefore, in principle, the Licence being modified by a law from Congress could never have frustrated those legitimate expectations or constituted a violation of fair and equitable treatment.*\n\n244.\n\nIt may be that the Tribunal accepted that this argument might be valid in relation to the principles of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" and \"state of emergency\" under Argentine law: that is to say, that at the time the investment was made, the guarantees were given and obligations were undertaken subject to principles of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" and \"state of emergency\", which were legal principles existing in Argentine law at the time that the investment was made. However, it is clear that the Tribunal rejected the argument that the guarantees were given and obligations were undertaken subject to a possibility of unilateral amendment at any time by Congress or the judiciary. The Tribunal said that:\n\n*153.... The Respondent has argued that as the prohibition of Clause 18.2 refers to the License not being modified by the Licensor, and the Licensor is the Executive Branch of Government, any measures or effects arising from congressional action, such as the Emergency Law, or from judicial decisions, such as the US PPI injunction, are not adopted by the Licensor and hence not envisaged in the prohibition of unilateral modification.*\n\n*154. Ingenuous as this argument might be it is no more than a play of words because the Executive Branch binds the State in guaranteeing certain rights to foreign investors. Furthermore, quite evidently any State action, governmental, legislative or judicial, must respect the rights acquired under a contract. If contract rights were at the mercy of other branches of the State the rule of law, under both domestic and international law, would be seriously in jeopardy, a view which is not quite likely to be accepted in an arbitration which, at least in part, is governed by international law.*\n\n245.\n\nThe Committee considers it to be clear that the Tribunal did not state here that the Argentine State would be liable *under Argentine law* for any unilateral modification of the Licence through legislation adopted by Congress or through judicial decisions. Rather, the Tribunal was here stating that Argentina could not escape liability *under international law* for a breach of the BIT by contending, in reliance on Clause 18.2 of the Licence, that Argentina had for purposes of its BIT obligations only guaranteed and undertaken the obligation that there would be no unilateral modification to the Licence conditions by the Executive branch of government (as opposed to the Legislative or Judicial branches). The Committee considers it necessarily implicit in what the Tribunal stated that even if as a matter of Argentine law the Licence only bound the Executive branch of government, for purposes of Argentina's BIT obligations, guarantees given and obligations undertaken by the Executive branch of government applied to future measures taken by any branch of government. The Committee considers the reasons for rejecting Argentina's arguments to be sufficiently clear.\n\n246.\n\nIn conclusion, for these reasons, the Committee is of the view that the law applicable to the Claimant's claims was the ICSID Convention, the BIT and applicable international law, and that on the Tribunal's reasoning, Argentine law was relevant in determining whether Argentina had for purposes of the BIT in fact given the claimed guarantees and undertaken the claimed obligations in respect of the Claimants' investment (as defined in the BIT). The Tribunal also found it relevant to consider whether as a matter of Argentine law the principles of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" and \"state of emergency\" were applicable in the circumstances of this case. The Committee finds that in adopting the approach that it did, the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law.\n\n*Interpretation of the Licence*\n-------------------------------\n\n*PPI adjustments*\n-----------------\n\n247.\n\nAt paragraph 43 of the Award, the Tribunal found that:\n\n*In order to facilitate the process of privatization, a Standard Gas Transportation License or \"Model Licence\" was approved by Decree 2255/92 including the applicable Basic Rules; all such rules were embodied in the License actually signed by TGS and the Government of Argentina and approved by Decree 2458/92. The duration of the License is of 35 years, leading up to 2027. An \"Information Memorandum\" concerning the privatization of Gas del Estado, the former State-owned transportation and distribution company, together with a \"Pliego\" explaining the bidding rules and the legal and contractual arrangements, were provided to prospective investors so as to organize the bidding process.*\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal found, at paragraph 101 of the Award, that:\n\n*The Tribunal must first note that it is correct that Article 41 of the Gas Law, while providing for adjustment of tariffs in accordance with a formula based on international market indicators, also related this formula to the change in value of goods and services. The formula, however, was not defined under the Law. This task was left to the Basic Rules of the License, which provided in this connection that tariffs were to be adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the US PPI. This was also the information conveyed to investors by the Information Memorandum.*221\n\nAward \u00b6 101.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants' argument was that this semi-annual US PPI adjustment was a *right* and that it \" *was an essential feature of the tariff system devised for the privatization, as it would prevent erosion of the US dollar value of the tariffs* \".222 Argentina's arguments, as referred to in paragraphs 97-98 of the Award, were that Article 41 of the Gas Law expressly related the adjustment to *the change in value of goods and services of the industry* and was only to reflect the evolution of changes in costs and not to ensure a given value of tariffs in US dollars. Argentina argued that the US PPI made sense at the beginning when the US indexes were lower than those of Argentina, but that the US PPI lost any meaning when the economy in Argentina went into recession and deflation. Paragraph 99 of the Award refers to an additional argument by Argentina that the suspension of the adjustment was first agreed with the licensees before being ordered by the judicial injunction of August 2000.\n\nAward \u00b6 96.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately reached the conclusion that \" *the licensees had a right to the US PPI adjustment under both the regulatory framework and the License, confirmed by the context and the practice of the privatization* \".223\n\nAward \u00b6 103.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning that lead to this conclusion is contained in paragraphs 101 to 104 of the Award.\n\n252.\n\nParagraph 101 of the Award has been quoted above. In that paragraph, the Tribunal found that Article 41 of the Gas Law provided that tariffs would be in accordance with a formula based on certain factors (international market indicators and change in value of goods and services) but that Article 41 itself did not define what that formula would be. The Tribunal further found in this paragraph that the formula was defined in the Basic Rules of the Licence, which provided for the semi-annual US PPI adjustments.\n\n253.\n\nThis paragraph of the Award needs to be read together with paragraph 43 of the Award, also quoted above, in which the Tribunal finds that the Basic Rules \" *were embodied in the License actually signed by TGS and the Government of Argentina and approved by Decree 2458/92* \".\n\n254.\n\nThe reasoning of the Tribunal might have been easier to follow if the relevant provisions of the Gas Law, the Basic Rules, the Licence, and the relevant Decrees had been set out in the Award. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that it is necessarily implicit in the language of the Award that the Tribunal reasoned as follows. The Basic Rules provided for semi-annual US PPI adjustments. The Basic Rules were embodied in the Licence signed by TGS and the provision in the Basic Rules providing for the PPI adjustments thus became a term of the Licence. This provision of the Basic Rules was consistent with Article 41 of the Gas Law and served the purpose of defining the formula referred to in only general terms in Article 41.\n\n255.\n\nIn paragraph 102 of the Award, the Tribunal then went on to say that:\n\n*The Tribunal is persuaded that such understanding was also the Government\u2019s view at the time and for almost a whole decade. This explains that Decree 669/00, dealing specifically with this mechanism, referred to the adjustment under it as a \"legitimately acquired right\", thus involving an unequivocal recognition of the existence of such a right.*\n\n256.\n\nThe first sentence of this paragraph must be read together with paragraph 62 of the Award, in which the Tribunal states that \" *Throughout the 1990s the regulatory system devised for the gas transportation sector operated without difficulties, including most significantly the periodic modification of tariffs to reflect changes in the cost of natural gas and the adjustment of tariffs, both up and down, following the variations in the US PPI* \". The Committee considers that it is sufficiently clear that the Tribunal was here stating, in effect, that the practice of the parties in the first period of operation of the Licence for almost a decade was consistent with the conclusion that the Tribunal had reached in paragraph 101 of the Award, and that from this the Tribunal was also satisfied that the Government of Argentina shared the understanding that the semiannual US PPI adjustments were in fact a term of the Licence. While it is true, as Argentina argues, that there may have been a different explanation for the US PPI adjustments in the initial period, the Committee finds that there is nothing inherently absurd or illogical in the Tribunal taking into account, in determining whether a particular interpretation of the Licence was correct, that the practice of the parties in the period immediately following the conclusion of the Licence was consistent with that interpretation.\n\n257.\n\nSimilarly, although Decree 669/00 was adopted many years after the Licence was concluded, the Committee finds nothing inherently absurd or illogical in the Tribunal taking into account, in determining whether a particular right was provided for in the Licence, that a decree adopted years after the event referred to the semi-annual US PPI adjustments as a *\"legitimately acquired right\".*\n\n258.\n\nThe last sentence of paragraph 101 indicates that this interpretation was also confirmed by the Information Memorandum. In paragraph 103, the Tribunal addressed Argentina's argument that the Information Memorandum was prepared by private consultants and that it contained a disclaimer that the Government of Argentina was not responsible for its contents. Contrary to what Argentina argues, the Committee can find no suggestion in the Award that the Tribunal considered that the Information Memorandum was itself in any way a source of the right to the PPI adjustments. The Committee considers it clear that the Tribunal was here merely stating that the *fact* that the Information Memorandum was also consistent with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal in paragraph 101 of the Award, and the *fact* that the Government of Argentina never took steps to correct what was stated in for Information Memorandum, were matters that further supported the conclusion reached in paragraph 101.\n\n259.\n\nThe final sentence of paragraph 103 of the Award, which deals with the Information Memorandum, states that \" *It is thus the conclusion of the Tribunal that the licensees had a right to the US PPI adjustment under both the regulatory framework and the License, confirmed by the context and the practice of the privatization* \". The Committee considers it to be clear from context that this sentence is in fact intended to be a general conclusion to what was stated in paragraphs 101, 102 and the earlier sentences of paragraph 103, and that the conclusion expressed in that sentence is not based solely on the considerations elaborated in paragraph 103.\n\n260.\n\nIn paragraph 104 of the Award, the Tribunal then proceeded to note that this interpretation of the licence was not inconsistent with the ability of the Government to \"change its mind later\" in the light of changing economic conditions, since adjustment mechanisms existed under the regulatory framework, and added that any different route taken by the Government could not be to the detriment of investors' rights such that \" *any ensuing damage must be compensated if legally justified* \".\n\n261.\n\nArgentina makes a number of specific complaints in respect of the Tribunal's reasoning in this part of the Award, such as that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal referred to,224 but gave no reasons for rejecting, Argentina's argument that the purpose of adjusting rates on the basis of a price index was not to guarantee profits in a foreign currency but to reflect the evolution of costs of public utility providers in the periods between periodical tariff recalculations.\n\n(b) The Tribunal referred to,225 but gave no reasons for rejecting, Argentina's argument that there was a specific reason to adopt the chosen adjustment methods and that it became unreasonable to rely on those methods in the late 1990s when that reason no longer existed.\n\n(c) The Tribunal, when dealing with the PPI-based adjustment issue, made no mention of relevant evidence of the expert Professor Nouriel Roubini and the witness Charles Massano, as if that evidence had not been presented.\n\n(d) The Tribunal took in isolation one Article of the Licence (which referred to the PPI) and did not pay any attention to other provisions that provided context for it, such as the provisions to the effect that the adjustment methodology should reflect the changes in the value of goods and services, that the rate should guarantee the lowest cost for consumers that is compatible with the security of the facilities, and that the licence should be interpreted in accordance with Argentine law. Moreover, the Tribunal did not take into consideration relevant provisions of Argentina's Constitution, even though the Tribunal expressly acknowledged that the Licence was subject to the Argentine law.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 69, 70 and 97.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 238 *et seq*, 492-496.\n\n262.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee refers to its discussion at paragraph 107 above. The Committee considers that the reasoning of the Award on this particular question \" *enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law* \" *.* To the extent that the Tribunal's reasoning is inconsistent with arguments of Argentina, it must be taken to have rejected those arguments. The Committee finds nothing to indicate that the Tribunal did not consider all of the evidence and arguments before it. The Tribunal was not required to give its evaluation of each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by Argentina.\n\n263.\n\nArgentina also argues that the Tribunal had no power to grant damages for the suspension of the PPI in 2000 and 2001 due to the Suspension Agreements, before the Emergency Law was enacted,226 as they were voluntary agreements. Argentina maintains that this finding of the Tribunal contradicted a separate finding of the Tribunal that the question of the Trust Fund and its operation, to which TGS had agreed, \"cannot be a matter of complaint before it\".227\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 445-448.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 190.\n\n264.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal gave reasons for this aspect of its decision. It found that TGS agreed to the suspension of the PPI adjustments in January and June 2000 on the basis that amounts not collected as a result of the suspension would be recouped later and with interest,228 and that with the abolition of the PPI adjustments by Law 25,561 such recouping was no longer available.229 The Committee finds no inconsistency with the Tribunal's finding that the Claimants could not complain about the Trust Fund established in 2004, \"to the extent that TGS has consented to this Trust Fund and its operation\".\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, 447.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 447.\n\n265.\n\nWhile the Tribunal's reasoning on the issue of US PPI adjustments is brief, the Committee is unable to conclude, bearing in mind the scope of the standard of review under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention referred to above, that the reasoning in the Award is insufficient to enable one \" *to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law* \" *.* Nor, in the light of the discussion in paragraphs 223-246 above, does the Committee consider that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in determining this question.\n\n*Tariff calculation in US dollars*\n----------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with this issue in paragraphs 106 to 150 of the Award. At paragraphs 106 to 126 the Tribunal sets out at some length the arguments of the parties, and then at paragraphs 127 to 150 set out its own reasoning.\n\n267.\n\nIn stating its reasons, the Tribunal begins in paragraph 127 by stating that *\"The Tribunal finds the Claimants\u2019 arguments about the existence of a right to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars persuasive* \". This statement must be read in the light of paragraphs 106 to 109 of the Award, setting out the relevant arguments of the Claimants. It is apparent from these paragraphs that the Claimants relied for their position particularly on the wording of Article 41 of the Gas Decree and Article 9.2 of the Basic Rules of the Licence, and argued that their understanding was confirmed by minutes of a meeting of the Privatisation Committee held on 2 October 1992, and the wording of Annex F to the Pliego.\n\n268.\n\nAt paragraph 128 of the Award, the Tribunal notes that the Gas Decree and Basic Rules of the Licence unequivocally referred to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars and noted that \" *such feature was also explained in the same terms by the Information Memorandum* \". It considered \" *that there cannot be any doubt about the fact that this is the central feature governing the tariff regime* \", and went on to say in the following paragraph that this was not surprising \" *[g]iven the emphasis that this regulatory framework placed on the stability of the tariff structure* \".\n\n269.\n\nThe Committee considers that these paragraphs in turn have to be read in the light of other paragraphs of the Award as a whole dealing with the context and circumstances of Argentina's programme of privatisation (referred to in paragraphs 41-43 of the Award), including for instance paragraph 136 in which the Tribunal said that \" *Precisely because these measures were preceded by a long period of economic turmoil, investors would not be attracted to participate in the privatization process unless specific assurances were provided in respect of the stability of their arrangements* \".\n\n270.\n\nThe Committee considers that paragraphs 127 to 129 of the Award contain the Tribunal's conclusion and essential reasoning on the issue of calculation of tariffs in US dollars. Although the reasoning in these paragraphs is brief, and the Tribunal does not even set out the text of the relevant provisions, the Committee considers it to be at the very least necessarily implicit in these paragraphs that the Tribunal found that there was a right to calculation of tariffs in US dollars under the provisions of the Gas Decree and Basic Rules of the Licence, given that these provisions referred \"unequivocally\" to the calculation of tariffs in US dollars and given the circumstances in which those provisions were adopted.\n\n271.\n\nThe Committee finds that the remainder of this section of the Award (paragraphs 130 to 150) is then devoted to addressing specific arguments of Argentina.\n\n272.\n\nAt paragraph 130 to 133 of the Award, the Tribunal refers to arguments of Argentina to the effect that the relevant clauses providing for tariff calculation in US dollars were linked to the Convertibility Law. These paragraphs must be read together with paragraphs 110 to 114, setting out relevant arguments of Argentina, in which the Tribunal noted *inter alia* Argentina's argument that \" *the mechanism envisaged only the possibility of a modification of the relationship between the peso and the dollar under the Convertibility Law, but not the situation if the Convertibility Law was altogether abandoned* \" (Award, para 112). At paragraphs 134 to 137, the Tribunal then proceeds to reject this argument, essentially on the grounds that \" *[g]uarantees and stability are meant precisely to operate when problems arise, not when business continues as usual* \", that \" *[t]he tariff regime approved was devised as a permanent feature of the privatization, not a transitory one* \" and that \" *[t]he regulatory and contractual arrangements were thus not incomplete* \". In short, it is necessarily implicit that the Tribunal considered that the relevant provisions were intended also to cover the eventuality that the Convertibility Law was abandoned, because (in addition to the reasons given in paragraphs 127 to 129 of the Award) they would not serve their purpose if they did not have this effect.\n\n273.\n\nAt paragraphs 138 to 144 of the Award, the Tribunal considered certain issues relating to the minutes of the Privatisation Committee that were in evidence before it. The Tribunal states that the discussion of these minutes \" *was on occasion confusing* \", and the first sentence of paragraph 139 of the Award appears to indicate that the Tribunal considered these minutes to be open to more than one interpretation. The Tribunal in these paragraphs appears to reach the conclusion that the minutes are consistent with the conclusion reached in paragraphs 127 to 129 of the Award, and appears to have considered this a relevant matter, which it was entitled to do.\n\n274.\n\nAt paragraphs 143 to 144 the Tribunal explains why it did not consider its conclusion to \"ignore economic reality\" or the possible need for adjustments to be made as a result of changing economic circumstances. The Tribunal was of the view that the contract itself contained mechanisms for such adjustment and that what was not permitted in this case was the unilateral action by the Government outside of those mechanisms.\n\n275.\n\nIn paragraphs 145 to 147 of the Award the Tribunal then addresses the arguments, referred to in paragraphs 115 to 118, concerning the \"historical experience\" with ENTEL, the national communications company that had earlier been privatised. The Tribunal considered amongst other things that the privatisation of ENTEL, which has occurred prior to the adoption of the Convertibility Law was \" *an entirely different situation to the present one* \", given that, following the adoption of the Convertibility Law, \" *the terms of the original privatisation of ENTEL were no longer viable* \".\n\n276.\n\nIn paragraphs 148 to 150 of the Award the Tribunal then addresses the arguments, referred to in paragraphs 119-212, that tariffs were higher because they included a premium for the risk that convertibility might be abandoned at some point in the future. The Tribunal found that the country risk premium related only to the risk of default by Argentina on its foreign debt, and not to the risk of future devaluation of the Argentine currency.\n\n277.\n\nArgentina has raised a variety of specific arguments in its challenge to this part of the Award. Some of these arguments are to the effect that the Tribunal left unanswered particular arguments of Argentina or ignored particular items of evidence. However, for the reasons given above, the Tribunal was not required to address every argument or every item of evidence. Other arguments of Argentina were to the effect that the Tribunal made findings of fact not supported by the evidence, or in contradiction to the evidence. However, for the reasons given above, neither error of fact nor error of law is in itself a ground of annulment, and it is accordingly not within the mandate of the Committee to determine whether or not the Tribunal's findings were consistent with the evidence.\n\n278.\n\nArgentina has also raised arguments to the effect that the Tribunal was partial and dogmatic in accepting arguments of the Claimant that had no basis, or in inventing counter-arguments to Argentina's position that had not been advanced by the Claimants. The Committee notes that lack of impartiality may be a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, and leaves open the possibility that such lack of impartiality might be evidenced, for instance, by the fact that an Award consistently and perversely makes findings favourable to one party without any basis in the evidence. However, Argentina has not expressly sought to rely on Article 52(1)(d) as a ground for annulment of the portions of the Award dealing with either the US PPI adjustments or the tariff payments in US dollars. Nor has it presented a developed argument in this respect. Nor in the Committee's view has it demonstrated that any findings or reasoning of the Tribunal were in the circumstances such as to establish the existence of partiality justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n279.\n\nThe Committee is unable to conclude, bearing in mind the scope of the standard of review under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention referred to above, that the reasoning in the Award is insufficient to enable one \" *to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law* \" *.* Nor, in the light of the discussion in paragraphs 223-246 above, does the Committee consider that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in determining this question.\n\n*The issue of TGS\u2019s and CIESA\u2019s financing policy*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nAt paragraphs 157-167 of the Award, the Tribunal dealt with what it termed \"The question of leverage policy\". In this section of the Award, the Tribunal dealt with Argentina's argument that the leverage policy followed by TGS had a negative impact on its equity value, and that this was something for which Argentina should not be held responsible.230 After setting out the parties' arguments at some length (paragraphs 157-163 of the Award) the Tribunal rejected Argentina's argument on the basis that there had been no suggestion by Argentina that the leverage policy followed by TGS was contrary to the regulatory framework, and that the leverage policy followed by TGS was thus \"essentially a company decision\".231 In effect, the Tribunal considered the issue of TGS's leverage policy to be irrelevant to the determination of the claim before it. The Committee finds nothing illogical or absurd in this conclusion, and finds that the Tribunal's rejection of Argentina's argument on this basis was not subject to any annullable error.\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6 158.\n\nAward \u00b6 165.\n\n281.\n\nAt paragraph 166 of the Award, the Tribunal dealt with a specific argument of Argentina, to the effect that devaluation fell within the sovereign prerogative of the State. The Tribunal rejected this argument on the basis that the Claimants' claim was not in respect of devaluation but in respect of the breach of various aspects of the tariff system and the rights that the investors had in that respect.\n\n282.\n\nDespite rejecting the argument on this basis, the Tribunal also considered the merits of Argentina's argument to the extent of deciding that there was nothing unreasonable about TGS's leverage policy. At paragraph 165 of the Award, the Tribunal gave reasons as to why it was not unreasonable for TGS to take debt in dollars in international financial markets. At paragraph 373, the Tribunal said that TGS's leverage was reasonable by industry standards and close to that advised by the regulator and that none of the debt holders expressed any concern regarding the level of leverage before the measures taken by Argentina were adopted. At paragraphs 374-375, the Tribunal noted that TGS's stock was consistently positive before the measures were adopted, and that it was only after the pesification of tariffs that the company defaulted on its debt.\n\n283.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for rejecting Argentina's arguments based on the leverage policy. The Committee finds nothing absurd or illogical or contradictory in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n*Rejection of the theory of* \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \"\n----------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal found that \" *there is no legal excuse under the Argentine legislation which could justify the non-compliance, as the very conditions set out by this legislation and the decisions of courts have not been met* \".232 In the course of its reasoning, the Tribunal considered and rejected the applicability of two legal excuses under Argentine law that might potentially have justified non-compliance, namely the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" and the \"state of emergency\".\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6 231.\n\n285.\n\nThe principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" is dealt with in paragraphs 214-217 of the Award. The Tribunal referred in these paragraphs to the expert opinion of Professor Comadira that was relied on by Argentina, and it is to be presumed that the Tribunal gave full consideration to the arguments in that expert opinion. The Committee considers it evident from paragraphs 215-216 of the Award that the Tribunal considered that the theory of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" applied only in the case of events that were unforeseeable, and that in the circumstances of the present case the events were to be regarded as having been foreseeable. This was because \" *the major features of the whole regulatory regime put in place under the privatisation were based on taking cover against all kinds of risks inspired by the economic history of the country and the instability of the 1980s* \", that \" *the parties were quite aware of the dangers ahead* \" and that \" *it would make no sense if when the dangers materialized, as they did, the protection envisaged would not operate* \".233\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6 216.\n\n286.\n\nThe Committee considers that although the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" is dealt with relatively briefly, it is easy to understand the Tribunal's reasoning, and there is no basis for concluding that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision. For the reasons given above, it is beyond the scope of the mandate of the Committee to consider whether the Tribunal correctly articulated and applied the theory of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" under Argentine law, since error of law is not a ground of annulment. The Committee considers that in determining this issue, the Tribunal determined (correctly or incorrectly) the application of the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" under Argentine law and did not fail to apply the applicable law.\n\n287.\n\nIn paragraph 217 of the Award, the Tribunal noted that under Article 23 of the ILC Articles, the concept of *force majeure* does not include circumstances in which performance of an obligation has become more difficult due to a political or economic crisis. The Committee does not accept the argument that the Tribunal thereby applied Article 23 of the ILC Articles rather than the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" under Argentine law. The Committee considers that the applicability of the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" was rejected by the Tribunal in paragraph 216 of the Award, not in paragraph 217 of the Award. The Committee considers that in paragraph 217, the Tribunal merely drew an additional comparison with Article 23 of the ILC Articles, and suggested that this would be an additional consideration \" *at least as the theory of* \u2018imprevisi\u00f3n' *is expressed in the concept of force majeure* \". In any event, even if the Tribunal was of the view that the content of the principle of \" *imprevisi\u00f3n* \" was identical to Article 23 of the ILC Articles, and even if this were not correct, this would be an error of law not amounting to a ground of annulment.\n\n288.\n\nThe second legal excuse under Argentine law considered by the Tribunal was \"state of emergency\" which it addressed in paragraphs 218-225 of the Award (and again in paragraphs 291-293). The Tribunal indicated that in reaching its conclusion in respect of this issue, it considered the expert opinions of both Dr Bianchi and Professor Comadira,234 and it is again to be presumed that the Tribunal gave full consideration to the arguments in both opinions.\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6 219.\n\n289.\n\nIt is clear from paragraphs 219-230 of the Award that the Tribunal considered that as a matter of Argentine law, the use of extraordinary powers in emergency situations was subject to three limitations articulated by the Argentine Supreme Court in the *San Luis* case.235 The Tribunal found that the first of these requirements, temporality, was not met because the Emergency Law had been extended a number of times and had \" *in reality been turned into a permanent feature of the Argentine economy* \"236 notwithstanding that \" *in actual fact the crisis is largely over* \".237 The Tribunal found that the second of these requirements, \"no essential mutation of rights\", at the very least appeared not to be met on the basis that the elimination of dollar clauses and other emergency provisions were adopted on a definitive rather than a transitory basis.238 The Tribunal found that the third of these requirements, reasonableness, was not met because both parties had recognised \" *an inescapable need to attend to tariff adjustments* \" such that \" *the prolongation of emergency measures without re-establishing or rebalancing the benefits of* *the Licence cannot be regarded as satisfying the legal requirements of reasonableness* \".239\n\nArgentine Supreme Court, *Provincia de San Luis c. P. E. N. -Ley 25,561, Dto. 1570/01 y 214/02* *s/ amparo*, judgment of March 5, 2003, cited in Award \u00b6 218.\n\nAward \u00b6 221.\n\nAward \u00b6 222.\n\nAward \u00b6 223.\n\nAward \u00b6 225.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal furthermore found, as a matter of Argentine law, that the emergency measures could not be imposed unilaterally by the Argentine State, but had either to be agreed between the parties or requested from a judge. The Tribunal found that this requirement was not satisfied, and noted that adjustment mechanisms did exist under the Licence.240\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 226-230.\n\n291.\n\nAgain, the Committee considers it easy to understand the Tribunal's reasoning, and finds that there is no basis for concluding that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision. The Committee considers that in determining this issue, the Tribunal applied (correctly or incorrectly) Argentine domestic law with respect to emergency measures and therefore did not fail to apply the applicable law.\n\n*Liability under Argentine law*\n-------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did apply the applicable law, and that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for its decision on that issue. It is beyond the scope of the mandate of the Committee to consider whether the Tribunal articulated and applied Argentine law correctly.\n\n**(d) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n293.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground of annulment must be rejected.\n\n**H. The Tribunal's finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Background**\n------------------\n\n294.\n\nArticle II(2)(a) of the BIT states in part (the \"fair and equitable treatment clause\") that:\n\n*Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment...*\n\n295.\n\nArgentina maintains that in finding that Argentina violated fair and equitable treatment clause, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.241\n\nThis ground does not appear to have been stated in the Application for Annulment.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal took the wording of the preamble to the BIT, and turned it into a legal obligation to maintain a stable framework for investment for the parties as a fundamental element of fair and equitable treatment.242\n\n(b) This interpretation amounts to a manifest excess of powers, since the preamble to the BIT does not establish such a legal obligation.243 Maintaining a stable legal system is substantially different from any obligation deriving from the BIT or the applicable international law, and by interpreting the standard of fair and equitable treatment in this way the Tribunal sought to create obligations for Argentina that did not derive from the BIT or the applicable international law, and did not resort to the applicable law for interpreting the fair and equitable treatment standard.244\n\n(c) The Tribunal based its decision on a dictum in the *Tecmed* Award245 which was criticised in the *MTD* Annulment Decision.246\n\n(d) The Tribunal's conclusion is absurd. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law and an investor knows that laws will evolve over time.247\n\n(e) In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Argentina objected to the Claimants' arguments as to the scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and consistently took the position that fair and equitable treatment means the minimum international standard.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 256, 259-260, 267-268.\n\nReferring to *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9. Award, September 5, 2008 (\" *Continental Casualty* Award\"), \u00b6\u00b6 258, 261.\n\nReferring to *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 67.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 262, 267.\n\nReferring to *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 67.\n\nReferring to *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v*. *Republic of Lithuania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award of 11 September 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 332, 233, 238.\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants argue, *inter alia*, that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal never determined that the preamble to the BIT establishes a legal obligation, but rightly concluded that stability of the legal framework is an element of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The Tribunal interpreted Article II(2)(a) of the BIT \" *in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of the object and purpose* \" as required by the Vienna Convention.248 During this exercise, the Tribunal \"gave weight\" to the preamble of the BIT,249 but did not conclude that the preamble itself established a legal obligation.\n\n(b) The Tribunal relied on the BIT's language for the standard, looked to relevant case law for persuasive authority, and then evaluated Argentina's actions.250 It did not base its decision only on the *Tecmed* Award, which was cited in support of the standard provided by the BIT, not in substitution of it. The Tribunal discussed other tribunals' interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.251\n\n(c) Throughout the merits phase, Argentina did not contest the Claimants' arguments that the fair and equitable treatment standard encompassed these requirements, and annulment is not the proper place for parties to reargue the merits of the case, under the guise of arguing that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n(d) Numerous tribunals and legal scholars have confirmed that the protection of legitimate expectations is a key facet of the fair and equitable treatment standard252 and Argentina cannot legitimately claim that the Tribunal somehow manifestly exceeded its power by drawing the same conclusion drawn by other tribunals.\n\n(e) The Tribunal examined Argentina's actions and determined that they violated the obligation to protect an investor's legitimate expectations that Argentina undertook when it signed the BIT and enacted the relevant legal framework applicable to Claimants' investment.\n\n(f) Argentina's arguments are merely disguised assaults on the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\n(g) The *Continental Casualty* Award specifically acknowledged that there were significant factual and contextual differences in its case that caused it to differ from other awards. The *CMS* case could be viewed as a companion case to Claimants' case.253\n\n(h) The *Parkerings-Compagniet* Award contradicts Argentina's position by recognizing that an investor's legitimate expectations must be protected. Unlike in that case, the present case has nothing to do with a lack of due diligence or the unreasonableness of the investor's expectations.\n\n(i) The *MTD* Annulment Decision did not consider that the tribunal exceeded its powers by holding that the legitimate expectations of the investor were part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.254\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 259.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 259.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 264-265.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 260, 262.\n\nReferring *inter alia* to *CME* Partial Award \u00b6 611; *Eureko B.V. v.

The Tribunal then went on to note that the international law standard on the minimum treatment due to foreign citizens, traders and investors is similarly \"not *too clear and precise* \", and that the standards have \" *gradually evolved over the centuries* \".\n\n301.\n\nAt paragraph 257, the Tribunal said that the development had been \" *fragmentary and gradual* \", based as it was on \" *a case by case determination by courts and tribunals* \".\n\n302.\n\nAt paragraph 258, the Tribunal expressed the view that the international minimum standard was insufficiently elaborate and clear for the fair and equitable treatment to be equated with it, that the fair and equitable treatment standard may be more precise than the customary international law minimum standard, and that the fair and equitable standard, in the context of the BIT, could require a treatment additional to, or beyond that of, customary law.\n\n303.\n\nAt paragraph 259, the Tribunal said that it was bound to interpret the fair and equitable treatment clause \" *in good faith in accordance with the ordinary* *meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of the object and purpose* \" as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n304.\n\nThe Committee considers that to this point in its reasoning, the Tribunal in effect said no more than that the standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the BIT is not necessarily the same as the customary international law minimum standard, and that the content of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" clause in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT was a question of interpretation of the BIT in accordance with normal principles of treaty interpretation. The Committee considers this obvious.\n\n305.\n\nIn paragraph 259, the Tribunal went on to say that it \" *gives weight to the text of the Treaty\u2019s Preamble, which links the standard to the goal of legal stability* \". The Tribunal then quoted a provision of the preamble of the BIT which states that *\"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for the investment and maximum effective use of economic resources* \".\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal did not state in this paragraph that the preamble to the BIT imposed a legal obligation or that the Tribunal was \"applying\" a provision of the preamble. Rather, in the Committee's view it is quite clear from context that the Tribunal was merely taking into account, and \"giving weight\" to, a provision of the preamble in interpreting the fair and equitable treatment clause in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. The Committee considers that there was nothing illogical or contrary to principle in the Tribunal doing this. Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention expressly states that \" *The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes* \".\n\n307.\n\nAt paragraph 260, the Tribunal then concluded that \" *a key element of fair and equitable treatment is the requirement of a* \u2018stable framework for the investment'\". The Committee considers it clear from a reading of this paragraph as a whole, in the context of the preceding paragraphs, that the Tribunal considered this to be a key element of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, and that the Tribunal based this conclusion on the case law cited in that paragraph.255\n\nAward, footnotes 59-60, referring to *Occidental Exploration and Production Company (OEPC) v.

In a footnote reference, the Tribunal indicated that it was quoting from paragraph 154 of the *Tecmed* Award. The Tribunal said that \"The *Tecmed* approach has been consistently adopted by subsequent decisions\", and cited a number of decisions.257 After referring to a difference in terminology used in the *Tecmed* Award and a NAFTA decision,258 the Tribunal then concluded, with reference to certain other awards,259 that \" *What seems to be essential, however, is that these expectations derived from the conditions that were offered by the State to the investor at the time of the investment and that such conditions were relied upon by the investor when deciding to invest* \".260\n\nReferring to *MTD* Award \u00b6 114; *OEPC* Award \u00b6 185; *Eureko* Partial Award \u00b6 235; *LG&E* Award \u00b6 127.\n\nReferring to *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

At paragraph 264, the Tribunal found that \" *The measures in question in this case have beyond any doubt substantially changed the legal and business framework under which the investment was decided and implemented\".* At paragraph 265, the Tribunal found that \" *it was in reliance upon the conditions established by [Argentina] in the regulatory framework for the gas sector that Enron embarked on its investment in TGS* \" and that in the circumstances of the case \" *Enron had reasonable grounds to rely on such conditions* \". At paragraph 266 the Tribunal found that \" *A decade later... the guarantees of the tariff regime that had seduced so many foreign investors, were dismantled* \" and that \" *The long-term business outlook enabled by the tariff regime, has been transformed into a day-to-day discussion about what comes next* \".\n\n313.\n\nAt paragraphs 267 and 268, the Tribunal then concluded that:\n\n*The Respondent might be right in distinguishing this case from the factual scenarios that recent decisions have faced, but this does not mean that Argentina\u2019s acts are consistent with the meaning of the protection under the Treaty. It is clear that the \u2018stable legal framework\u2019 that induced the investment is no longer in place and that a definitive framework has not been made available for almost five years.*\n\n*Even assuming that the Respondent was guided by the best of intentions, which the Tribunal has no reason to doubt, there is here an objective breach of the fair and equitable treatment due under the Treaty. The Tribunal thus holds that the standard established in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty has not been observed and that to the extent that it results in a detriment to the Claimants\u2019 rights it will give rise to compensation.*\n\n314.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal, in finding that there was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, purported to interpret that provision in accordance with general international law treaty interpretation principles and to apply it to the facts of the case as found. In so doing, the Tribunal applied the applicable law, whether or not it did so correctly.\n\n315.\n\nThe Committee finds that no other valid basis has been advanced by Argentina for the contention that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. Argentina in effect argues no more than that the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT was wrong, which as observed above is not a ground of annulment.\n\n316.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground of annulment must also be rejected.\n\n**I. The Tribunal's finding of a breach of the umbrella clause**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Background**\n------------------\n\n317.\n\nArticle II(2)(c) of the BIT (the \"umbrella clause\") states that:\n\n*Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.*\n\n318.\n\nArgentina maintains that in finding that Argentina violated umbrella clause, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) failed to state reasons for its conclusion, justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention; and261\n\n(b) manifestly exceeded its powers, justifying annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 55-60, 71-74.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(a) The Tribunal's reasoning does not allow the reader to proceed from the existence of the umbrella clause in the BIT to the ruling against Argentina for alleged breaches of the provisions of the Licence to which the Claimants were not parties, and with regard to which they had no rights.262\n\n(b) The Tribunal confined itself to making an inadequate description of other Tribunals' interpretations of the phrase \" *any obligations* \" contained in the umbrella clause and gave no grounds regarding the phrase \" *entered into* \" or the purported violation of the clause by Argentina.\n\n(c) The present case is materially similar to that in the *CMS* Annulment Decision in which the *ad hoc* committee found that the tribunal had failed to analyse relevant issues263 and that \" *it is quite unclear how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion* \".264\n\n(d) The Tribunal did not address the arguments of Argentina, in particular Argentina's argument as to the inexistence of an investment agreement or obligations with the Claimants.\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(e) The Tribunal's analysis265 was based on only four decisions of arbitral tribunals,266 but in the cases relied on, except for the *LG&E* case, there were instruments expressly linking the investor to the host State. In the present case, Argentina never assumed any obligation *vis \u00e0 vis* the Claimants other than the BIT.\n\n(f) The expression \"obligations\" in the umbrella clause means specific obligations concerning the investment, and does not include general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.267 Contrary to what the Tribunal found,268 the Gas Law did not comprise any \"specific obligations\" with respect to the Claimants.\n\n(g) The application of the umbrella clause is limited to commitments in investment contracts.269\n\n(h) The License cannot be assimilated to an investment contract.270 There is no investment agreement in this case, since the Claimants did not enter into any agreement with the Argentine Government. Furthermore, the License lacked any element to internationalise it,271 was regulated by Argentine law, was subject to local courts, and was granted to an Argentine company (TGS). Under Argentine Law and the License, Argentina was subject to obligations only towards TGS and not the Claimants, who had no right to enforce it.272\n\n(i) Article VII of the BIT deals with \"investment agreements\". Argentina and the United States intended to attribute a special meaning to the term \"investment agreement\", and the special meaning should be observed.273 Under the BIT, in order for an investment agreement to exist, there must be an agreement between a party and a national or company of the other party. The definition of \"investment treaty\" of the 1994 US Model BIT was intended to broaden the notion of \"investment agreement\" and is inapplicable to the interpretation of the BIT.274\n\n(j) It is inadmissible for the Claimants on the one hand to assert that they are not a party to the Licence and therefore are not bound by its forum clause, and on the other hand to claim that the Licence is an investment agreement entitling them to invoke the umbrella clause. The Tribunal followed the same contradictory reasoning.275\n\n(k) The position in the *Azurix* case276 and *CMS* Annulment Decision277 was correct.\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 89-97.\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95(d)-(f).\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 269-277.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 274, citing *Fedax N.V. v.

It rejected the notion that the \"obligation\" in question had to be \"entered into\" with the investor directly. The Tribunal expressly observed that \" *Through the Gas Law* *and its implementing legislation, the Respondent assumed \"obligations with regard to investments\"278* The Tribunal found that Argentina had failed to observe those obligations, thus triggering its liability under the Umbrella Clause.279\n\n(b) The Tribunal expressly found that the Award covered both contractual obligations such as payment as well as obligations assumed through law or regulation, and cited authorities.280\n\n(c) It is not the case that the Tribunal failed to explain what \"entered into\" means.281\n\n(d) The Award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion. The Tribunal clearly by implication rejected Argentina's arguments.\n\n(e) It would be a rare event that the host State would enter into an obligation directly with the foreign investor, precisely because foreign investors are often required by local law to channel their investment through and into local companies (as they were in this case).282\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(f) The Tribunal expressly invoked the precise wording of the umbrella clause, finding that the Gas Law and its implementing legislation constituted \"obligations with regard to investments\"283 and that the License provisions were \"obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to Claimants' investments.\"284\n\n(g) Under the broad definition of \"investment\" in the BIT, the Claimants' indirect interests in TGS, and the rights conferred on TGS by the Gas Law and the License, were \"investments\" of the Claimants, and Argentina's failure to observe the obligations it entered into \"with regard to\" those \"investments\" violated the plain text of the umbrella clause, as the Tribunal properly and expressly found.\n\n(h) The umbrella clause provides that each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into \"with regard to invest *ments* \" and not \"with regard to a particular invest *or* \". The fact that the obligation \"entered into\" in this case was the License with TGS does not mean that the Claimants were enforcing contractual rights to which they were not a party. Any breach of those License rights constituted an independent violation of the BIT under the umbrella clause in respect of an \"investment\" of the Claimants.\n\n(i) The umbrella clause uses the term \"investments,\" not \"investment agreements\", and it is not confined to \"contracts\" or \"investment agreements\", but extends to \"any obligation\" entered into \"with regard to\" any category of \"investment\" within the definition of the BIT.285 Argentina effectively argues that the umbrella clause should be read as stating, which it does not, that \"each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into *in an investment agreement with an investor of the other party* \".\n\n(j) Even if the umbrella clause did only cover investment agreements, the License would qualify as an \"investment agreement\" under the BIT because it was a written agreement between the national authorities of Argentina and an \"investment\" of the Claimants (namely, TGS) granting rights with respect to assets controlled by the national authorities on which the Claimants relied in establishing, acquiring and continuing their investments in Argentina.286\n\n(k) Even if the Committee were to conclude that the Tribunal erred in its interpretation of the scope of the umbrella clause, that would not rise to the level of a manifest excess of power, as erroneous application of the law is not grounds for annulment. Argentina's argument amounts to little more than a disagreement as to the proper scope and interpretation of the umbrella clause. While some tribunals and commentators have taken the interpretation that Argentina favours, other awards have held (as the Tribunal did in this case) that foreign shareholders may invoke the umbrella clause when the host State fails to observe obligations entered into with their locally-incorporated subsidiaries.287\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 275-276.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 273-277.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 274.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 275-276.\n\nReferring to First Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 55.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 275.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 276.\n\nReferring to F.A.

The Tribunal said that nonetheless, in accordance with the express wording of the umbrella clause, to be covered by the clause, an obligation had to be one that was \" *with regard to investments* \u2019.\n\n325.\n\nAt paragraph 275 of the Award, the Tribunal then said that \" *Through the Gas Law and its implementing legislation, the Respondent assumed \u2018obligations with regard to investments\u2019\",* and referred to the provisions in the legislation for tariffs to be calculated in US dollars converted to pesos for billing purposes, linked to the US PPI.\n\n326.\n\nThe Committee considers that this section of the Award must be read in the light of the Award as a whole, including in the light of the Tribunal's two decisions on jurisdiction which, as noted above, form part of the Award.\n\n327.\n\nFor the reasons given in paragraphs 87-111 above, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for its conclusion that the Claimants could bring BIT proceedings, notwithstanding Argentina's argument that the claim concerned rights which belonged to TGS and not to the Claimants.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal expressly found that the Claimants had invested in TGS.288 Paragraph 241 of the Award refers back to paragraphs 29-30 of the Second Jurisdiction Decision in which the Tribunal noted that the definition of \"investment\u2019 in the BIT included \" *the channeling of investments through locally incorporated companies, particularly when this is mandated by the very* *legal arrangements governing the privatization process in Argentina* \u2019. At paragraphs 264-267 of the Award (in the section dealing with the fair and equitable treatment clause, which precedes the treatment of the umbrella clause) the Tribunal then went on to say:\n\n*The measures in question in this case have beyond any doubt substantially changed the legal and business framework under which the investment was decided and* *implemented. Argentina in the early 1990s constructed a regulatory framework for the gas sector containing specific guarantees to attract foreign capital to an economy historically unstable and volatile. As part of this regulatory framework, Argentina guaranteed that tariffs would be calculated in US dollars, converted into pesos for billing purposes, adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the US PPI and sufficient to cover costs and a reasonable rate of return. It further guaranteed that tariffs would not be subject to freezing or price controls without compensation.* *Foreign investors were specifically targeted to invest in the privatization of public utilities in the gas sector. Substantial foreign investment was undertaken on the strength of such guarantees, including the investment made by Enron in TGS.*\n\n*The Tribunal observes that it was in reliance upon the conditions established by the Respondent in the regulatory framework for the gas sector that Enron embarked on its investment in TGS. Given the scope of Argentina\u2019s privatization process, its international marketing, and the statutory enshrinement of the tariff regime, Enron had reasonable grounds to rely on such conditions.*\n\n*A decade later, however, the guarantees of the tariff regime that had seduced so many foreign investors, were dismantled. Where there was certainty and stability for investors, doubt and ambiguity are the order of the day. The long-term business outlook enabled by the tariff regime, has been transformed into a day-to-day discussion about what comes next. Tariffs have been frozen for almost five years.* *The recomposition of the tariff regime is subject to a protracted renegotiation process imposed on the public utilities that has failed to provide a final and definitive framework for the operation of business in the energy sector.*\n\n*The Respondent might be right in distinguishing this case from the factual scenarios that recent decisions have faced, but this does not mean that Argentina\u2019s acts are consistent with the meaning of the protection under the Treaty. It is clear that the \u2018stable legal framework\u2019 that induced the investment is no longer in place and that a definitive framework has not been made available for almost five years.*\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 42 (final sentence), 47-61 (especially the heading to that section), 191, 193, 242.\n\n329.\n\nReturning to paragraph 275 of the Award, dealing with the umbrella clause, the Tribunal said that:\n\n*The dismantling of these guarantees [under the Gas Law and its implementing legislation] would suffice to establish a* *violation of the obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment.*\n\n330.\n\nAt paragraph 276 of the Award, the Tribunal then said:\n\n*In addition, the prohibition of price controls without indemnification and the prohibition of License amendments without consent, although contained in the License were also approved by decree and formed part of the implementing legislation that established the tariff regime.*\n\n*The obliteration of these commitments likewise entails a violation of obligations entered into by the Respondent with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment.*\n\nThe Committee considers it sufficiently clear from the wording of this paragraph that the Tribunal did not consider a violation of the Licence itself to be a breach of the umbrella clause. Rather, the Tribunal found that the terms of the Licence formed part of the implementing legislation, such that a violation of the provisions of the Licence referred to in this paragraph also amounted to a violation of the guarantees contained in the legislative framework.\n\n331.\n\nThe Committee considers that the reasoning of the Award as a whole is clear. The Tribunal considered that the Claimants had invested in the privatised gas sector in Argentina, and had, as required by Argentine law, channelled that investment through a locally incorporated company. That investment was found to have been made by the Claimants on the strength of guarantees contained in a regulatory regime that had been implemented by Argentina for the purpose of attracting such foreign investment. Pursuant to the plain meaning of the wording of the BIT, and consistently with at least two prior arbitration decisions, the Tribunal considered that those guarantees in the legislative framework were therefore \" *obligations* \u2019 entered into by Argentina \" *with regard to* \u2019 the investment that the Claimants had made. The guarantees concerned included the right to tariff calculations in US dollars, converted into pesos for billing purposes, adjusted semi-annually in accordance with the US PPI and sufficient to cover costs and a reasonable rate of return. The dismantling of these guarantees, as it was described in paragraphs 189, 266 and 275 of the Award, were considered by the Tribunal as a violation of the obligations entered into by Argentina with regard to the Claimants' investment, and hence a violation of the umbrella clause with respect to that investment.\n\n332.\n\nThe Committee recalls the standard of review on annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. It is not for the Committee to determine whether the reasoning of the Tribunal was correct or convincing. It is only for the Committee to determine whether \" *the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion* \". The Committee is of the view that it clearly does. The Committee finds nothing contradictory or frivolous in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n333.\n\nArgentina relies on the *CMS* Annulment Decision, in which the *ad hoc* committee did annul, under Article 52(1)(e), the finding in the *CMS* Award that there had been a violation of the umbrella clause.289 However, a finding that the tribunal in the *CMS* case failed to give adequate reasons for its decision in no way necessarily leads to a conclusion that the Tribunal in the present case failed to give adequate reasons. The reasoning of the two tribunals in the two cases was different.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 89-100.\n\n334.\n\nIn the *CMS* case, the tribunal found that not all violations of a contractual obligation will result in a breach of the BIT, and that \" *Purely commercial aspects of a contract might not be protected by the treaty in some situations, but the protection is likely to be available when there is significant interference by governments or public agencies with the rights of the investor* \".290 The tribunal in that case then went on to say no more than that \" *None of the measures complained of in this case can be described as a commercial question as they are all related to government decisions that have resulted in the interferences and breaches noted* \",291 and that the umbrella clause had therefore not been observed \" *to the extent that legal and contractual obligations pertinent to the investment have been breached and have resulted in the violation of the standards of protection under the Treaty* \".292\n\n*CMS* Award \u00b6 299.\n\n*CMS* Award \u00b6 301.\n\n*CMS* Award \u00b6 303.\n\n335.\n\nIn the annulment proceedings in the *CMS* case, the claimant apparently made it clear to the *ad hoc* committee that the claimant did not assert a right under either Argentine law or international law to enforce compliance with the terms of the licence held by the locally incorporated company of which it was a shareholder.293 Rather, in the words of the *ad hoc* committee:\n\n*... CMS relied on a literal interpretation of Article II(2)(c). It contended that Argentina entered into legal obligations under the License, which were obligations \"with regard to investments\" under that Article. Although CMS was not entitled as a minority shareholder to invoke those obligations of Argentina under Argentine law (not being the obligee), the effect of Article II(2)(c) was to give it standing to invoke them under the BIT.*294\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 90-91.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 92.\n\n336.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* case considered that it was not clear from paragraph 303 of the *CMS* Award quoted above whether the Tribunal accepted this interpretation,295 that \" *In the end it is quite unclear how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion* \u2019296 and that \" *In these circumstances there is a significant lacuna in the Award, which makes it impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point* \u2019.297\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 93-94.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 96.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 97.\n\n337.\n\nWhile the *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* case may for these reasons have considered the reasoning in the *CMS* Award to be inadequate, for the reasons given above, the Committee considers that the reasoning of the Tribunal in the present case is quite clear.\n\n338.\n\nThe Committee notes that in the *CMS* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee said that \" *there are major difficulties with this broad interpretation* \u2019 taken by the claimants,298 and then proceeded to list these issues,299 and to say that if the tribunal in that case had adopted such an interpretation \" *one would have expected a discussion of* \u2019 these issues.300\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 96.\n\n339.\n\nThe Committee considers that all that the *CMS ad hoc* committee could properly have meant by this is that in the absence of any clearly expressed reasoning in the *CMS* Award, the absence of any discussion of these problematic issues made it impossible to conclude that the tribunal in that case had by implication adopted this particular interpretation of the umbrella clause.\n\n340.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* Annulment Decision said that \" *seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT itself* \",301 that \" *Consensual obligations are not entered into erga omnes but with regard to particular persons* \",302 and that \" *The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else* \".303 However, it is not for an annulment committee to express its own views on the meaning of particular provisions of the treaty. Thus, in the Committee's view, the CMS *ad hoc* committee should not be regarded as having thereby purported, akin to an appeal court, to pronounce on what the correct position is. Rather, this paragraph of the *CMS* Annulment Decision should, in the Committee's view, be regarded merely as identifying *lacunae* that were found to have existed in the award in that particular case, in view of the absence of any express rationale or any discussion of certain issues from which a rationale might have been implied.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95(a).\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95(b).\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95(c).\n\n341.\n\nProvided that it is clear how a tribunal arrived at the conclusion that it did, it is unnecessary for the tribunal to address every argument of the parties, let alone every possible argument that might be raised in relation to a particular point. Thus, when the *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* Annulment Decision stated that \" *There is no discussion in the award of the travaux of the BIT on this point* \",304 this similarly in the Committee's view should not be understood as suggesting that an Award will contain an annullable error under Article 52(1)(e) if it does not discuss the *travaux* of the BIT on a particular point. In every case, the question will be whether the standard of review on annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention has been met in the particular circumstances of the particular award that is sought to be annulled.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95(f).\n\n342.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee is quite satisfied for the reasons given above that there is a very clearly stated rationale for the Tribunal's conclusion that there was a breach of the umbrella clause. It is not for the Committee to determine whether or not that rationale was correct.\n\n343.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground of annulment must be rejected.\n\n**(d) Manifest excess of powers as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee's views**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal, in finding that there was a breach of the umbrella clause, purported to interpret and apply the relevant provisions of the BIT in accordance with customary international law principles. In so doing, it applied the applicable law, whether or not it did so correctly.\n\n345.\n\nThe Committee finds that no other valid basis has been advanced by Argentina for the contention that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. Argentina in effect argues no more than that the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT was wrong. However, that is not a ground of annulment.\n\n346.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground of annulment must also be rejected.\n\n**J. Emergency situation**\n--------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n347.\n\nIn the proceedings before the Tribunal, Argentina argued that the gravity of the economic crisis faced by Argentina at the material time was such that Argentina was exempted from liability for taking the measures complained of by the Claimant by virtue of the theory of *imprevisi\u00f3n* under Argentine law; the principle of necessity under customary international law; Article IV(3) of the BIT; and Article XI of the BIT.\n\n348.\n\nThe arguments concerning the theory of *imprevisi\u00f3n* under Argentine law are considered in paragraphs 284-291 above.\n\n349.\n\nAs to the principle of necessity under customary international law, the Tribunal found this customary international principle to be as stated in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which provides that:\n\n*1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:*\n\n*(a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril;*\n\n*and*\n\n*(b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.*\n\n*2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:*\n\n*(a) The International obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or*\n\n*(b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity*.305\n\nThe Tribunal found that the requirements of this provision were not satisfied, in particular because the measures adopted by Argentina were not the only way available to Argentina to achieve the result,306 and because Argentina had itself contributed to the state of necessity.307\n\nAward \u00b6 303.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 304-309.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 311-312.\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal further rejected Argentina's argument based on Article IV(3) of the BIT, which provides that:\n\n*Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national* *emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.*\n\nThe Tribunal found that the effect of this provision is to provide a minimum treatment to foreign investments suffering losses in the host country, and that this provision does not allow derogation from rights under the BIT or exclude wrongfulness, liability and eventual compensation for a breach of the BIT.308\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 320-321.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal additionally rejected Argentina's argument based on Article XI of the BIT, which provides that:\n\n*This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security interests.*\n\nRejecting Argentina's arguments, the Tribunal found that Article XI of the BIT is not self-judging and that the Tribunal's examination was not limited to the question whether the measures were adopted by Argentina in good faith, but also extended to the substantive question whether the requirements of this provision had been met such as to preclude wrongfulness.309 The Tribunal found that this provision was not applicable for the same reasons that it found that Argentina could not rely on the principle of necessity under customary international law.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 335-340.\n\n352.\n\nArgentina seeks annulment of the Award on the basis that, in relation to these aspects of the Award, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to apply the applicable law to the merits of the dispute (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention), and failed to state sufficient reasons for its decision (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia*, that:\n\n*In relation to Article XI of the BIT*\n\n(a) Article XI of the Treaty differs significantly from the \"state of necessity\u2019 under customary international law, which is substantially contained in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, in that (1) Article XI may only be invoked within the framework of the BIT while the state of necessity can be invoked in any context against any international obligation; (2) Article XI is a provision that delimits the scope of application of the Treaty such that if it applies the substantive obligations under the BIT do not apply, while the state of necessity is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of substantive obligations under the BIT; (3) Article XI does not include the stringent requirements of the state of necessity such as the requirement that the measure at issue be \"the only way for the State to safeguard its interests\u2019 and the requirement that the State must not itself have contributed to the state of emergency; (4) Article 25 of the ILC Articles, in contrast to Article XI of the BIT, has been drafted in a negative way especially to emphasize its exceptional nature; and (5) when Article XI of the BIT is applicable no compensation is payable, while Article 25 of the ILC Articles is expressed by virtue of Article 27 of the ILC Articles to be without prejudice to the question of compensation.\n\n(b) The Tribunal therefore made manifest errors of law in equating Article XI of the BIT with Article 25 of the ILC Articles,310 and in applying the rule of Article 27 of the Articles on State Responsibility to Article XI of the Treaty.311\n\n(c) Although an error of law is not a ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention,312 in certain circumstances, an error of law may be serious enough to be deemed a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law.313 The manifest errors of law present in the Award in this case are so serious that they amount to a manifest excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law.314\n\n(d) The Tribunal also failed to apply Article XI of the BIT as it did not respect the self-judging nature of that provision.315\n\n(e) Furthermore, even if Article XI is not self-judging, the Tribunal failed to apply Article XI of the BIT as it did not perform a substantial review but simply replaced Article XI of the Treaty with the state of necessity under customary international law, which differs substantially from Article XI, contrary to the principle of *effet utile* or *ut res magis valeat quam pereat*.\n\n(f) For purposes of Article XI of the BIT, Argentina alleged that the measures challenged had been taken not only to protect the essential security interests of the State, but also to maintain public order, but the Tribunal said nothing about the maintenance of public order.316 The public order component does not find direct reflection in customary law, and the absence of an analysis in the Award with respect to public order shows that the Tribunal in fact did not apply Article XI of the BIT. This is particularly disturbing as in practice the Tribunal recognised that the Argentine crisis involved issues related to public order.317\n\n(g) The Tribunal failed to state reasons pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention in that it did not explain (1) why the lack of specific guidance in the Treaty with respect to essential security interests made it necessary to rely on the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law; and (2) why Article XI did not establish conditions different from the requirements under customary law set forth in Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n*In relation to Article IV(3) of the BIT*\n\n(h) Article IV(3) of the BIT establishes a special solution for exceptional situations in which general obligations arising from normal circumstances do not apply. Otherwise, Article II(1) would have sufficed, since it obliges each party to afford treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or nationals of a third State. Under Article IV(3), in the event of \"state of national emergency\u2019 or \"other similar events\u2019, if foreign investors suffer losses, the only obligation of the State is not to discriminate if it decides to take measures in relation to such losses.\n\n(i) The Tribunal in this case did not evaluate whether there had existed a state of national emergency or other similar events that triggered the application of Article IV(3), but summarily rejected the relevance of that article.318\n\n*In relation to state of necessity under customary international law*\n\n(j) The reasons provided by the Tribunal in relation to the requirements of the state of necessity under customary international law were contradictory and insufficient, which warrants annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(k) The Tribunal's finding that it had not been established that the economic crisis had compromised the very existence of the State319 is inconsistent with other findings in the Award.320 Furthermore, the essential interests of the State are not limited to its existence, and the State must be given a margin of appreciation in the protection of its essential interests.321\n\n(l) The Tribunal's finding that it had not been established that events were out of control or had become unmanageable322 is inconsistent with other findings in the Award,323 and in any event the necessity defence \"does not require that \"total collapse\" of the country or a \"catastrophic situation\".324\n\n(m) The Tribunal, having found that it is a requirement of the state of necessity that the challenged measures be the *only way* for the State to safeguard its essential interests, did not identify which were the supposed alternatives. Furthermore, there will always be alternative ways for dealing with an economic crisis, but this does not preclude the application of the state of necessity to an economic crisis.325\n\n(n) The Tribunal did not identify how Argentina contributed to the state of necessity or how that contribution was substantial.326\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 130-131.\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 146, 383-394; J\u00fcrgen Kurtz, *Adjudging the Exceptional at International Law: Security, Public Order and Financial Crisis* 24-25 (Jean Monnet Center for International and Regional Economic Law & Justice, NYU School of Law, Jean Monnet Working Paper 06/08, 2008).\n\nReferring to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 136, 150, 158.\n\nReferring to *Amco II* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 7.12, 7.19; *Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 59, 169; *Mitchell* Annulment Decision \u00b6 45; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 135; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 46-47; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 86.\n\nReferring to Campbell McLachlan, *\"Investment Treaties and General International Law\",* (2008) 57 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 361, 363; Th\u00e9odore Christakis, \"Quel rem\u00e8de a l'\u00e9clatement de la jurisprudence CIRDI sur les investissements en Argentine?

Argentina cannot re-plead its case and introduce new arguments now.\n\n(c) The Tribunal correctly interpreted and applied Article XI and the defense of necessity in accordance with the international rules of treaty interpretation, as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n(d) Argentina is advancing a new interpretation of Article XI in these annulment proceedings, which it is not entitled to do. Before the Tribunal, Argentina advanced two primary necessity arguments (1) that Article XI is self-judging, and (2) that the defense of necessity precluded its liability and compensation duty. The *CMS* Annulment decision subsequently advanced an alternative interpretation of Article XI that Argentina now advances in these annulment proceedings.\n\n(e) Argentina's new interpretation of Article XI is unsupported by a proper treaty analysis but merely relies on three authorities that all post-date the underlying proceeding. The Committee would be second-guessing what would have been the Tribunal's decision had the new material been available to it before rendering the Award, but the Committee's role is solely to evaluate whether the Tribunal exceeded its authority or failed to state reasons.\n\n(f) A manifest error of law is not a ground for annulment.\n\n(g) Even if manifest errors of law could constitute a ground for annulment, the Tribunal interpreted the law correctly.\n\n(h) The Tribunal expressly considered and rejected Argentina's argument that Article XI is different and separate from customary law as it is *lex specialis*.327 The Tribunal did not hold that they are one and the same, but rather, that the conditions under which these two defences may be invoked are the same.\n\n(i) Without a provision like Article XI, a Tribunal could exclude the necessity plea entirely. The specific purpose of Article XI is to clarify that the necessity defense in customary international law may still be invoked under the BIT.\n\n(j) The Tribunal correctly analyzed the \"Maintenance of Public Order\" Aspect of Article XI.328\n\n(k) Argentina's new interpretation of Article XI is wrong.\n\n(l) The *Continental Casualty* Tribunal's analysis is even more flawed than Argentina's.329\n\n(m) The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons regarding its Article XI analysis.\n\n(n) The Tribunal correctly interpreted and applied Article IV(3).\n\n(o) The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons regarding the plea of necessity under customary international law.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 334.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 306.\n\nReferring to *Continental Casualty* Award \u00b6\u00b6 167-168, 175, 192.\n\n**(c) The Committee's views**\n-----------------------------\n\n*Situation of necessity under customary international law*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nThe section of the Award dealing with this issue sets out the arguments of Argentina (Award, paragraphs 294-298) and of the Claimants (Award, paragraphs 299-302), followed by the Tribunal's consideration and conclusion (Award, paragraphs 303-313).\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning begins with its finding, at paragraph 303 of the Award, that Article 25 of the ILC Articles, although not a treaty provision or part of customary international law, reflects the state of customary international law on the matter. From paragraphs 294 and 299 of the Award, it appears that this was common ground between the parties in the proceedings before the Tribunal, and this has not been disputed in these annulment proceedings. In the circumstances, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not err in proceeding on this basis. Whether or not the Committee were to agree that Article 25 of the ILC Articles reflects customary international law, it could not amount to an annullable error for the Tribunal to give an applicable legal rule an interpretation on which both parties were agreed.\n\n357.\n\nAt paragraph 305 of the Award, the Tribunal noted that under the terms of Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles, Argentina could only plead the defence of necessity in relation to its conduct if that conduct was \"the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril\". The Tribunal therefore considered that in addressing Argentina's plea of necessity under customary international law, it had to \"establish whether the Argentine crisis qualified as affecting an essential interest of the State\". The Committee considers that this follows logically from the conclusion referred to in the previous paragraph.\n\n358.\n\nAt paragraph 306 of the Award, the Tribunal said that it did not find convincing the argument that the economic crisis \"compromised the very existence of the State and its independence so as to qualify as involving an essential interest of the State\". By this wording, the Tribunal rejected the argument of Argentina, referred to in paragraph 289 of the Award, that the crisis \"threatened in its view the very existence of the State and its independence\". The Tribunal's reason for rejecting this argument appeared to be that regardless of how serious the crisis may have been, \"[q]uestions of public order and social unrest could be handled\", \"questions of political stabilization were handled\", and \"there is no convincing evidence that the events were out of control or had become unmanageable\" (Award, paragraphs 306-307). In other words, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the existence of the State was threatened because the evidence was that the Government of Argentina continued to exist and to function and to deal with the crisis.\n\n359.\n\nContrary to what Argentina suggests, the Committee considers that paragraphs 306-307 of the Award cannot be understood as going further, amounting to a finding that the \"essential interests\" of the State are limited to its existence. The Committee considers that when paragraphs 306 to 308 of the Award are read as a whole, it is implicit that the Tribunal, while rejecting the argument that the existence of Argentina was threatened, nonetheless accepted that an \"essential interest\" of Argentina may have been affected. The Committee considers that this follows from the Tribunal's findings that \"there was a severe crisis and... in such context it was unlikely that business could have continued as usual\", that \"the government had the duty to prevent the worsening of the situation and could not simply leave events to follow their own course\", and that \"[i]t is quite evident that measures had to be adopted to offset the unfolding crisis\" (Award, paragraphs 306-308).\n\n360.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal made no express finding that an \"essential interest\" of Argentina was affected, the Committee considers it necessarily implicit from these statements in the Award that at the very least the Tribunal left open that the \"essential interests\" requirement of Article 25(1)(a) might be satisfied, as well as the requirement that the measures in question were taken to safeguard that essential interest from a \"grave and imminent peril\". The Tribunal may have left this open rather than deciding the matter on the basis that the Tribunal considered that, in any event, other requirements of Article 25 considered below were not met.\n\n361.\n\nThe first of these other requirements was the requirement in ILC Article 25(1)(a) that the measures of Argentina in question must have been \" *the only way* \" to safeguard the essential interest. The Tribunal found that this requirement was not satisfied at paragraphs 308 to 309 of the Award.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal's reason for so finding was that \" *there are always many approaches to address and correct such critical events, and it is difficult to justify that none of them were available in the Argentine case* \". The Tribunal indicated at paragraph 309 that it was not the Tribunal's role to say what alternative Argentina *should* have adopted, and that the Tribunal confined itself to finding that there were alternatives that Argentina *could* have adopted.\n\n363.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal did not in this paragraph identify what any of these alternatives might have been, this paragraph must be read in the context of the Award as whole, and in particular in the light of paragraph 300 of the Award, which states that:\n\n*The Claimants also argue that options other than pesification were available and thus this measure was not the only way to address the crisis; among the options discussed there was the structural reforms indicated, the agreed restructuring of its debt, dollarization and devaluation without pesification. Such alternative plans have worked in other countries, such as Uruguay, the expert explains.*\n\n364.\n\nThe reference to the \"expert\" in the final sentence of this quote must from context be a reference to the expert report of Professor Sebasti\u00e1n Edwards dated April 27, 2005 (the \"Edwards Report\"),330 which is referred to in a footnote in paragraph 300 of the Award, as well as in the first sentence of the following paragraph 301. The measures other than pesification that could in the opinion of Professor Edwards have been adopted by Argentina are set out in paragraphs 12 to 21, 83-125 and 134-137 of the Edwards Report.\n\nExhibit CEX-40 to the Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n365.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Edwards Report deals separately with alternatives that would have been available to Argentina in the 1990s and 2000 (paragraphs 13, 84-85 and 134 of the Edwards Report), in 2001 (paragraphs 14-16, 86-96 and 135-136 of the Edwards Report), and at the time of adoption of the Emergency Law in January 2002 (paragraphs 17-21, 97-125 and 137 of the Edwards Report).\n\n366.\n\nFor instance, in relation to the time at which the Emergency Law was adopted in January 2002, the only alternative to the adoption of the Emergency Law that is identified in the Edwards Report is devaluation of the peso without pesification of contracts denominated in US dollars, accompanied by other measures (a non-comprehensive list of which is given in paragraphs 20 and 108 of the Edwards Report) for assisting debtors who had borrowed in dollars and for whom devaluation would result in financial distress.\n\n367.\n\nThe Committee considers it sufficiently implicit that the Tribunal's reasoning was that the Claimants (via the Edwards Report) had identified alternative ways in which Argentina could have sought to address the economic crisis, that the Tribunal was not satisfied that none of these alternatives would have been available to Argentina, and that the Tribunal was therefore not satisfied that the \" *only way* \" requirement in Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles was satisfied.\n\n368.\n\nThe Committee finds that this reasoning of the Tribunal does not address a number of issues that are essential to the question of whether the \" *only way* \" requirement was met.\n\n369.\n\nThe first question concerns the legal definition of the expression \" *only way* \" in Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles. The Committee notes that the expression is capable of more than one possible interpretation. One potential interpretation is that it has its literal meaning, such that in the present case, the principle of necessity could be relied on by Argentina if there were genuinely no other measures that Argentina could possibly have adopted in order to address the economic crisis. As Argentina points out, there will almost inevitably be more than one way for a Government to respond to any economic crisis, and if this interpretation were correct, the principle of necessity under customary international law could rarely if ever be invoked in relation to measures taken by a Government to deal with an economic crisis. However, that would not mean that it would not be open to a Tribunal to find that this is the correct interpretation, although there are other interpretations that would be equally open to a Tribunal.\n\n370.\n\nFor instance, another possible interpretation would be that there must be no alternative measures that the State might have taken for safeguarding the essential interest in question that did not involve a similar or graver breach of international law. Under this interpretation, if there are three possible alternative measures that a State might adopt, all of which would involve violations of the State's obligations under international law, the State will not be prevented from invoking the principle of necessity if it adopts the measure involving the least grave violation of international law. Under this interpretation, the principle of necessity will only be precluded if there is an alternative that would not involve a breach of international law or which would involve a less grave breach of international law.\n\n371.\n\nA second question not addressed by the Tribunal is whether the relative effectiveness of alternative measures is to be taken into account. In adopting measures to safeguard an essential interest, a State may in practice not be in a position to know with certainty whether a given measure will prove to be effective, and reasonable minds may judge that some measures are likely to be more effective than others. For instance, suppose that there are two possible measures that a State might take in order to seek to safeguard an essential interest. One is 90 per cent probable to be 90 per cent effective to safeguard that essential interest, while the other is 50 per cent probable to be 60 per cent effective. Suppose that the former measure would (subject to the potential application of the principle of necessity) be inconsistent with obligations of the State under international law, while the latter measure would not. Would the State be precluded from invoking the principle of necessity if it adopted the former measure, on the basis that there was an alternative available? Or could the State claim that the measure taken was the \"only way\" that stood a very high chance of being very effective?\n\n372.\n\nA third question that is not specifically addressed by the Tribunal is who makes the decision whether there is a relevant alternative, and in accordance with what test? Does the Tribunal determine this at the date of its award, when the Tribunal may have the benefit of knowledge and hindsight that was not available to the State at the time that it adopted the measure in question? Or does the Tribunal determine whether, on the basis of information reasonably available at the time that the measure was adopted, a reasonable and appropriately qualified decision maker would have concluded that there was a relevant alternative open to the State? Or does customary international law recognise that reasonable minds might differ in relation to such a question, and give a \"margin of appreciation\" to the State in question? In that event, the relevant question for the Tribunal might be whether it was reasonably open to the State, in the circumstances as they pertained at the relevant time, to form the opinion that no relevant alternative was open.\n\n373.\n\nIt is not for the Committee in these annulment proceedings to provide answers to these questions. It was however necessary for the Tribunal, either expressly or *sub silentio*, to decide or assume the answers in order to apply the \"only way\" provision of Article 25(1)(a) to the facts of this case.\n\n374.\n\nOn no view could Professor Edwards be said to have expressed an expert opinion on these questions. Professor Edwards is an economist and not a lawyer, and his report does not purport to address the principle of necessity under customary international law or the interpretation of Article 25 of the ILC Articles. When Professor Edwards states that Argentina had other options for dealing with the economic crisis, he so states as an economist, and does not suggest that these other options would have amounted to relevant alternatives for purposes of the \"only way\" requirement of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n375.\n\nThe Committee notes that from the material before it, the parties in their arguments before the Tribunal do not appear to have expressly identified and argued the questions set out above, which would provide an explanation for why the Tribunal did not expressly address them. A Tribunal is not required to address expressly every argument put by a party, and a Tribunal is therefore certainly not required to address arguments that have not been put by parties.\n\n376.\n\nHaving said that, the Tribunal is required to apply the applicable law, and is required to state sufficient reasons for its decision. In this case, a reading of the cursory reasoning of paragraphs 300 and 308-309 of the Award clearly suggests that the Tribunal accepted the expert evidence of Professor Edwards over the conflicting expert evidence of Professor Nouriel Roubini, to the effect that Argentina had other options available to it for dealing with the economic crisis. From this, without any further analysis, the Tribunal immediately concluded, that the measures adopted by Argentina were not the \"only way\".\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal was required to determine whether, on the proper construction of Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles, the \"only way\" requirement in that provision was satisfied, and not merely whether, from an economic perspective, there were other options available for dealing with the economic crisis. The Committee concludes that in determining that the measures adopted were not the \"only way\", the Tribunal did not in fact apply Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles (or more precisely, customary international law as reflected in that provision), but instead applied an expert opinion on an economic issue. In all the circumstances the Committee finds that this amounts to a failure to apply the applicable law, as ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n378.\n\nFurther, even if the Tribunal did in fact satisfy itself that the \"only way\" requirement in Article 25(1)(a) was not met on the evidence before it, it is not apparent from the reasoning in the Award how or why the Tribunal came to that legal conclusion. Even if, contrary to all appearance, the Tribunal did apply the \"only way\" requirement in Article 25(1)(a), the Committee considers that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision. This constitutes a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n379.\n\nThe next issue that was considered by the Tribunal, dealt with in paragraph 310 of the Award, was whether the measures adopted by Argentina \" *seriously impair[ed] an essential interest of the State or States towards which the* *obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole* \", within the meaning of Article 25(1)(b) of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal found in that paragraph that \" *the interest of the international community does not appear to be in any way impaired* \", and said that the Tribunal would discuss subsequently whether there was an impairment of an essential interest of the State towards which the obligation exists. This subsequent discussion to which the Tribunal refers is paragraphs 341 to 342 of the Award. In paragraph 342, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n*... in the context of investment treaties there is still the need to take into consideration the interests of the private entities who are the ultimate beneficiaries of those obligations, as explained by the English court case in* OEPC *noted. The essential interest of the Claimants would certainly be* *seriously impaired by the operation of... state of necessity in this case.*\n\n380.\n\nThe reference in this paragraph to the *OEPC* case appears to be a reference back to paragraph 338 of the Award, which states:\n\n*As an English court has recently held in respect of a claim of non-justiciability relating to a State challenge to the* OEPC *award, the fact that a treaty is concluded between States cannot derogate from rights that belong to private parties, in the instance concerning dispute settlement, and as a consequence the doctrine of non-justiciability could not apply.*\n\n381.\n\nA footnote to that paragraph indicates that the reference to the *OEPC* case is to *Republic of Ecuador v. Occidental Exploration and Production Company* *(OEPC)*, Queen's Bench Application of April 29, 2005, at paragraph 85. This paragraph of that decision states:\n\n*I appreciate also that Article VII provides the means whereby the state Parties to the BIT can resolve a dispute as to the interpretation or application of the BIT through an arbitral tribunal \"in accordance with the applicable rules of international law\". But there is no dispute as between the USA and Ecuador, so far as I know. And that provision of the BIT cannot detract from the rights given to Occidental to have an investment dispute resolved in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article VI. That is what it has done and that is what Ecuador wishes to challenge. [Footnote omitted.]*\n\n382.\n\nThat paragraph of that decision was not concerned with the principle of necessity under customary international law, or with Article 25 of the ILC Articles, or indeed with the question of what are the \"essential interests\" of the two contracting States to a BIT. The relevance to the quoted passage from the *OEPC* case to the application of Article 25(1)(b) of the ILC Articles is entirely obscure.\n\n383.\n\nParagraph 310 of the Award might be understood as stating implicitly that in the context of a BIT, an essential interest of one contracting State will be seriously impaired if the other contracting State fails to respect the rights under the BIT of a national of the former. However, this is far from clearly implicit. Paragraph 342 of the Award states that \" *The essential interest of the Claimants would certainly be seriously impaired by the operation of... state of necessity in this case* \". This suggests that the Tribunal considered that the principle of necessity would not, or might not, apply in the context of a BIT if *the application of the principle of necessity* would seriously impair an essential interest of a national of the other contracting State to the BIT. This contrasts with the language of Article 25(1)(b) of the ILC Articles, which speaks of a situation where *the act of the State* invoking the principle of necessity would seriously impair a relevant essential interest.\n\n384.\n\nThe Tribunal nowhere states expressly that it finds the requirement in Article 25(1)(b) of the ILC not to be satisfied in this case. The Committee considers it unclear whether the Tribunal ultimately did make such a finding or not. To the extent that the Tribunal did make such a finding, the Committee considers that it is entirely unclear on what basis that finding of law was made, and the Committee concludes that the Tribunal therefore failed to state reasons for that decision, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n385.\n\nThe next issue that was considered by the Tribunal, dealt with in paragraphs 311-313 of the Award, was whether Argentina \" *contributed to the situation of necessity* \" within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles.\n\n386.\n\nAs in the case of the \"only way\" requirement, the Committee considers it selfevident that this requirement is potentially capable of more than one interpretation, and that the Tribunal was necessarily required, either expressly or *sub silentio*, to decide or assume the correct interpretation in order to apply the provision to the facts of the case.\n\n387.\n\nOn the most literal interpretation of this requirement, if there is any causal link at all between the conduct of the State and the situation of necessity, the principle of necessity will not apply, no matter how small a contribution the State's conduct made to the situation of necessity, regardless of whether or not the State was in any way blameworthy for that conduct, and regardless of whether or not the State could have in any way foreseen that its conduct would contribute to a situation of necessity.\n\n388.\n\nIt would appear that the Tribunal did not adopt such a literal interpretation. At paragraph 311 of the Award it said that \" *This [requirement in Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles] is of course the expression of a general principle of law devised to prevent a party taking legal advantage of its own fault* \". The Tribunal therefore appeared to consider that conduct of a State contributing to a situation of necessity for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles must be conduct constituting some sort of \"fault\" on the part of the State.\n\n389.\n\nHowever, that begs the question as to what will amount to \"fault\" in this context. Must the conduct of the State in question be deliberate (in the sense of being deliberately intended to bring about the situation of necessity), or does it suffice that the conduct was reckless or negligent, or is some even lesser degree of fault sufficient?\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal did not address this question. The Tribunal found at paragraphs 311-312 of the Award that:\n\n*Although each party claims that the factors precipitating the crisis were either endogenous or exogenous, the truth seems to be somewhere in between with both kind of factors having intervened, as in the end it has been so recognized by both the Government of Argentina and international organizations and foreign governments.*\n\n*... This means that to an extent there has been a substantial contribution of the State to the situation of necessity and that it cannot be claimed that the burden falls entirely on exogenous factors. This has not been the making of a particular administration as it is a problem that had been compounding its effects for a decade, but still the State must answer as a whole.*\n\n391.\n\nFrom these paragraphs it is apparent to the Committee that the Tribunal's finding that Argentina made a substantial contribution to the situation of necessity was based on the finding that the crisis was caused by both \"endogenous\" factors and \"exogenous\" factors. From these paragraphs read in conjunction with the first sentence of paragraph 300 of the Award, it is apparent that the Tribunal's finding that the crisis was caused at least in part by endogenous factors was based on paragraphs 33-82 of the Edwards Report. That report expresses the view that Argentina made various mistakes in its management of its economy in the years preceding and during the economic crisis, and states for instance at paragraph 74 that:\n\n*While external factors undoubtedly did play a role in the slowdown of the economy after 1998, that role was minor when compared to Argentina's own misguided policies - both during the 1990s and during 2000-2001. Those misguided internal policies greatly amplified the effects of external shocks on the Argentine economy.*\n\nHowever, Professor Edwards was speaking as an expert economist. He was not addressing the principle of necessity under customary international law, or Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles.\n\n392.\n\nAs in the case of the \"only way\" requirement, the Committee notes that from the material before it, the parties in their arguments before the Tribunal do not appear to have expressly identified and argued the issue of the legal definition of the expression \" *contributed to the situation of necessity* \" in Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles. However, the Committee again considers that the Tribunal is nonetheless required to apply the applicable law. The Committee considers that a reading of the cursory reasoning of the Tribunal in paragraphs 300 and 311-312 of the Award clearly suggests that the Tribunal accepted the expert evidence of Professor Edwards to the effect that Argentina's own \"misguided\" policies contributed to the magnitude of the economic crisis, and that from this the Tribunal directly concluded that the measures adopted by Argentina \" *contributed to the situation of necessity* \".\n\n393.\n\nThe Committee finds that in reaching that conclusion, the Tribunal did not in fact apply Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles (or more precisely, customary international law as reflected in that provision), but instead applied an expert opinion on an economic issue. While an economist might regard a State's economic policies as misguided, and might conclude that such policies led to or amplified the effects of an economic crisis, that would not of itself necessarily mean that as a matter of law, the State had \" *contributed to the situation of necessity* \" such as to preclude reliance on the principle of necessity under customary international law. The Tribunal's process of reasoning should have been as follows. First, the Tribunal should have found the relevant facts based on all of the evidence before it, including the Edwards Report. Secondly, the Tribunal should have applied the legal elements of the Article 25(2)(b) to the facts as found (having if necessary made legal findings as to what those legal elements are). Thirdly, in the light of the first two steps, the Tribunal should have concluded whether or not Argentina had \" *contributed to the situation of necessity* \" within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b). For the Tribunal to leap from the first step to the third without undertaking the second amounts in the Committee's view to a failure to apply the applicable law. This constitutes a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n394.\n\nThe final issue considered by the Tribunal was whether the BIT itself \" *excludes the possibility of invoking necessity* \", thereby precluding reliance on that principle in terms of Article 25(2)(a) of the ILC Articles. At paragraph 310 of the Award, the Tribunal said that it would discuss this issue subsequently. The Committee finds that the Tribunal did not subsequently make any determination of this question.\n\n395.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee finds that the decisions of the Tribunal that requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles were not met were tainted by annullable error. The Committee accordingly finds that the Tribunal's decision that Argentina is precluded from relying on the principle of necessity under customary international law must be annulled.\n\n*Article IV(3) of the BIT*\n--------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe section of the Award dealing with this issue sets out the arguments of Argentina (Award, paragraphs 314-316) and of the Claimants (Award, paragraphs 317-319), followed by the Tribunal's consideration and conclusion (Award, paragraphs 320-321).\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately found that this provision of the BIT, contrary to the submissions of Argentina, does not have the effect of allowing the host State to derogate from rights under the BIT in times of emergency.\n\n398.\n\nIt may well be that different interpretations of this provision are possible. However, for the reasons given in paragraphs 60-77 above, it is not for the Committee to determine whether or not the interpretation given to this provision by the Tribunal was correct or not. Whether it did so correctly or not, the Tribunal applied this provision as part of the applicable law. The Committee considers that from paragraphs 320-321 of the Award, read together with the preceding paragraphs setting out the arguments of the parties, the Tribunal's reasons for adopting the interpretation that it did are sufficiently clear. The Committee finds no annullable error.\n\n399.\n\nThe Committee accordingly finds no annullable error in this section of the Award.\n\n*Article XI of the BIT*\n-----------------------\n\n400.\n\nThe section of the Award dealing with this issue sets out the arguments of Argentina (Award, paragraphs 324-326) and of the Claimants (Award, paragraphs 327-330), followed by the Tribunal's consideration and conclusion (Award, paragraphs 331-342).\n\n401.\n\nIn its reasoning in respect of this issue, the Tribunal found (at paragraphs 331-332 and 335-342) that Article XI of the BIT is not \"self-judging\". This finding is the Tribunal's ruling on the arguments of Argentina referred to in paragraphs 324 and 326 of the Award. The Claimants' response to that argument is referred to in paragraphs 327-328 and 330 of the Award.\n\n402.\n\nThe Committee considers that when these paragraphs are read as a whole, the reasons for the Tribunal in reaching the conclusion that it did are quite clear. It is not for the Committee to determine whether that interpretation was correct or not. The Committee accordingly finds no annullable error in these paragraphs of the Award.\n\n403.\n\nAt paragraphs 333-344 of the Award, the Tribunal then concluded that it is \" *necessary to rely on the requirements of state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, so as to evaluate whether such requirements have been met in this case* \". This was said in paragraph 333 of the Award with particular reference to the expression \"security interests\" in Article XI. The apparent meaning of these paragraphs is that the Tribunal found that the effect of Article XI of the BIT is the same or similar to the effect of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, or at least, that the expression \" *measures necessary for... the Protection of its own essential security interests* \" in Article XI of the BIT has the same or similar meaning as the expression \" *[an act that is] the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril* \" in Article 25 of the ILC Articles. The Committee finds that the reasons for the Tribunal in reaching the conclusion are sufficiently clear, that it is not for the Committee to determine whether or not that interpretation was correct, and the Committee accordingly finds no annullable error in these paragraphs of the Award.\n\n404.\n\nIn view of this finding, the Tribunal then proceeded at paragraphs 339-341 of the Award to note that as it had already found that Argentina could not rely on the principle of necessity under customary international law because the requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles were not satisfied, for similar reasons Argentina could not rely on Article XI of the BIT in this case.\n\n405.\n\nThe Committee has concluded above that the Tribunal's finding that the requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles are not satisfied in this case must be annulled. Because that finding formed the basis of the Tribunal's finding that Article XI of the BIT was inapplicable in this case, the Committee concludes that the latter finding of the Tribunal must also be annulled.\n\nThe Committee notes that in the *CMS* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee expressed the view that the requirements under Article XI of the BIT are not the same as those under customary international law as codified by Article 25 of the ILC Articles, and that the tribunal in the *CMS* Award had erred on this point.331 The *ad hoc* committee in that case also considered that because the two texts have a different operation and content, it was necessary for the tribunal to take a position on their relationship and to decide whether they were both applicable in that case, and that the tribunal had made a manifest error of law in failing to do so.332 However, the Committee considers that the substantive operation and content of Article XI and the customary international law principles of necessity, and the interrelationship of the two, are issues that fall for decision by the tribunal. The role of an annulment committee is not to reach its own conclusions on these issues, but to determine whether the tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in reaching the conclusion that it did, or whether the tribunal failed to state reasons for reaching the conclusion that it did. The Committee has concluded that both the Tribunal's decision that Argentina is precluded from relying on Article XI, and the Tribunal's decision that Argentina is precluded from relying on the principle of necessity under customary international law, are tainted by annullable error. It follows that both of those findings of the Tribunal and its associated reasoning must be annulled. In the circumstances, there is no occasion for the Committee to go further and to express any view on the correctness or otherwise of the Tribunal's findings with respect to the substantive operation and content of, and interrelationship between, Article XI and the customary international law principles of necessity, and the Committee does not do so.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 130.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 131-132, and see also \u00b6\u00b6 145-146.\n\n**K. Conclusions**\n------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Committee has found above that the Tribunal's decision that Argentina is precluded from relying on Article XI of the BIT and on the principle of necessity under customary international law must be annulled.\n\n407.\n\nThe findings of the Tribunal that Argentina was precluded from relying on Article XI of the BIT and on the principle of necessity under customary international law were essential to the Tribunal's disposition of the case. The Committee finds it necessarily implicit in the reasoning in the Award that if the Tribunal had found that Argentina was entitled to rely on Article XI of the BIT or on the principle of necessity, it might have found that Argentina was not liable for any breach of the BIT. It therefore follows that the Tribunal's ultimate finding that Argentina breached its obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Claimants under the fair and equitable treatment clause and umbrella clause of the BIT must also be annulled.\n\n408.\n\nHaving annulled these findings of the Tribunal, the Committee cannot go further and make its own findings as to whether or not Argentina is entitled to rely on the principle of necessity under customary international law or on Article XI of the BIT, or as to whether or not Argentina is responsible for breaches of its obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Claimants under the fair and equitable treatment clause and umbrella clause of the BIT. These questions could only be determined by a tribunal, in the event that either party were to request resubmission pursuant to Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n409.\n\nArgentina has also sought annulment of the Tribunal's findings and decision with respect to the quantum of compensation awarded.333 However, a preliminary question arises as to whether, even if Argentina's arguments in this respect were rejected, the Tribunal's decision on compensation could in any event stand in view of the annulment of its decision on liability.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 61-64, 77-90.\n\n410.\n\nIt is clearly possible for an award to be annulled only in part.334 As one *ad hoc* committee has stated:\n\n*... a party to annulment proceedings which successfully pleads and sustains a ground for annulment set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention cannot limit the extent to which an* ad hoc *committee may decide to annul the* *impugned award as a consequence. Certain grounds of* *annulment will affect the award as a whole\u2014for example, where it is demonstrated that the tribunal which rendered the award was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)).* *Others may only affect part of the award. An* ad hoc *committee is expressly authorised by the Convention to annul an award \"in whole or in part\" (Article 52(3)).*\n\n*Thus where a ground for annulment is established, it is for the* ad hoc *committee, and not the requesting party, to determine the extent of the annulment. In making this determination, the committee is not bound by the applicant\u2019s characterisation of its request, whether in the original application or otherwise, as requiring either* *complete or partial annulment of the award. This is reflected in the difference in language between Articles 52(1) and 52(3), and it is further supported by the* travaux *of the ICSID Convention.*335\n\nICSID Convention, Article 52(3) (final sentence); ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3).\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n411.\n\nAs another *ad hoc* committee has also stated:\n\n*Generally speaking, partial annulment would seem appropriate if the part of the Award affected by the excess of power is identifiable and detachable from the rest, and if so, the remaining part of the Award has an independent basis.*336\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 80.\n\n412.\n\nFor this reason, the Committee considers that it would be inappropriate to annul an entire award where the decision on annulment affects only a discrete part of parts of an award.\n\n413.\n\nLiability and quantum of compensation are two discrete issues, but a decision on the latter must necessarily follow the decision on the former. It is unproblematic in theory to annul the portion of an award dealing with quantum of compensation but to leave intact the portion dealing with liability. In that event, in any resubmission proceedings, the issue before the resubmission tribunal would be confined to determining the quantum of damages in the light of the findings on liability made by the original tribunal.\n\n414.\n\nThe position is otherwise where the finding on liability is annulled. There can be no obligation to pay compensation in the absence of any liability. Following annulment of the Tribunal's finding on liability, its finding on damages can simply no longer stand, but must fall with the finding on liability. In the event that resubmission proceedings were requested, and in the event that a resubmission tribunal were to make a new finding of liability, it would be for that tribunal to also make a new finding of damages. The Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal's original decision with respect to damages must also be annulled in consequence of the annulment of the Tribunal's finding on liability. In the circumstances, there is no need for the Committee to consider Argentina's contentions that the Tribunal's findings with respect to damages themselves contained annullable errors.\n\n415.\n\nThe Committee finds however that the parts of the Award other than those referred to above are detachable from the annulled portions and have an independent existence. These other parts are not annulled.\n\n416.\n\nA further issue concerns the Tribunal's decision with respect to the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal. The Tribunal decided that each party is to bear the legal costs by it in connection with those proceedings and that the arbitration costs were to be borne in equal shares by the parties. The Tribunal indicated that it reached this decision as to costs \"Considering... the various issues in this case\",337 which would have included the consideration that the Claimants had succeeded in their claim. The question is whether the partial annulment of the Award removes the basis for that decision as to costs. For instance, as the *ad hoc* committee said in the *MINE* Annulment Decision, in which the award was partially annulled:\n\n*The award of costs can nevertheless not remain in existence since its basis, viz., that Guinea was the losing party, has disappeared as a result of the annulment of the portion of the Award relating to damages. The award of costs cannot survive the annulment of that portion of the Award with which it is inextricably linked. The Committee therefore finds that the award of costs must be annulled in consequence of the annulment of the damages portion of the Award.*338\n\nAward \u00b6 453.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 6,112.\n\n417.\n\nHowever, the present case is distinguishable in that in the *MINE* case, the tribunal had awarded to the successful claimant costs towards its fees and expenses in the ICSID arbitration.339 In the present case, the Tribunal ordered both parties to bear their own costs and to share equally the arbitration costs notwithstanding that the Claimants had succeeded in their claim. The Committee finds no reason for thinking that the Tribunal would not have made exactly the same order, even if Argentina had been successful in defending the claim. The Committee therefore sees no reason for annulling the Tribunal's decision as to the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 2.01.\n\n**L. Costs and stay of proceedings**\n------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nUnder Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), read in conjunction with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has a discretion to determine how and by whom shall be paid the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n419.\n\nThe Committee notes that in the *MTD* Annulment Decision, it was said that:\n\n*In all but one of the concluded annulment proceedings,* *Committees have made no order for the parties\u2019 own costs and have held that ICSID\u2019s costs should be borne equally by the parties. They did so not only where the application for annulment succeeded in whole or part but also where it failed.*340\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 110.\n\n420.\n\nOther annulment decisions have also adopted the same approach to costs,341 which has been referred to a \" *developing practice* \",342 subject to some flexibility, for instance in a case where the annulment application was \" *fundamentally lacking in merit* \" and that the respondent's case was \" *to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed* \".343\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 138; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 161-162; *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 131.\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 138.\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 111. See also *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Decision on Annulment, January 08, 2007, \u00b6 88; *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v. Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on Annulment, April 16, 2009, \u00b6 82.\n\n421.\n\nOn the other hand, in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee took a different approach. It noted that under Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the default rule is that an applicant for annulment is solely responsible for making the advance payments to ICSID on account of ICSID's costs. It contrasted this provision with Regulation 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, which applies to the original proceedings before a tribunal, under which the default rule is that each party shall pay one half of each advance payment to ICSID on account of the costs of the arbitration. The *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix* concluded that:\n\n*As to this difference in approach the Committee takes the view that a default position is thereby established that in the absence of other order a party who has applied for annulment and has paid in advance all of the costs of the Centre in relation to that application as is required by the Regulations should bear those costs.*344\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 373.\n\n422.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee then went on to conclude that:\n\n*The Committee considers that under the Regulations, and as a matter of discretion, the normal course should be for a wholly unsuccessful applicant for annulment carry the burden of the whole of the costs of the Centre advanced by it associated with the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the* ad hoc *committee. Of course, the Committee does not exclude the possibility that circumstances might justify a departure from this normal rule, but the Committee finds no such exceptional circumstances in the present case. In particular, the fact that there are novel and complex issues to be determined in the annulment proceedings, as here, does not of itself amount to such exceptional circumstances. Also, as here, it is of the essence of annulment matters that they are original and difficult*.345\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 378.\n\n423.\n\nA similar approach was subsequently taken in the *MCI* Annulment Decision, in which the *ad hoc* committee concluded that a consequence of Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations \" *should normally be that the applicant, when annulment is refused, remains responsible for these costs* \".346\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 88.\n\n424.\n\nHowever, unlike the *Azurix* and *MCI* cases, this is not a case in which the\n\nannulment application has been entirely unsuccessful. In the present case, the application for annulment of Argentina has succeeded in part, but not in whole. The Committee considers that it would be appropriate in the circumstances and in the light of previous annulment decisions for ICSID's costs in these annulment proceedings to be borne equally by the parties.\n\n425.\n\nAs to each party's own litigation costs, the Committee notes that after the oral hearing on the merits, each of the parties submitted details of the precise costs of their own representation in these annulment proceedings. The Committee notes that the costs of each party were of a comparable magnitude. In view of this, and in view of the fact that the application for annulment of Argentina has succeeded in part but not in whole, the Committee considers that it would also be appropriate in the circumstances and in the light of previous annulment decisions for each party to bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding, including its costs of legal representation.\n\n426.\n\nDuring these annulment proceedings, the enforcement of the Award was stayed pending the Committee's decision on the Application for Annulment, pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(1) and (2). ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3) provides that:\n\n*If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n427.\n\nThe present stay of enforcement of the Award thus terminates with the rendering of the present decision of the Committee. Given that the Tribunal's decision on liability as well as its decision on damages have both been annulled, the remaining portions of the Award that have not been annulled are presently incapable of enforcement, and will remain so unless and until that position is altered by a subsequent decision of a tribunal on resubmission. In the circumstances, the Committee considers that there is no need for it to make any order pursuant to the second sentence of ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3).\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n[428].\n\n**For the reasons given above, the Committee:**\n\n**(1) pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning that the Argentine Republic is precluded from relying on Article XI of the BIT;**\n\n**(2) pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning that the Argentine Republic is precluded from relying on the principle of necessity under customary international law;**\n\n**(3) consequently to (1) and (2), annuls the decision of the Tribunal in paragraph 1 of the Disposition of the Award that \"The Respondent breached its obligations to accord the investor the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty and to observe the obligations entered into with regard to the Investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty\";**\n\n**(4) consequently to (1), (2) and (3), annuls the decision of the Tribunal in paragraph 2 of the Disposition of the Award that \"The Respondent shall pay the Claimants compensation in the amount of US$106.2 million\", and the decision of the Tribunal in paragraph 3 of the Disposition of the Award relating to the payment of interest on such compensation;**\n\n**(5) otherwise rejects the application for annulment of the Argentine Republic;**\n\n**(6) decides that each Party shall bear one half of the costs incurred** **by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the** **Committee;**\n\n**(7) decides that each Party shall bear its own litigation costs and** **expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding, including its costs of legal representation.**"}]}
