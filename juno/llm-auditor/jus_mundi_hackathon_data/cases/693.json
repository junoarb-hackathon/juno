Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 January 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration against the Argentine Republic (hereinafter \"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Continental Casualty Company (hereinafter \"the Claimant\" or \"Continental\"), a company incorporated under the law of the State of Illinois, United States of America. The Request concerned Continental's investment in CNA Aseguradora de Riesgos del Trabajo S.A. (\"CNA ART\"), an insurance company incorporated in Argentina, which Continental claims to wholly own, and Argentina's alleged breaches of Continental's rights as investor under the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (the \"Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty\" or the \"BIT\").1\n\nDone in Washington, D.C. on November 14, 1991, in force since October 20, 1994.\n\n2.\n\nIn its request, Continental invoked Argentina's advance consent to arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\") in the Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated January 28, 2003, Continental supplemented its request, attaching a copy of a letter dated January 15, 2003 with its consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the BIT, and a power of attorney authorizing the law firm of Appleton & Associates to represent it in these proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nOn January 29, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of January 17, 2003, the Centre requested Continental to provide: (i) further information regarding the steps taken to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, as foreseen in Article VII (2) of the BIT; and (ii) confirmation that the dispute had not been submitted to the local courts of Argentina or any previously agreed dispute settlement procedures, also in accordance with Article VII (2) of the BIT. Continental responded by letter of March 17, 2003.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of May 2, 2003 the Centre further asked Continental to clarify whether the condition set forth in the BIT that six month should elapse between the date in which the dispute arose and the submission of the request for arbitration had been fulfilled. Claimant responded by letter of May 5, 2003.\n\n7.\n\nOn May 22, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nMore than sixty days elapsed since the date of registration without the parties being able to agree on the number of arbitrators that would comprise the tribunal in this case or on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on July 22, 2003, the Claimant requested that the tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (i.e. a Tribunal comprising three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the parties).\n\n9.\n\nOn August 20, 2003 the Argentine Republic appointed Licenciado Michell Nader, a Mexican National, as an arbitrator. On August 22, 2003, the Claimant appointed Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, a national of the United Kingdom as an arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nAlso on August 22, 2003, more than ninety days having elapsed since the date of registration, Continental, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, requested that the president of the tribunal be appointed by the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council.\n\n11.\n\nWith the agreement of both parties, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Tribunal appointed Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti, an Italian national, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On October 6, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the agreement of the parties, on January 29, 2004, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Among others, it was agreed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 22, the languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish. The Claimant would file its pleadings in English and Argentina would file its pleadings in Spanish, with a subsequent courtesy translation into English. Also, the Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, fixed the following schedule for the written phase of the proceedings: the Claimant would file a memorial on the merits within ninety (90) days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial on the merits within ninety (90) days from its receipt of the Claimant's memorial; the Claimant would file a reply within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the counter-memorial; and the Respondent would file a rejoinder within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the Claimant's reply.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the first session it was noted that were Argentina to raise objections to jurisdiction, it may do so within the ninety (90) days time limit fixed for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits. In that case the proceedings on the merits would be suspended in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3) and the Claimant would file its counter-memorial on jurisdiction within forty five (45) days from its receipt of the Argentine Republic's objections to jurisdiction. The Tribunal would thereafter, in consultation with the parties, fix a date for a hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nOn April 27, 2004, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation. On June 29, 2004 Argentina filed a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of July 12, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3). In conformity with the procedural decisions referred above, the Claimant submitted its counter-memorial on jurisdiction on July 30, 2004.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 6, 2004, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht resigned as an arbitrator in this case due to health conditions. Following Professor Sacerdoti's and Licenciado Nader's consent to Sir Elihu's resignation and in accordance with Arbitration Rule 10, the proceedings were suspended until the vacancy created by Si Elihu's resignation was filled. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1), the Secretary of the Tribunal invited Continental to appoint a new arbitrator in replacement of Sir Elihu. By letter of September 14, 2004, the Claimant appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom as an arbitrator. The proceedings were resumed in October 14, 2004, following Mr. Veeder's acceptance of his appointment.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of December 16, 2004, the Tribunal informed the parties that it wished to hold a hearing on jurisdiction and proposed dates for such hearing. The hearing was held, with the agreement of the parties, on February 1, 2005 at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. Messrs. Barry Appleton, Robert Wisner, Hernando Otero, Nick Gallus, Ali Ghiassi and Ms. Asha Kaushal from the law firm of Appleton & Associates, International Layers of Toronto Canada, and Ms. Sally Narey, General Counsel, Continental, attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimant. Ms. Cintia Yaryura and Ms. Maria Victoria Vitali from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Mr. Marcelo Massoni, from the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C. and Mr. Roberto Bado from the Ministry of Economy of the Argentine Republic, attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing Messrs. Appleton and Wisner addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Continental. Ms. Yaryura and Vitali addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n19.\n\nSubsequent to the hearing the Tribunal received a communication from the Claimant pointing to recent ICSID decisions on jurisdiction issued in cases involving Argentina, and an answer from Argentina raising objections as to the relevance of those decisions. The Tribunal informed the parties, through the Secretariat, on July 20, 2005 that \" *it believes it is empowered to take judicial notice of such published decisions.* *However, in accordance with due process principles, the Tribunal is of the opinion that should it consider necessary for its decision on jurisdiction to specifically rely on points raised and discussed in those decisions, it should give an opportunity first to the parties to comment on those possibly relevant points. The Tribunal would accordingly do so should the situation envisaged occur.\"*\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and considered thoroughly the parties' written submissions on the question of jurisdiction and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the February 1, 2005 hearing. As indicated in paragraph 16 above, the consideration of the merits has been suspended until the issue of the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence has been decided by the Tribunal. Having considered the basic facts of the dispute, the ICSID Convention and the 1991 Argentina-U.S. BIT, as well as the written and oral arguments of the parties' representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n**B. The Subject Matter of the Dispute**\n----------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nBefore examining the issue of jurisdiction submitted to the Tribunal, it appears useful to highlight briefly the subject matter of the dispute, in fact and in law, as presented by the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration, as thereafter expanded in its Memorial on the Merits of April 27, 2004, taking into account thereafter the statements made up to now by Argentina. Such presentation is made for the sole purpose of comprehension of the factual circumstances and the legal claims made by Claimant in respect of which Argentina has raised objections to jurisdiction. No legal evaluation is hereby implied or made by the Tribunal, nor should any such significance be attached to it for the purpose of the present case.\n\n22.\n\nAs indicated by the Claimant in its briefs, Continental is a company incorporated in Illinois, in the U.S., and is a subsidiary of CNA Financial Inc. (CNA) \"a leading financial services provider which has its head offices in Chicago.\" Continental owns and controls CNA ART which \"is one of Argentina's leading providers of workers compensation insurance services.\" CNA ART was incorporated in Argentina in 1996 under the name of \"OMEGA Aseguradora de Riesgos del Trabajo SA.\" In June 1997, Continental acquired a 70% interest in this company and increased its participation to practically 100% (precisely 99,995%) in December 2000. Thereupon Omega changes its name into CNA ART.\n\n23.\n\nCNA ART, like other insurance companies, maintains a portfolio of investment securities in order to earn a return on its capital, consisting mainly of \"low-risk assets such as cash deposit, treasury bills and government bonds.\" Under Argentinean regulations of CNA's insurance operation \"such capital must be invested within Argentina, with minor exceptions.\"\n\n24.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, prior to March 2001, CNA investment portfolio was primarily in assets denominated in Argentine pesos, which were at the time fully convertible to U.S. dollars at a one to one exchange rate. In order to hedge the risk of devaluation, CNA's management decided to invest assets within Argentina in low risk U.S. denominated assets. As a result of various investment operations CNA held thereafter a portfolio of cash accounts, certificates of deposit, T-bills, Government bonds and Government loans (GGLs) for a U.S. value of $100,998,000.\n\n25.\n\nContinental indicates that \"Commencing in December 2001, Argentina enacted a series of decrees and resolutions that destroyed the legal security of the assets held by CNA ART. These measures frustrated CNA ART's ability to hedge against the risk of the devaluation of the pesos.\" Claimant refers to \"Argentina's restrictions on transfers out of its territory\"; to \"rescheduling of cash deposits;\" to \"pesification of U.S. dollar deposits;\" to \"pesification and defaults on its debt obligations\" as well as to other measures. Continental indicates that due to these measures (collectively referred to as \"Argentina's *Capital Control Regime*.\"), as an investor in Argentina, it has suffered an absolute loss in value of its assets of US$ 45,456,000; in addition it is or was unable due to the \"Bank Freeze\" to access its investments in Argentina.\n\n26.\n\nFrom a legal point of view, Continental asserts that it is protected under the BIT as \"a U.S. investor with an investment in Argentina,\" its protected investment being namely CNA ART. Continental claims that, by the conduct and acts summarily referred to above, Argentina has failed to meet its existing bilateral investment treaty obligations owed to it as a U.S. investor with investment in Argentina. Continental claims that Argentina has violated, at least the following provisions of the BIT:\n\n(i) the requirement to observe obligations required by Art. II(2)(c) of the BIT;\n\n(ii) the requirement to provide treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, as required by Art. II(2)(b) of the BIT, as well as MFN treatment under Art. II(2)(a);\n\n(iii) the requirement to permit all transfers relating to an investment without delay, set out in Art. V of the BIT; and\n\n(iv) the requirement to pay compensation upon acts of expropriation, set out in Art. IV of the BIT.\n\nClaimant refers to international law as to the law applicable to its claims of breach of the BIT by Argentina, in conformity with Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n27.\n\nIn view of the facts and arguments set out in its Memorial, the Claimant has submitted that \"Owing to these violation of the BIT, singly and in combination, the Investor is entitled to compensation in an amount equal to the full amount of the damages suffered as a consequence.\"\n\n**C. The objections of Argentina to jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Generally**\n----------------\n\n28.\n\nIn the introductory part of its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Argentina takes issue with various statements of facts and the legal basis of Continental's claims. Argentina objects to the characterization by the Claimant of the various measures referred to by same \"as involving an alleged breach of the treaty.\" Argentina points out generally that \"The Guaranteed Loans, the LETEs and the Term Deposits in the different financial entities in Argentina are operations governed by the law in force in the Argentine Republic. The regulations applicable to those operations were changed in the context of the most serious financial, institutional and political crisis that took place in Argentine by the end of 2001\" which made it \"necessary to take urgent and exceptional measures\" of various kinds involving the \"restructuring of the financial banking and exchange markets.\"\n\n29.\n\nSpecifically Argentina addresses in some details the various measures that affected (a) the *Argentine Government Guaranteed Loans,* in the context of the end of the convertibility; (b) the restructuring of the financial system, as it brought to the conversion in pesos of deposits made originally in U.S. dollars, their rescheduling and the option to receive government bonds in pesos; as well as (c) the restructuring of defaulted debt.\n\n30.\n\nArgentina further indicates that it is undisputed that \"CNA ART is a corporation incorporated under Argentinean law and governed by the Argentine Law\" which applies not only to its legal status and capacity but also in respect to its operation. Argentina submits that in the case submitted by Claimant \"all the investment operations are only related to the Argentine Republic, both in respect of the parties involved and the place of performance of the contracts\". Argentina points out that the two agreements referred to by the Claimant were entered by CNA with CADISA (an Argentine company) and the Argentine subsidiary of Citicorp S.A. and were both subject to Argentine law and jurisdiction according to their terms. These were contracts without international connection subject to Argentine law including \"the mandatory and non waivable laws passed by the Argentine Government during the economic emergency\" that modified those contractual relationships.\n\n31.\n\nArgentina concludes the general part of its Memorial on Jurisdiction by stressing that CNA, which had entered into an investment management agreement with another Argentine company to be performed in Argentina, is an Argentine corporation, notwithstanding the fact that its shares have been bought by an American corporation, namely the Claimant. As to CNA \"the interest in shares has not the effect of changing its special law or changing the legal system applicable to its acts\". Argentina concludes generally that it has never given its consent to the international arbitral tribunals of ICSID as to disputes of the type submitted by Claimant. This is because, in Argentina's view, the dispute involves claims between individuals and issues arising from the taking of business risks.\n\n32.\n\nBefore examining the specific objections of Argentina to jurisdiction, together with the counter arguments of Claimant, mention must be made that Claimant disputes the summarization of facts by Argentina as not accurate. The Claimant does not rebut in detail the factual presentation by Argentina, since in its view \"On a jurisdictional motion, the facts alleged in the Claimant's Memorial are assumed to be true on a *prima facie* basis.\" The Claimant elaborates therefore further on the factual aspect in its countermemorial only in so far the facts are relevant in its view for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n2. **Argentina's specific objections to jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nArgentina raises four objections to jurisdiction in its memorial on jurisdiction, which are being listed hereunder and are being thereafter specifically described and addressed together with the counter-arguments of the Claimant:\n\n*(i) \"Argentina has not given its consent to submit to this arbitration;\"*\n\n*(ii) \"The dispute submitted by Claimant does not comply with the requirements of the Convention or those under the U.S.-Argentina BIT,\" particularly as to (a) the existence of a legal dispute and as to (b) the requirement that the legal dispute arises directly out of an investment;*\n\n*(iii) \"The claim is premature or not ripe;\"*\n\n*(iv) \"The Claimant lacks \"jus standi\" to submit the dispute to the Tribunal.*\n\n**a. First and second jurisdictional objections of Argentina:**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) *\"Argentina has not given its consent to submit to this arbitration\"*\n\n(ii) *\"The dispute submitted by Claimant does not comply with the* *requirements of the Convention or those under the US-Argentina BIT\", particularly as to (a) the existence of a legal dispute and as to (b) the requirement that the legal dispute arises directly out of an investment*\n\n**i. Argentina's arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe first objection is presented by Argentina as an introduction to the second objection, so that it appears warranted to examine them jointly.\n\n35.\n\nUnder its first objection Argentina \"insists on the need to examine the extent of the consent by the Argentine State to submit to the ICSID system\" by examining, according to the principles of interpretation of treaties under international law, the relevant clauses of both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-U.S. BIT.\n\n36.\n\nWithin its second objection Argentina points out that it gave its consent under the BIT \"only for those cases that - complying with requirements of the Washington Convention are encompassed within the Treaty's scope of application.\" Argentina refers to three basic and essential requirements that restrict the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunals pursuant to Art.25(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\na. the existence of a legal dispute\n\nb. directly arising out of an investment\n\nc. between a Contracting State and a National of another Contracting State\n\n37.\n\nAs to requirement (a) Argentina submits, based also on *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* that the dispute must be about \"rights and obligations,\" about legal titles and not some \"undesirable consequences\" that have not as the proximate cause the host State's conduct in respect of its investment. In Argentina's view in this case the Claimant is not submitting a legal claim within those requirements because it \"is not the holder of the legal rights that it alleged have been breached by the Argentine Republic.\"\n\n38.\n\nAs to requirement (b) Argentina submits that the legal dispute must arise directly out of the investment in that \"the measure or measures alleged as in violation of the U.S.-Argentina BIT must be *specifically* addressed to the investments.\" Argentina considers that the word \"directly\" in Art. 25(1) \"may also be translated as specifically.... The measure must be addressed to the investment. Universal measures addressed to the general public cannot be considered by ICSID Tribunals. That would be to judge a public policy and not a legal conflict.\"\n\n39.\n\nArgentina considers accordingly that in order that jurisdiction be established \"Continental must show which specific obligations, vis a vis the claimant were breached by Argentina through its devaluation of the Peso, the establishment of a new exchange rate and the temporary pesification of the tariffs.\" As a support to its approach, Argentina relies on the recent NAFTA arbitration awards on jurisdiction \" *Methanex v. U.S.A.* \" and \" *GAMI v. Mexico* \" to the effect that it is not enough that the measure \"affects\" the investor or its investment. Argentina concludes that Continental has not been able to prove, as is required in Argentina's view also for jurisdictional purposes, \"a direct proximate and immediate connection between the measure its alleged investment.\"\n\n40.\n\nIn Argentina's view the only position that the Claimant is able to assert is its position as shareholder of CNA. According to Argentina, however, this position does not enable Continental to claim in the circumstances impairment to its \"legal rights born out of the ownership of shares\" due to Argentina's measures. Argentina submits further that also the damages suffered by the investor must be direct, that is grounded on an action that \"specifically impairs a legal right born out of the ownership of the shares.\" This requirement that those damages result from an interference with a right and not with a mere interest of the shareholders, be they minority or majority shareholders, is not met either in the present case, according to Argentina.\n\n**ii. The Claimant's counterarguments:**\n----------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant argues generally in the first place that the \"Proper Approach to a Jurisdictional Challenge\" requires that the Tribunal must determine whether the pleadings have disclosed a *prima facie claim*. The Claimant submits that for this purpose the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's description of the facts as true referring to international case law in support of its position. The Claimant points out that, accordingly, Argentina's attempt to justify its measures as necessary to respond to its economic crisis is irrelevant at the jurisdictional phase. The Claimant also objects to Argentina's description of the facts alleged by Claimant and Argentina's introduction of new unsubstantiated facts as improper for jurisdictional purposes and invites the Tribunal to disregard them.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the following facts it has alleged are sufficient to establish jurisdiction:\n\n- Continental is a U.S. juridical person;\n\n- Continental owns 99,995% of the shares of CNA;\n\n- CNA owned a portfolio of low-risk assets in Argentina;\n\n- Argentina enacted a series of measures that directly interfered with the legal security of CNA assets, which violated specific commitments to Continental and CNA in treaties, legislation and contracts.\n\n43.\n\nTo clarify its assertions that \"the measures taken by Argentina had a direct legal connection to CNA ART and violated specific commitments in treaties, legislation and contracts,\" the Claimant sets forth a table summarizing Argentina's \"Measures Violating Specific Legal Commitments\" and correlating each of them to the \"Direct Legal Connection to CNA ART\" and to the \"Legal Commitment violated\", specifying their respective source, in contract, legislation and/or the BIT.\n\n44.\n\nSpecifically, in respect of the first and second jurisdictional objections of Argentina the Claimant argues as follows.\n\n45.\n\nThe dispute is a \"legal dispute\" because it arises from a conflict of rights rather than a conflict of interests. More specifically, according to the Claimant, the dispute at issue \"concerns the different views of the Claimant and Argentina on questions of legal rights and obligations in connection with the existence of an investment, and the effects this may have on Argentina's obligations to honour debt instruments, to preserve the Claimant's property rights in the cash deposits and its right under the BIT to transfer capital\". As to the argument of Argentina that the claim concerns the commercial relationship between CNA and CADISA, the Claimant indicates that the dispute does not arise from that relationship, so that \"simply because a dispute involves commercial relationships does not preclude it from also concerning legal rights based on treaty...and therefore being a legal dispute.\"\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant objects to Argentina's approach. In its view, the requirement that a dispute must arise \"directly\" from an investment does not imply that the measure challenged must be \"specifically\" addressed at the business concerned. The Claimant submits that for jurisdictional purposes it is enough - as held in the *CMS* decision on jurisdiction - that the impugned measures *prima facie* adversely affect the Claimant's investment, so that the Tribunal is competent to examine whether those measures are in breach of specific commitments given to the investor.\n\n47.\n\nFurther more the Claimant states that the impugned measures need not be \"specifically directed against investments.\" The Claimant points out that the NAFTA precedents referred to by Argentina are irrelevant, both because the text of Art. 1101(1) of NAFTA is worded differently from that of Art.25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and because in the *Methanex* case the measure at issue did not concern an investment of said company but affected the operations of other companies to which Methanex supplied its products. In this case, by contrast, Claimant points out that \"Argentina's measures affected the legal rights of Continental and CNA ART by interfering with commitments given to them in contracts, legislation and the BIT.\" In any case, according to the Claimant, there is no requirement in the NAFTA either, as interpreted and applied in various disputes, that the measure be specifically directed at a particular investment.\n\n48.\n\nAs to the argument of Argentina that \"the measure must affect assets owned by the investor and not just by the investment,\" the Claimant addresses it when discussing Argentina's objection to jurisdiction as to the *jus standi* of the Claimant. The Claimant believes that Argentina \"recharacterizes this issue as one on Continental's \u2018standing' to bring the claim.\"\n\nb. **Third jurisdictional objection of Argentina** :\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n*(iii) The Company may not file a claim because the claim is premature or not ripe.*\n\n49.\n\nArgentina considers that Continental's claim is not ripe - in legal terms and not just from a policy point of view - because the alleged damages fluctuates constantly since Argentina's negotiations with foreign creditors are not yet over; therefore \"A claim on the indirect consequences that may have affected foreign shareholders of Argentine corporations can hardly be though of.\" Moreover, according to Argentina this would be contrary to a proper interpretation of the BIT: \"Should it be admitted that this is applicable to the contractual relations governed by local law and submitted to the jurisdiction of the local courts, the scope of application of the BIT would be unlawfully extended.\"\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant rejects Argentina's argument that the claim is not ripe. The Claimant recalls that in a previous decision that Tribunal has stated that the perspective of negotiations between Argentine authorities and a company owned by foreign investors and/or those investors are immaterial in order to determine the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal. The Claimant states that the principles relied to by Argentina in support of this objection do not affect the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, which depends on the claim satisfying the requirements of Art.25 of the ICSID Convention and of the BIT.\n\n**c. Fourth jurisdictional objection of Argentina**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*(iv) Continental's lack of action to submit a dispute to this Tribunal: the \"Jus Standi\"*\n\n**i. Argentina's arguments**\n----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nArgentina submits that the present dispute does not fall within the scope of the application of the BIT for different reasons, all related to the definition of \"investment\" suggested by Argentina as being the correct one under that treaty. It is Argentina's view that the Claimant \"has presented a claim founded on the loss in value of its investment represented by the acquisition of shares in an Argentinean corporation - CNA ART\" and that the foreign investor has alleged \"that its interests have been impaired by commercial and financial decisions taken in the framework of a shares investment business made within Argentina\". Argentina submits further that the purchase of shares in that Argentine corporation is a business subject to Argentina's law, which is also the law applicable to the interest in those shares and more generally to the existing legal relationship between the Claimant and CNA. In view of the above Argentina concludes that \"the claimant has not proved that the Argentine State has issued any measure addressed directly to that acquisition of shares.\"\n\n52.\n\nArgentina further indicates that since the investment of the Claimant consists in shares of an Argentine company, while the measures have affected the Argentinean corporation of which the Claimant is a shareholder, the lack of the required relationship between the dispute brought and the investment in accordance with the BIT result in a lack of jurisdiction on the \"indirect claim\" which is the subject matter of this dispute. This is because the situation here is that of a shareholder making a claim in connection to assets or circumstances related to the entity where it has interests, in disregard therefore of the acknowledged principle that the partners and the corporation are different legal persons. Argentina concludes that while the definitions of investment in the BIT are broad, CNA - whose interests have been affected - \"does not qualify either as an investor or as an investment pursuant to the mentioned international instrument.\"\n\n**ii. The Claimant's counterarguments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant considers that it is \"now well settled that an investor may bring an investor-state claim under the BIT for measures interfering with the legal rights of its Argentine subsidiary and not just for measures affecting the investor's shares in the subsidiary.\" In support of its position the Claimant refers, with extensive quotes, to various decisions of ICSID tribunals, to the effect that there is no bar in current international law, including under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-U.S. BIT, to the concept of allowing claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned, even if those shareholders are minority or non controlling shareholders. The Claimant also recalls that, some years after *Barcelona Traction* (relied upon by Argentina), the ICJ in the *Elsi* case accepted the protection of shareholders of a corporation by the State of their nationality in spite of the fact that the affected corporation had a corporate personality under the defendant's State legislation.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant refers to various decisions recognizing that the ICSID Convention \"looks to the real interests behind an investment.\" These decisions rejected Argentina's argument that, in a case of an investment in shares in an Argentinean company, claims can be only made in respect of measures affecting the shares *qua* shares, as in the event of expropriation of the shares or other measures affecting directly the economic rights of the shareholders. The Claimant concludes that \"the ability of shareholders to claim for damage suffered by the company in which they hold shares,\" in any case when the protected investor is a controlling shareholder (as here), is well settled in jurisprudence and cannot be open to challenges at the jurisdictional stage.\n\n**d. Other jurisdictional arguments by Argentina**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nArgentina raises also a different argument in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, namely relating to the Most Favored Nation clause (MFN) referred to by the Claimant in its briefs. Argentina challenges the reference made to this standard by the Claimant. Argentina submits that, based on the intention of the parties and as held in various precedents, the MFN clause in the Argentina-U.S. BIT is inapplicable to jurisdictional issues. In this respect Argentina stresses that in its view the *Maffezzini* decision rendered under the Argentina-Spain BIT has no precedential value here.\n\n56.\n\nContinental points out in turn that it has invoked the MFN clause of the Argentina-U.S. BIT (Art. II(1)) in relation to the treatment granted to Chilean investors as to the remittance of capital transfers under the Argentina-Chile BIT, since the latter appears to grant a better treatment. The Claimant points out that this argument pertains in any case to the merits and that it does not seek to use Article II(1) of the Argentina - U.S. BIT in order to enjoy the better *dispute resolution provisions* in another treaty. Therefore the Claimant \"does not rely on the aspects of the *Maffezini* decision that Argentina impugns.\" The proper interpretation of the MFN clause in the BIT is therefore not a jurisdictional issue.\n\n**D. Consideration by the Tribunal on the Objections to Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. In general**\n-----------------\n\n57.\n\nAs announced by the President of the Tribunal at the end of the hearing on jurisdiction and in conformity with Art. 31 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41, the Tribunal is called to decide as a preliminary question the objections raised by the Respondent to the effect that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre nor within the competence of the Tribunal. While the parties have advanced many arguments, some of which touching upon the merits, the Tribunal will consider hereafter only those that are relevant to its decision regarding the objections of the Respondent to jurisdiction.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore ascertain, for the sole purpose of determining its competence under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-U.S. BIT, whether the criteria that define disputes for the purpose of the ICSID jurisdiction under those two instruments are met. These criteria are:\n\na. that the dispute is between Argentina (as a contracting party to ICSID and the BIT) and a national of the U.S.A., as defined in the BIT;\n\nb. that the dispute is a \"legal\" dispute (Art. 25 (1) ICSID Convention);\n\nc. that said legal dispute arises \"directly\" out of an investment (Art. 25 (1) ICSID Convention);\n\nd. that said dispute is \"an investment dispute\" within the meaning of Art. VII of the BIT, namely \"arising out or relating to.(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment;\" and\n\ne. that such investment is of the type covered under the BIT in accordance with the definition of \"investment\" found in Art.I(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n**2. The proper methodology to resolve the jurisdictional challenge**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nBefore starting the above examination on the basis of the parties' documentation and arguments, but not necessarily in the same order as the parties have raised them, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to elucidate the type of analysis that it is called to make in order to ascertain its jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n60.\n\nIn order to determine its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must consider whether the dispute, as presented by the Claimant, is *prima facie,* that is at a summary examination, a dispute that falls generally within the jurisdiction of ICSID and specifically within that of an ICSID Tribunal established to decide a dispute between a U.S. investor and Argentina under the BIT. The requirements of a *prima facie* examination for this purpose have been elucidated by a series of international cases2. The object of the investigation is to ascertain whether the claim, as presented by the Claimant, meets the jurisdictional requirements, both as to the *factual subject matter* at issue, as to the *legal norms* referred to as applicable and having been allegedly breached, and as to the *relief* sought.3 For this purpose the presentation of the claim as set forth by the Claimant is decisive. The investigation must not be aimed at determining whether the claim is well founded, but whether the Tribunal is competent to pass upon it.\n\nA detailed examination of international cases can be found in the Decision on Jurisdiction by the ICSID Tribunal in *Impregilo v. Pakistan* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, of April 22, 2005, para. 237-253. Available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/impregilo-decision.pdf\n\nThis corresponds to the traditional Roman law description of the elements of a claim: *factum*, *causa petendi* and *petitum.*\n\n61.\n\nAs to the *facts of the case*, the presentation of the Claimant is fundamental: it must be assumed that the Claimant would be able to prove to the Tribunal satisfaction in the merit phase the facts that it invokes in support of its claim. This does not mean necessarily that the \"Claimant's description of the facts must be accepted as true,\" without further examination of any type. The Respondent might supply evidence showing that the case has no factual basis even at a preliminary scrutiny, so that the Tribunal would not be competent to address the subject matter of the dispute as properly determined. In such an instance the Tribunal would have to look to the contrary evidence supplied by the Respondent and should dismiss the case if it found such evidence convincing at a summary exam.\n\n62.\n\nIn the present dispute, however, there does not seem to be any basic disagreement between the parties as to the factual elements of the case, as far as this may be relevant to identify the ambit of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to the dispute. Argentina does not basically dispute that its measures, referred to by the Claimant (notably the *pesification* of assets denominated in U.S. dollars), have had generally the factual impact described by Continental on the investment portfolio held by CNA, the Argentine subsidiary of the latter. The Tribunal recognizes the arguments of Argentina that CNA had entered into certain contracts with other Argentine companies concerning the management of some of its assets, and that Argentine law is applicable both to those contracts and to CNA as a company incorporated in Argentina. The Tribunal considers however that these arguments pertain to the merit of the case and do not affect its jurisdiction.\n\n63.\n\nAs to the *legal foundation* of the case, in accordance with accepted judicial practice, the Tribunal must evaluate whether those facts, when established, could possibly give rise to the Treaty breaches that the Claimant alleges, and which the Tribunal is competent to pass upon4. In other words those facts, if proved to be true, must be \"capable\" of falling within the provision of the BIT and of having provoked the alleged breach5. It is of course a question for the merits whether the alleged facts constitute breaches of the BIT for which the Respondent must be held liable.\n\nSee ICJ, *Oil Platforms* case, ICJ Reports 1996, p. 806, para. 16; see also the separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, at para 32 of her separate Opinion; *SGS v Philippines (Jurisdiction)* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6, ICSID Reports, p. 518, para 157; also available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/SGSvPhil-final.pdf.\n\nICJ, *Legality of the Use of Force* (Yugoslavia v. Italy) ICJ Reports 1999-1, para. 25.\n\n64.\n\nAs to the *relief* sought, there is no challenge here as to the admissibility of the request for relief that the Claimant has sought against and from Argentina (notably a declaratory judgment concerning various BIT's violations and the adjudication of alleged damages stemming therefrom). With these considerations in mind the Tribunal will turn to examine the jurisdictional basis of the claim challenged by Argentina.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes immediately to dispose of the first requirement listed above, namely that concerning the parties. Argentina does not dispute that the Claimant, Continental Casualty Company, is a juridical person having the nationality of another Contracting State in conformity with Art. 25(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, Argentina does not dispute that the Claimant meets moreover the requirements of being a U.S. company under the BIT.\n\n**3. The requirement that the dispute be of a \"legal\" nature**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nBoth parties acknowledge that, pursuant to Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the dispute must have a \"legal\" character. Indeed judicial organs can by their very nature only pass upon disputes which involve the attribution between the parties of rights and obligations, stemming from binding norms and instruments. Such disputes must be resolved by the proper interpretation and application of those norms and other relevant rules to the facts of the case6. This is confirmed within the ICSID system by Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention that indicates the different \"rules of law\" in accordance to which the Tribunal \"shall decide\" a dispute.\n\nA possible exception is when the parties expressly confer to the Tribunal the power to decide \"ex aequo et bono.\"\n\n67.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant invokes specific legal acts and provisions as the foundation of its claim: it indicates that certain measures by Argentina have affected its legal rights stemming from contracts, legislation and the BIT. The Claimant further indicates specific provisions of the BIT granting various types of legal protection to its investments in Argentina, that in its view have been breached by those measures.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal considers as crucial for reaching its conclusions the reference by Continental to specific provisions of the BIT as the legal foundation of its claim. This is because the alleged violation of domestic laws and contracts by Argentina would not give rise *per se* to an international claim cognizable by the present ICSID Tribunal in the absence of an allegation that the BIT has been thereby breached by Argentina. It will be of course for the merits to determine whether such breaches have indeed taken place to the prejudice of the protection to which the Claimant, as a U.S. investor, is entitled under the treaty7.\n\nThe observations made in this paragraph are also relevant in order to conclude that the present dispute is \"an investment dispute\" within the meaning of Art.VII(c) of the BIT; cfr. above para.58(d).\n\n69.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these indications set forth in detail by the Claimant allow the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant has made legal claims against Argentina, so that the Tribunal is presented with a legal dispute within its jurisdiction. The Tribunal does not find support on the face of the claim for the contrary argument that the intervention of ICSID is being requested here for \"mere commercial or political disputes.\"8\n\nWe find therefore that this dispute fits the indications of the \"Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, para. 26:\" The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of a legal obligation.\"\n\n**4. The requirement that the dispute arises \"directly\" out of an investment.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nWe turn now to Argentina's objection that its measures are not \" specifically \" addressed against Continental's investments. Argentina bases this objection on the premise that by referring to \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment,\" Art.25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the measures impugned by the Claimant as being contrary to the BIT must be \"specifically\" addressed to an investment. In the present case, according to Argentina, at issue are general measures, taken by Argentina in case of emergency and affecting all the sectors of its economy. Argentina concludes that since \"The measures were not intended to have any specific effect on the claimant\" its claim is not amenable to the jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share the argument of Argentina nor its conclusions for the following reasons. First of all, the Tribunal does not consider that from a textual point of view the term \"specific\" can be considered as a synonym of \"directly.\" A measure of the host State can affect directly an investment, so that the dispute as to the international legality of that measure arises directly out of that investment, even if the measure is not specifically aimed at that investment.\n\n72.\n\nInternational practice indeed shows that many, if not most, disputes based on an alleged breach of international standards concerning the treatment of the property of aliens, settled either by means of diplomatic protection or of direct arbitration, have arisen from general measures taken by host States, that affected directly those investments, without necessarily being specifically aimed at them. Were this not the case, nationalization measures, either aimed at the property of both nationals and foreigners, or just at foreign property, which have been the subject matter of a substantial portion of those disputes, would have escaped any international litigation and dispute settlement mechanisms.\n\n73.\n\nThe requirement that the dispute arises directly from an investment is surely met when, as in the present case, the Claimant challenges some measures of the host State that affected directly the investment, in that they were applicable and were applied to such an investment. There is no doubt that the measures of Argentina described by the Claimant brought about, immediately and directly, an unfavorable change of the legal and economic regime applicable to the assets in Argentina that the Continental indicates represented its investment in that country, in breach - according to Continental - to Argentina's obligations under the BIT.\n\n74.\n\nIt is important to clarify that the subject matter of the dispute is not those general measures of Argentina *per se*, nor can the Tribunal pass judgment on whether they were right or wrong from an economic or domestic legal point of view. The Tribunal is called upon by the Claimant, pursuant to an objective exercise of its competence under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, to determine whether any specific measures, \"or measures of general economic policy having a bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\"9 \"What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\"10\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co v Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB 01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, December 8, 2003, para. 33. Available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/CMS\\_Decision\\_english.pdf\n\n*Ibid*, para. 27, referred to by Argentina in its memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n75.\n\nArgentina relies to the contrary on the decision on jurisdiction in the well known *Methanex* case, rendered under Art. 1101(1) of the NAFTA11. In that case the arbitral tribunal found that a measure enacted by the State of California that restricted the use of an additive of gasoline (MTBE) for environmental purposes, thus preventing Methanex to supply to the producers of that additive a component it manufactured in the U.S.A. (methanol), did not present a measure \"relating to\" a protected investor or to an investment as required by Art.1101(1). The Methanex tribunal held that the language of Art. 1101(1) required that \"there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the investor or the investment\"12. It concluded that since the measure did not relate to methanol or Methanex it had no jurisdiction on the claim: Methanex had not alleged facts \"establishing a legally significant connection between the U.S. measures, Methanex and its investments.\"13. Irrespective of the question whether the term \"relating to,\" used by the NAFTA, can be considered as equivalent to the term \"directly arising from\" found in the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal believes that the factual circumstances are here quite different. In the present case the assets that the Claimant indicates as representing its investments in Argentina were directly subject to, and legally and economically affected by the measures at issue. In the light of what has been said above this direct impact cannot be denied, to the effect that the jurisdictional requirement pertaining to \"directly\" is satisfied.\n\n*Methanex Corp. v. U.S.A.,* Decision on Jurisdiction, August 7, 2002, para. 127-139 (this decision on jurisdiction has since been applied in the Final Award of August 3, 2005).\n\n*Ibid, para. 139.*\n\n*Ibid, para. 150.*\n\n**5. The nature of the investment affected by Argentina's measure (*****ius standi*** **of the Claimant).**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Argentina considers that the Claimant, as a U.S. investor having acquired the shares of an Argentinean company (CNA ART), has no *locus standi* to challenge measures, as those at issue, that do not legally affect its position as shareholder of the said company. Argentina concludes that the Claimant has submitted an indirect claim as shareholder for damages suffered by the company that represents its investment. This would be, in Argentina's view, an inadmissible \"indirect\" claim.\n\n77.\n\nThe question whether under a BIT, such as the one at issue here, a controlling or even a minority foreign shareholder can bring a suit for the damages suffered by the local company, in which it hold shares, caused by expropriation or other measures affecting directly the economic rights of the shareholders, is a key legal issue in many disputes brought under BITs.\n\n78.\n\nThe starting point must be therefore the very BIT between Argentina and the U.S. According to Art. I(1)(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other party....and includes without limitation: (ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof.\" Not only are investments, as defined above, protected under the substantive obligations undertaken by the two Contracting Parties in the BIT for the benefit of their investors. The BIT includes also a definition of \"associated activities\" at Art. I(1)(e) which \"include the organization, control, operation, maintenance and disposition of companies.\" These associated activities are subject to the national and most-favored-nation treatments provided for in Art. II(1). Moreover, according to Art. II(2)(b) \"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, use, enjoyment, acquisition, or disposal of investments.\"\n\n79.\n\nThese provisions warrant an interpretation of the BIT according to which, in case of an acquisition by an investor of one Contracting Party of the entire capital of a company of the other Party, the treaty protection is not limited to the free enjoyment of the shares, that is the exercise of the rights inherent to the position as a shareholder, specifically a controlling or sole shareholder. It also extends to the standards of protection spelled out in the BIT with regard to the operation of the local company that represents the investment.\n\n80.\n\nThis interpretation is supported by the object and purpose of the BIT. As results from its very title, the BIT is a Treaty \"concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment.\" In the Preamble, the Parties recognize that \"agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investment (\"by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party\") will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties,\" and agree that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum use of economic resources.\" Disregard of the actual treatment of the company representing the investment, by removing it from the BIT coverage would therefore require a restrictive interpretation of the BIT's terms contrary to its object and purpose. Such an interpretation would moreover render most of its provisions ineffective and useless for investors, especially those that can be defined, as Continental in this case, as having made a \"direct investment\" in and through the local company that they have established or acquired.\n\n81.\n\nIt is widely recognized that \"Traditionally, home countries have relied on BITs as a mechanism to ensure protection for their investments in developing countries, while developing countries have entered into BITs as part of their strategies to attract foreign direct investment (FDI)\"14. An investment is considered direct when the investor's share of ownership is sufficient to allow control of the company, while an investment that provides the investor with a return, but not control over the company, generally is considered portfolio investment. Because an investor may be able to control a company with less than the majority of the stock, the degree of ownership required for investment to be regarded as direct may vary with the circumstances. In some instances, investment may be defined as direct if it is to be of lasting duration.\"15 Besides a contribution of capital resources, FDI entails usually a transfer of managerial skills, as well as of proprietary commercial and technical know-how. Although portfolio investments are not excluded from the coverage of a BIT such as the one at issue, the specific listing in it of various \"associated activities\", which typically pertain to FDI, indicates that in case of acquisition of a company established in the other country the scope of its application is not merely limited to the ownerships of the shares. The absence in the Argentina-U.S. BIT of a detailed asset-based definition of investment (as found in Art. 1139 of the NAFTA) does not limit therefore the broad coverage of the BIT.\n\nUNCTAD, *Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Mid-1990s,* United Nations 1998, at p.1. See also *ibid,* p.2: \" Bilateral investment treaties are one of the policy instruments available to provide legal protection to foreign investments under international law and thus to reduce as much as possible the non-commercial risks facing foreign investors in host countries.\"\n\nUNCTAD, IIA Series, *Scope and Definition,* United Nations 1999, p.8; reprinted in UNCTAD, *International Investment Agreements: Key Issues;* United Nations 2004, Ch.3, *Scope and Definitions,* p.115,.\n\n82.\n\nReliance on the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the *Barcelona Traction* case in 1970 to deny the possibility that action taken by the host country against the activities and assets of a local company fully owned or controlled by foreign investors may constitute a breach of the BIT would be therefore misplaced, since only the protection of foreign shareholders under customary international law was at issue in that dispute. Without entering into the specifics of that case, the ICJ itself recognized in its decision that the protection of shareholders required that recourse be had to treaty stipulations. The Court recalled that \"Indeed, whether in the form of multilateral or bilateral treaties between States, or that in agreements between States and companies, there has since the Second World War been considerable development in the protection of foreign investments.\"16 The impressive development of BIT has been a response to the uncertainty of customary international law relating to foreign investment.\n\nICJ Reports (1970) para. 88-89. In the subsequent *Elsi* case the Court upheld the applicability of Art.III.2 of the bilateral treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1948 between the US and Italy, granting to nationals and corporations of either party the right to \"organize, control and manage\" corporations controlled by them and created under the law of the other party, in a case where Italian authorities had requisitioned property of an Italian company owned by two US corporations, ICJ Reports (1989), para. 68 ff. The relevance of this decision for the interpretation of BITs has been highlighted by the late Dr. F.A. Mann in his comment *Foreign Investment in the International Court of Justice,* American J. Int. Law, 86, p. 92- 102.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal is comforted in its holding by the decisions of several ICSID arbitral tribunals in disputes involving Argentina as respondent under the same U.S.-Argentina BIT which constitutes the basis of jurisdiction in the present case. These tribunals have ruled that their jurisdiction extends to examining whether measures, taken by Argentina in connection with its economic crisis of 2001, and legally and economically affecting directly companies controlled, in whole or in part, by U.S. investors, constitute a breach of the protection afforded to the latter in the BIT.\n\n84.\n\nThus, the decisions on jurisdiction in the *Lanco* and *CMS* cases have held that the term investment in the Argentina-U.S. BIT is \"very broad and allows for many meanings\"17. In the *CMS* decision on jurisdiction the arbitral tribunal rejected the interpretation suggested by Argentina according to which in case of an investment in shares only claims against measures affecting the shares as such are allowed, not claims connected to damages suffered by the corporate entity. The arbitral tribunal concluded to the contrary that jurisdiction could be established under the terms of the specific provisions of the treaty \"since there is a direct right of shareholders\"18. Those tribunals found that it was immaterial for jurisdictional purposes to rely on the additional factual circumstances that those claimants were moreover a party to a concession or a license agreement.\n\n*Lanco International Inc. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6, Peliminary Decision on Jurisdiction, Dec. 8, 1998, at para. 10; *CMS v. Argentina cit.,* Decision on Jurisdiction cit. at para. 57, 59. Both companies held a minority shareholding in the relevant Argentine companies.\n\n*CMS Decision, ibid*. at para. 65, 68\n\n85.\n\nThe *ius standi* of U.S. corporate investors in Argentinean companies under the Argentina-U.S. BIT has been further affirmed in the *Azurix* decision on jurisdiction, since \"Azurix is the investor that made the investment through indirectly owned and controlled subsidiaries\"19. In the decision on jurisdiction in the *Enron* case, the arbitral tribunal based itself on a similar reasoning as to shareholder's rights under the BIT. It concluded that \"Whether the locally incorporated company may further claim for the violation of its rights under contracts, licenses, or other instruments, does not affect the direct right of action of foreign shareholders under the Bilateral Investment Treaty for protecting their interest in the qualifying investment.\"20\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No,.ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, Dec. 8, 2003, at para. 74, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/azurix-decision-en.pdf\n\n*Enron Corp. and Ponderosa Asset, L.P. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, Jan.14, 2004, at para. 49.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that it has jurisdiction to pass upon the present dispute, even assuming that the measures taken by Argentina and challenged by Continental as having breached its treaty rights were addressed and affected primarily or essentially the assets, investments, activities of the wholly owned subsidiary of Continental in Argentina.\n\n87.\n\nIn so deciding the Tribunal does not deny the relevance of the separate legal personality of the U.S. investor on the one hand, which is a U.S. corporation, and of its subsidiary in Argentina on the other hand, namely CNA ART, a company established and organized under the laws of Argentina, and which represents the investment of Continental. These two entities are clearly separate legal entities having different, though inter-connected rights relevant to the present dispute. CNA may have claims against the authorities of Argentina under local law, be they based on constitutional, civil or administrative legislation, for damages suffered as a consequence of actions taken by those authorities in breach of applicable legal provisions of such law. Continental, on the other hand, invokes here treaty rights concerning its investment in Argentina protected by the BIT. The claims of Continental cannot therefore be defined as indirect claims (or \"derivative\" claims), as if Continental was claiming on behalf or in lieu of CNA in respect of rights granted to the latter by the laws of Argentina. It is therefore irrelevant that such claims would be inadmissible under the laws of Argentina and that they would not be amenable in any case to the jurisdiction of an ICSID arbitral tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal recalls the important statement of the ICJ in the *Elsi* case: \"Compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be fully innocent of violation of a treaty provision.\"21\n\n*Elsi* case cit. at para.73. See also to the same effect Art.3 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, annexed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 Dec. 2001 \"Responsibility of States for Internationally wrongful acts.\"\n\n89.\n\nThis principle underlines another dimension of the distinction between the foreign investor and the local company in and through which the investment was made: not any and all action by the host State that causes a damage or prejudice to the assets of the local company automatically and necessarily represents an indemnifiable treaty breach. Generally speaking, this requires that:\n\na. the prejudice to those assets amount at the same time, quality or quantity wise, to an injury caused to the very investment of the foreign investor; and\n\nb. the action be in breach of a treaty obligation owed by the host State to the foreign investor under the BIT.\n\n90.\n\nAs to the latter requirement, the Claimant has several times indicated in its counter-memorial on jurisdiction that the measures taken by Argentina \"violated specific commitments in treaties, legislation and contracts.22 More specifically the Claimant has stated that \"In addition to the violation of provisions of the BIT, Argentina's measures violated specific contractual commitments regarding payment, maturity and security interests made by Argentina to CNA ART in GGLs and LETEs\". The Claimant also stated that Argentina's pesification and reprogramming commitments should \"be assessed against the specific commitments made by Argentina in the Intangibility Law.\"23. In view of the principle recalled in para. 88 above, it should be clear that it is the concurrent denunciation of an alleged breach of a legal commitment stemming from the BIT that brings these actions or measures within the purview of our jurisdiction, not the alleged breach of contractual or legislative provisions *per se.*\n\nClaimant's counter-memorial, p.5-6\n\n*Ibid.* para. 10 and 13.\n\n**6. Alleged lack of jurisdiction because the claim is premature or \"not ripe\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nSome of the arguments made by Argentina in its third objection dealing with the argument that the claim is premature relate to the relationship between the local company and its foreign shareholders. They have been dealt with above. The Tribunal is unable to follow Argentina as to the other arguments it makes to support its objection, both as to its content and as to its relevance for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n92.\n\nThe claim of Continental cannot be considered to be without content because the measures challenged as being in breach of the BIT have not yet been enacted (so that they would be non-existent) or have not yet been applied. This is clearly not the case here. Nor does the possible uncertainty as to the final amount of the damages represent a bar to jurisdiction, especially since the Claimant has petitioned i.a. for a declaratory judgment.\n\n93.\n\nNor does the existence of ongoing negotiations with local companies or the foreign shareholders (which are however disputed by the Claimant) represent a bar to the introduction or furtherance of an international claim such as the one at issue. Negotiations in view of a settlement are often carried on by the parties to a dispute, domestically and internationally, between private parties, between governments and between governments and foreign investors, while the dispute is pending before a court of law or an international or arbitral tribunal. This situation does not undermine the jurisdiction of those judicial or arbitral bodies, except if the parties jointly decide to suspend proceedings or to intervene otherwise on the course of the pending dispute. Since this is clearly not the situation given here, the Tribunal has no other choice than to reject this objection as being without foundation.\n\n**7. Other jurisdictional objections**\n--------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nAs mentioned before, Argentina has raised an argument based on the Most-Favored-Nation clause in the context of its memorial on jurisdiction. Specifically Argentina has criticized the *Maffezini* decision on jurisdiction whereby a jurisdictional requirement provided for in the Argentina-Spain BIT was superseded by a different provision in another BIT incorporated by virtue of the MFN clause of the Argentina-Spain BIT.24 Since however the Argentina-U.S. BIT contains no such requirement, nor has any such argument been made here by the Claimant, the Tribunal finds those arguments of no relevance to resolve the jurisdictional objections raised by Argentina. The Claimant has relied on the MFN clause in its written submissions on the MFN clause, but for a different purpose, namely in respect to the substantive obligations concerning the treatment of its investments. This is an issue for the merits with no relevance at the present jurisdictional phase.\n\n*Emilio Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, Jan. 25, 2000. Available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/emilio\\_DecisiononJurisdiction.pdf\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\nFor the reasons stated above the Tribunal concludes that all jurisdictional requirements laid down in the ICSID Convention and in the BIT are met in the present dispute. The Tribunal rejects accordingly Argentina's objections to jurisdiction and decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal.

The Request concerned Continental's investment in CNA Aseguradora de Riesgos del Trabajo S.A. (\"CNA ART\" or \"CNA\"), an insurance company incorporated in Argentina, which Continental claims to wholly own, and Argentina's alleged breaches of Continental's rights as investor under the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (the \"Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty\" or the \"BIT\").1\n\nSigned on November 14, 1991, entered into force since October 20, 1994.\n\n2.\n\nIn its request, Continental invoked Argentina's advance consent to arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\") in the Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated January 28, 2003, Continental supplemented its request, attaching a copy of a letter dated January 15, 2003 with its consent to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in the BIT, and a power of attorney authorizing the law firm of Appleton & Associates to represent it in these proceedings.\n\n4.\n\nOn January 29, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of March 14, 2003, the Centre requested Continental to provide: (i) further information regarding the steps taken to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, as foreseen in Article VII(2) of the BIT; and (ii) confirmation that the dispute had not been submitted to the local courts of Argentina or any previously agreed dispute settlement procedures, in accordance with Article VII(3)(a) of the BIT. Continental responded by letter of March 17, 2003.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of May 2, 2003, the Centre further asked Continental to clarify whether the condition set forth in the BIT that six months should elapse between the date in which the dispute arose and the submission of the request for arbitration had been fulfilled. Claimant responded by letter of May 5, 2003.\n\n7.\n\nOn May 22, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nMore than sixty days elapsed since the date of registration without the parties being able to agree on the number of arbitrators that would comprise the tribunal in this case or on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on July 22, 2003, the Claimant requested that the tribunal be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (i.e., a Tribunal comprising three arbitrators, one appointed by each party, and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the parties).\n\n9.\n\nOn August 20, 2003 the Argentine Republic appointed Licenciado Michell Nader, a Mexican national, as an arbitrator. On August 22, 2003, the Claimant appointed Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, a national of the United Kingdom, as an arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nAlso on August 22, 2003, more than ninety days having elapsed since the date of registration, Continental, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, requested that the Chairman of ICSID Administrative Council appoint the president of the tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nWith the agreement of both parties, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Tribunal appointed Professor Giorgio Sacerdoti, an Italian national, as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On October 6, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date.\n\n12.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the agreement of the parties, on January 29, 2004, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n13.\n\nDuring the first session the parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Among others, it was agreed that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 22, the languages of the proceedings would be English and Spanish. The Claimant would file its pleadings in English and Argentina would file its pleadings in Spanish, with a subsequent courtesy translation into English. Also, the Tribunal, after consultation with the parties fixed the following schedule for the written phase of the proceedings: the Claimant would file a memorial on the merits within ninety (90) days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial on the merits within ninety (90) days from its receipt of the Claimant's memorial; the Claimant would file a reply within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the counter-memorial; and the Respondent would file a rejoinder within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the Claimant's reply.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the first session it was noted that were Argentina to raise objections to jurisdiction, it may do so within the ninety (90) days time limit fixed for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits. In that case, the proceedings on the merits would be suspended in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3) and the Claimant would file its counter-memorial on jurisdiction within forty-five (45) days from its receipt of the Argentine Republic's objections to jurisdiction. The Tribunal would thereafter, in consultation with the parties, fix a date for a hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nOn April 27, 2004, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation. The Claimant expanded therein the content of its Request for Arbitration, dealing with the \"Facts of the Claims\" and the \"Legal Argument.\"\n\n16.\n\nAs indicated by the Claimant in its briefs, Continental is a company incorporated in Illinois, in the U.S., and is a subsidiary of CNA Financial Inc. (CNA), \"a leading financial services provider which has its head offices in Chicago.\" Continental owns and controls CNA ART, which \"is one of Argentina's leading providers of workers compensation insurance services.\" CNA ART was incorporated in Argentina in 1996 under the name of \"OMEGA Aseguradora de Riesgos del Trabajo Sociedad An\u00f3mima.\" In June of 1997, Continental acquired a 70% interest in this company and increased its participation to practically 100% (precisely 99.9995%) in December 2000. Thereupon, Omega changed its name into CNA ART.\n\n17.\n\nCNA ART, like other insurance companies, maintains a portfolio of investment securities in order to earn a return on its capital, consisting mainly of \"low-risk assets such as cash deposit, treasury bills and government bonds.\" Under Argentinean regulations of CNA's insurance operation, \"such capital must be invested within Argentina, with minor exceptions.\"\n\n18.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, prior to March 2001, the CNA investment portfolio was primarily in assets denominated in Argentine pesos, which were at the time fully convertible to U.S. dollars at a one to one exchange rate. In order to hedge the risk of devaluation, CNA's management decided to invest assets within Argentina in low risk U.S. denominated assets. As a result of various investment operations, CNA held thereafter a portfolio of cash accounts, certificates of deposit, T-bills, Government bonds and Government loans (GGLs) for a U.S. value of $100,998,000.\n\n19.\n\nContinental indicates that \"[c]ommencing in December 2001, Argentina enacted a series of decrees and resolutions that destroyed the legal security of the assets held by CNA ART. These measures frustrated CNA ART's ability to hedge against the risk of the devaluation of the peso.\" Claimant refers to \"Argentina's restrictions on transfers out of its territory;\" to \"rescheduling of cash deposits;\" to \"pesification of U.S. dollar deposits;\" to \"pesification and default on its debt obligations,\" as well as to other measures. Continental indicates that due to these measures (collectively referred to as \"Argentina's Capital Control Regime\"), as an investor in Argentina, it has suffered an absolute loss in value of its assets of U.S. $46,412,000; in addition it is or was unable due to the \"Bank Freeze\" to access its investments in Argentina.\n\n20.\n\nFrom a legal point of view, Continental asserts that it is protected under the BIT as \"a U.S. investor with an investment in Argentina,\" its protected investment being namely CNA ART. Continental claims that by the conduct and acts summarily referred to above, Argentina has failed to meet its existing bilateral investment treaty obligations owed to it as a U.S. investor in Argentina. Continental claims that Argentina has violated, at least, the following provisions of the BIT:\n\n(i) the requirement to observe obligations required by Art. II(2)(c) of the BIT;\n\n(ii) the requirement to provide treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection or security, as required by Art. II(2)(b) of the BIT, as well as MFN treatment under Art. II(2)(a);\n\n(iii) the requirement to permit all transfers relating to an investment without delay, set out in Art. V of the BIT; and\n\n(iv) the requirement to pay compensation upon acts of expropriation, set out in Art. IV of the BIT.\n\n21.\n\nIn view of the facts and arguments set out in its Memorial, the Claimant submitted that \"owing to these violations of the BIT, individually and in combination, the Investor is entitled to compensation in an amount equal to the full amount of the damages suffered as a consequence.\"2\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 22-27.\n\n22.\n\nBased on an \"Independent Valuators Report\" it submitted to the Tribunal, Continental assessed its losses as follows: i) for the violation of contracts obligation, not less than U.S.$31 million; ii) for the violation of expropriation obligations, not less than U.S.$38 million.3\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits, paras. 250-254.\n\n**II. The Jurisdictional Phase**\n--------------------------------\n\n*A. Generally*\n--------------\n\n23.\n\nOn June 29, 2004, Argentina filed a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction. Thereupon, by a letter of July 12, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3). Consequently, the proceedings continued on the issue of jurisdiction in accordance with the agreed procedural calendar.\n\n*B. Argentina's specific objections to jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nArgentina's specific objections to jurisdiction were the following:\n\n(i) \"Argentina has not given its consent to submit to this arbitration;\"\n\n(ii) \"The dispute submitted by Claimant does not comply with the requirements of the Convention or those under the U.S.-Argentina BIT,\" particularly as to (a) the existence of a legal dispute and as to (b) the requirement that the legal dispute arises directly out of an investment;\n\n(iii) \"The company may not file a claim because the claim is premature \u2018or not ripe';\"\n\n(iv) \"Continental's lack of action to submit a dispute to this Tribunal: the *ius standi.*\n\n25.\n\nUnder its first objection, Argentina took the position that it had not given its consent to ICSID arbitration with regard to the present dispute. Accordingly, it \"insist[ed] on the need to examine the extent of the consent by the Argentine State to submit to the ICSID system\" by examining, according to the principles of interpretation of treaties under international law, the relevant clauses of both the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-U.S. BIT.\n\n26.\n\nWithin its second objection, Argentina pointed out that it gave its consent under the BIT \"only for those cases that - complying with requirements of the Washington Convention - are encompassed within the Treaty's scope of application.\" Argentina referred to three basic and essential requirements that restrict the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal pursuant to Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\na. the existence of a legal dispute;\n\nb. directly arising out of an investment;\n\nc. between a Contracting State and a National of another Contracting State.\n\n27.\n\nAs to requirement (a), Argentina submitted, based among other things on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, that the dispute must be about \"rights and obligations,\" about legal titles and not some \"undesirable consequences\" that have not as the proximate cause the host State's conduct in respect of its investment. In Argentina's view in this case the Claimant was not submitting a legal claim within those requirements because it \"is not the holder of the legal rights that it alleged have been breached by the Argentine Republic.\"\n\n28.\n\nAs to requirement (b), Argentina submitted that the legal dispute must arise directly out of the investment in that \"the measure or measures alleged as in violation of the U.S.-Argentina BIT must be ***specifically*** addressed to the investments.\" Argentina considered that the word \"directly\" in Art. 25(1) \"may also be translated as specifically.... The measure must be addressed to the investment. Universal measures addressed to the general public cannot be considered by ICSID Tribunals. That would be to judge a public policy and not a legal conflict.\"\n\n29.\n\nArgentina considered accordingly that in order for jurisdiction to be established \"Continental must show which specific obligations, *vis-a-vis* the Claimant were breached by Argentina through its devaluation of the Peso, the establishment of a new exchange rate and the temporary pesification of the tariffs.\"\n\n30.\n\nIn Argentina's view, the only position that the Claimant was able to assert is its position as shareholder of CNA. According to Argentina, however, this position does not enable Continental to claim in the circumstances impairment to its \"legal rights born out of the ownership of shares\" due to Argentina's measures. Argentina submitted further that also the damages suffered by the investor must be direct, that is grounded on an action that \"specifically impairs a legal right born out of the ownership of the shares.\" This requirement that those damages result from an interference with a right and not with a mere interest of the shareholders, be they minority or majority shareholders, was not met either in the present case, according to Argentina.4\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 35-40.\n\n31.\n\nUnder its third objection to jurisdiction, Argentina considered that Continental's claim is not ripe - in legal terms and not just from a policy point of view - because the alleged damages constantly fluctuate since Argentina's negotiations with foreign creditors are not yet over; therefore, a claim based on indirect consequences that may have affected foreign shareholders of an Argentine corporation cannot be submitted before an arbitral tribunal under the BIT. Moreover, according to Argentina, this would be contrary to a proper interpretation of the BIT: \"[s]hould it be admitted that this is applicable to the contractual relations governed by local law and submitted to the jurisdiction of the local courts, the scope of application of the BIT would be unlawfully extended.\"5\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 49.\n\n32.\n\nFinally, Argentina maintained that the dispute did not fall within the scope of the application of the BIT for different reasons, all related to the definition of \"investment\" suggested by Argentina as being the correct one under the Treaty. It is Argentina's view that the Claimant \"has presented a claim founded on the loss in value of its investment represented by the acquisition of shares in an Argentinean corporation - CNA ART,\" and that the foreign investor has alleged \"that its interests have been impaired by commercial and financial decisions taken in the framework of a shares investment business made within Argentina.\" Argentina submits further that the purchase of shares in that Argentine corporation is a business subject to Argentina's law, which is also the law applicable to the interest in those shares and more generally to the existing legal relationship between the Claimant and CNA. In view of the above, Argentina concludes that \"the claimant has not proved that the Argentine State has issued any measure addressed directly to that acquisition of shares.\"\n\n33.\n\nArgentina further indicated that since the investment of the Claimant consisted in shares of an Argentine company, while the measures affected the Argentinean corporation of which the Claimant is a shareholder, the lack of the required relationship between the dispute brought and the investment in accordance with the BIT resulted in a lack of jurisdiction on the \"indirect claim,\" which is the subject matter of this dispute. This is because the situation here is that of a shareholder making a claim in connection to assets or circumstances related to the entity where it has interests, in disregard therefore of the acknowledged principle that the partners and the corporation are different legal persons. Argentina concluded that while the definitions of investment in the BIT are broad, CNA - whose interests have been affected - \"does not qualify either as an investor or as an investment pursuant to the mentioned international instrument.\"6\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 51-52.\n\n*C. The Claimant's counter-arguments*\n-------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn conformity with the procedural time table, the Claimant submitted its Countermemorial on jurisdiction on July 30, 2004. Continental requested the Tribunal to reject the objections of Argentina and to affirm the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Claimant argued generally in the first place that the \"Proper Approach to a Jurisdictional Challenge\" requires that the Tribunal determine whether the pleadings have disclosed a *prima facie* claim.\n\n35.\n\nSpecifically, in respect of the first and second jurisdictional objections of Argentina, the Claimant maintained that the dispute is a \"legal dispute\" because it arises from a conflict of rights rather than a conflict of interests. More specifically, according to the Claimant, the dispute at issue \"concerns the different views of the Claimant and Argentina on questions of legal rights and obligations in connection with the existence of an investment, and the effects this may have on Argentina's obligations to honor debt instruments, to preserve the Claimant's property rights in the cash deposits and its right under the BIT to transfer capital.\"\n\n36.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimant, the requirement that a dispute must arise \"directly\" from an investment does not imply that the measure challenged must be \"specifically\" addressed at the business concerned. The Claimant submitted that for jurisdictional purposes, it is enough that the impugned measures *prima facie* adversely affect the Claimant's investment, so that the Tribunal is competent to examine whether those measures are in breach of specific commitments given to the investor.7\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 45-46.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant also opposed Argentina's third objection to jurisdiction that the claim was not ripe. The Claimant recalled that in a previous decision an ICSID Tribunal had stated that the perspective of negotiations between Argentine authorities and a company owned by foreign investors and/or those investors were immaterial in order to determine the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal. The Claimant took the position that the principles relied on by Argentina in support of this objection do not affect the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal, which depends on the claim satisfying the requirements of Art.25 of the ICSID Convention and of the BIT.8\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 50.\n\n38.\n\nAs far as the fourth objection to jurisdiction is concerned, the Claimant considered that it is \"now well settled that an investor may bring an investor-state claim under the BIT for measures interfering with the legal rights of its Argentine subsidiary and not just for measures affecting the investor's shares in the subsidiary.\" The Claimant concludes on this point that \"the ability of shareholders to claim for damages suffered by the company in which they hold shares,\" in any case when the protected investor is a controlling shareholder (as here), is well settled in jurisprudence and cannot be open to challenges at the jurisdictional stage.9\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 53-54.\n\n39.\n\nOn August 6, 2004, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht resigned as an arbitrator in this case due to health conditions. Following Professor Sacerdoti's and Licenciado Nader's consent to Sir Elihu's resignation and in accordance with Arbitration Rule 10, the proceedings were suspended until the vacancy created by Sir Elihu's resignation was filled. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1), the Secretary of the Tribunal invited Continental to appoint a new arbitrator in replacement of Sir Elihu. By letter of September 14, 2004, the Claimant appointed Mr. V.V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom as an arbitrator. The proceedings were resumed in October 14, 2004, following Mr. Veeder's acceptance of his appointment.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of December 16, 2004, the Tribunal proposed to the parties dates for holding the hearing on jurisdiction. The hearing was held, with the agreement of the parties, on February 1, 2005 at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. Messrs. Barry Appleton, Robert Wisner, Hernando Otero, Nick Gallus, Ali Ghiassi and Ms. Asha Kaushal from the law firm of Appleton & Associates, International Lawyers of Toronto Canada, and Ms. Sally Narey, General Counsel, Continental, attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimant. Ms. Cintia Yaryura and Ms. Maria Victoria Vitali from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, Mr. Marcelo Massoni, from the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C. and Mr. Roberto Bado from the Ministry of Economy of the Argentine Republic, attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing, Messrs. Appleton and Wisner addressed the Tribunal on behalf of Continental. Ms. Yaryura and Vitali addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n41.\n\nSubsequent to the hearing, the Tribunal received a communication from the Claimant pointing to recent ICSID decisions on jurisdiction issued in cases involving Argentina, and an answer from Argentina raising objections as to the relevance of those decisions. The Tribunal informed the parties, through the Secretariat, on July 20, 2005 that \"it believes it is empowered to take judicial notice of such published decisions. However, in accordance with due process principles, the Tribunal is of the opinion that should it consider necessary for its decision on jurisdiction to specifically rely on points raised and discussed in those decisions, it should give an opportunity first to the parties to comment on those possibly relevant points. The Tribunal would accordingly do so should the situation envisaged occur.\"\n\n42.\n\nOn February 22, 2006, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction,10 rejecting the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and holding that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\nAvailable at: http://www.investmentclaims.com.\n\n43.\n\nIn view of the objections raised by Argentina, the Tribunal considered that it had to ascertain, for the sole purpose of determining its competence under the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-U.S. BIT, whether the criteria that define disputes for the purpose of the ICSID jurisdiction under those two instruments had been met. These criteria are:\n\na. that the dispute is between Argentina (as a contracting party to ICSID and the BIT) and a national of the U.S.A., as defined in the BIT;\n\nb. that the dispute is a \"legal\" dispute (Art. 25(1) ICSID Convention);\n\nc. that said legal dispute arises \"directly\" out of an investment (Art. 25(1) ICSID Convention);\n\nd. that said dispute is \"an investment dispute\" within the meaning of Art. VII of the BIT, namely \"arising out or relating to....(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment;\" and\n\ne. that such investment is of the type covered under the BIT in accordance with the definition of \"investment\" found in Art.I(1)(a) of the BIT.11\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 58.\n\n44.\n\nBefore starting its examination on the basis of the parties' documentation and arguments, the Tribunal found it appropriate to outline the proper methodology to resolve the jurisdictional challenge. The Tribunal asserted that \"[i]n order to determine its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must consider whether the dispute, as presented by the Claimant, is *prima facie*, that is, at a summary examination, a dispute that falls generally within the jurisdiction of ICSID and specifically within that of an ICSID Tribunal established to decide a dispute between a U.S. investor and Argentina under the BIT. [...] The object of the investigation is to ascertain whether the claim, as presented by the Claimant, meets the jurisdictional requirements, both as to the factual subject matter at issue, as to the legal norms referred to as applicable and having been allegedly breached, and as to the relief sought.12 For this purpose, the presentation of the claim as set forth by the Claimant is decisive. The investigation must not be aimed at determining whether the claim is well founded, but whether the Tribunal is competent to pass upon it.\"\n\nThis corresponds to the traditional Roman law description of the elements of a claim: factum, *causa petendi* and *petitum*.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal continued:\n\nAs to the *facts of the case*, the presentation of the Claimant is fundamental: it must be assumed that the Claimant would be able to prove to the Tribunal's satisfaction in the merit phase the facts that it invokes in support of its claim. This does not mean necessarily that the \"Claimant's description of the facts must be accepted as true,\" without further examination of any type. The Respondent might supply evidence showing that the case has no factual basis even at a preliminary scrutiny, so that the Tribunal would not be competent to address the subject matter of the dispute as properly determined. In such an instance, the Tribunal would have to look to the contrary evidence supplied by the Respondent and should dismiss the case if it found such evidence convincing at a summary exam.13 (Footnotes omitted)\n\nDecision on jurisdiction, paras. 61-64.\n\n46.\n\nTurning to the first requirement defining disputes for the purpose of ICSID jurisdiction, namely that concerning the disputing parties, the Tribunal acknowledged that Argentina was not disputing that the Claimant, Continental Casualty Company, was a juridical person having the nationality of another Contracting State in conformity with Art. 25(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, Argentina was not disputing that the Claimant met moreover the requirements of being a U.S. company under the BIT.14\n\nDecision on jurisdiction, para. 65\n\n47.\n\nWith respect to the requirement that the dispute be of a \"legal\" nature, the Tribunal considered decisively the fact that the Claimant invoked specific legal acts and provisions as the foundation of its claim. In fact, the Claimant indicated that certain measures taken by Argentina have affected its legal rights stemming from contracts, legislation and the BIT. The Claimant further indicated specific provisions of the BIT granting various types of legal protection to its investments in Argentina, that in its view have been breached by those measures. The Tribunal then \"concluded that the Claimant had made legal claims against Argentina, so that the Tribunal was presented with a legal dispute within its jurisdiction.\"15\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 66-69.\n\n48.\n\nWith respect to the requirement that the dispute arises \"directly\" out of an investment, the Tribunal dismissed the objection of the Respondent according to which the measures impugned by the Claimant were general measures taken by Argentina in case of emergency and affecting all the sectors of its economy and not \"specifically\" addressed against Continental's investments. The Tribunal, on the contrary, considered satisfied the jurisdictional requirement at issue since, in the first place, from a textual point of view the term \"specific\" cannot be considered as a synonym of \"directly.\" A measure of the host State can affect directly an investment, so that the dispute as to the international legality of that measure arises directly out of that investment, even if the measure is not specifically aimed at that investment. The Tribunal then considered that \"[t]he requirement that the dispute arises directly from an investment is surely met when, as in the present case, the Claimant challenges some measures of the host State that affected directly the investment, in that they were applicable and were applied to such an investment. There is no doubt that the measures of Argentina described by the Claimant brought about, immediately and directly, an unfavorable change of the legal and economic regime applicable to the assets in Argentina that Continental indicates represented its investment in that country, in breach - according to Continental - to Argentina's obligations under the BIT.\"16\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 70-73.\n\n49.\n\nWith respect to the requirement concerning the definition of the investment under the BIT (i.e. the *ius standi* of the Claimant), the Tribunal dismissed the objection of the Respondent according to which the Claimant had submitted an \"indirect\" claim as shareholder, for damages suffered by the company that represents its investment. The Tribunal acknowledged that \"[t]he question whether under a BIT, such as the one at issue here, a controlling or even a minority foreign shareholder can bring a suit for the damages suffered by the local company, in which it hold shares, caused by expropriation or other measures affecting directly the economic rights of the shareholders, is a key legal issue in many disputes brought under BITs.\" It then proceeded by interpreting the BIT provision containing the definition of the investments covered by the Treaty and came to the conclusion that \"the treaty protection is not limited to the free enjoyment of the shares, [...] It also extends to the standards of protection spelled out in the BIT with regard to the operation of the local company that represents the investment.\" Moreover, \"the specific listing\" in the BIT provision at issue \"of various \u2018associated activities', which typically pertain to FDI, indicates that in case of acquisition of a company established in the other country the scope of its application is not merely limited to the ownerships of the shares.\"\n\n*D. The Tribunal's conclusion on the objections to jurisdiction*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the Claimant, as a corporate investor in an Argentinean company, enjoyed *ius standi* under the BIT, \"even assuming that the measures taken by Argentina and challenged by Continental as having breached its treaty rights were addressed and affected primarily or essentially the assets, investments, activities of the wholly owned subsidiary of Continental in Argentina.\" In view of certain statements by the Claimant that the measures taken by Argentina \"violated specific commitments in treaties, legislation and contracts\" such as those \"made by Argentina to CNA ART in GGLs and LETEs,\" the Tribunal recalled that \"it is the concurrent denunciation of an alleged breach of a legal commitment stemming from the BIT that brings these actions or measures within the purview of our jurisdiction, not the alleged breach of contractual or legislative provisions *per se*.\"17\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 76-86 and 90.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, with respect to the alleged lack of jurisdiction because the claim was premature or \"not ripe,\" the Tribunal rejected this objection as being without foundation for the following reasons: first of all, \"[t]he claim of Continental cannot be considered to be without content because the measures challenged as being in breach of the BIT have not yet been enacted (so that they would be non-existent) or have not yet been applied. This is clearly not the case here.\" Then, \"the possible uncertainty as to the final amount of the damages cannot represent a bar to jurisdiction, especially since the Claimant has petitioned for a declaratory judgment.\" Finally, the existence of ongoing negotiations with local companies or the foreign shareholders (which are however disputed by the Claimant) cannot represent a bar to the introduction or furtherance of an international claim such as the one at issue.\"18\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 91-93.\n\n**III. The Procedure Leading to the Award on the Merits**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOnce the jurisdiction of the Tribunal had been affirmed, proceedings resumed on the merits in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, issued on the same day as the Decision on Jurisdiction. Since the Claimant had already filed its Memorial on the merits (on April 27, 2004), the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits on May 8, 2006.\n\n*A. Argentina's arguments*\n--------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the Merits of May 8, 2006, Argentina starts with the factual examination of the economic context in which the measures complained of by the Claimant were taken. In Argentina's view, the State \"faced a terminal situation and had to forcibly change the economic plan of the country as a result of the devaluation of the local currency.\"19 \"The crisis became an emergency situation when it turned into an institutional, social and economic collapse of unprecedented seriousness and depth in the country's history.\"20 \"The financial system was on the verge of collapse. The Central Bank reserves had dropped significantly and, even if by the end of December 2001 the exchange rate in effect was formally still 1 peso = dollar 1, before the Emergency Law was passed, in practice the peso had already been devaluated.\"21 \"The sovereign debt service difficulties faced by the Government were also evident, and by the end of December 2001 the Argentine Republic had no choice but to suspend payment of its sovereign debt obligations with private holders.\"22 \"The social situation was dreadful and the unemployment rate was above twenty per cent (20%) of the active population.\"23 Argentina maintains that \"[t]he Emergency Law,\" passed on January 6, 2002, \"is not the cause of the economic emergency but a regulatory consequence intended to cure through realistic measures the existing state of necessity;\"24 [...] \"The Emergency Law only provided the institutional framework for a situation already existing in practice: the 1 to 1 peso-dollar convertibility had disappeared.\"25 Argentina then describes in turn the economic, the social, the political and the institutional aspects of what it defines as a \"collapse\" of the State.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 21. (hereinafter, Counter-Memorial).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 23.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 24.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 25.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 26.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 30.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 33.\n\n54.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the merits, Argentina opposes the claims advanced by Continental. First of all, it maintains that it allowed, at all times, transfers in connection with investments in accordance with Article V of the BIT. In this respect, Argentina observed that \"[d]uring a short period of time, BCRA authorization was required for that purpose, but neither CONTINENTAL nor CNA ART ever asked for such authorization.\" Moreover, according to the Respondent, \"the actions brought into question by CONTINENTAL, which did not prevent them from transferring funds anyway, are expressly authorized by article XI of the BIT, which entitles a signatory State to take \u2018measures necessary for the maintenance of public order. or the protection of its own essential security interests'.\"26\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 161.\n\n55.\n\nSecondly, as far as the alleged violation of Article IV of the BIT concerning expropriation is concerned, Argentina considers the claim inadmissible since the measures complained of did not affect Continental's investment value. Argentina maintains that \"[t]he existence of an expropriation regarding such investment is impossible, as long as, after the adoption of measures that CONTINENTAL qualifies as expropriation and in spite of the fact that the Argentine Republic underwent the most serious economic crisis in its history, such investment is nowadays worth three times its value before the crisis, in U.S. dollars.\"27 In fact, \"CONTINENTAL does not base its claim upon a reduction in its investment value, the shareholding in CNA, but on alleged reductions in the value of CNA investments and on measures that could have affected such investments.\"28 Additionally, in Argentina's view, the Claimant \"confusedly invokes a *de facto* expropriation of certain contractual rights pertaining to CNA [...] Continental cannot make claims for alleged damages to CNA investments but only for damages to its investment, i.e. shareholding in CNA.\"29 According to Argentina, this claim should be dismissed since, firstly, \"neither CNA nor CONTINENTAL have ever claimed before Argentine courts a redress of their allegedly affected contractual rights;\"30 secondly, such rights or investments were not substantially affected in spite of the terminal crisis in the Argentine Republic, but \"had a financial performance, on average, higher than the one they would have obtained provided they had been invested at a free from risk rate.\" Finally, Argentina describes the evolution of CNA Art throughout the crisis31 and concludes as follows:\n\n1. - In the hard road towards restoring the country's economic and financial situation to normal, different options were available to the holders of deposits made with financial institutions.\n\n2. - The holders of deposits had to state whether they wanted to choose any of the options offered by the Argentine Government, which varied according to the progress of the recovery of the country's economic, financial and social situation.\n\n3. - That being so, three options were available to CNA ART in order to get back its deposited amounts, and it decided to go for the third of them.\n\n4. - Through the option chosen by CNA ART, it had access to the release of its rescheduled deposits receiving also \"BODEN 2013\" bonds for the difference between the original face value of the Rescheduled Deposit adjusted by CER as of April 1, 2003 and the value of the dollar in the exchange market as of the same date.\n\n5. - CNA ART was able to recoup its deposited amounts thanks to the options offered by the Argentine State, as it prevented the financial system from falling apart [...]\n\n6.- Notwithstanding the option exercised by CNA ART, it should be noted that financial institutions could offer enhancements on the conditions established for the return of rescheduled deposits, such as bringing forward the schedule of payments, prepayments or acknowledgement of higher interest rates. If the banks with which CNA ART made the deposits offered no enhancement, this is attributable only to those banks and ultimately to CNA ART, which is responsible for choosing the financial institutions with which the deposits were made.32\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 271.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 280.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 301.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 302.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 321 ff.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para.369.\n\n56.\n\nThirdly, Argentina opposes the claim concerning the alleged violation of article II(2)(b) of the BIT according to which a foreign investment has to be accorded treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. Argentina submits that \"investments made by CONTINENTAL, as it happens with the remaining foreign investments, have been considered in accordance with international law.\"33 According to Argentina, \"the fair and equitable treatment standard (as well as the remaining treatment standards), in connection to which CONTINENTAL invokes its violation, must be compulsorily applied considering especially the circumstances under which such measures were adopted.\"34 \"Nobody can deny that the Argentine Republic experienced (and it still does) a \u2018dramatic economic situation'.\" No one can deny that when adopting the measures nowadays CONTINENTAL questions, the Argentine authorities had in mind the interests of almost 40 million inhabitants of the Argentine Republic, obviously including the interests of investors. Within such a context, the allegation made by CONTINENTAL should be considered inadmissible as regards the violation of the standards of treatment.\"35 Argentina furnishes in any case its evaluation of the standards of treatment provided for by Art. II of the BIT and comes to the conclusion \"that investments made by CONTINENTAL, as it happens with the remaining foreign investments, have been considered in accordance with international law.\"36 Argentina therefore concludes that:\n\na) At all times CONTINENTAL's investment was granted fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law.\n\nb) The fair and equitable treatment is the minimum international treatment, understanding that the latter is a standard which means reasonability, proportionality and no discrimination.\n\nc) The measures alleged to be infringing are proportional to the situation in which they were passed, and they are reasonable. The reasonability of such measures was based on the re-establishment of a balance among all the economic agents of society. The measures were not inconsistent because not only did they take into account the whole society, but also they re-adapted the circumstances to the prevailing economic situation.37\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 492.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 494.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 499.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 501 ff.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 625.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, Argentina opposes the alleged violation of Article II(2)(c) of the BIT regarding the requirement to observe \"obligations entered into with regard to investments.\" In this respect, Argentina maintains not to have violated any commitment towards the Claimant. The Respondent gives its assessment of \"umbrella clauses\" under international law, especially in light of arbitral practice and then proposes its interpretation of the umbrella clause of the BIT between Argentina and the U.S. According to Argentina, the umbrella clause of the BIT \"is intended to protect the commitments assumed by the Argentine Republic towards foreign investors protected by the BIT, not contractual obligations.\" Thus, according to Argentina, it would not apply to the dispute at issue since \"it does not apply to contracts entered into between CNA ART and the Argentine Republic.\"38\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 689 ff.\n\n58.\n\nIn case the Tribunal should conclude for a violation of the articles of the BIT invoked by the Claimant, Argentina invokes Art. XI of the BIT in order to justify the measures it adopted to face the severe crisis, which affected the country.39 In this context, Argentina also invokes Art. IV(3) of the BIT, which regards the protection of foreign investors suffering losses \"owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events.\" This provision requires the contracting parties to apply a non-discriminatory treatment (according either to the Most Favored Nation or to the National Treatment principles) to the foreign investor \"as regards any measures [they] adopt in relation to such losses.\"40 As to Art. XI of the BIT, first of all Argentina claims that a \"bona fide invocation of Article XI of the BIT should be sufficient for the Tribunal to dismiss the claims made by the Claimant under such BIT, as both parties to the Treaty accorded that each State had the exclusive right to decide whether its own measures were covered by such Article.\"41 Argentina submits that since its measures were necessary \"for the maintenance of public order\" and also \"for the protection of [its] own essential security interests\" they \"could never amount to a violation of the BIT or give rise to international liability on the part of the Argentine Republic.\"42\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 737 ff.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 739.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 743.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 744.\n\n59.\n\nArgentina then asserts the \"constitutionality of the state of necessity and emergency under Argentine law.\"43 \"In accordance with the provisions of Sections 76 and 99(3) of the Constitution, an economic emergency is one of the situations expressly contemplated in the Constitution.\"44 \"Subsidiarily,\" the Argentine Republic invokes the application of the state of necessity under international law to the present case \"should the Tribunal consider that the provisions of articles IV(3) and XI of the BIT are not applicable to this controversy.\"45 In this respect, Argentina claims that all the requirements associated with the customary rule on the State of Necessity, as codified by the ILC in its works on State responsibility and specifically in Art. 25 of its draft articles on the subject matter, were satisfied in the present dispute. Namely, that \"the State did not contribute to the state of necessity;\" that \"[t]he actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger;\" and that \"no essential interest has been affected of the State or States in connection with which the obligation exists, or the community as a whole.\"46 Moreover, according to Argentina, \"[w]ith respect to the treatment afforded by the Argentine Republic to foreign investors in the context of the state of emergency, [...] such treatment was not less favorable than the one afforded to nationals (who stoically suffered the crisis) and other investors, regardless of their citizenship.\" Argentina refers to its arguments on the standards of treatment mentioned here above.47\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 794.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 801.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 817-829.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 829-847.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 848-850.\n\n60.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina does not address the issue of the damage that Continental claims to have suffered as a consequence of Argentina's alleged breaches. Argentina filed, however, an evaluation Report dated March 20, 2006 by AGM Finanzas (signed by Daniel Marx and Jos\u00e9 M.Echag\u00fce) according to which CNA ART, and hence Continental, has suffered no damages due to Argentina's measures. On the contrary, according to this Report, both in terms of pesos and in terms of U.S. dollars, the value of CNA had increased considerably from November 2001 to March 2006.\n\n*B. The Claimant's arguments*\n-----------------------------\n\n61.\n\nOn July 26, 2006 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.2 to settle certain questions regarding the submission of evidence to the Tribunal. Thereupon, the Claimant filed its Reply on August 17, 2006 and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on October 20, 2006.\n\n62.\n\nIn its Reply dated August 17, 2006, the Claimant furnishes a descriptive context of the policies enacted by Argentina in the period preceding the crisis in order to show the Respondent's contribution to the crisis itself. Specifically, the Claimant points out that \"Argentina failed to adopt policies to support its currency board.\" \"Prior to 2001, Argentina made a number of serious policy mistakes [...] In particular: the lack of fiscal discipline and the failure to address deep rooted labor market and trade restrictions \"which in the end \"created a lack of credibility.\" \"Instead, Argentina could have implemented economic policies that would have supported the ability of the currency board to withstand an economic recession.\"48\n\nClaimant's Reply on the Merits, at paras. 32-36, (hereinafter, Continental Reply).\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant, moreover, contests Argentina's allegation that \"this Tribunal should deny recovery on the grounds that CNA ART voluntarily maintained assets in a country with high sovereign risk.\"49 The Claimant contests the behavior taken by the Respondent, which \"promised to refrain from interference with Bank Deposits, then froze and pesified them;\"50 \"promised to honor its government debt, then defaulted on and pesified it.\"51 According to the Claimant, \"[t]hese measures impugned the BITs provisions on expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, contracts observance and transfers.\"52\n\nContinental Reply, para.50.\n\nContinental Reply, para.53.\n\nContinental Reply, para.70.\n\nContinental Reply, para.81.\n\n64.\n\nThe Claimant points out to a number of factual elements in order to contest the alleged necessity of the specific measures taken by Argentina to overcome the crisis.53 The Claimant stresses that \"in any event, the devaluation of the peso *per se* is not being challenged in this arbitration, only the subsequent pesification of U.S. dollars denominated contracts. an unusual and extraordinary measure.\" The Claimant adds that \"[o]ther countries have pursued devaluation successfully without interfering with the property and contract rights of the holders of U.S. dollar-denominated contracts\" by following alternative approaches.54 The Claimant further submits that the impugned measures themselves \"inflamed social unrest\" and that \"their stated rationale has long since disappeared.\" Since Argentina's economy has now fully recovered, the Claimant concludes in this respect that \"deposit holders should be fully compensated for the confiscatory pesification of their deposits.\"55\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 84-109.\n\nContinental Reply para. 92, 94.\n\nContinental Reply para. 106.\n\n65.\n\nAs to the applicable legal standards under the BIT, the Claimant then refers back and elaborates further the arguments it had already developed in its Memorial on the Merits in order to establish the violation by Argentina of the various articles of the BIT that the Claimant had invoked in its previous submissions. Continental addresses first, its claims that Argentina breached Art. II(2)(c) of the BIT concerning the obligation to observe contractual obligations.56 Furthermore, \"[i]n the alternative, should this Tribunal determine that Article II(2)(c) applies only to obligations Argentina may have entered into with claimants (rather than \u2018with regard to investments'),\" the Claimant indicates that \"then CNA ART directly makes an ancillary claim for breach of this obligation.\"57 According to the Claimant, this ancillary claim would be allowed under the terms of Art. 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which \"enables a locally incorporated company that is subject to foreign control to claim as if it were a national of the other contracting Party,\" provided that the contracting parties have so agreed. In the Claimant's view, the required agreement is to be found at Art. VII(8) of the BIT itself, which provides as follows:\n\nFor purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.58\n\nContinental Reply, para. 137 ff.\n\nContinental Reply, para.142\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 143-144.\n\n66.\n\nAs a matter of procedure, Continental claims that the Tribunal is empowered to add CNA ART as a claimant pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.59\n\nContinental Reply, para. 147.\n\n67.\n\nSecondly, Continental reasserted its claim about the violation of the obligation to compensate following an act of expropriation, provided for by Art. IV of the BIT. The Claimant argues that \"CNA ART's assets are protected from expropriation;\" that \"legislation extinguishing intangible property rights is an expropriation;\" and that \"Argentine law continues to consider the measures as an expropriation.\" Continental points out to Argentina's Supreme Court decisions *Smith* and *San Luis* that declared \"Decree 1570 to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it was an unreasonable measure, lacking in proportionality between the deprivation of property rights and the objective of averting the crisis;\" and \"the pesification of bank deposits through Decree 214 to be unconstitutional.\"60 Those cases \"were based on Article 17 of the Argentine Constitution which provides that:\n\nThe right to property is inviolable and no inhabitant of the Nation can be deprived of it except by judicial decision founded in the law.61\n\nContinental Reply, para. 167.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 168.\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant observes that \"the Intangibility Law specifically declared that bank deposits were vested property rights entitled to the protections of Article 17.\"62\n\nContinental Reply, para. 169.\n\n69.\n\nThirdly, Continental reaffirms its claim about the violation of the obligation to treat the foreign investor according to the international law standard of treatment, provided for by Art. II(2)(a) of the BIT. This Article provides that:\n\nInvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n70.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the article obliges Argentina \"to provide a stable legal and business environment\"63 and \"to protect the investor's legitimate expectations.\"64\n\nContinental Reply, para. 181 ff.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 188 ff.\n\n71.\n\nFinally, as to the obligation to permit free transfers, provided for by Art. V of the BIT, Continental asserts that \"Article V Protects Transfers of CNA ART's Assets\"65 and that \"Article V proscribes any interference with the transfer of CNA ART's Assets.\"66\n\nContinental Reply, para. 193 ff.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 199 ff.\n\n72.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in the light of what it considers to be the legal import of the BIT provisions it relies upon, Argentina breached its treaty obligations through Decree 1570 (*Corralito*);67 by pesification of bank deposits through Decree 214;68 by pesification of government debt through Decree 471;69 by the unilateral rescheduling of deposits and default on debt.70\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 216-219. Breach of the freedom of transfers; obligation to pay compensation for expropriated investments; obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 221-223. Breach of the obligation to pay compensation for expropriating investments.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 224. Breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security; breach of the expropriation obligations; breach of the obligation to observe its obligations.\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 225-229. Breach of articles V, IV, II(2)(c) and II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant denies that Argentina could rely on the defense of necessity. On the one hand, the conditions required by the customary rule on the State of Necessity are not satisfied in the present case; on the other hand, it argues that Art. XI of the BIT cannot be applied. As to the customary international law defense of necessity, Continental argues that \"Argentina has failed to satisfy any of the cumulative elements of the defense of necessity.\"71 According to the Claimant, Argentina was not threatened by a grave and imminent peril to an essential interest, such as the existence of the State; Argentina's actions were not \"the only means to safeguard itself from the grave and imminent peril to its essential interest,\" since other means consistent with the BIT were available to it; and Argentina contributed to the state of necessity. Finally Continental considers that \"[e]ven if Argentina can successfully invoke the defense of necessity, Argentina must compensate the Claimant.\"72\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 236-257.\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 258-263.\n\n74.\n\nAs to Art. XI, Continental denies in the first place that the provision is self-judging, relying on the various means of interpretation of international treaties. Furthermore, Continental asserts that the requirements provided for by Art. XI have not been met: the correct interpretation of concepts like \"essential security interests\" and \"public order\" leads Continental to deny that such values were threatened when Argentina adopted the measures complained of by the Claimant.73 Continental also denies that the measures adopted by Argentina in order to protect such values were \"necessary\" in light of the correct interpretation of Article XI.74\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 325-343.\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 344-352.\n\n75.\n\nContinental concludes that, should the Tribunal find that Art. XI of the BIT is applicable in the present case, \"Argentina must still compensate the investor.\"75\n\nContinental asserts further that Argentina cannot rely on Article IV(3) to avoid such compensation. \"Regardless of whether Argentina faced circumstances falling within the scope of Article IV(3), the Investor does not claim Argentina has compensated foreigners and locals unequally and, therefore, Article IV(3) is irrelevant to this claim.\"76\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 353-364.\n\nContinental Reply, paras. 365-368.\n\n76.\n\nIn the last part of its Reply, the Claimant develops its arguments concerning the amount of damages it has suffered from Argentina's breaches of the Treaty. According to the Claimant, this \"calculation. is straightforward. But for Argentina's actions in breach of the Treaty, the Claimant would have received the value of the principal and interest payable on CNA ART's financial securities in accordance with their terms. The Claimant would have received the value of its U.S. dollar deposits and the value of its government loans at the agreed rate of interest.\"77 Instead, \"[a]s a consequence of Argentina's breaches, the Claimant received a fraction of this value. The Claimant received financial securities pesified at a confiscatory exchange rate and certificates of deposit and government loans with unilaterally reduced rates of interest. In the case of the LETEs, the Claimant received nothing at all.\"78 Continental challenges Argentina's claim that the Claimant suffered no damage. Based on the Reply Report of its expert Mr. Rosen, Continental argues that the \"AGM's conclusion that the Claimant has suffered no damages\" based \"on the alleged growth of CNA ART's overall equity since Argentina took its measures in breach of the Treaty\" is based on a \"completely inappropriate\" methodology.79\n\nContinental Reply, para. 369.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 370.\n\nContinental Reply, para. 373.\n\n77.\n\nQuite to the contrary, the Claimant asserts it has suffered substantial losses / damages. It has included in its Reply the following table reproduced from the Rosen Reply Report, which summarizes the Investor's damages from Argentina's breaches of the BIT:\n\n**Losses Due to**\n\n*C. Argentina's counter-arguments*\n----------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nIn its Rejoinder of October 20, 2006, Argentina replies to the arguments that the Claimant has developed in its Reply. First of all, Argentina opposes the Claimant's attempt to introduce a new party into the arbitration (CNA ART), at this late stage of the proceedings and requests that it be rejected as inadmissible and contrary to Art. 36(2) of the ICSID Convention80 and Arbitration Rules. \"Argentina will not argue at this point whether CNA ART can invoke Article 25(2)(b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention or whether it complies with the requirements expressed in Article VII(8) of the BIT,\" since \"[t]hese are matters which affect the claim's admissibility and the Tribunal's competence (apart from other jurisdiction-related and/or preliminary issues that might come up in connection with CNA ART), which Argentina has the right to address as exceptions to the Centre's jurisdiction or the Tribunal's competence in view of Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules. As to the merits, Argentina claims that introducing CNA ART at this point would also seriously violate Argentina's right of defense in various ways. The right for a party to submit an additional claim under Art. 46 of the Convention does not include in Argentina's view the right to introduce additional parties into the proceedings.81\n\nArgentina points out that Art. 36(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that the request to institute arbitration proceedings \"shall contain information concerning\" *inter alia* \"the identity of the parties.\"\n\nArgentina's Rejoinder on the Merits, at paras. 12-21, (hereinafter Argentina Rejoinder).\n\n79.\n\nSecondly, Argentina insists on its description of the context \"in which the measures applied during the collapse in 2001 were taken,\" reiterating that what the country suffered was a \"collapse that goes beyond an economic crisis.\"82 In particular, Argentina stresses that \"measures taken were necessary to counteract the effects of the crisis\" and that \"the challenged measures were not the cause of the social unrest.\"83\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 30.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 31 ff. and 83 ff.\n\n80.\n\nNext, Argentina then resumes its arguments against the claims raised by the Claimant. Firstly, Argentina reiterates that it cannot have expropriated Continental's investment since \"the value of CNA ART's equity increased by almost threefold-measured in U.S. dollars- than what it was worth before the crisis.\"84 In fact, \"the Claimant grounds its claim not in the decrease in the value of its investment (the interest in CNA ART) but alleged decreases in the value of CNA ART's investments and the measures that would have affected such investments.\"85\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 115.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 121.\n\n81.\n\nSecondly, \"Argentina confirm[ed] the grounds presented in its Counter-Memorial and restates that it granted CONTINENTAL a treatment in conformity with the provisions of Article II.2(a) and (b) of the BIT at all times.\"86 Argentina reiterates its position already stated in its Counter-Memorial according to which \"the fair and equitable treatment standard should be applied taking special consideration of the special circumstances in which the challenged measures were adopted.\"87 Argentina maintains that \"at no time (had it) stopped meeting its treatment obligations during the course of the crisis.\"88 According to Argentina \"[t]he fair and equitable treatment standard does not have as an objective to guarantee an objective and immutable right to the stability of the juristic order where the investment is carried out. On the contrary it should be interpreted as including the basic powers of the States of maintaining public order and facing emergencies.\"89 Argentina adds that \"[a]nother interpretation would turn the BITs into an insurance policy that would make the State respond in light of any situation regardless of the external circumstances motivating the State's acts.\"\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 213.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 219.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 221.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 224.\n\n82.\n\nThirdly, Argentina reiterates that it did not violate Art. V of the BIT in regard to transfers. First of all, Argentina claims that Art. V concerns only foreign investors and not local subsidiaries as CNA ART. Argentina draws support for this position from the Claimant's request to \"legitimize CNA ART as a party in this controversy.\"90 Argentina further argues that Art. V does not prevent \"specific regulations for balance-of-payment difficulties\" in view of Art. XI of the BIT and the \"standards established in multilateral agreements which both Argentina and the United States -the parties involved in the BIT applicable in this arbitration- have signed,\" with specific mention of GATT, GATS and the IMF.91 Argentina also claims that its regulations of monetary transfers conform with international customary law, as a manifestation of the exercise of monetary sovereignty by States, in view of the severe difficulties in its balance-of-payment.92 Therefore Argentina adds that \"if CONTINENTAL wanted to make transfers abroad of money derived from revenues and dividends, they could be made by previously requesting the authorization from the corresponding authority, i.e., the BCRA.\"93 However, Argentina submits that Art. V(1)(e) \"protects transfers of the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\" but that this was not the case since CNA ART and not \"CONTINENTAL was the holder of the bank deposits.\"94\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 294.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para.295.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para 297.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para.306.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para.308.\n\n83.\n\nNext, Argentina opposes again the Claimant's argument about the alleged violation of Art. II(2)(c) of the BIT. Firstly, it maintains that it had never \"adopted any commitment towards CONTINENTAL.\" According to Argentina, Continental \"intends to 'turn' a claim of contractual nature which is not its own into a claim for violations of the BIT.\"95 Continental's claim on this ground should thus be considered inadmissible since \"CONTINENTAL is acting on its own behalf, on the basis of an alleged violation of rights which are entitled to CNA ART. CONTINENTAL is not acting on behalf of CNA ART.\"96 Argentina points out \"the contractual nature of the claim,\" opposing \"CONTINENTAL's extensive interpretation\" of Art. II (2)(b) of the BIT.97\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 314.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 317.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 329-331.\n\n84.\n\nAs to Art. XI of the BIT, Argentina points out that it \"requested the Tribunal to apply Article XI of the BIT to this dispute... notwithstanding the fact that the measures under analysis did not violate any BIT standard.\"98 Argentina submits that Art. XI of the BIT and the customary rule on the State of Necessity are two different rules since they come from \"autonomous sources of international law,\" namely treaty and customary law respectively.99 Argentina adds that, contrary to Continental's assertions, the Report by professors Slaughter and Burke White - submitted as expert's testimony by Argentina -does not support the opinion that \"Article XI is *lex specialis* within the customary *lex generalis* of the state of necessity.\"100\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 365.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 367.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 376.\n\n85.\n\nArgentina then opposes the Claimant's interpretation of Art. XI of the BIT. With regard to the reference to the \"essential security interests,\" Argentina contests the argument according to which it would \"comprise only the external threats against the country.\"101 On the contrary, according to Argentina, \"the terms \u2018essential security interests' should be interpreted in a broad manner and they include crises as the one suffered by the Argentine Republic.\"102 Argentina also opposes the Claimant's views that the term \"public order\" in Art. XI, has to be assimilated with the concept of public order [ *ordre public* ] under private international law.103 According to Argentina, on the contrary, \"within the concept of public order\" are to be included \"at least the protection of public security and other powers included within the State's police power.\"104 Finally, Argentina submits that the term \"necessary\" contained in Art. XI of the BIT must be interpreted in line with the GATT-WTO case-law, under which \"necessary\" is not synonymous of \"indispensable.\"105\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 390.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 396.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 402.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 408.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, paras. 409-419.\n\n86.\n\nAs far as the issue of compensation is concerned, Argentina opposes Continental's allegation that \"even if the requirements under Article XI were fulfilled with respect to this case, the Argentine Republic should compensate it.\" According to Argentina, on the contrary, if Art. XI is applicable to the dispute at issue no compensation is due since \"there is no treaty violation.\"106\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, paras. 420-422.\n\n87.\n\nArgentina also reiterates its position that application of Art. XI of the BIT is self-judging. Finally, as to the invocation of the State of Necessity under customary international law, Argentina challenges Continental's reliance on the *CMS v. Argentina* ICSID award and invokes instead the decision in the *LG&E v. Argentina* case. Argentina reiterates that \"the measures were the only means of safeguarding an essential interest from a serious and imminent peril.\"107\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 481.\n\n88.\n\nArgentina then specifies its defense based on the customary rule on the State of Necessity contended in its Counter-Memorial, in the alternative with respect to the one based on Art. XI of the BIT. Argentina concludes that all the requirements associated with the customary rule were satisfied in the present case, contrary to the Claimant's allegations.108\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, paras. 454-465; 481-491.\n\n89.\n\nIn the final pages of its Rejoinder, Argentina deals with Continental's request of compensation for the damage it has suffered, denying that the investor suffered any damage based on the Max & Echag\u00fce Report.109 Finally, Argentina denies Continental's argument that a forcible effect of pesification was to \"trigger additional tax liabilities for CNA ART.\" According to Argentina, the income tax that was applied to all residents of Argentina does not constitute an expropriatory act and was not discriminatory, nor extraordinary or punitive.110\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 498 ff.\n\nArgentina Rejoinder, para. 531 ff.\n\n90.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 deciding the schedule for the Hearing to be held from November 27 to December 3, 2006; requiring to the disputing parties some additional information in order to fill a Chronological Table of the relevant events and measures at issue in the present dispute; asking the parties to send to the Secretary of the Tribunal a list of persons who would be attending the hearing as counsel, party representatives, witnesses and experts. The parties complied with those requests. The Hearing on the Merits took place from November 27 to December 3, 2006 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At the hearing the Claimant was represented by: Messrs. Barry Appleton, Robert Wisner, Hernando Otero, Nick Gallus and Ms. Asha Kaushal of the law firm of Appleton & Associates International Lawyers. The Respondent was represented by the Office of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, in person of the Procurador Mr. Oswaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino assisted by: Mr. Jorge Barraguirre, Ms. Cintia Yaryura, Mr. Fab\u00edan Markaida, Mr. Gabriel Bott\u00edni, Mr. Ignacio Torterola, Ms. Mar\u00eda Victoria Vitali, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde, Ms. Veronica Lavista, Mr. Diego Brian Gosis, and Mr. Norberto Ariel Martins. The witnesses and experts presented by the Claimant's counsel for oral examination were: Gary J. Owcar; C\u00e9sar Bunge; Kenneth Vandevelde; Howard Rosen; Sebastian Edwards. Mr. Samitier was also present as party representative for Continental. The following witnesses and experts testified on behalf of the Argentine Republic: Roberto Frenkel & Mario Damill; Eduardo Ratti; Federico Molina; Roberto Fortunati; Augusto Belluscio; A.M. Slaughter & B. White; Daniel Marx & Jos\u00e9 M. Echag\u00fce. Each party cross-examined the witnesses and experts of the other party as far as they requested.\n\n91.\n\nPursuant to the Procedural Direction of the Tribunal dated December 12, 2006, the Claimant and the Respondent filed their Post-Hearing Briefs on January 22, 2007. Afterwards, the Claimant and the Respondent filed their Post-Hearing Replies on March 9, 2007. Both parties presented their Statements of Costs on April 10, 2007. In the above-mentioned Procedural Direction the Tribunal also indicated that it would decide together with the merits the admissibility of the \"ancillary claim\" advanced by the Claimant in its Reply and opposed by Argentina concerning the addition of CNA ART as a claimant.\n\n92.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal declared the file closed to the parties on May 11, 2007. On June 25, 2007 Argentina wrote to the Tribunal asking that the Tribunal take into account as \"a decisive factor for the resolution of the present dispute\" an attached letter of the U.S. Department of State to former Legal Advisor Abraham Soafer (filed by a Claimant against Argentina in another ICSID dispute against Argentina in a pending arbitration under the U.S.-Argentina BIT) where the U.S. Department of State states, *inter alia*, that \".the position of the U.S. Government is that the essential security language in our FCN treaties and Bilateral Investment treaties is self-judging [...].\" The Claimant asked the Tribunal \"to ignore this untimely material\" adding that \"even if the Tribunal decides to consider the document, it sheds no greater light on the meaning of the essential security interests provision in the Argentina-U.S. treaty.\"\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal answered to the parties on July, 6, 2007 admitting the document (and allowing the Claimant to comment in writing on it) notwithstanding the file had been declared closed to the parties, stating various reasons justifying that it \"represents a rare exception to the above mentioned ruling.\"111 The Claimant duly filed its comments on July 16, 2007, restating its position that this standard \"Employment Ethics Letter\" by the Department of State was irrelevant, since it \"is not a letter about the meaning of the Argentine-U.S. BIT,\" does not evidence any agreement between the Contracting Parties to the BIT that Article XI is self-judging, is irrelevant under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and is generally far from a \"decisive factor for the resolution of the dispute\" contrary to Argentina's claim.112\n\nThree reasons were given in the Tribunal's letter, namely \"i. The document was not reasonably available to the Respondent until after the written and oral phases of these arbitration proceedings; ii. It addresses an issue in these proceedings on which both parties have submitted much material already; and iii. It is not a document which, as now introduced, can cause any material prejudice to the Claimant as a matter of procedure.\"\n\nAmong its supporting documents, the Claimant included the Award on the merits rendered in the case of *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, rendered on May 22, 2007 (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3).\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with ArbitrationRule 38 on April 24, 2008.\n\n**IV. Preliminary Issue**\n-------------------------\n\n*A. Continental's request to add CNA ART as a Claimant*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn its Reply Continental has submitted that the \"Umbrella Clause\" of Art. II (2)(c) of the BIT also applies to obligations entered by the host State \"with an investment\" of the protected covered investor, thus here CNA. Continental has also submitted that \"should this Tribunal determine that Article II (2)(c) applies only to obligations Argentina may have entered into with claimants (rather than \"with regard to investments\"), then CNA ART makes directly an ancillary claim for breach of this obligation.\"113 According to Continental, this ancillary claim is permissible under Art. 25 (2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which is referred to at Art. VII (8) of the BIT.114 As a matter of procedure, Continental claims that the Tribunal \"is empowered to add CNA ART as a claimant pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention\" which establishes the competence of an ICSID Tribunal to \"determine any incidental or ancillary claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 138 and 142.\n\n\"For the purpose of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or any political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n96.\n\nArgentina opposes the introduction of a new party mid-way through these pending arbitration proceedings, as being contrary to various provisions of the ICSID Convention and related procedural rules. Argentina also submits that the introduction of such a new party would adversely affect its position as a respondent and its rights of defense.115\n\nArgentina's Rejoinder, paras. 12-18.\n\n*B. Tribunal's Conclusion*\n--------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that Art. VII (8) of the BIT could allow CNA to initiate separate arbitration proceedings against Argentina on the basis of Art. 25 (2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It is also correct that Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention permits a tribunal to determine additional claims to be introduced in pending proceedings, subject to any agreement otherwise between the parties (of which none exists here). However these are two very different procedures. We fail to see how Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention allowing the introduction of an additional claim in a pending dispute between the same disputant parties could possibly justify the introduction into that arbitration of an additional third person with its own new claim, moreover at a late stage of the proceedings. An \"incidental or additional claim\" to the principal claim initially submitted clearly refers in Art. 46 to the relationship of this new claim with those claims already made in the pending proceedings by the same claimant; that is what \"additional\" and \"incidental\" signify in their ordinary meaning; and Art. 46 does not permit an extension of the dispute *ratione personae*. Moreover, as a further relevant factor in this case, the due process concerns raised by Argentina against the late introduction of a new claimant and a new claim are well founded in the view of the Tribunal.\n\n98.\n\nWe observe further that it is not CNA that has asked to be joined in the pending dispute; it was its parent Continental that purported to add it to the dispute as a coclaimant, an initiative that finds no support in the ICSID rules. Such an addition of CNA appears in any case unnecessary in the light of the objectives asserted by the Claimant. If a contract or other obligation entered into by the host State is found to be covered by Art. II (2)(c) of the BIT because it was entered into \"in regard to investments,\" notwithstanding the fact that it was entered into with the local subsidiary of the foreign investor, it would be immaterial if, procedurally, the claim is brought by the foreign investor directly, or by its local subsidiary relying on Art. VII (8) of the BIT in conjunction with Art. 25 (2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal, for these reasons, rejects the request of the Claimant in the above respect.\n\n**V. Factual Background**\n-------------------------\n\n*A. The economic evolution of Argentina from the introduction of the convertibility regime (1991) to the crisis (2001)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) General overview\n-------------------\n\n100.\n\nAll measures (the \"Measures\"), which Continental challenges, were enacted by Argentina during the well-known economic, political and social crisis which the country experienced during 2001-2002,116 as a response to that crisis and in attempts to control and overcome it. In different ways, all the Measures reflected, brought about, formalized or implemented the abrupt and traumatic abolition of the convertibility regime. The introduction of bank deposit freezes and of foreign exchange controls (*Corralito*, Decree 1570 of December 1, 2001) were the first Measures introduced. The Public Emergency Law 25,561 of January 6, 2002, and Measures adopted thereunder provided for the official abolition of the convertibility regime and of the connected pegging of the peso with the U.S. dollar, as well as the forced conversion into pesos of all dollar denominated financial instruments, indebtedness and contracts (\"pesification\"). A further set of Measures adopted under Law 25,561 acknowledged and formalized the default of Argentina on its internal and external debt and provided subsequently for that debt's restructuring with the aim of progressively restoring normal economic and financial conditions. Certain of these Measures affecting the Claimant have also been challenged by Continental as being in breach with BITs obligations.\n\nThe crisis materialized in 2001, but depending on the analysis its beginning has been set in 2000, and its origin even as early as 1998, see IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 8.\n\n101.\n\nContinental, on the one hand, relies on the convertibility regime as representing a standard of treatment to which it was entitled and the abolition of which, especially as to how it was carried out through the Measures, breached various BIT provisions to its financial detriment. On the other hand, Argentina claims that the Measures are justified because of the \"economic, social and institutional crisis precipitated in the Argentine Republic, which was the gravest of the country's history,\" so to render the context within which the Argentina's Measures were adopted absolutely exceptional.117\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 19-20.\n\n102.\n\nIt is therefore appropriate to summarize at the outset the economic evolution of Argentina following the introduction of the convertibility regime in 1991 up to the crisis, including the latter's causes, with a specific focus on the legal aspects of this regime as well as on the nature and effects of the various Measures. This part of the Award contains the factual basis for the Tribunal's consideration of Argentina's defense of necessity, including the availability of alternative measures.\n\n103.\n\nIn this summary the Tribunal has been much assisted by the Parties' Counsel and the Parties' expert witnesses and related materials. The subject is, of course, vast, difficult and complex. There is no single comprehensive study or chronology adequate for the task facing the Parties and the Tribunal in these proceedings. Moreover, each case addressing Argentina's crisis, with its different parties, claims and legal texts, raises its own special issues and particular considerations. Guided by the issues in the present case, this Tribunal has made its own analysis and arrived at its own decisions based upon the materials presented by the Parties in these proceedings. However, the Tribunal has confirmed such analysis and decisions by relying on authoritative and publicly available reports and studies of an economic and social-political nature, which assist in the narration of the crisis, its causes and responses. A distinction is made below, as appropriate, between objective facts and data, contemporary evaluation of the economic policy pursued by Argentina, and subsequent evaluation based on hindsight, made retrospectively.\n\n104.\n\nAs described by the IMF in 2004:\n\nThe Convertibility Law, which pegged the Argentine currency to the U.S. dollar in April 1991, was a response to Argentina's dire economic situation at the beginning of the 1990s. Following more than a decade of high inflation and economic stagnation, and after several failed attempts to stabilize the economy, in late 1989 Argentina had fallen into hyperinflation and a virtual economic collapse [...]. The new exchange rate regime, which operated like a currency board, was designated to stabilize the economy by establishing a hard nominal peg with credible assurances of non reversibility. The new peso (set equal to 10,000 australes) was fixed at par with the U.S. dollar and autonomous money creation by the central bank was severely constrained, though less rigidly than in a classical currency board. The exchange rate arrangement was part of a larger Convertibility Plan, which included a broader agenda of market-oriented structural reforms to promote efficiency and productivity in the economy. Various service sectors were deregulated, trade was liberalized, and anti-competitive price-fixing schemes were removed; privatization proceeded vigorously, notably in oil, power, and telecommunications, yielding large capital revenues. [footnotes omitted]118\n\nThe investment made by Continental in Omega ART (later CNA ART) in 1997 and completed in 2000 was made in a newly privatized sector (in June 1996), that of workers' accident insurance.119 In general, foreign direct investment inflows were sustained after the convertibility, representing more than 2-3% of GDP from 1995 to 2000 with a peak of 8.46% in the year 1999.120\n\nIMF, **Evaluation Report**, 11. As stated in the Preface to the Report, the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF (IEO), which authored the report, \"was created in 2001 to provide objective and independent evaluations on issues relevant to the IMF. It operates independently of IMF management and at arm's length from the IMF Executive Board.\" The **Evaluation Report** \"evaluates the role of the IMF in Argentina during 1991-2001, focusing particularly on the period of crisis management from 2000 to early 2002,\" *ibid*. For an acknowledgment of the value of this independent report and including its criticism to the IMF management of the crisis, see *Blustein*, 213. As to the effects of the Convertibility Plan, *see* also World Bank, *From Insolvency to Growth*, (Country Study) 1993, Claimant's doc. C-389. Argentina puts in doubt in its Post-Hearing Reply, 20-21, the objectivity of the Report, pointing to the criticism contained in a subsequent \"Report of the External Evaluation of the Independent Evaluation Office\" of March 29, 2006 (Respondent's doc. R-294), at p.14. The Tribunal considers this criticism not relevant as to the present description of the evolution of Argentina's economy. See also footnote 353 hereunder.\n\nART stands for \"Aseguratora de Riesgos del Trabajo\" (Workers' Risks Insurer).\n\nSee Claimant's doc. C-392 drawn from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, various years.\n\n105.\n\nIn more precise legal terms, the convertibility regime entailed that the national currency (the peso that replaced the Austral at one peso for each 10,000 Australes on January 1, 1992) was freely convertible with the U.S. dollar at 1:1, and the external value of the peso being pegged to the dollar under a currency board type arrangement.121 Transactions in convertible currencies were permitted. Authorized banks could open accounts in pesos or foreign currencies so that Argentines and foreigners in Argentina were allowed to hold and use any currency. This possibility led in time to the \"dollarization\" of Argentina's economy to a notable degree: contracts, especially medium and long term contracts such as rents, loans, supply contracts were expressed in dollars, rather than in pesos, and bank deposits were opened and maintained in dollars. Specifically, a large proportion of the banking system's assets and liabilities were denominated in dollars. The level of dollarization, which had been growing steadily since 1991, increased substantially in the second half of 2000: more than 70% of the private sectors deposits and almost 70% of the banking system credit to private sector were denominated in dollars by the end of 2000.122\n\nA publication directed to foreign investors \"Argentina Business,\" 259, summarized the arrangement as follows: \"The Convertibility Law also transformed the Banco Central de la Republica Argentina (BCRA, the central bank) into a currency board, preventing it from issuing more currency than can be backed by foreign currency reserves. This prevents the government from creating unbacked currency, \u2018running the printing press,' or monetizing deficits and thus limits inflation, contributing to the stability and integrity of the monetary system.\"\n\nCf. *Lessons from the Crisis*, 21, showing indicators from 1990 to 2000. According to Claimant's doc. C-190 (National Bureau of Economic research Working Paper No.10015 of 2003), Argentina had a \"very high\" degree of dollarization, with a score of 20, preceded by smaller economies such as Ecuador (25), Bolivia (22) and Uruguay (21).\n\n106.\n\nAnother feature of the convertibility regime was that, in strict adherence with the nominalistic principle,123 any indexation mechanism of debts was expressly prohibited, including in cases of delayed payment by the debtor (*mora del deudor*). This was in sharp contrast with the law and practice that had prevailed in Argentina under the previous monetary regime. In this connection Art. 11 of the Convertibility Law modified Art. 617 and 618 of the Civil Code to the effect that:\n\na. the obligation to pay a debt in a currency which is not legal tender in Argentina was considered to be a monetary obligation (new Art. 617);\n\nb. the obligation to pay a sum in a specified type of currency is satisfied by paying in that type of currency.124\n\nAs a result, debts in dollars had to be repaid in dollars. However, as reported officially by the IMF, in legal terms \"the currency of Argentina is the Argentine peso,\" and only the peso. \"Transactions in convertible currencies are permitted, and contracts in these currencies are legally enforceable, although the currencies are not legal tender.\"125 Accordingly, companies' accounts, including those of CNA, were always expressed in pesos only.\n\nArt. 7 of the Convertibility Law N\u00b0 23928 of March 1991, which also provides that a debtor of a given amount in pesos, satisfies his obligation by remitting at the date due that nominal quantity. As is well-known, nominalism indicates that a given currency is legal tender by sovereign will and must be accepted to satisfy debts and as means of exchange for its face value, irrespective of its purchase power, notably over time, or its loss of exchange value in terms of foreign currencies (i.e. devaluation), without the sovereign incurring thereby an international responsibility. See *Mann*, 463; D. Carreau, *Souverainet\u00e9 et coop\u00e9ration mon\u00e9taire internationale*, 1970, 73.\n\nThe parties have disputed the exact import of those provisions as discussed hereafter. According to the Claimant, Art. 617 and 619 not only entitled the debtor to discharge its obligation in foreign currency in that currency but \"gave creditors the right to refuse payment that was not in the agreed upon currency\" (Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20). Argentina claims that those obligations could be discharged also in pesos at the current exchange rate.\n\nIMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of January 31, 1999 (Claimant's doc. C-377) at p. 32; IMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of December 31, 1999 (Claimant's doc. C-378), at p.33; IMF Argentina, Status Under IMF Articles of Agreements: Article VIII, Position as of December 31, 2000 (Claimant's doc. C-379), at p.34.\n\n107.\n\nThere have been many descriptions of the evolution of Argentina's economy under the Convertibility Plan from what have been described as the \"boom years,\" to the first deterioration of the country's performance in the second half of 1998, and thereafter to the intensification of Argentina's problems in 2000, ultimately leading to the crisis and the abandonment of the convertibility regime in early January 2002. The Tribunal considers that a useful overview of this evolution relevant for the subsequent legal analysis is set forth in the relevant pages of the \"Overview of Economic Developments, 1991-2001,\" found in the IMF Independent Evaluation Office Report \"The IMF and Argentina: 1991-2001\" published in 2004, 11-13.126\n\nThere was a marked improvement in Argentina's economic performance under the Convertibility Plan, particularly during its early years. Inflation, which was raging at a monthly rate of 27 percent in February 1991, declined to 2.8 percent in May 1991; on an annual basis, inflation fell to single digits in the summer of 1993 and remained low (or even negative) from 1994 to the end of the convertibility regime in early 2002. The overall fiscal balance of the federal government improved significantly from the previous years, with an average budgeted deficit of less than 1% of GDP during 1991-98.\n\nGrowth performance was impressive through early 1998, except for a brief set back in 1995 when Argentina was adversely affected by the Mexican crisis. For 1991-98, GDP growth averaged nearly 6 percent a year, vindicating the market-oriented reforms introduced in the early 1990s. Attracted by a more investment-friendly climate, there were large capital inflows in the form of portfolio and direct investments.127 During 1992-99, Argentina received more than $100 billion in *net* capital inflows, including over $ 60 billion in *gross* foreign direct investments.\n\nThe resilience of the convertibility regime was severely tested by the Mexican crisis in 1995. In response, Argentina launched a rigorous adjustment program under IMF financial support consisting of strong fiscal action and structural reform. When the peg survived and a V-shaped recovery ensued, this was widely interpreted as evidence of the convertibility regime's robustness and credibility. Favorable external circumstances also contributed to this outcome. This was a period in which the U.S. dollar was relatively weak, so the peg did not entail a loss of competitiveness, particularly given the improvements in productivity. Tariff reductions achieved under MERCOSUR also helped promote exports, particularly to Brazil, Argentina's largest trading partner. Capital flows to emerging markets were strong in the mid-1990s and Argentina was a major beneficiary. Argentina was relatively unaffected by the outbreak of the East Asian crisis in 1997; it quickly returned to the international capital markets in December of that year.\n\nIn October 1998, the performance of Argentina received the attention of the world when President Carlos Menem shared the podium of the Annual Meetings with the IMF Managing Director, who characterized \"the experience of Argentina in recent years\" as \"exemplary.\" The Managing Director further remarked: \"Argentina has a story to tell the world: a story which is about the importance of fiscal discipline, of structural change, and of monetary policy rigorously maintained.\"\n\nAs it happened, Argentina's performance deteriorated from the second half of 1998, owing to adverse external shocks, including a reversal in capital flows to emerging markets following the Russian default in August 1998; weakening of demand in major trading partners, notably in Brazil; a fall in oil and other commodity prices; general strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro; and the 70 percent devaluation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar in early 1999. Real GDP fell by over 3 percent in the second half of 1998, there was a mild pickup in economic activity in the second half of 1999, spurred by increasing government spending in the run-up of the October presidential elections, but this was not sustained and GDP declined by 3\u00bd percent for 1999 as a whole. The economy never recovered through the end of the convertibility regime.\n\nThe economic slowdown, coupled with the election-driven surge in public spending in 1999, had important implications for fiscal solvency. Argentina's consolidated fiscal balance had been in deficit throughout the 1990s except in 1993, but the magnitude was not large. Consolidated public sector debt, however, increased more rapidly because of the periodic recognition of off-budget liabilities, including the court-ordered payments of past pension benefits, which averaged over 2 percent of GDP a year during 1993-99. Even so, the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio was modest as long as growth remained high, and there was even a small decline in the ratio from 1996 to 1997. The situation changed in 1999, when growth decelerated and the public finances deteriorated sharply. The debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 37.7 percent of GDP at end-1997, to 47.6 percent at end-1999, an increase of 10 percentage points in just two years. The ratio would eventually reach 62 percent at end of 2001.\n\nArgentina's problems intensified in 2000, when growing solvency concerns over the cumulative increase in public debt was exacerbated by the continued appreciation of the U.S. dollar and a further drying up of capital flows to emerging market economies. These developments would normally require a smaller current account deficit and a depreciation of the real exchange rate, but the convertibility regime placed severe limitations on the ability of Argentina to achieve this adjustment in a manner that could avoid recession. Argentina initially sought to restore market confidence by negotiating a SBA with the IMF, which it indicated would be treated as precautionary.\n\nMarket confidence did not recover as expected and market access was effectively lost later in the year, leading Argentina to seek an augmentation of IMF support. From December 2000 to September 2001, the IMF made a series of decisions to provide exceptional financial support to Argentina, which ultimately amounted to SDR 17 billion, including the undrawn balance under the existing arrangement. However, stabilization proved elusive. The augmentation announced in December 2000 and formally approved in January 2001 had a favorable effect, but it was short-lived. Pressure built up again as it became evident that political support for the agreed measures was lacking and program targets were unlikely to be met.\n\nFrom the spring of 2001, the authorities took a series of measures in quick succession, including: an announced plan to change the anchor of the convertibility regime from the U.S. dollar to an equally weighted basket of the dollar and the euro (the switch to take effect only when the two currencies reached parity); a series of heterodox industrial or protectionist policies (called \"competitiveness plans\") involving various tax-exemptions measures in sectors most adversely affected by the recession; and an exchange of outstanding government bonds totaling $30 billion in face value for longer maturity instruments (the so-called mega-swap). Many of these measures, which were taken without consultation with the IMF, were perceived by the markets as desperate or impractical and served to damage market confidence.\n\nDespite these initiatives and the financial support of the IMF, market access could not be restored, and spreads on Argentine bonds rose sharply in the third quarter of 2001. Amid intensified capital flight and deposit runs, capital controls and a partial deposit freeze were introduced in December 2001. With Argentina failing to comply with the fiscal targets, the IMF indicated that it could not clear the disbursement scheduled for December. At the end of December, following the resignation of President Fernando De La R\u00f9a the country partially defaulted on its international obligations. In early January 2002, Argentina formally abandoned the convertibility regime and replaced it with a dual exchange rate system.\n\nSee Claimant's doc. C-149 and Respondent's doc. R-207. References in the text to Tables and Boxes of the Report and footnotes have been omitted.\n\nThe conclusion of Bilateral Investment Treaties was part of this policy. Argentina signed its first three BITs in 1990. In 1992 the first BITs entered into force for Argentina. At the end of 2001 Argentina had signed 58 BITs in total, among which the one with the US at issue in the present case.\n\n108.\n\nArgentina's crisis of 2001-2002 has been described both as \"one of the worst economic crises in its history\" and \"among the most severe of recent economic crises\" worldwide.128 It resulted in a massive default of public debt both domestic and international, the latter involving U.S.$141 billion. \"The immediate macroeconomic consequences of the crisis were severe. Real GDP fell by about 10% in 2002, bringing the cumulative decline since 1998 to almost 20%.129 Inflation peaked at a monthly rate of about 10% in April 2002, driven by liquidity provisions from the central bank to banks experiencing deposit withdrawals, but then declined, averaging around 40% for the year as a whole.130 More generally the crisis was characterized by severe deflation, a decline in domestic prices as a consequence of the peso overvaluation and the deterioration of the competitiveness of the economy.131 The stock index of Buenos Aires lost more than 60% from 1998 to 2002.132 More important than any of these economic indicators, the crisis lead to substantial social and personal hardship, including the youngest and most vulnerable members of the populations: the unemployment rate rose to above 20% in 2002; and per capita expenses fell off about 74%.133 \"The poverty level increased to 54.3% of the urban population of the country and the indigence level reached 24.7%. Between October 1998 and October 2002, the poverty level was doubled, whereas the indigence level increased 358%,\" most of the increase having taken place from May 2001 on.134 Argentina also points out to other aspects of the social crisis due to the \"impossibility of the State to provide the necessary conditions for harmonious development of society as set forth in the Argentine Constitution,\" due to the gradual deterioration of the State as regards fulfillment of security and health duties.135 The political effects of this massive economic and social crisis, were \"the political demonstrations, riots and looting in December 2001 which led to an abrupt end of De La R\u00faa's government\" and the vacuum in the political power that followed his resignation.136 Argentina has concluded from its recapitulation of those events that \"the effective control of the government on the territory was seriously endangered, with presidents coming one after the other and riots causing tens [sic] of deaths throughout the country, which entails in turn that the existence of the Argentine Government137 itself was at risk.\"138 The Tribunal accepts this characterization of the gravity of the crisis confronting Argentina at this particular time.\n\nSee respectively *Lessons from the Crisis*, 1, and IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 8. Argentina's default on its $141 billion external default in late December 2001 was the largest sovereign default, *See* Scott, 575.\n\nCf. *Lessons from the Crisis,* 38. According to data supplied by Argentina (Argentina's Counter-Memorial, 63-65), not challenged by the Claimant, the GDP decrease was even worse, from US$300 billion in mid-98 to US$220 billion in the first quarter of 2002. Argentina observes further \"[d]uring the first quarter of 2002 GDP fell 16.3% in relation to the same period of the previous year, which implies a fall worse than that suffered in the crack of the 30's in the United States\" relying also on a statement by US Undersecretary of State for Latin American Affairs Otto Reich. (Argentina's CounterMemorial, 64).\n\nCf. *Lessons from the Crisis*, 38, noting also that: \"[r]eflecting the effects of the exchange rate depreciation on foreign-currency denominated debt, the issuance of debt to compensate banks for the asymmetric pesoization, and the accumulation of arrears, the public debt ratio more than doubled from 63% of GDP at the end of 2001 to about 135 % of GDP at end-2002.\"\n\nArgentina points out that several economic observers had suggested, already in 1999 (Warburg Dillon Read and Paul Krugman), again in 2000 (Floyd Norris in the New York Times) and at the beginning of November 2001 (Paul Krugman, Michel Mussa, Argentina's Counter-Memorial p. 203) that in order to overcome this overvaluation and make Argentina's economy internationally competitive again, Argentina might have to abandon the fixed exchange rate and put an end to dollarization. According to Prof. S. Edwards Report filed by Claimant, however, by the year 2000, Argentina's terms of trade were back to their 1997 level, \"The temporary decline between 1997 and 2000 was mild compared to other large Latin American countries (see Claimant's Reply, para. 38). According to the IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 66, \"a deeper and more systematic analysis of the conditions facing Argentina would have lead to the conclusion that, in 2000, Argentina fixed exchange rate could not be sustained for long.\"\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 73.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 105.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 78-79 based on published labour market indicators.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 81 ff. Among other effects, medical services had to be interrupted to thousand of AIDS patients at the beginning of 2002; malnutrition especially in children increased and disease spread. A \"sanitary emergency\" until the end of 2002 was declared by Law 25590 on May 15, 2002. Two special social programs for the most needed were introduced in the course of 2002, the Plan for Unemployed Persons in charge of a Family (*Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados*), and the Federal Food Emergency Program (*Programa de Emergencia Alimentaria Nacional*).\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 132. A vivid personal account of this situation was given in the oral testimonies of Judge Belluscio (see para. 127) and of Mr. Eduardo A. Ratti who was Legal and Administrative Secretary of the Ministry of the Economy between the beginning of January and 6 May, 2002, in charge of the coordination of the Drafting Committee for the Emergency Law and of Decree 214/02 (see Transcript of the Hearing of November 30, 2006, at p. 809 ff).\n\nIn the original Spanish text: \"la existencia misma del Estado Argentino.\"\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 138.\n\n*b) The Deterioration of the financial and economic situation of Argentina in 2001 until Decree 1570 of December 1 (Corralito)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nHaving thus presented an overview of the developments of Argentina's economy from 1991 to 2001-2002 in general terms, we will here address more specifically the events of the year 2001-2002.139\n\nThis timeline is based on a chronological table of relevant events supplied by the Parties to the Tribunal prior to the hearing on the merits, pursuant to the Tribunal's request and to the Parties' documents referred therein; on Appendix II of *Lessons from the Crisis*, \"Chronology of Key Developments in 2001-2002\" (used as a source where no other indication is given), and on *Hornbeck*, (see Claimant's doc. C-189).\n\n*(i) The events and economic policy initiatives that punctuated the deterioration of the situation of Argentina*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nIn March 2000 the IMF approved a Stand-By Arrangement with Argentina providing an amount equivalent to SDRs 5.4 billion. In its *First Review* and periodic consultation under Art. IV of the Fund's Articles of Agreement140 released in December 2000, the IMF noted that the economy had slowed down again in 2000, that it continued to adjust to the external shocks it suffered in 1998-99 through domestic cost and price deflation, that competitiveness had improved, that there had been a further decline in nominal wages.141 The Review underlined that the \"fiscal program for 2000 was designed to comply with the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved by the Argentine Congress in September 1999, and aimed at reducing the deficit of the federal government... To this end, the authorities early in the year enacted a sizable tax package..., and budgeted a cut in non-interest expenditures equivalent to almost 1 percent of GDP142... The program envisaged a reduction of the overall public sector deficit (including the provinces).\" The Review further mentioned that since the effects of the tax package had not materialized due to the sluggish recovery of the economy resulting in a growing shortfall in tax revenues, the authorities had announced in May [2000] \"a sizable package of additional spending cuts including a 12-15 percent cut in salaries of civil servants earning more than Arg. $ 1,000 per month\"... \"The program also envisaged that the fiscal adjustment effort at the federal level would be complemented by improvements in the finance of the provinces, which are responsible for nearly half of total public sector expenditure.\"143 The Review further noted \"[p]rogress was made along a broad front in the structural reform area\" pointing out to Labor Market Reform, Health Care, Tax Administration.144\n\nSee IMF, *First Review* \"[u]nder Art. IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic development and policies,\" *ibid*, Annex to the *Rewiew* \"Public Information Notice,\" footnote 1.\n\nIbid, 4-5.\n\nSee here original footnote 4: \"It is difficult to make budget cuts without affecting the appropriation for socially important programs. During 1995-99, no less than \u00bd of the federal public spending, net of interest payments and transfers to provinces was directed to broadly defined social programs including social security, health, education, and the social safety net.\"\n\nIbid, 8-9.\n\nIbid, 12-13.\n\n111.\n\nCertain sentences are worth quoting from the \"Public Information Notice\" annexed to the IMF Report, reporting the conclusion of the IMF Executive Board of September 15, 2000:\n\nExecutive Directors welcomed the authorities' strong ownership of, and demonstrated commitment to, their economic program, and the significant progress made so far in improving the fiscal position at both the federal and provincial level, despite cyclical adverse conditions, and in implementing structural reforms (...)\n\nWhile recognizing these concerns, Directors concurred with the authorities' view that, within the framework of the convertibility regime, the resumption of sustainable growth depended crucially on credible further progress in fiscal consolidation and structural reform. (...)\n\nDirectors noted that the convertibility regime, together with a strong financial system, had served Argentina well in weathering the major external shocks that had affected it in recent years. They also noted the strong support of the population for the regime, its demonstrated success in anchoring inflation expectations, and the high degree of *de facto* dollarization in the economy... Directors considered that, with an improved competitive position, both the current account and the public sector deficits on a declining path, and important structural reforms enacted or under way, the Argentine economy was now in a good underlying position to resume sustainable growth.145\n\nAnnex, 3-4.\n\n112.\n\nIn its *Second Review* of January 2001, the IMF staff noted that \"the external environment worsened in the subsequent months, with external financing to emerging markets nearly drying up. This was compounded by domestic political uncertainties, which raised doubts about the political governability of the country.(...) The authorities have responded to these adverse developments by strengthening the growth orientation of their economic program, through measures aimed at promoting a recovery of investment, and an accelerated implementation of structural reforms... \" *In view of the staff, this*  *strategy is appropriate, and deserves the increased financial support of the international* *community... A recovery of confidence hinges,* in turn, not only on a relatively benign international environment, but perhaps more importantly, *on a demonstrated, unwavering commitment by the authorities to a rapid and full implementation of their announced* *policies.* \"146\n\nIMF, *Second Review*, 27-28.\n\n113.\n\nBased on the IMF staff recommendation, the IMF Executive Board approved on January 12, 2001 an augmentation of Argentina's Stand-By Arrangement to an equivalent of U.S.$14 billion, as part of a broader international support package of almost U.S.$40 billion.147 \"Financial markets initially responded positively to the revised program, but already by mid February it became evident that the fiscal deficit was about to exceed the agreed ceiling for the first quarter. Moreover, following the resignation of the finance minister, his successor was forced out of office in less than two weeks as his planned budgetary cuts and reform measures failed to find the necessary political backing. Doubts about the sustainability of the public debt dynamics and the currency board arrangement resurfaced quickly, evidenced by rising spreads and sizable deposit outflows.\"148 Thus on March 28, 2001, Domingo Cavallo, the author of the Convertibility Plan of 1991, was appointed Minister of Economy and secured \"emergency powers\" from Congress. However, at the end of March 2001 risk-rating agencies lowered Argentina's long-term sovereign rating.149 On April 26, 2001, the President of the Central Bank was replaced after a clash with the Minister.150 On May 1, 2001 Minister Cavallo publicly reaffirmed that he would stick to convertibility.151\n\n\"The proposed mix of resources exceeds the normal 300 per cent of the quota limit of financing under the credit tranches, and reflects the more protracted nature of Argentina's financing problem\" *Ibid*, 26. \"About $3 billion of IMF support was made available immediately and three additional tranches of about $1.3 billion were planned to be released during the remainder of 2001 in the context of subsequent reviews. The program sought to bolster the prospects for economic growth through gradual fiscal consolidation (...) and various structural measures,\" through among other things, elimination of tax disincentives, continued implementation of already approved labour market reforms and deregulation of key sectors, See *Lessons from the Crisis,* 35. The IMF support of January 2001 became known as the \"blindaje,\" that is the \"armour plating\" of the peso against runs on the peso aimed at the devaluation or destabilization of Argentina's currency.\n\n*Lessons from the Crisis*, 35.\n\nS&P from BB to B+ and Moody's from B1 to B2, *ibid*, 48.\n\nSee *Blustein*, 123.\n\nContinental has referred to this public statement as having been an element for CNA's decision not to transfer liquid funds out of Argentina. In April, Minister Cavallo had sent to Congress a bill proposing to include the euro in addition to the US dollar in the Convertibility Law.\n\n114.\n\nOn 21 May 2001, the IMF completed its planned *Third Review* of Argentina's Stand-By Arrangement, at a point when the Fund had an outstanding credit of nearly SDR 5.8 billion and another SDR 6.8 billion scheduled purchase under the arrangement in place, making Argentina the third largest debtor to the IMF.152 The Review contained both favorable and critical evaluations. The IMF underlined \"the favorable developments that followed the agreement on the program and financing package in January\" which were however interrupted in early March by a new crisis. The principal catalyst was evidence of a major deterioration in the fiscal performance, but internal political disagreements and increased uncertainty in international markets were contributing factors.153 Amongst the negative developments, the Report mentioned the increase of the spread on Argentine bonds, the decline in economic activity and the significance of the deterioration in the federal government finances.154 Positive developments mentioned included the fact that the provincial government deficit for 2000 was slightly lower than expected, and the improvement of the trade balance in 2000 and in the first quarter of 2001. The Review highlighted the revised economic program of Minister Cavallo, praised the fact that \"[t]he government re-affirmed its commitment to the fiscal targets of the economic program for 2001;\" noted the introduction in April 2001 of a financial transaction tax \"[t]o correct for the prospective large deviation and bring the fiscal program back on track.\"155 The Review estimated that the new fiscal package has started to show results, and that the new fiscal measures under the Fiscal Responsibility Law \"will contribute substantially to strengthen fiscal performance in 2002,\" also in view of the fact that the authorities attach great importance to improving the province's finance and \"are continuing to work with provincial governments to secure a sustained adjustment of their fiscal position, as contemplated in the federal fiscal pact signed last November.\"156\n\nIMF, *Third Review*, 20.\n\nIMF, *Third Review*, 3. \"Two thirds of the deviation resulted from a revenue shortfall, in turn explained about evenly by weaker than expected economic activity and a deterioration in tax compliance,\" *ibid*, 5.\n\nThe tables included in the IMF, *Third Review*, at 9, showed the substantive decrease of peso bank deposits, especially after January 2001 against the continuous increase of US dollar denominated deposits from the beginning of 2000 to January 2001, followed by a modest decrease thereafter.\n\n*Ibid*, 12.\n\n*Ibid*, 15-16. The Review mentions that in December 2000, \"with technical support of the Fund, a strategy was laid out to strengthen tax collection,\" and the reform of the pension and health insurance systems that had been hampered by judicial challenges.\n\n115.\n\nThe Review also praised the initiatives taken by the Argentinean Government within the Competitiveness Law. The IMF Staff's concluding appraisal was that \"[t]he government has responded to this latest crisis with an effort commensurate with the gravity of the situation\" and regarded \"this strategy - consistent with the objectives of the program supported by the Stand-By Arrangement.\"157 The News Brief of May 21, 2001 announcing the positive completion of the Fund's Third Argentina Review ended with the following paragraph: \"\u2018[i]n adopting the new measures, the Argentine authorities have responded promptly and effectively in difficult circumstances. The strengthened program deserves the strong support of the international community\" K\u00f6hler said.158\n\nSpecifically praised at p. 21 are the authorities' initiatives \"to put in place a package of significant revenue and expenditure measures to bring the public finance back to a path consistent with the program targets\" and the fact that they \"have introduced a number of tax incentives and regulatory changes aimed at promoting a recovery of investment and sustainable output growth.\" It is perhaps striking that *ex post facto* the IMF, *Evaluation Report*, at 5, criticizes \"the weak implementation of the program in early 2001 and the adoption - without consultation with the Fund - of a series of controversial and market-shaking measures by the authorities after March 2001.\"\n\nHorst K\u00f6hler, currently President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was at the time the Director General of the IMF. In retrospect, the IMF Study *Lessons from the Crisis,* Appendix II, dismisses the *Third Review* as \"reprofiling the path for the federal government deficit target during 2001 to accommodate the deviations observed during the first quarter.\"\n\n116.\n\nAt the beginning of June 2001 Argentina's authorities announced the completion of the \"mega-swap\" entailing the voluntary exchange of external Governmental bonds of a face value of U.S.$29.5 million for longer-term instruments.159 In July 2001, Minister Cavallo announced a drastic program of fiscal adjustment (zero-deficit plan), which was promptly approved by Congress. \"But by the time the law was approved by Congress at the end of July, spreads between the peso and U.S. dollar-denominated interest rates had reached 1,500-2.000 basis points,\"160 while the Government was paying a yield of 14.1% to place U.S.$827 million of 90-day paper.161 Risk agencies further lowered Argentina's debt rate. A likely U.S.$8 billion increase of the Stand-By was announced by the IMF in August and approved on September 7, 2001, augmenting the total to U.S.$21.6 billion, while the IMF positively completed its *Fourth Review*, which entailed a commitment to disburse further funds in November 2001.\n\nDespite the high turnover of bondholders who participated, the \"mega-swap\" did not reassure the market and was criticized, especially *ex post facto*, for not having helped Argentina to improve its ability to service its debt, while having burdened it with the costs of such an operation, see *Blustein*, 125 ff; *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36. Also in June 2001 a package of tax and trade measures, including a trade compensation mechanism for exporters and importers of non-energy goods was announced by Minister Cavallo. \"This was part of \u2018a number of measures aimed at improving competitiveness, with little effect other than to erode confidence and widen spread further',\" *Lessons from Crisis*, 35.\n\nCf. *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36. However, according to a paper of March 25, 2002 by M. Mussa of the Institute for International Economics (and former high official of the IMF), *Argentina and the Fund: From Triumph to Tragedy*, 29 (Claimant's doc. C-153) \"With the Argentine economy already in deep recession and spiralling downwards under the pressure of crushingly high interest rates, the massive additional fiscal tightening needed to achieve a zero deficit was neither politically acceptable nor economically sensible. By the summer of 2001, the Argentine government was clearly trapped with no viable avenue of escape.\"\n\nThis corresponds to a spread of about 1,000 basis point (or 10%) in respect of the U.S. dollar, see *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36, while the even greater spread between the peso rate and the U.S. dollar rate, notwithstanding convertibility, evidenced the perceived country risk for Argentina, *Blustein*, 136.\n\n117.\n\nAs mentioned above, from the end of 2000 and in the course of 2001, Argentina passed several laws aimed at adopting the structural reforms that the IMF had asked Argentina to undertake in accordance with the Stand-By conditions. These related to budgetary discipline against the deficit,162 increases in taxation, fiscal discipline (including the provinces), labor market flexibility (i.e. reducing employees' protection under labor legislation in place), reforming social security and controlling the pensions' costs, increasing the competitiveness of enterprises and helping exporters. Many of these provisions were not or could not be carried out effectively, or did not yield the expected results. Thus tax revenues continued to fall, due also to the economic crisis, while the promised reform of the central governments revenue-sharing agreement with the provinces was not concluded.163 The planed labor market reform which entailed addressing labor market rigidities through \"the adjustment of real wages\"164 was not completed; on the other hand widespread strikes had taken place specifically to protest against harsh spending cuts. Many of these reforms, recommended by the Fund consistent with a market-oriented approach to the structural changes deemed appropriate for a country like Argentina, met with widespread social opposition, to the point that some reforms were blocked by the courts.165 The domestic economy of Argentina - which was in a state of recession since early 2000 - and hence the population of Argentina, had to bear the increasingly heavy burden of adjustment to the maintenance of the exchange rate and convertibility.166\n\nOn July 29, the Congress passed the \"Zero Deficit Law\" requiring a balanced budget by the forth quarter of 2001; see *Hornbeck*, 3 (Claimant's doc. C-189).\n\nHowever under the zero-deficit law Minister Cavallo had cut federal payments to the provinces, leaving them without funds to make necessary payments and leading some of them to issue their own currency, the patacon, \"a disturbing sign of economic anarchism,\" *Blustein*, 161. After the crisis, as to the IMF policies towards Argentina, *Lessons from the Crisis,* 39, comments that \"[t]he most glaring omission was in the fiscal area, where the IMF condoned repeated slippages of debt and deficit targets.\" Other commentators point out however that the Average Public Revenue - GDP Ratios for Argentina in 1990-2002 (a little more than 20%), although lower than the ratio for industrialized countries, was higher than Brazil's, IMF, *World Economic Outlook*, September 2003.\n\nThis is the terminology used by *Lessons from the Crisis*, 32, hinting at wage reduction. In any case, the zero-deficit plan entailed cuts in governmental salaries and pensions of up to 13%.\n\nSee the successful judicial challenges to the reforms of the pension and health insurance system mentioned in the IMF *Third Review*, 17.\n\nSee P. Krugman, Editorial, *Reckonings; A Cross of Dollars*, New York Times, November 7, 2001: \"[u]nfortunately, that old-time economic religion, with its narrow-minded insistence on monetary rectitude at the expense of every other consideration. more than anything else, is responsible for Argentina's looming catastrophe. But austerity has not brought recovery. On the contrary it has worsened the recession, increased social tension and further reduced confidence. The natural answer is to remove the straitjacket: let the peso float.\" (Argentina's doc. RA-54). See also Mussa, 49, \"it is my view that the Argentine's government basic decision to combine efforts at macroeconomic stabilization with market-oriented reforms that reversed decades of interventionist policies and protectionism was the right policy approach. and the spectacular collapse in 2001 is due to the failure of implementing this strategy sufficiently vigorously. Others, however, may be inclined to the view that the policies of the so-called Washington Consensus are fundamentally wrong and were doomed from the start to produce a disaster in Argentina.\"\n\n118.\n\nIn fact, throughout this period, the Government of Argentina showed and declared a staunch commitment to maintaining the convertibility regime in all its features (as was expected by the international financial community). This was a fundamental element of the policy of stability pursued by the IMF in agreement with Argentina.167\n\nThe IMF *Evaluation Report*, 21, notes: \"repeated public statements by the IMF supportive of Argentina's convertibility regime.\" *Blustein*, 136, considers that it was thanks to the official visit by U.S. Undersecretary Taylor to Buenos Aires on 3, August 2001, when he visited Argentina's President at Casa Rosada, that \"[t]he stage was being set for another IMF rescue that would attempt to preserve convertibility and keep Argentina from violating its obligations to creditors.\"\n\n119.\n\nAs decided and announced in August 2001, \"[d]espite concerns about the lack of political support for the measures that would be needed to achieve the zero-deficit target, the IMF agreed in early September of 2001 to support the new program,\" increasing the support by U.S.$8 billion, disbursing U.S.$5 billion immediately (pledging another U.S.$3 billion in support of prospective debt restructuring).168\n\nSee IMF *Evaluation Report*, 9. According to Mussa, 30, \"[n]ot only was the procedure unusual, the outcome - a Fund disbursement of over $ 6 billion. with a pledge of $3 billion more to support an unspecified debt restructuring - was extraordinary both in its size and in the lack of reasonable justification.\"\n\n120.\n\nIt was in this context that Argentina's Congress passed the \"Intangibility Law,\" promulgated on September 24, 2001, providing, as described concisely by the Claimant, that \"the government would not alter terms of deposits in the banking system.\" In emphatic terms, the law proclaimed in Art. 1 that all deposits in pesos or in foreign currency were considered \"intangible,\" that is, the State was prohibited, in all cases, from changing the terms agreed between the depositors and the financial institution, exchange them with public debt instruments or other public assets, extend their terms, modify the agreed interest rate, change the currency of the debt. Art. 3 declared the law to be \"of public order;\" the private rights covered by its Art. 1 \"shall be considered acquired rights and protected under Art. 17 of the Nation's Constitution.\"169\n\nSee Law 25,466 \" *Intangibilidad de los Depositos*.\" It is interesting to note that this legal enactment, on which the Claimant relies and which was put at as the basis of Argentina's Supreme Court decisions of 2002 and 2003 (holding the *Corralito* and the *Corralon* as unconstitutional encroachments on private property, see footnote 410 hereunder) is nowhere mentioned in the economic literature as having had any relevance or impact within the management of the economic crisis. Nor is there any mention that the confidence of the public had been thereby reinforced. The continuing flight of capital out of Argentina would rather point to the contrary.\n\n121.\n\nIn the mid-term congressional elections held on October14, 2001 the ruling coalition obtained less than 25% of the votes; and the opposition Peronist party won control of both Chambers. In the same month the rating agencies downgraded Argentina's debt twice. On October 28, 2001, Minister Cavallo announced that he would seek voluntary restructuring of all government debt, which was in part carried out throughout November 2001.170\n\nThis was carried out by Decree 1387 of November 1, which among various measures to stimulate economic activity and employment and to reduce the cost of the public debt, provided (at Art. 17 ff.) for the voluntary conversion (swap) of instruments of public debt (bonds) for Guaranteed Loans (GGL) and/or Guaranteed Bonds (in which Continental participated). At the end of November 2001, the authorities announced the completion of domestic debt swaps involving $41 millions (face value) of government bonds and $10 billions at the provincial level.\n\n122.\n\nWithdrawal of deposits from the banks developed however at a growing pace and capital flight increased.171 While there had been a sustained inflow of foreign direct investment into Argentina in the years from 1997 to 2000, with a peak in 1999, the flow almost halted in 2001.172 The fall in official reserves continued downwards to a level barely enough to cover domestic currency in circulation.173 In the meantime the dollarization of the economy amplified even more,174 since the public sought refuge in dollar denominated deposits, savings and financial assets. The spread between \"on-shore dollar\" and peso interest rate, which was no more than \u00bd to 2 percentage points on average prior to 2001 jumped to 40 points in the first part of 2001 while the sovereign debt spread skyrocketed.175\n\nAlready in July 2001, US$5 billion, or 7% of the total deposits had flown out from the banks, *Blustein*, 136.\n\nU.S. $ mil 23988 in 1999, 10418 in 2000, 2166 in 2001 (Claimant's doc. C-392).\n\n*Mussa*, 34. Already at the time of the visit to Argentina of U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs to Buenos Aires on August 3, 2001, \"reserves totalled $20.4 billion, down from $28.8 billion at the beginning of July. At that rate of decline, convertibility was facing a serious threat, because the system required an ample cushion of reserves to cover the supply of pesos,\" *Blustein*, 136. \"On November 16, following a steady decline that gained momentum in late October, the reserves dropped at $18.44 billion, almost exactly the same level as immediately before the IMF replenished the central banks reserves with a disbursement of nearly $5 billion in early September. the inescapable conclusion is that most of the depletion could be attributed to the steadily increasing demand for dollars in October and November by people and firms exchanging pesos for greenbacks, many of whom were shipping the money abroad.\" *Ibid*, 171.\n\nThe degree of dollarization (percentage in dollars of the total banks deposits) went up from 64.3% to 73.6% between the end of 2000 and the end of 2001: see data on percentage of Argentine pesos in U.S. dollars, taken from Eduardo Levy Yeyati, *Financial Dollarization: Evaluating the Consequences* (2006) (Claimant's doc. C-382).\n\n*See Lessons from the Crisis*, table at 25.\n\n123.\n\nThe general economic situation deteriorated notwithstanding the IMF's assistance: actual GDP declined 4.5% in 2001 while the IMF program had forecasted an increase;176 unemployment rate grew at 18.3%. By the end of 2001 \"both the economy and the public finances were in deep crisis.\"177 The GDP would have dropped 4.5%; the primary and overall fiscal position ended up 3% weaker than anticipated in September; the debt-to-GDP ratio rose above 60%.178\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, table at 27.\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, 37.\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36-37.\n\n124.\n\nOn November 6, 2001, S&P lowered Argentina's long-term sovereign debt from CC to SD (Selective Default), thereby implying that the Government was already not in the condition to meet some of its financial obligations.179 A growing number of commentators outside Argentina, notably in the international financial press,180 hinted at the impossibility for Argentina to maintain the convertibility regime. At the end of this month the peso started to devalue in the free market of Montevideo. Facing a substantial run on deposits,181 on December 1, 2001 the Government enacted Decree 1570 (*Corralito*), freezing deposits in the banking system (only pesos 250 withdrawals per week were admitted) and prohibiting transfers out of the country.\n\nSee *Hornbeck*, \"November 6: Argentina conducts a second debt swap, exchanging $60 billion of bonds with an average interest rate of 11-12% for extended maturity notes carrying only 7% interest rate. International bond rating agencies considered it an effective default.\" This is the restructuring in which CNA participated exchanging its bonds for GGL.\n\nSee for instance *Krugman*, quoted at footnote 166.\n\nOn November 30 \"A run on the banks begins, with central bank reserves falling by $2 billion in one day,\" *Hornbeck,* CRS-4. According to *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36, \"[t]he crisis broke with a run of private sectors deposits, which fell by more than $3.6 million (6 per cent of the deposit base) during November 28-30.\"\n\n125.\n\nThis was the first of a series of Measures that Argentina took while the crisis was developing, culminating in the devaluation of the peso, the pesification of dollar-denominated assets in Argentina and the default on public debt and its rescheduling, all of which impacted adversely on the Claimant's assets, and which it has challenged as being in breach of the BIT (with the exclusion of the devaluation *per se*).\n\n126.\n\nThe *Corralito* brought about immediate and severe hardship in the general population which relied largely on cash for every day transactions, as is the practice in Argentina's economy. The crisis worsened also in the social and political dimension. On December 13, 2001, the Government announced that the unemployment rate had reached a record level of 18%; trade unions called for nationwide strikes. Supermarket looting began in various locations; and rioting spread to major cities. The Government declared a state of siege; and Minister Cavallo resigned. Finally, on December 20, 2001 President de La R\u00faa \"resigns in the wake of continuous rioting, leaving 28 people dead.\"182\n\nSee *Hornbeck*, CRS-4.\n\n127.\n\nIt is worth here recording the personal accounts of Judge Augusto Belluscio who lived through this turbulent period of Argentina's crisis and appeared as a witness before the Tribunal. Judge Belluscio was and remains one of the most distinguished and respected jurists in Argentina. He was an impressive expert witness at the hearing. As a law professor, he was first appointed a judge in 1965 and served on the Supreme Court of Argentina from 1983 until his retirement in 2005. In early January 2002, Judge Belluscio was on leave; but he was called back to the Supreme Court for urgent judicial meetings in litigation associated with the crisis. It is best to give his account in his own words, as recorded in the hearing's transcript in English translation:\n\nIn the middle of the meeting I received a phone call from the city of Cordoba, where my in-laws lived, to inform me that a horde or a mob had attacked my inlaws' home thinking that I was there. There were shouts, \"The judge should come out, the judge should come out,\" so my father-in-law went out to see what was happening, and they thought I was him [i.e. Judge Belluscio], and they began to throw pieces of stone which didn't hit him, but which did do harm to the facade of the house. He was with - one of his sons was with him, one of my brothers-in-law. My brother-in-law went out. He tried a dialogue with the mob and get them to see that it wasn't the judge who was in the house because evidently they wanted to attack me, and the response was that he was attacked, he was beaten, and he suffered a fracture in one finger. Well, this obviously upset me a great deal [...].183\n\nSee Transcript of the Hearing of December 1, 2006, p. 1082.\n\n128.\n\nIt requires very little imagination to see that if Judge Belluscio had in fact been present at the family home, this incident could have produced much more serious consequences for one of Argentina's most senior judicial figures.\n\n*(ii) The actions undertaken by CNA / Continental as to its investments in 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nContinental and CNA did not stand idle while the crisis unrolled and the likelihood of some kind of exchange and financial restriction increased in the course of 2001. Before addressing the steps undertaken by CNA and Continental, it is useful to describe the activity carried out by CNA and the nature of its investments and other funds that it intended to protect against the associated risks.\n\n130.\n\nAs explained by the Claimant,184 CNA ART, like other insurance companies, maintains a portfolio of invested securities in order to earn a return on its capital, reserves and other funds. CNA has a history of making conservative investments, so that its \"portfolio consists mainly of low-risk assets, such as cash deposits, treasury bills and government bonds.\" These investments derive from its business activity, its capital, reserves and undistributed profits. The proceeds of its insurance business drive from the underwriting of its policies; the clients of CNA are business companies that satisfy their statutory and contractual obligations to cover their employees against worker's risks. CNA's insurance operations are regulated by two Argentine state agencies: the Superintendent of Insurance (SSN), which regulates the financial aspects of the business, while the handling of workers' compensation claims and services (such as medical treatment, etc.) is regulated by the Superintendent of Workers Compensation of the Ministry of Labor (SRT). More specifically, SSN lays down criteria for insurance companies such as CNA concerning the ratio of reserves they have to hold and the types of investment they may make.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para.15 ff.\n\n131.\n\nThe business of CNA was successful. As explained by Claimant, its premiums \"have consistently been among the highest in the market. CNA ART also maintained the highest reserves and investments per insured worker in the market.\"185 Furthermore, \"[p]rior to March 2001, CNA ART's investment portfolio was primarily in assets denominated in Argentinean pesos. At the time, pesos were fully convertible to U.S. dollars at a one to one exchange rate. However, CNA ART's management was concerned about the risk of devaluation. As a result, CNA ART's senior management prepared an analysis of the options available to CNA ART to hedge the risk of devaluation. These options consisted of:\n\ni) maintaining the portfolio in peso denominated assets, which were earning a much higher return than comparable dollar denominated assets;\n\nii) transferring all of CNA ART's assets in excess of minimum capital requirements out of Argentina to be held by CNA; and\n\niii) moving CNA ART's investment portfolio to lower return U.S. dollar assets with greater credit worthiness.\"186\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16, footnote 33.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 19-20.\n\n132.\n\nAs to the option of moving capital out of Argentina, \"CNA ART's management made a recommendation to its American controlling shareholder that it should not transfer assets out of Argentina at that time, but that it should choose to invest assets within Argentina in low risk U.S. dollar denominated assets.\"187 CNA management accepted this recommendation so that its investment agent CADISA (*Citicorp Administradora de Inversiones S.A.*) \"was then instructed to liquidate peso denominated cash deposits, treasury bills and bonds as they matured and to reinvest the proceeds in U.S. dollar denominated assets.\"188 Thus, \"CNA ART's policy of shifting its portfolio to U.S. dollar denominated assets involved a deliberate choice to forego the higher yields of peso-denominated assets in favor of the greater capital security of U.S. dollar assets.\"189 As against capital flight, this was of course a socially responsible policy by Continental and CNA.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 21.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 22. The Claimant explains further that, in addition, CADISA was instructed to move cash deposits out of Argentinian owned banks and into either the local subsidiaries of international banks or, preferably, into full branches of international banks. These steps were meant to improve the credit worthiness of its investment portfolio and to protect it from currency risk and credit risk. Cash deposits at full branch banks earned a lower return than at other banks but there was little credit risk associated with them (Claimant's Memorial, paras. 22-24).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 24.\n\n133.\n\nAs already mentioned, on November 1, 2001, through Decree 1387, Argentina announced an offer to restructure part of its debt by, amongst other things, offering certain bondholders the opportunity to exchange their bonds for Government Guaranteed Loans or \"GGLs\" (*prestamos garantizados*).190\n\nFor details see *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36.\n\n134.\n\nAs explained by the Claimant,191 \"[a]lthough the GGLs had longer maturities and lower interest rates than the Argentine government bonds held by CNA ART, there were a number of advantages associated with entering into a \"swap\" whereby bonds would be exchanged for GGLs. These advantages included the following:\n\ni) the GGLs had lower credit risk as they were secured by revenue from a specific federal tax on financial transactions that was not shared with Argentina's provincial governments;\n\nii) in the event of default by Argentina, unpaid tax obligations could be set off against amounts owing by Argentina for its failure to pay capital and interest on the loans;\n\niii) in the event of default by Argentina, GGL holders could re-swap their GGLs for the original bonds exchanged in the swap;\n\niv) the face value of the GGLs could be used to satisfy minimum capital requirements whereas only the market value could be considered for other securities. This feature would allow CNA ART to liquidate its other securities and use the proceeds elsewhere; and\n\nv) Argentina provided various tax incentives including the ability to write off losses associated with the original bonds, exempting any capital gains from taxes and exempting interest payments on the GGLs from taxes.\"192\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 26 ff.\n\nThis was provided by Decree 1646 of December 12, 2001 (see particualrly Annex II \" *Contrato de prestamo garantizado* \" Claimant's doc. C-19. Witness Statement of Cristian Samitier at para. 22).\n\n135.\n\nCNA decided to take advantage of this offer. \"On November 29, 2001, CNA instructed CADISA to effect the swap of the following Argentine government bonds for GGLs:\n\n**Bond Face Value (U.S.$) Guaranteed Loan**\n\nGlobal 2017 6,240,000 Tasa Fija GLI7\n\nBonte 2 6,317,000 Tasa Fija Bonte 02\n\nBonte 3 7,900,000 Tasa Fija Bonte 03\n\nFRB 11,368,000 Tasa Variable FRB\n\nThe GGLs were denominated in U.S. dollars and their governing law was Argentinean law. This debt swap allowed CNA ART to maintain its portfolio in the same U.S. currency while increasing its legal security.193 By early December 2001, CADISA had largely completed the re-balancing of CNA ART investment portfolio. The investment portfolio at that time included the following assets denominated in U.S. dollars:\n\ni) Argentine Government Guaranteed Loans contracts totaling U.S.$17, 295, 320 at market value. CNA ART held four contracts as follows:194\n\nGuaranteed Loan Contract (GGL) Market Value\n\nGGL Tasa Fija Global 2017 2,966,080\n\nGGL Tasa Fija Bonte 02 4,417,294\n\nGGL Tasa Fija Bonte 03 4,385,322\n\nGGL Tasa Variable FRB 5,526,624\n\nii) Argentine Government Treasury Bills (LETEs) totaling U.S.$2,805,000 at market value. LETEs had much shorter maturities than the GGL contracts.195\n\niii) Term Deposits (\"CDs\") totaling U.S.$ 63,510,278: these deposits were held at a range of full branch international banks and subsidiaries of international banks; and\n\niv) A U.S. dollar cash account at Citibank also used for operational purposes.\"\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, paras. 27-28.\n\nGGL official name in Spanish is \" *Prestamos Garantizados del Gobierno*.\" These GGLs carried an interest rate of approximately 7%, (see Claimant Post-Hearing Brief, 33).\n\nMore specifically CNA bought the first LETEs (Letra del Tesoro 90 Vto 15/03/02, that is Treasury Bills 90 due March 15, 2002) on September 25, 2001 and the second one on October 18, 2001 see Claimant's Memorial, para. 45. LETEs had been issued under Resolution 4/5 of January 2001.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant points out that it thus held a \"conservative portfolio of investments,\" 92% of which was expressed in U.S. dollar-denominated assets.196\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33. In contrast 21% of CNA's portfolio was in dollars in July 2001 (see Claimant's doc. C-24).\n\nc) *The Measures adopted by Argentina during the crisis, specifically those challenged by the Claimant*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nIn view of the distinct nature and effect of the various Measures, as well as their separate impact on the assets of CNA, the different allegations of breach of the BIT that the Claimant raises in respect of each of them and the defense of necessity raised by Argentina, it is useful for the subsequent legal analysis to distinguish the Measures according to their nature, features and effects. To that end, it is necessary to distinguish between:\n\ni) Measures that blocked deposits (temporary bank freeze), severely curtailing the right to withdraw money (namely Decree 1570 of December 1, 2001, *Corralito*);\n\nii) Measures that prohibited the transfer of funds abroad and their exchange in freely convertible and transferable currencies (same Decree 1570);\n\niii) Measures that terminated the peso convertibility and its pegging to the U.S. dollar at the fixed exchange rate 1:1 (Emergency Law 25,561 of January 6, 2002 and Decree 260/02);\n\niv) Measures that rescheduled term deposits and reduced interest rates (Resolution 6 of January 9, \" *Corralon* \");\n\nv) Pesification (that is forced conversion) of outstanding dollar-denominated contracts and private or governmental debt, at a rate of 1.40 peso for each nominal U.S. dollar as to the latter and financial deposits, while in all other cases conversion occurred at par (Decree 214 of February 3, Decree 471 of March 8, Decree 644 of April 18, 2002);\n\nvi) Default on and unilateral rescheduling of governmental debt, made official by Res. 73 of April 25, 2002.\n\n138.\n\nDecree 1570 of December 1, 2001 (*Corralito*), limited by Art. 2(a) cash withdrawals from bank accounts to pesos 250 or U.S.$250 a week. The Decree, which was declared to be \"of public order,\" also prohibited by Art. 2(b) any transfers of funds out of Argentina with the exception of certain current transactions.197 The Decree was presented as a short term \"emergency measure\" until the conversion of the public debt under Decree 1387 would be completed, both in order to avoid any instability in the level of deposits in the financial system \"that could imperil its intangibility recognized by Law 25,466\" (the Intangibility Law), and to react to \"the fall in the total level of bank deposits that has manifested itself since February of the current year.\" In fact, the blocking was still in force when devaluation and pesification intervened.\n\nThe Central Bank (BCRA) was empowered to authorize certain other transactions with the exterior and did so in the following months. From September 2002 onwards, exports of funds under certain ceilings have been gradually admitted (Claimant's Memorial, para. 34).\n\n139.\n\nTransactions between banks were not prevented by the *Corralito*. Moreover, the Central Bank was empowered to issue general and specific derogations; and several were in fact issued both as to cash withdrawals and foreign exchange transactions. A number of derogations concerned commercial transactions, including transfers for insurance companies, in order to allow the carrying on of normal business transactions.198\n\nSee Argentina's doc. RA-117 (see also footnote 223 and 305). Based on the \" *Corralon*,\" by Res. 28, 580 of February 11, 2002 the Superintendent of Insurance (SSN) authorized insurance companies in the workmen's compensation sector to withdraw up to one million pesos monthly from their cash deposits for use in their business operations. (Claimant's Memorial, para. 41, Claimant's doc. C-26). As to derogations from the prohibition of transfers abroad, contrary to Argentina's position, the Claimant considers that the evidence \"demonstrate that the Central Bank did not authorize transfers of any kind between December 1, 2001 and the end of January 2002,\" while thereafter authorizations \"were limited to transfers related to foreign trade or other irrelevant categories,\" Post-Hearing Reply, para. 33.\n\n140.\n\nThe aim of the *Corralito* was to prevent further withdrawals from banks and thus to preserve the stability of the banking system. It was also meant to avoid further runs on the foreign exchange reserves of the Central Bank. This did not prevent Argentina -which had become unable to access international credit markets, especially after the withdrawal of the IMF's support - from announcing on December 7, 2001 that it could not guarantee payment of foreign debt, thereby evidencing Argentina's *de facto* default.199 While the pesos were *de facto* inconvertible and were devaluated on exchange markets outside Argentina, the Ministry of the Economy announced the suspension of all payments on the external debt on December 24, 2001.200\n\nSee *Hornbeck*, 4.\n\nComunicado de Prensa (*see* Argentina's doc. RA 119).\n\n141.\n\nAfter the resignation of President De La R\u00faa on December 20, 2001 and the unsuccessful appointment by Congress of three successive presidents between December 20 and December 30, Senator E. Duhalde was elected President by the Congress to complete the presidential term, and assumed formal power on January 1, 2002. On January 6, 2002, \"Public Emergency and Reform of the Exchange Regime\" Law 25,561 was enacted. The law proclaimed a public emergency in conformity with Art. 76 of the National Constitution \"with respect to social, economic, administrative, financial and exchange matters,\" terminated the peso convertibility system and granted extensive extraordinary powers in the above matters to the Government.201 The application of the Intangibility Law 25,466 was expressly suspended. Articles 617, 619 and 623 of the Civil Code on monetary obligations were expressly maintained in the text of the Convertibility Law but \"with the exceptions and objectives established in the present law.\" Art. 19 of the Law stated: \"[t]he present law is of public order. Nobody can invoke against it irrevocably acquired rights. Any contrary provision to its content is hereby derogated.\"\n\nThose powers were granted until December 10, 2003 but the Law and the emergency regime has been extended several times, last time on December 10, 2007.\n\n142.\n\nThe convertibility regime was initially replaced by a dual exchange system based on an official exchange rate of 1.4 pesos per dollar for public sector and most trade-related transactions; all other transactions would take place at prevailing market rates. Effective February 11, 2002, the dual system was abolished (Decree 260/02). When the market opened for the first time under a unified regime on February 11, 2002, the exchange rate depreciated to 1.8 peso per dollar. The peak devaluation was reached on June 25, 2002 (almost 4 pesos to a dollar). Later, the exchange rate stabilized around three pesos for one U.S. dollar.202\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, 38. See the Table of exchange rates (Claimant's doc. C-52).\n\n143.\n\nThree days after the enactment of the Emergency Law,203 Resolution 6 of January 9, 2002 (\" *Corralon* \") affected all demand term deposits within the banking system, both in pesos and dollars, rescheduling maturity dates and reducing interest rates.204 CNA\u2018s term deposits with various banks were subject to this Measure.\n\nBased on Art. 9 of the Emergency Law, the Government issued on January 24, 2002 a Decree freezing utility tariffs, a Measure which is at issue in several ICSID arbitrations brought against Argentina under various BITs.\n\nAccording to the Claimant \"[p]ursuant to Resolution 6, the maturities of CNA's deposits would be extended to September 23, 2003 and thereafter be paid out in 24 monthly instalments. In addition, the rescheduling also eliminated the interest rates on the deposits and imposed an annual interest rate of 2% to be paid monthly,\" (see Claimant's Memorial, par. 36). This \"freezing\" was eventually lifted in part starting from 2003. As to the authorization to insurance companies to use their liquid funds for business operations, see footnote 198 above.\n\n144.\n\nOn February 3, 2002, Decree 214 provided that \"all obligations to pay money expressed in dollars are hereby converted into pesos at one to one\" (i.e. compulsory pesification). However, whilst this applied to contracts between private persons and to debts owed to financial institutions, dollar deposits within the banking system were converted at the rate of 1.40 peso for each dollar (i.e. \"asymmetric\" pesification), plus the granting of an indexation to compensate for future inflation (\"CER\").205 This concerned also CNA's cash deposits with its banks. The Government intervened massively to support the banks in the asymmetric pesification. This scheme would have brought the banks otherwise to bankruptcy, since they had to \"pay back\" to depositors 1.40 pesos for each dollar, while their credits were converted at 1:1.206\n\nAccording to *Lessons from the Crisis*, 38, \"[t]he measure was intended to protect firms and households with foreign-currency-denominated debt, but it merely shifted the burden of the devaluation to the banking system - and ultimately to the taxpayer as banks would need to be issued compensation bonds.\" See also Mussa, 36: \"[t]he exchange rate for the conversion of dollar-denominated bank deposits, however, set a significantly higher value for such deposits than the market exchange rate applied for the conversion of dollar-denominated bank loans - implying huge capital losses and deep insolvency for Argentine banks.\"\n\nThe Government issued bonds to banks amounting to about 9 billion pesos, contributing to the increase in public debt from 63% of GDP at end-2001 to about 135% at end-2002, *Lessons from the Crisis,* 38. According to *Blustein*, 192, the 1.40 rate was the result of an understanding between the Government and Argentina's business sectors, striking a balance between the latter's interests and the expectations of depositors, \"in order to appease savers.\"\n\n145.\n\nOn March 8, 2002, Decree 471 converted also all U.S.-dollar denominated government debt, \"the law applicable to which is only Argentine law,\" into pesos (pesification) at the above-mentioned rate of 1 U.S. dollar to 1.4 pesos. The U.S. dollar denominated LETEs and GGLs held by CNA were thereby converted into pesos. The pesified instruments were to be indexed at the CER rate and would earn a reduced interest.207 One effect of this pesification at 1:1.40 on financial holdings was that, since the peso value of these holdings had increased by 40%, the balance sheet of CNA showed a capital gain, as was the case of all companies in the same situation. Continental complains that, although \"the value of assets which had been converted was actually less in real U.S. dollars terms,\" this capital gain was taxed at the statutory rate.208\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, para. 44. The Claimant points out that \"Argentina failed to pay even these reduced amounts when the LETE became due. The LETEs matured on March 15, 2002, but CNA ART did not receive payment on that day. The default on these LETEs continues on this day\" (Claimant's Memorial, para. 45).\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, paras. 42-43. Continental submits that: \"[t]his additional tax was caused directly by Argentina's actions and would not have been exigible but for Argentina's actions\" (see particularly Claimant's Memorial, para. 43).\n\n146.\n\nDecree 644 of April 18, 2002 requested the holders of GGLs to accept their conversion in pesos and a reduction in their original security in order to receive payment.209 Holders that did not accept these conditions would receive back the bonds they had handed in for the swap.210 These bonds, being in default, CNA did not accept this option; rather it instructed on May 20, CADISA to continue to hold the GGLs on behalf of CNA.211\n\nThe preamble states i.a. that \"[c]ertain powers were delegated to the Executive Branch by Law N\u00b0 25,561, among other things to proceed to reorganize the financial, bank and foreign exchange system to create the conditions towards a sustainable economic growth compatible with the restructuring of the obligation in the course of execution, affected by the new foreign exchange system in place\" (English translation supplied by Claimant, Claimant's doc. C-31). Law 25,570 of February 27, 2002 had reorganized the financial relations between the Government and the Provinces, by agreement between them, thus eliminating according to the Claimant the guarantee for the payment of the GGLs consisting of certain fiscal revenues from the \"financial transaction tax\" (Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35).\n\nThis choice was provided under the original terms of the GGLs in case of default.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 46.\n\n147.\n\nOn April 25, 2002, Resolution 73 made the default of Argentina on its public debt (with some exceptions) official, in that payment of the public debt of the national government was thereby deferred to December 31, 2002 \"or until financing thereof has been completed if the latter is completed before that date.\"212 Although GGLs were not subject to the deferral, interest payments due in April, May, June and July 2002 were only made on August 8, 2002.213\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 51, Claimant's doc. C-32.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 53.\n\n*B. Subsequent measures by Argentina in 2002-2003 relevant to the present dispute*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nStarting in the spring of 2002 the Government enacted various Measures aimed at reestablishing normal conditions in the financial market. None of these Measures reinstated the \"status quo ante,\" whilst nonetheless mitigating in some cases losses for those concerned and representing some steps toward the reinstatement of an orderly economic, monetary and financial situation on a new basis. These Measures failed to give any sufficient satisfaction to CNA or Continental; on the contrary, certain of these Measures are challenged by the Claimant as having caused further damage to its subsidiary in breach of the BIT.\n\n149.\n\nDecree 905 of May 31, 2002 offered dollar denominated bonds (BODEN 2012) in exchange for the term deposit dollars that had been pesified by Decree 214. It also provided a choice as to the receipt of BODEN 2012214 for depositors in financial institutions in distress, such as Scotiabank where CNA held term deposits. CNA opted for converting these deposits into U.S.$ 4,470,900 worth of BODEN 2012.215\n\nBODEN 2012 stands for \" *Bonos de Gobierno Nacional en Dollares Estadounitenses Libor 2012*.\"\n\nSee Claimant's Memorial, para. 53. At the same time the Claimant explains that it refused the opportunities offered to depositors to access their deposits under Decrees 905 of May 31, 2002 and Decree 1836 of September 16, 2002, since this entailed in exchange to accept \"unreasonably long-term bonds\" (Claimant's Memorial, para. 55).\n\n150.\n\nCNA accepted instead \"under protest\" the terms of Decree 739 of March 28, 2003 that provided for an elaborate scheme of \"partial thawing\" of the bank freeze, after a further rescheduling of 120 days, earning 2% interest, and the distribution of a BODEN 2013 \"to compensate for the difference between the market exchange rate at the date of the enactment of the Decree and the government imposed rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar adjusted by CER.\"216 Continental complains that these bonds were not issued on the due dates and that payments of the initial interest were delayed. It was only on February 11, 2004 that \"the government issued BODENs for deposits at ten of the twelve banks at which CNA had originally held its certificated of deposits\" and paid interest in arrears.217\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 58.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 64.\n\n151.\n\nAs to the LETEs, Argentina offered to restructure them through Decree 1735/04 in December 2004 by offering a swap of these securities, as well as of several others also in default, against newly issued securities, specifically GDP-linked derivative instruments.218 CNA did not accept this conversion, since it would have received in exchange \"only U.S.$ 0.30 per dollar and would have been required to waive its rights\" and to accept long maturities on bonds from a Government \"that had demonstrated its willingness to repeatedly default on its debt.\"219\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 717, 414; *see* Claimant's Reply, para. 78.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 78. Argentina indicates that 76.15 % of the holders of eligible securities took part to the swap (Counter Memorial, par. 415). According to Claimant (Claimant's Reply, para. 386) it has suffered as to LETEs losses of US$0.7 million due to pesification and of US$2.8 million \"due to the further default and revocation of contractual rights.\"\n\n*C. Relevant economic, financial and political developments in Argentina after the crisis*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nAs mentioned above,220 the social and economic crisis reached its apogee in the second half of 2002, when more than half of the population where forced to live below the poverty line. The situation improved slowly but progressively from the end of that year onwards. Even two years later, in 2004, per capita GDP, adjusted for inflation, remained about 13% below the 1998 level; and in dollar terms it was equivalent to minus 55%.221\n\nSee above para. 107.\n\nSee *Blustein*, 204.\n\n153.\n\nIt is worth noting that ultimately the crisis did not affect the functioning of the democratic constitutional order of Argentina beyond emergency measures enacted on the basis of the Constitution. Civil liberties were not restricted, nor constitutional guarantees suspended.222 This is apparent now; but it certainly could not be assumed in late 2001 and 2002.\n\nNotwithstanding its political and public order consequences, the emergency situation proclaimed in Law 25,561 was limited to \"social, economic, administrative and financial matters.\"\n\n154.\n\nOn the other hand, while the crisis affected heavily the financial sector, inflicting losses on depositors and effecting radical changes to binding contractual relations resulting from devaluation, pesification, defaults and restructuring, it is also worth noting that business activity went on without interference from the State, and that it progressively adjusted to the new conditions, including import-export operations. Major bankruptcies that had characterized previous economic crises in Argentina, notably those affecting banks, did not take place after the Government supported the financial system in the asymmetric pesification.\n\n155.\n\nThe above finding holds true for the insurance business and specifically for CNA.223 CNA's Annual Report as to June 30, 2003224 states:\n\nCNA ART has come out very reinforced both economically and financially from the severe economic crisis that the country has suffered during the last years. CNA ART enjoys a very solvable economic situation and a very comfortable financial situation, with an extraordinary degree of liquidity. CNA ART has an average investment of almost P. 850 for each insured. This amount is almost four times the average for the other insurers of workmen risks. Moreover only 30% of CNA ART investments are represented by public debt instruments, while the market average as to this indicator amounts to almost 50% of the investment papers. As to the average level of reserves per insured, CNA ART has about P. 270 that is more than the double than the other companies in the market. The net assets of the Company at the closing of the financial amounts to P. 106,004,253, so as to allow the company to present a substantial excess (superavit) in respect to the minimum capital, which amounts at said date to 102,626,233, after having the company obtained during the business year an after taxes profit of P. 39,531,719. The level of investments of the Company at the closing of the financial year amounts to P. 195,602,044. The level of reserves and of technical commitments amounts to P.62.283.313.\n\nOn the basis of the authorization for withdrawals by insurance companies (Res. 28,580 of February 11, 2002), from April 2002 to March 2003 \"CNA was able to withdraw 10.5 million pesos in total from funds that were originally held by CNA ART in dollar-denominated CDs\" (Claimant's Memorial, para. 41).\n\nCNA ART Financial Statement, June 30, 2003, at pages 2212-2213 (English translation by the Tribunal). As to the evolution of CNA's earnings through the crisis see also footnote 393.\n\n156.\n\nTowards the end of 2002, Argentina also fell in arrears with its obligations owed to multilateral financial institutions. Notwithstanding the criticism previously addressed by the IMF to Argentina after the collapse of the Stand-By, in mid-January 2003 the IMF resumed its assistance and announced an interim Stand-By Arrangement. The Fund rolled over obligations due to it and provided liquidity so as to permit Argentina to pay arrears due to the World Bank and the Inter-American Bank and to service debt becoming due in the next months.225\n\nIn January 2002 the IMF had granted a one-year extension of US$936 million repayment obligation of Argentina to avoid it falling into arrears with the Fund. While Argentina had initially continued to service its debt to other multilateral agencies, this changed in November 2002 when it fell in arrears with the World Bank and the IDB (*Hornbeck*, 5). According to **Scott**, 577, the Government explained that it could not service such a large amount due until it had IMF help, which was received in mid-January 2003 when the IMF announced the interim Stand-By Arrangement for Argentina shortly before the elections (**Scott**, 577). The Fund justified its decision of January 24, 2003 on the ground that \"an extension can be granted if repayment would cause undue hardship and provided borrower is taking actions to strengthen its balance of payment\".\n\n157.\n\nThe regular functioning of the democratic institutions was reestablished with the general elections held on May 25, 2003 when Nestor Kirchner was duly elected president of Argentina. The country's economy recovered progressively from the crisis from about the end of 2002 onwards. GNP grew by more than 8% in 2003, compared to 2002. Fears of resurgent inflation did not materialize: consumer prices rose less than 4% in 2003 compared with a 40% increase in the previous year. The peso improved against the dollar from 3.36 at the end of 2002 to less than 3 pesos per dollar at the end of 2003; and it has remained relatively stable against the U.S. dollar since.\n\n158.\n\nThe turn-around and the subsequent recovery of Argentina's economy, its public finances and its balance-of-payments (leading to a robust rebuilding of its foreign exchange reserves starting from 2003) have been attributed to a mix of endogenous and exogenous factors. In variable proportions different observers have pointed to the effect of Argentina's own policies and measures (including the unilateral reduction of domestic and external debt by 70% as to some securities226), and external causes, such as the strength of world commodity markets and the increase of prices for Argentina's main exports (grain and soybeans), coupled with the effect of the 70% devaluation of the peso, rendering Argentina's economy more competitive.227\n\nAt the end of 2003 of a total gross debt of US $ 178 billion, 101 billion were in default.\n\nWhile Argentina considers that its various Measures were instrumental in its recovery, the Claimant's view is that recovery occurred \"in spite of, rather than as a result of, Argentina's measures,\" Post Hearing Brief, para. 75. The contrast of views is apparent also among qualified economists. Thus *Lesson of the Crisis*, 38, considers that many of the initial measures of the Government \"not only failed to stabilize the situation but complicated any eventual resolution of the crisis,\" and considers the \"asymmetric pesoization\" as \"especially damaging.\" On the other hand *Calomiris*, 2, is of the view that \"the decision to redominate debts, and other dollar-denominated or dollar-indexed contracts, during the devaluation of the peso at the beginning of 2002, was successful in reversing the downward trend in economic activity.\" The paper by Prof. Calomiris was handed out to the parties at the first day of the hearing in the merits and discussed at the second day of the hearing in the merits (see Transcript of the Hearing of November 28, 2006, at p. 406).\n\n159.\n\nIn May 2004, Argentina made an offer to its foreign bondholders to pay about 25 cents to the dollar on such debt, leading to partial acceptance (but leading also to international litigation by creditors not accepting the offer). The settlement of the swap operation of bonds in default, both domestic and issued abroad was completed in June 2005, with a participation of about 75% of the bondholders, notwithstanding the fact that the new instruments offered in exchange were worth only about 30% of the original securities in dollar terms.228 In September 2004 Argentina re-entered the international financial market by filing a prospectus concerning the future issuance of debt securities up to more than U.S.$12 billion.229 By February 2005 Argentina had completed its various restructuring procedures.230 Finally, the improved balance of payment situation enabled Argentina to repay in a short time-span all of the sizeable amounts outstanding to the IMF, in 2005 (SDR 2,417 billion) and January 2006 (SDR 6,655 billion).231\n\nCf. Argentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 414-419; see Claimant's Reply, para. 78. Argentina underlines the complexity of the restructuring of its defaulted debt comprising 152 government securities, involving many jurisdictions, various currencies \"in the hands of institutional creditors and hundreds of thousands of individual creditors, both local and international.\" (Argentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 419.7). This could be viewed as the natural consequence of Argentina having tapped a variety of sources of credit to finance itself in previous years.\n\nSee Claimant's doc. C-89.\n\nCNA's Annual Report as of March 31, 2005 states that Argentina had ceased to be in default on its debt after the completion of the restructuring of its bonds on February 25, 2005 (Claimant's doc. C-91, at p. 12).\n\nThis has been contrasted with the fact that the swap finally offered to foreign bondholders entailed a \"haircut,\" that is a reduction of the face value of their bonds, of about 70%, if not more.\n\n**VI. Necessity: Argentina's Defence based on Article XI of the BIT and on State of Necessity under International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nWhile Argentina denies primarily having committed any breach of the BIT through its various Measures challenged by the Claimant, Argentina also relies subsidiarily on two defenses of a general character that would in its view render in any event its action entirely lawful. The first such defense is based on Art. XI of the BIT;232 and the second on the doctrine of \"state of necessity\" in customary international law (as codified by the ILC), \"as an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility.\"233\n\nArt. XI states that: \"[t]is Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or the restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 817.\n\n161.\n\nThe pervasive nature of these general exceptions, which Argentina raises against all claims of Continental, might be such as to absolve Argentina, in whole or in part, from the alleged breaches and from the ensuing responsibility to pay damages. This causes the Tribunal to deal first with these general exceptions rather than starting by examining the individual claims of breach of specific articles of the BIT submitted by the Claimant.\n\n*A. Differences between the two Defences*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with the arguments based on Art. XI first, both because Argentina raises it as its first defense, and also because the application of Art. XI in the present case (if warranted) may be such as to render superfluous a detailed examination of the defense of necessity under general international law applied to the particular facts of the present dispute. This is also true with regard to Argentina's defense based on Art. IV(3) and its relevancy as to the claims submitted by Continental.\n\n163.\n\nMoreover, the content of the two defenses is different. Under Art. XI the obligations that either Party have undertaken under the Treaty as to the treatment of investments and investors of the other Party \"shall not preclude\" the application of \"measures necessary\" for the pursuit of three types of national interest listed therein, namely for:\n\na. the maintenance of public order;\n\nb. the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security;234\n\nc. the protection of its own essential security interests.\n\nAccording to the Protocol to the BIT \"[t]he Parties understand that, with respect to rights reserved in Art. XI\" this refers to obligations under the UN Charter. This item is thus irrelevant in the context of the present arbitration.\n\n164.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the language used, together with the object and purpose of the provision (as here highlighted and interpreted under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties) clearly indicates that either party would not be in breach of its BIT obligations if any measure has been properly taken because it was necessary, as far as relevant here, either \"for the maintenance of the public order\" or for \"the protection of essential security interests\" of the party adopting such measures. The consequence would be that, under Art. XI, such measures would lie outside the scope of the Treaty so that the party taking it would not be in breach of the relevant BIT provision. A private investor of the other party could therefore not succeed in its claim for responsibility and damages in such an instance, because the respondent party would not have acted against its BIT obligations since these would not be applicable, provided of course that the conditions for the application of Art. XI are met.235 In other words, Art. XI restricts or derogates from the substantial obligations undertaken by the parties to the BIT in so far as the conditions of its invocation are met.236 In fact, Art. XI has been defined as a safeguard clause; it has been said that it recognizes \"reserved rights,\" or that it contemplates \"non-precluded\" measures to which a contracting state party can resort.237\n\nAs Argentina puts it (Argentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 744) \"[t]herefore, this type of measures could never amount to a violation of the BIT or give rise to international responsibility.\"\n\nThis Tribunal is thus minded to accept the position of the *Ad Hoc* Annulment Committee in the ICSID case *CMS v. Argentina*, where it states: \"Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations\" (*CMS Annulment Decision*, para. 129). On the one hand, if Art. XI is applicable because the measure at issue was necessary in order to safeguard essential security interest, then the treaty is inapplicable to such measure. On the other hand, if a State is forced by necessity to resort to a measure in breach of an international obligation but complying with the requirements listed in Art. 25 ILC, the State escapes from the responsibility that would otherwise derive from that breach.\n\nSee *Vandevelde*, 220.\n\n165.\n\nArt. 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, assuming it to be reflective of customary international law,238 envisages and regulates a different situation:239\n\nArt. 25: 1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b). does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Art. 25 codifies customary international law in the matter. In fact the ICJ has acknowledged that \"the state of necessity is a ground recognized by customary international law, for precluding the wrongfulness of a fact not in conformity with an international obligation,\" ICJ, *Gabc\u00eckovo-Nagymaros Project*, para. 51. However, the ILC text is not a provision of a multilateral treaty, agreed by signatories States in its exact formulation but a work of codification, having the nature of a restatement. Thus the ILC articles should not be considered per se as a source of international law. The General Assembly of the United Nations, in taking note of the Articles presented to it by the ILC, \"commends them to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate actions\" (Resolution 56/83 of December 12, 2001, the annex to which contains the text of the ILC articles). See also *Sempra* Award, 344.\n\nSee *CMS Annulment Decision*, para. 130.\n\n166.\n\nNecessity is there taken into account as a \"ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation,\" under certain strict conditions. \"The cases show that necessity has been invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of acts contrary to a broad range of obligations, whether customary or conventional in origin. It has been invoked to protect a wide variety of interests, including safeguarding the environment, preserving the very existence of the State and its people in time of public emergency, or ensuring the safety of a civilian population.\"240\n\nThus an act otherwise in breach of an international obligation (\"not in conformity\" with it) is not considered wrongful, and does not therefore entail the secondary obligations attached to an illicit act, thank to the \"exceptional\" presence of one of the conditions that under international law preclude wrongfulness, here necessity.241\n\nILC Commentary to Art. 25, para. 14.\n\nSee Crawford, Special Rapporteur of the ILC, Second Report on State Responsibility, U.N.A.G., ILC, 51st Session, Geneva July 23, 1999, A/CN.4/498/Add. 2, 27-28 \"when a State invokes the state of necessity, it has full knowledge of the fact that it deliberately chooses a procedure that does not abide an international obligation.\" This is an argument that would not be applicable to the invocation of Art. XI.\n\n167.\n\nIn view of these differences between the situation regulated under Art. 25 ILC Articles and that addressed by Art. XI of the BIT, the conditions of application are not the same.242 The strict conditions to which the ILC text subjects the invocation of the defence of necessity by a State is explained by the fact that it can be invoked in any context against any international obligation.243 Therefore \"it can only be accepted on an exceptional basis.\"244 This is not necessarily the case under Art. XI according to its language and purpose under the BIT. This leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that invocation of Art. XI under this BIT, as a specific provision limiting the general investment protection obligations (of a \"primary\" nature) bilaterally agreed by the Contracting Parties, is not necessarily subject to the same conditions of application as the plea of necessity under general international law...245\n\nThe Tribunal accepts in this respect the *CMS Annulment Decision*, paras. 129-134. We do not share the different position apparently taken by the *Ad Hoc* Annulment Committee in the ICSID case *Mitchell v. Congo*. In that Committee's view, the identical clause in Art. X(1) of the US - Congo BIT \"is a provision relating to the causes for exemption from liability or, in other words, a provision that precludes the wrongfulness of the behaviour of the State in certain exceptional circumstances, and not a provision that delimits that scope of application of the Treaty\" (*Mitchell Annulment Decision*, para. 55).\n\nExcept those \"arising under a peremptory norm of general international law,\" as stated in Art 26 ILC Articles.\n\nSee ICJ, *Gabc\u00eckovo-Nagymaros Project*, para. 51. The ILC Commentary to Art. 25, para. 14, notes \"to emphasize the exceptional nature of necessity and concerns about its possible abuse article 25 is cast in negative language.\"\n\nSee ILC Commentary to Art. 25, par. 21: \"[a]s embodied in Art. 25, the plea of necessity is not intended to cover conduct which is in principle regulated by the primary obligations.\"\n\n168.\n\nThere is a link, however, between the two types of regulation. First of all, they both intend to provide flexibility in the application of international obligations, recognizing that necessity to protect national interests of a paramount importance may justify setting aside or suspending an obligation, or preventing liability from its breach. Moreover, the practical result of applying the carve-out of Art. XI, rather than the defense of necessity, may be the same: condoning conduct that would otherwise be unlawful and thus removing the responsibility of the State. This would also be so if Art. XI is viewed as a specific bilateral regulation of necessity for purposes of the BIT (thus a kind of *lex specialis*), pre-empting recourse to the more restrictive customary exception of necessity.246 These connections may be relevant as to the interpretation of the bilateral provision in Art XI, in that the customary concept of necessity may be relevant in this respect. The Tribunal will therefore focus on the analysis of Art. XI and the conditions of its application, referring to the customary rule on State of Necessity (as enshrined in Art. 25 of the ILC test) only insofar as the concept there used assist in the interpretation of Art. XI itself.247\n\nThis view is consistent with that expressed by the *CMS Annulment Decision*, para. 133.\n\nSince we are not applying here the customary principle of necessity, we do not have to, nor do we express any view as to whether the necessity invoked by Argentina in respect of the Measures at issue (except as to the restructuring of the LETEs. see paras. 221-222) would also qualify under Art. 25 ILC.\n\n169.\n\nAs to Art. XI, the Parties have expressed different views as to various fundamental elements relating to its application:\n\na. Whether the economic political and social crisis, with its specific aspects, in Argentina during 2001-2002 qualify under Art. XI in that they involved the \"maintenance of public order\" and/or the protection of Argentina's \"essential security interests;\"\n\nb. Whether the invocation of Art. XI is \"self-judging,\" in the sense that the Party relying on it has absolute discretion to invoke it;\n\nc. Whether the Measures challenged were \"necessary\" in order to maintain the Argentine public order and protect the essential security interests of Argentina that were at stake;\n\nd. The effect of the application of Art. XI to the evaluation by the Tribunal of the lawfulness under the BIT of Argentina's Measures challenged by Claimant.\n\n*B. Whether Argentina's crisis in 2001-2002 qualifies under Article XI in that it involved the \"maintenance of public order\" and/or the protection of Argentina\u2019s \"essential security interests\"*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the crisis that Argentina encountered in 2001-2002 does not qualify under Art. XI, first of all because \"the ordinary meaning of \u2018security' is safety from external threats.\"248 The Claimant considers the adjective \"essential\" as meaning nothing less than indispensable, and it concludes \"[t]he essential security interest of a country are, therefore, interest indispensable to keeping the country safe from external threats.\"249 Argentina was obviously never exposed to such an external threat, nor did Argentina ever suggest it in these proceedings.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 326.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 327\n\n171.\n\nAs to \"public order,\" the Claimant submits that it is the equivalent of the French term \" *ordre public* \" \"which is the civil law equivalent of the common law concept of \u2018public policy'.\" The Claimant further submits that this is a \"special meaning\" of the term public order250 that refers, more narrowly, \"to measures necessary to maintain the public policies, laws and morals that define the country's society.\"251 The Claimant concludes that the Measures it has challenged were obviously not aimed at protecting these values, which were not threatened by Argentina's crisis.\n\nIn the sense of Art. 31 (4) VCLT, which directs the interpreter to give effect to such special meaning if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 338.\n\n172.\n\nIn contrast, Argentina contends that under Art. XI \"the measures necessary for the maintenance of public order... include the measures aimed at ensuring internal security in the face of events such as violent internal upheavals, disturbances, looting and crimes, extended social tension, or the likelihood of the fundamental order falling apart and the government loosing actual control over the territory of the State.\" Argentina submits that was exactly the situation prevailing in Argentina when the Measures challenged by the Claimant were adopted so that this situation \"constitutes a national emergency sufficient to invoke the protections of Art. XI.\"252\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 745.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus confronted by a narrow interpretation by the Claimant and a broader definition by Argentina of the terms \"public order\" and \"essential security interests.\" The Tribunal's view is that the interpretation submitted by the Claimant is far too narrow and that the emergency situation at issue qualifies in general under Art. XI for the following reasons.\n\n174.\n\nThe interpretation offered by the Claimant would in substance exclude an economic crisis, however serious, from the application of Art. XI. As indicated above, it submits that \"public order\" relates to fundamental societal value, such as morality, while security interest refers to the international security of the State in relation of external threats. The expression \"maintenance of public order\" indicates however rather clearly that \"public order\" is intended as a broad synonym for \"public peace,\" which can be threatened by actual or potential insurrections, riots and violent disturbances of the peace.\n\nThis is the ordinary and principal meaning of *\"orden p\u00fablico\"* in the Spanish text of the BIT, corresponding to the same meaning in the French legal concept of \" *ordre public* \" in public and criminal law. Thus, in the Tribunal's view, actions properly necessary by the central government to preserve or to restore civil peace and the normal life of society (especially of a democratic society such that of Argentina), to prevent and repress illegal actions and disturbances that may infringe such civil peace and potentially threaten the legal order, even when due to significant economic and social difficulties, and therefore to cope with and aim at removing these difficulties, do fall within the application under Art. XI.\n\n175.\n\nAs to \"essential security interests,\" it is necessary to recall that international law is not blind to the requirement that States should be able to exercise their sovereignty in the interest of their population free from internal as well as external threats to their security and the maintenance of a peaceful domestic order. It is well known that the concept of international security of States in the Post World War II international order was intended to cover not only political and military security but also the economic security of States and of their population.253 The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations254 and, even more relevant for the present case, that of the International Monetary Fund support this approach.255 As noted by the International Law Commission, States have invoked necessity \"to protect a wide variety of interests, including safeguarding the environment, preserving the very existence of the State and its people in time of public emergency, or ensuring the safety of a civilian population.\"256\n\nSee the famous speech of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt of January 11, 1944, pointing out that a just and durable system of international peace requires freedom from fear, from hunger and from want, and \"a decent standard of living for all individual men and women and children in all nations.\"\n\nSee UN Charter Art. 1 (3) that includes amongst the purposes of UN \"to achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character (...).\" Moreover see UN Charter Art. 55 \"[w]ith a view to the creation of conditions of stability and well-being which are necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, the United Nations shall promote: a. higher standards of living, full employment, and conditions of economic and social progress and development; (...).\"\n\nSee Art. 1 (ii) Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund which includes amongst the purposes of the IMF \"to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy.\"\n\nSee ILC, Commentary, at Art. 25, para. 14.\n\n176.\n\nIt has been submitted in this case that since Art. XI derives from the Model BIT of the U.S., which in turn derives from the United States' Friendship Commerce and Navigation (FCN) standard treaties, special attention should be addressed to this historical context in interpreting the expressions found in Art. XI and its object and purpose in general. This appears to be correct; and the Tribunal will therefore assume that the interpretation based on those antecedents conforming to the plain texts, and the legislative history of the Model BIT was well known and taken into account when the parties concluded this BIT.\n\n177.\n\nIn this respect the Tribunal notes that the Parties' inquiries into the origin of these antecedent texts do not support the restrictive view advanced by the Claimant. An authoritative commentary, whose distinguished author was involved in the drafting of the U.S. BITs for many years, takes the following view:257\n\nUnited States treaty practice since the Second World War has acknowledged that the interest in protecting United States investment overseas may be subordinate to certain other national interests, primarily the interest in protecting the national security and the health, safety and welfare of the people. Investment-related treaties thus have had provisions which permit the United States to deny protection to foreign investment in its territory where necessary to these other interests. The price paid by the United States for reserving the right to derogate from investment-related treaties on these grounds has been the recognition of a corresponding right in its treaty partners.258\n\nSee *Vandelvelde*, 222. During the period 1982 to 1988 the author served as an attorney-adviser in the Office of the Legal Adviser of the US Department of State in charge of BIT negotiations. Prof. Vandevelde supplied an expert opinion in the present dispute on behalf of the Claimant and rendered oral testimony (subject to cross-examination) before the Tribunal.\n\nSee also ibid at 223 as to the \"reservations of rights involved in the clause\": \"United States negotiators sought to draft BITs which provided rigorous protection for investors. At the same time, the practical reality is that the United States increasingly has relied upon various forms of economic sanctions to effect other foreign policy goals. The inclusion of a non-precluded measures provision preserved the flexibility to use economic sanctions . At the same time, however, it provided a textual justification for actions by BIT partners against United States investors in violation of BIT provisions \" (emphasis added).\n\n178.\n\nA severe economic crisis may thus qualify under Art. XI as affecting an essential security interest, in the broad sense described by the Tribunal above. The Tribunal is comforted in this approach by previous ICSID awards in other arbitrations brought against Argentina (although perhaps their discussion of the issue does not as clearly distinguish between the requirements of Art. XI and Art. 25 of the ILC text). Those ICSID tribunals have recognized, in general terms, that \"there is nothing in the context of customary international law or the object and purpose of the treaty that could on its own exclude major economic crises from the scope of Art. XI,\"259 even if they have taken a different evaluation *in concreto* as to the gravity of the Argentine economic crisis.\n\nSee *CMS* Award, para. 359. See also *LG&E* Award, para. 238; *Enron* Award, para. 332. See also ILA, Resolution on International Monetary Law, Report of the Warsaw Conference 1988, 20-22, dealing with the inability of a State debtor to pay a foreign debt that \"will normally have to be considered under the rule of necessity\": \"It would appear that the organization of domestic peace, the provision for external security, the maintenance of services essential for the well-being of the population and the preservation of the environment are essential interests. \"\n\n179.\n\nThe review carried out above of basic features of the crisis which Argentina faced in the latter part of 2001, and which continued into 2002, causes the Tribunal to decide that such a crisis is covered by the application of Art. XI. Measures that would have been otherwise in breach of the Treaty could be lawfully implemented by Argentina in that crisis, provided that all other requirements are respected, first of all that of actual \"necessity.\"\n\n180.\n\nIt is impossible to deny, in the Tribunal's view, that a crisis that brought about the sudden and chaotic abandonment of the cardinal tenet of the country's economic life, such as the fixed convertibility rate which had been steadfastly recommended and supported for more than a decade by the IMF and the international community; the nearcollapse of the domestic economy; the soaring inflation; the leap in unemployment; the social hardships bringing down more than half of the population below the poverty line; the immediate threats to the health of young children, the sick and the most vulnerable members of the population, the widespread unrest and disorders; the real risk of insurrection and extreme political disturbances, the abrupt resignations of successive Presidents260 and the collapse of the Government, together with a partial breakdown of the political institutions and an extended vacuum of power; the resort to emergency legislation granting extraordinary legislative powers to the executive branch, that all of this, taken together, does not qualify as a situation where the maintenance of public order and the protection of essential security interest of Argentina as a state and as a country was vitally at stake.261 The fact that Argentina's Congress declared a \"public emergency\" in economic, financial, exchange, social and administrative matters in conformity with Art. 76 of its Constitution, and enacted a specific \"Public Emergency Law\" to cope with the crisis,262 is powerful evidence of its gravity such as that could not be addressed by ordinary measures.263 The protection of essential security interests recognized by Art. XI does not require that \"total collapse\" of the country or that a \"catastrophic situation\" has already occurred before responsible national authorities may have recourse to its protection.264 The invocation of the clause does not require that the situation has already degenerated into one that calls for the suspension of constitutional guarantees and fundamental liberties.265 There is no point in having such protection if there is nothing left to protect.\n\n*Blustein*, 1, notes the \"tragic spectacle of a succession of five presidents taking office over a mere ten days.\"\n\nSee *LG&E* Decision on Liability, para. 257: \"[t]he essential interests of the Argentine State were threatened in December 2001. It faced an extremely serious threat to its existence, its political and economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in operation and to the preservation of its internal peace.\"\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 799 ff.\n\nIn this context, it should not be forgotten that democracy and the rule of law had been re-established in Argentina only twenty years before after the fall of a brutal military dictatorship which had lasted for more than a decade.\n\nIn this respect this Tribunal takes a different view than that expressed in the *CMS* Award, para. 354. We note that Art. 25 of the ILC Articles, which is more restrictive than Art. XI, admits recourse to necessity at para. 1(a) \"to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.\" See also ILC, Report on the 32\u00b0 Session, Commentary on draft Art. 33 (State of Necessity), R. Ago, Special Rapporteur, ILC Yearbook 1980, II, (1980), para. 12: \"[t]he extent to which a given interest is \"essential\" naturally depends on all the circumstances in which the State is placed in different specific situations; the extent must therefore be judged in the light of the particular case into which the interests enters, rather than be predetermined in the abstract.\"\n\nNotwithstanding its political and public order effects, the emergency situation proclaimed in Law 25,561 was limited to \"social, economic, administrative and financial matter.\"\n\n181.\n\nIt may well be that in drafting the model text for Art. XI, the U.S. intended to protect first of all its own security interests in the light of geopolitical, strategic and defense concerns, typical of a world power, so as to be able to reserve the right to freeze assets of foreigners in the U.S. and to resort to unilateral economic sanctions that may conflict with its BIT obligations. This intention would not exclude from the protection provided by Art. XI different measures taken by the other Contracting Party in relation to emergency situations affecting essential security interests of a different nature of such other Contracting Party.266 These interests such as \"ensuring internal security in the face of a severe economic crisis with social, political and public order implications\"267 may well raise for such a party, notably for a developing country like Argentina,268 issues of public order and essential security interest objectively capable of being covered under Art. XI.269 An interpretation of a bilateral reciprocal treaty that accommodates the different interests and concerns of the parties in conformity with its terms accords with an effective interpretation of the treaty. Moreover, in the Tribunal's view, this objective assessment must contain a significant margin of appreciation for the State applying the particular measure: a time of grave crisis is not the time for nice judgments, particularly when examined by others with the disadvantage of hindsight.270\n\nEven if invocation of Art. XI is not self-judging so that the propriety of its invocation is not carved out from the competence of an arbitral tribunal established under Art. VII, the expression \"its own security interests\" implies that a margin of appreciation must be afforded to the Party that claims in good faith that the interests addressed by the measure are essential security interests or that its public order is at stake.\n\nSee Argentina's Counter Memorial, para. 745.\n\nThe U.S. policy is to enter into BITs only with developing countries, see *Vandevelde*, 21.\n\nSee Iran-US Claims Tribunal, *Sea-Land Service, Inc.*, at page 11 (Argentina's doc. AL-100) with reference to measures taken in time of civil unrest: \"it is well recognized that, in comparable situations of crisis, governmental authorities are entitled to have recourse to very broad powers without incurring international responsibility.\"\n\nArgentina (Counter-Memorial, para. 497) points to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in this respect: \"because of their direct knowledge of their society and of its needs, the national authorities are in principle better placed than the international judge to appreciate what is \u2018in the public interest..'. the national authorities, accordingly, enjoy a certain margin of appreciation\" (ECHR, *Jahn and others v. Germany,* June 30, 2005). A certain deference to such a discretion when the application of general standards in a specific factual situation is at issue, such as reasonable, necessary, fair and equitable, may well be by now a general feature of international law also in respect of the protection of foreign investors under BITs, see Yuval Shany, *Towards a General Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in International Law?*,16 EJIL, 907-940 (2005).\n\n*C. Whether the Invocation of Article XI is \"self-judging\"*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nHaving concluded that the crisis of Argentina (in the context of which the Measures challenged by the Claimant were adopted) qualifies under Art. XI, the Tribunal is still faced with the conflicting position of the Parties as to the alleged self-judging nature of the provision. If Art. XI granted unfettered discretion to a party to invoke it, in good faith, in order to exempt a particular measure which the investor claims has breached its treaty rights from any scrutiny by a tribunal, then that tribunal would be prevented from entering further into the merits, after having recognized that an economic crisis such as the one experienced by Argentina in 2001-2002 qualified under Art. XI.\n\n183.\n\nArgentina claims that \"[t]he Argentine Republic's bona fides invocation of Art. XI of the BIT should be sufficient for the Tribunal to dismiss the claim made by the Claimant under such BIT, as both parties to the Treaty accorded that each State had the exclusive right to decide whether its own measures were covered by such Article.271 The United States stated its position expressly, and the Argentine Republic gave its consent to such statements.\"272\n\nArgentina suggests that, even if the application of Art. XI is self-judging, a tribunal would be empowered to check that recourse to the exception was made in good faith and claims that it is self evident that in the present case the measures were adopted in good faith. As a result, the control by a tribunal would be substantially more limited than if the provision is found not to be self-judging.\n\nSee Argentina's Counter Memorial, para. 743. Besides relying on the position allegedly taken by the U.S., which we discuss below, Argentina also relies on a statement by the PCIJ, *The Wimbledon*, 37 that \"[t]he right of a State to adopt the course which it considers best suited to the exigencies of its security and to the maintenance of its integrity, is so essential a right that, in case of doubt, treaty stipulations cannot be interpreted as limiting it.\"\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant rejects this submission. The Claimant notes that the text of Art. XI does not explicitly include such a restriction (as Argentina itself admits), and that there is no negotiating record (or at least none presented or known to this Tribunal) that would evidence an understanding of the Contracting Parties to this effect. To the contrary, the Claimant points out that the formulation of Art. XI follows closely the FCN model of the U.S.A, which in terms did not follow the language of Art. XXI of GATT 1947 (although the content is in part similar). Art. XXI of GATT 1947 specifies that \"[n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed (b) to prevent any contracting party to take action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests...\n\n185.\n\nThe Parties have argued the point extensively, relying on the expert opinions of Prof. Kenneth J. Vandevelde for the Claimant and of Prof. Anne-Marie Slaughter for Argentina, who also testified at the final hearing. Both were impressive experts. Their basic difference derives from the lack of documentation as to whether the U.S. had taken the position at the time of the negotiation and signature of the BIT that it considered its invocation and application as self-judging and therefore not reviewable by an arbitral tribunal established under Art. VII of the BIT.\n\n186.\n\nThe position of Argentina is that this was indeed the case: that the U.S. had informed Argentina of its position and that Argentina had shared it. The position of the Claimant is that the U.S. had not taken nor expressed such a position at that time. On the contrary, after the International Court of Justice had rejected in the *Nicaragua* case the claim by the U.S. that Art. XXI of the FCN Treaty between the U.S. and Nicaragua (including identical expressions to those of the BIT) was self-judging,273 the U.S. abandoned, in any case *de facto*, such a position. That position was only later resumed by the U.S. when Russia had asked and obtained during the negotiations of the U.S.-Russia BIT that the self-judging nature of the exception be inserted into this BIT (Art. 8 Protocol of U.S.-Russia BIT of 1992).274 Thereafter, the U.S. adopted this interpretation and finally changed the text of its Model BIT to such effect, but only in 2004.275\n\nSee ICJ, *Nicaragua* Case, Merits, 222.\n\nThis occurred during the negotiations of the US-Russia BIT signed on June 17, 1992 after the conclusion of the negotiations of the US - Argentina BIT signed on November 14, 1991.\n\nSee Art. 18 (1) US 2004 model BIT.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant's position is supported by the limited evidence available to the Tribunal and conforms to legal principles applicable to treaty interpretation, applied by the Vienna Convention. The International Court of Justice has twice interpreted provisions substantially identical (from which the text of Art. XI derives), as not restricting the ability of a tribunal empowered by the parties to resolve disputes under the treaty to determine whether the conditions of the \"limitation\" were met.276 This Tribunal finds at most inconclusive the evidence relied upon by Argentina to support its claim that the U.S. had taken and conveyed to other BIT partners at the time, specifically to Argentina,277 its position that recourse to the clause was self-judging.278 The Tribunal has in any case not been given any evidence of the Argentina's acceptance of such a communication.279 Although a provision such as Art. XI, as earlier indicated, involves naturally a margin of appreciation by a party invoking it,280 caution must be exercised in allowing a party unilaterally to escape from its treaty obligations in the absence of clear textual or contextual indications.281 This is especially so if the party invoking the allegedly self-judging nature of the exemption can thereby remove the issue, and hence the claim of a treaty breach by the investor against the host state, from arbitral review. This would conflict in principle with the agreement of the parties to have disputes under the BIT settled compulsorily by arbitration, both between an investor and the host State or between the Contracting Parties, as the case may be.\n\nBesides the Nicaragua case, cited above footnote 273, see ICJ, *Oil Platform Case*, Merits, 43. In the latter case the U.S. did not argue that the provision was not justiciable, but rather that the Court should grant the U.S. \"a measure of discretion.\"\n\nThis additional requirement, if met, could have complied with the conditions of Art. 31 VCLT for finding an agreement on a special meaning to a term (31.4), a subsequent agreement (31.3.a), or a subsequent practice establishing an agreement (31.3.b).\n\nThe Tribunal has received no evidence supporting the statement by the US State Department, contained in the description of the US model BIT of February 1992 (in any case approved three months after the signing of the US-Argentina BIT in November 2001) submitted to the US Senate on July 30, 1992 that \"[w]e are careful to note, in each negotiation, the self-judging nature of the protection of a Party's essential security interests.\" (See documentation concerning the hearing before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the US Senate, August 4, 1992 supplied to the Tribunal by the Claimant, Claimant's doc. C-230, at p. 65). Moreover the Letter of Submittal of the US-Argentina of January 13, 1993 is silent about the self-judging nature of the essential security interests clause asserted by the Respondent. As to the view expressed by the Department of State in its letter to the former Legal Advisor A. Sofer in 2006 submitted by Argentina to the Tribunal after the file had been declared closed to the Parties (see paras. 92-93), the statement \"...the position of the U.S. Government is that the essential security language in our FCN treaties and Bilateral Investment treaties is self- judging\" is too generic (also because of the absence of any timing) to be considered relevant.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that no preparatory work or documentation as to the negotiating history of the Argentina-US BIT had been supplied in this dispute. It should also be recorded that neither Party wished the Tribunal to invite the U.S. to state its position formally for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings, one way or the other.\n\nThis was one of the objects of several contacts between the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Senate at various points in time according to the documentation concerning the hearing before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the US Senate of August 4, 1992, supplied to the Tribunal by the Claimant, cited above footnote 278.\n\n\"Context\" may include circumstantial elements relating to the conclusion of the treaty, see WTO Appellate Body, *EC-Chicken Cuts*, 289.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal notes finally that the same conclusion, as to the non-self-judging nature of the recourse to Art. XI, has been reached by the other ICSID arbitral tribunals to which Argentina has submitted the same defense.282 It has however, like all other decisions in this Award, first reached its own decisions independently of any such ICSID awards.\n\nSee specifically *CMS* Award, paras. 359 and 370; *LG&E* Award, paras. 212-213; *Enron Award*, para. 339.\n\n*D. Whether the measures challenged were \"necessary\" in order maintain public order and protect essential security interests of Argentina*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) The applicable standard\n--------------------------\n\n189.\n\nAt this point the Tribunal has to evaluate whether the impugned measures were \"necessary\" for the maintenance of public order and the protection of the essential security interests of Argentina within the meaning of the BIT. Argentina claims that the actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.283 Argentina submits that \"[a]n international tribunal should analyze this issue with the highest deference and should not arrogate itself the power to establish what other measures could have been taken instead.\"284 In any event, Argentina submits that \"[i]f the measures now brought into question by Continental had not been adopted, the accelerated drain of deposits and loss of reserves of the Argentine financial system evidenced since early 2001 would have brought about a widespread collapse of the Argentine economy, even bigger than the one actually experienced.\"285\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, at p. 217.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 838.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 840.\n\n190.\n\nContinental, in contrast, submits that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of \u2018necessary' is that which \u2018cannot be dispensed with or done without,' or, in other words, indispensable. Under the ordinary meaning of Article XI, Argentina must demonstrate that its measures were indispensable to the protection of its essential security interests or maintenance of public order.\"286 Thus, it is the Claimant's opinion that \"Argentina must meet a high threshold in demonstrating that its measures were necessary,\" taking into account the Treaty's objects to provide a stable framework for investment and to encourage and protect investment.287\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 344.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 346.\n\n191.\n\nTo support this conclusion the Claimant relies also on the ILC commentary on Art. 25 (1)(a) stating that the \"plea is excluded if there are other (otherwise lawful) means available, even if they may be more costly or less convenient\" (ILC commentary para. 15). This ought to be considered not only as a more precise explanation of the term \u2018necessary' with regard to invocation of the defense of necessity under customary international law, but also as a standard applicable in interpreting Art. XI of the BIT. In the Claimant's view \"if a measure is indispensable to the protection of its essential security interests or maintenance of public order then it must be the only means to protect those essential security interests or maintain the public order.\"288 The Claimant submits that it has shown to the Tribunal that alternative measures (irrespective of their costs) were available to Argentina for addressing the national emergency in 2001. It concludes that \"the existence of these alternate measures demonstrates that the measures Argentina did take were not necessary for the purposes of Article XI of the BIT.\"289\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 350.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 352.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal is thus faced with the task of determining the content of the concept of necessity in Art. XI, in order to decide whether the various Measures challenged by the Claimant were indeed necessary, as a matter of causation. With regard to the necessity test required for the application of the BIT, for the reasons stated above relating to the different role of Art. XI and of the defense of necessity in customary international law, the Tribunal does not share the opinion that \"the treaty thus becomes inseparable from the customary law standard insofar as to the conditions for the operation of the state of necessity are concerned,\" as stated in the *Enron Case* and submitted also by the Claimant.290 Since the text of Art. XI derives from the parallel model clause of the U.S. FCN treaties and these treaties in turn reflect the formulation of Art. XX of GATT 1947,291 the Tribunal finds it more appropriate to refer to the GATT and WTO case law which has extensively dealt with the concept and requirements of necessity in the context of economic measures derogating to the obligations contained in GATT, rather than to refer to the requirement of necessity under customary international law.292\n\nEnron Award, para. 334.\n\nArt. XX GATT (and similarly Art. XIV GATS) provides that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party of measures : (a) necessary to protect public morals; (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or heath; (d) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations...\"\n\nThe Claimant has also referred to the case law under Art. XX of GATT 1947 (Claimant's Reply, para. 348).\n\n193.\n\nWith regard to the necessity test for the purposes of application of the general exception of Article XX of GATT, it is well established that:\n\n[...] the reach of the word \"necessary\" is not limited to that which is \"indispensable\" or \"of absolute necessity\" or \"inevitable.\" Measures which are indispensable or of absolute necessity or inevitable to secure compliance certainly fulfill the requirements of Article XX (d). But other measures, too, may fall within the ambit of this exception. As used in Article XX (d), the term \"necessary\" refers in our view to a range of degrees of necessity. At a one end of this continuum lies \"necessary\" understood as \"indispensable;\" at the other, is \"necessary\" taken to mean as \"making a contribution to.\" We consider that a \"necessary\" measure is, in this continuum, located significantly closer to the pole of \"indispensable\" than to the opposite pole of simply \"making a contribution to.\"293\n\nWTO Appellate Body, *Korea-Beef*, para. 161. See also ICJ, *Nicaragua* Case, Merits, 282: \"the Court emphasizes the importance of the word \"necessary\" in Art. XXI: the measures taken must not merely be such as tend to protect the essential security interest of the party taking them, but must be \u2018necessary' for that purpose.\"\n\n194.\n\nIn order to determine whether a measure which is not indispensable, may nevertheless be \"necessary\":\n\nThe necessity of a measure should be determined through \"a process of weighing and balancing of factors\" which usually includes the assessment of the following three factors: the relative importance of interests or values furthered by the challenged measures, the contribution of the measure to the realization of the ends pursued by it and the restrictive impact of the measure on international commerce.294\n\nPanel Report, *EC Tyres*, para. 7,104, summing up the Appellate Body case law in *Korea-Beef*, para. 164; *EC- Asbestos*, para. 172; *US-Gambling*, para. 306; *Dominican Republic-Cigarettes*, para. 70. Within this weighing and balancing of those various factors, the WTO case law stresses the assessment of the importance of the interests or values furthered by the challenged measure.\n\n195.\n\nWithin the WTO a measure is not necessary if another treaty consistent, or less inconsistent alternative measure, which the member State concerned could reasonably be expected to employ is available:\n\n[...] an alternative measure may be found not to be \"reasonable available,\" however, where it is merely theoretical in nature, for instance, where the Responding Member is not capable of taking it, or where the measure imposes an undue burden on that Member, such as prohibitive costs or substantial technical difficulties. Moreover a \"reasonable available\" alternative measure must be a measure that would preserve for the responding Member its right to achieve its desired level of protection with respect to the objective pursued under paragraph (a) of Article XIV.295\n\nWTO Appellate Body, *US-Gambling*, 308, referring to Art. XIV GATS. See also WTO Panel *EC-Tyres*, 7,211 \"[w]e do not exclude however that there may be circumstances in which a highly restrictive measure is necessary, if no other less trade restrictive alternative is reasonably available to the member concerned to achieve its objectives.\"\n\n*b) Application of the standard*\n--------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nAccording to these principles, the next step for us is to assess whether the Measures contributed materially to the realization of their legitimate aims under Art. XI of the BIT, namely the protection of the essential security interests of Argentina in the economic and social crisis it was facing. More specifically, whether the Measures were apt to and did make such a material or a decisive contribution to this end.296\n\nSee WTO Appellate Body, *EC-Tyres*, 150.\n\n197.\n\nIn light of the analysis we have carried out above, we believe that this was the case. In general terms297, within the economic and financial situation of Argentina towards the end of 2001, the Measures at issue (the *Corralito*, the *Corralon*, the pesification, the default and the subsequent restructuring of those debt instruments involved here) were in part inevitable, or unavoidable, in part indispensable and in any case material or decisive in order to react positively to the crisis, to prevent the complete break-down of the financial system, the implosion of the economy and the growing threat to the fabric of Argentinean society and generally to assist in overcoming the crisis. In the Tribunal's view, there was undoubtedly \"a genuine relationship of end and means in this respect.\"298\n\nThat is without prejudice for the analysis of individual measures developed in the next paragraphs.\n\n*Ibid*. 145. This report has highlighted, at para. 151, the importance of the temporal perspective in the evaluation of necessity: \"the results obtained from certain actions.can only be evaluated with the benefit of time.\"\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal is also guided by the principles highlighted above in its analysis of whether Argentina had reasonably available alternatives, less in conflict or more compliant with its international obligations, \"while providing an equivalent contribution to the achievement of the objective pursued,\"299 to the Measures challenged by Continental as inconsistent with the BIT. If so, the Measures adopted would be deprived of a fundamental element underpinning their alleged necessity. The Tribunal will look accordingly both to:\n\ni) alternatives to the Measures, not in breach of the BIT, that might have been available when the Measures challenged were taken (thus from November 2001 onwards) and that would have yielded equivalent results/relief; and\n\nii) whether Argentina could have adopted at some earlier time different policies, that would have avoided or prevented the situation that brought about the adoption of the measures challenged.\n\nIf the result of such additional analysis shows that such alternatives would not have been reasonably available or would have been impracticable or speculative as to their effects, the conclusion that the measures were necessary under Art. XI of the BIT would be confirmed.\n\nSee WTO Appellate Body, *EC-Tyres*, para 156.\n\n199.\n\nIn evaluating whether these alternatives were in fact reasonably available and would have avoided the adoption of the challenged Measures, the Tribunal is mindful that it is not its mandate to pass judgment upon Argentina's economic policy during 20012002, nor to censure Argentina's sovereign choices as an independent state. Our task is more modestly to evaluate only if the plea of necessity by Argentina is well-founded, in that Argentina had no other reasonable choice available, in order to protect its essential interests at the time, than to adopt these Measures. If the conclusion upholds this defence, then Argentina will escape any liability since necessity would exclude a breach of the BIT's obligations to the detriment of the Claimant, and/or would exempt Argentina from responsibility. If not, Argentina would have to face the consequences of its breaches in as far as Continental's claims are otherwise upheld. In either case, the Tribunal is not called upon to make any political or economic judgment on Argentina's policies and of the Measures adopted to pursue them. Nor does this entail, retrospectively, a judgment on those same grounds that Argentina should not have enacted the Measures that it did adopt.\n\n*(i) Alternatives that might have been available when the challenged measures were taken (thus at the outbreak and at the height of the crisis in November 2001 - February 2002)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimant submits that there were alternatives that Argentina could have adopted in lieu of: a) the *Corralito* (the imposition of the bank freeze in December 2001); b) the devaluation of the peso; c) the pesification of the U.S. dollar denominated contracts and deposits; and d) the suspension of payments (default) and rescheduling of the governmental financial instruments held by CNA.\n\n*(a) In respect of the Corralito (the imposition of the bank freeze in December 2001)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn particular, Continental submits that the *Corralito*, instead of qualifying as a necessary reaction to a sudden extraneous fall in bank deposits, aggravated the crisis because it inevitably caused a deep loss of public confidence. In the Claimant's words \"[t]he social discontent triggered by this measure put an end to any further negotiations between federal authorities and the Provinces and the multilateral institutions,\"300 which would have represented an alternate available measure to avoid the sharp fall in the bank deposits.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 87.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the evidence as to the massive falls in bank deposits and the capital flight out of the country that had occurred in the preceding months and had amplified in the weeks and days before the imposition of the *Corralito*, very significantly depleting Argentina's reserves.301 The Tribunal notes that the imposition of the bank freeze is a typical short-term measure used by monetary authorities in order to block withdrawals from banks and block capital flight. These events occur when the public loses confidence in the economy and in the ability of the state to maintain freedom of exchange; bank-runs must then be stopped lest the banks and the country go bankrupt.302\n\nIn the situation of Argentina in the autumn of 2001, the impossibility for Argentina to maintain convertibility was reasonably foreseeable and was even widely expected; the need to take strict remedial actions against massive withdrawals from the banks, widespread requests of exchange of pesos for dollars and capital flight was inevitable.303\n\nSee para 122 above.\n\nSee UNCTAD, *Transfer of Funds*, 7: \"[l]arge surges of capital outflows can exacerbate a country's balance-of-payment problems by making it more difficult for the country to implement adjustment policies that are designed to correct the underlying problems;\" *ibid*, 11: \"while restrictions on transfers will generally not be the preferred means of addressing balance-of-payment crises, in certain circumstances they may be necessary.\"\n\nAs mentioned, their need had been anticipated by commentators and institutions outside Argentina; see for instance R. Dornbush, *The Last Tango*, August 2001, (Claimant's doc. C-114).\n\n203.\n\nThus the *Corralito* has to be viewed in connection with the abandonment of the conversion of the peso to U.S. dollar at 1:1, which entailed floating of currency and market-driven devaluation. This was also widely considered inevitable once the IMF had withdrawn its further support for the reasons highlighted above. It is true that the imposition of severe restrictions on withdrawals from bank accounts entailed further hardship, especially as to individuals, families and small businesses. However, the block affected CNA's business activity only marginally304 because intra-bank operations were allowed and special authorisations were soon thereafter granted to insurance companies.305 There was indeed no difference between the position of a local subsidiary of an American investor, such as CNA, and the position of any other Argentine insurance company.\n\nSee footnote 393 infra.\n\nSee. \"Resolucion\" 28, 580 of February 11, 2002 (see also footnote 198 and 223).\n\n204.\n\nThe evidence does not permit the Tribunal to conclude that \"further negotiations between federal authorities and the Provinces and the multilateral institutions\" could have formed the basis for Argentina obtaining additional external support.306 First of all, the *ex post facto* evaluation indicates that a restructuring of Argentina's debt without sacrificing in part creditors' rights in breach of same (as was finally the case in 2002-2003) was probably already impossible by 2000.307 In late 2001, Argentina had already carried out various restructurings of its debt, both external (through the mega-swap) and domestic (through the issuance of GGLs), but had not obtained any meaningful relief. The country was precluded from further voluntary restructuring by its loss of credibility in the world financial markets and the withdrawal of the Fund's support. Consultations and negotiations cannot be considered *per se* an alternative measure to urgent legislative or administrative action of general application such as a bank freeze. This is even more true when taking account of the level of public order protection and protection of its own essential security interests that a State manages to achieve with such prohibitions. Moreover, in this regard it can even be questioned whether consultations and negotiations can be considered as \"measures\" at all, due to their uncertain results.308 In any case, when the Government was able to strike a financial and fiscal deal with the provinces, in the midst of the crisis towards the end of February 2002, this entailed leaving to the provinces about 30% of the proceeds of the financial tax. These proceeds had been specifically earmarked as a guarantee to GGLs holders in case of default, a measure complained of by Continental as having affected its own rights, at least indirectly by rendering recourse to this guarantee impossible.309\n\nSee also Scott, 576: \"[c]ritics of the IMF said that it should have led a bailout like that for Mexico, infusing $50 billion that would jump start the economy. The Bush administration, far from allowing this, had prevented the IMF in December 2001 from advancing the stand-by funds, once again trying to get tough on the expansion of official and multilateral debt and its contribution to creditor moral hazard.\"\n\nSee infra para. 208. **Lessons from the Crisis**, 34, indicates that already in 2000 a large depreciation should have been accompanied by \"a preventive sovereign debt restructuring which would have provided both sufficient liquidity and net present value relief; this would have necessarily entailed a sovereign default. Even more so an involuntary debt restructuring, with reduction in the present value of the debt\" in 2001, **Lessons from the Crisis**, 36.\n\nSee WTO Appellate Body, *US-Gambling*, para. 317.\n\n\"Federal State-Provinces Agreement on the Financial Relation and Basis for the Federal Revenue Sharing System\" of February 27, 2002, referred to in Decree 644/2002 on the restructuring of GGLs, (Argentina's doc. R-31).\n\n205.\n\nTo conclude, for the Tribunal the **Corralito** was justified by necessity within the meaning of this BIT, in any case as far as a company like CNA was affected by it. The block was adequate and effective in respect of its legitimate aims to prevent further fall in bank deposits that would have brought about the banks' bankruptcy, as well as the exhaustion of the country's reserves. Continental also complains mostly of the *Corralito* because it prevented CNA from transferring out of the country funds available in Argentina to CNA. This raises a different point. We will address later the issue whether such international transfers of funds are and would have been guaranteed by Art. V of the BIT. Subject to that, we conclude here that the **Corralito** was necessary to prevent exactly that outflow of funds to which Continental would have contributed, according to its own statements, an outflow that would have undermined Argentina's essential security interests.310\n\nSee Nussbaum, *Money in the Law, National and International*, 1950, 476, \"[r]estrictions to safeguard a country's balance of payment, however, constitute acts of self-preservation\" legitimate even in the teeth of a MFN clause. The situation is otherwise where the differentiation is not justified by economic necessity.\"\n\n*(b) In respect of the devaluation of the peso*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nWith regard to the devaluation of the peso that Argentina claims was necessary, together with the pesification, in order to cope with the economic public emergency, the Claimant submits that: \"[t]his argument is doubly flawed. First, devaluation was not inevitable. Second, Argentina could have devaluated the peso without unilaterally altering the terms of contracts denominated in U.S. dollars.\"311 The Claimant dealt extensively with these arguments, relying on the written opinion and the testimony of its expert witness, Prof. S. Edwards.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 89.\n\n207.\n\nContinental does not challenge devaluation **per se** and recognizes that the BIT does not guarantee foreign investors and their investments against devaluation, nor does it claim that devaluation breached **per se** its treaty rights.312 There was however a close connection between the devaluation of the peso and the decision to pesify bank deposits and government debt. The pesification was an integral part of the scheme of abandoning convertibility and letting the peso float, i.e. to devalue against the US dollar. The Claimant when challenging the necessity of the pesification suggests alternatives that would have avoided in its view the very need for devaluing the peso.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 92.\n\n208.\n\nIn the Claimant's submission, Argentina could have avoided devaluation either through (a) a voluntary debt exchange or (b) \"full dollarization\" of the economy.313 The Tribunal has not received evidence that would sustain either argument. As to voluntary debt exchange (alternative (a)), we have recalled that Argentina had already pursued this policy: Argentina had entered into swaps both as to its foreign debt (\"megaswap\" of Spring 2001) and domestic debentures, namely through the restructuring of part of the government's debt by issuing in November 2001 GGLs in exchange, a swap in which also CNA took part.314 Both operations were ineffective in lessening the burden on Argentina's finances and in restoring the public's confidence. With the Fund refusing further support to Argentina, there was no realistic possibility for the Government at a later date, towards the end of 2001, to conclude a voluntary exchange that would have fully respected the depositors' rights in dollar terms, while also avoiding devaluation.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 91.\n\nIn order to make Argentina's debt sustainable, a debt reduction of 30% to 40% was considered to be necessary within the Fund in Autumn 2001, *Blustein*, 167; see also *Lessons from the Crisis*, 36, \"[a]t this stage, serious consideration should already have been given to an involuntary debt restructuring..\"\n\n209.\n\nAs to \"full dollarization\" (alternative (b)), that is, replacing physically the pesos in circulation with dollar bills and adopting the U.S. dollar as legal tender, the overwhelming evidence before us indicates that this was a purely theoretically and thoroughly impractical solution, never really envisaged by the various relevant actors, considering that Argentina alone would not have been in the position to pursue it. Such a full dollarization had never been tried before for a large economy, such as that of Argentina, and that would have required massive financial and logistical support by the U.S. Government.315 That support was not available. Commentators have also considered that, even if implemented, full dollarization would not have solved Argentina's problems, nor restored confidence in its debt sustainability.316\n\nThis was conceded by Prof. S. Edwards who supported this full dollarization in his oral testimony. See also J. Sachs, \" *Duhalde\u2019s Wrong Turn*,\" Financial Times, USA Edition, Jan. 11, 2002 (according to whom dollarization should have been accompanied by massive devaluation), Claimant's doc. C-115; *Scott*, 576, cited. footnote 306 above (as to the refusal of the US Government to approve further financial support to Argentina at the end of 2001); *Lessons from the Crisis*, 34, excluding that full dollarization might have been a solution in Argentina's situation of recession already in 2000.\n\nAgainst the support expressed by Prof. S. Edwards for this solution as an expert witness for the Claimant, Argentina referred to the same expert's article \"The false promise of dollarization,\" Financial Times May 11, 2001 (Argentina's doc. RA-262). See also *Lessons from the Crisis*, 30.\n\n210.\n\nThus neither solution can be considered as an alternative to devaluation that could have been reasonably pursued by Argentina with any probable chances of success. For the purpose of the present legal evaluation, devaluation has thus to be considered inevitable in view of the economic unsustainability of the parity with the U.S. dollar, and because of the run on deposits and the flight from the peso which had made the *Corralito* necessary.317\n\nSee *Calomiris*, 1: \"[t]he inconsistency between persistent fiscal deficits and recession, on the one hand, and the inflexible currency regime of \u2018convertibility,' on the other hand, became increasingly apparent to market observers from 1999 through 2001. By the end of 2001, given the political infeasibility of fiscal reform (a fact illustrated by the brief tenure and abrupt demise of officials who suggested the desirability of fiscal reform), sovereign default and devaluation became inevitable toward the end of 2001.\"\n\n*(c) In respect of the pesification of the U.S. dollar-denominated contracts and deposits*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe main argument of the Claimant is that Argentina could have let the peso devalue and terminate convertibility, whilst leaving unaffected the denomination in dollar of the deposits and especially of the financial instrument issued in dollars within Argentina. The Claimant submits that many countries had similar levels of \"dollarization\" during similar currency crisis, but that \"[o]nly Argentina chose the highly unusual route of mandatory de-dollarization, i.e. pesification of contracts - deposits, debt and utility tariffs.\"318\n\nThe Claimant mentions the cases of Indonesia in 1997, Ecuador and Bolivia in 1999 and Uruguay in 2002 (Claimant's Reply, 93-94). It further points to various strategies in debt restructuring adopted by these and other countries in a situation of crisis; all of them however presuppose that the crisis brings borrowers into distress and that companies in distress can be saved through various debt restructuring, a form of solution that cannot be (by definition) fully compliant with depositors' rights.\n\n212.\n\nArgentina in turn submits that, in view of the level of dollarization of the financial sector, it would have been impossible after the devaluation of the peso of more than 300% to satisfy claims denominated in dollars by converting them at the market rate. The debtor would have gone bankrupt and a massive bail-out of the banks would have been required far beyond the possibilities of Argentina's strained public finances. Moreover, this would have caused widespread imbalances and unjustified discrimination between those depositors which had converted their peso in dollars, possibly just before the *Corralito*, and those who had maintained their assets in pesos. The solution which was put in place distributed more evenly and equitably the burden of the country's new financial situation between all those affected, while recognizing through the asymetric pesification the expectations of those who had made deposits in dollars.\n\n213.\n\nAccording to one of the most specific economic studies devoted to the issue, and discussed by the Parties at the hearing, \"[r]edenomination of dollar debts implied a substantial reduction of the real debt service burdens of dollar-denominated debtors. It was inspired by the realization that without redenomination Argentina would have to find a way to address massive economy-wide insolvency of dollar-denominated debtors, as well as huge relative price increases for energy and transport costs that were fixed by concession contracts in dollar terms.\"319 Furthermore \"Argentina was in an unusually vulnerable macro-economic position as the result of the large fraction of domestic debts and transportation and utility concession contracts that were denominated in or indexed to the dollar, and the small fraction of its economy devoted to exports.\"320 Thus dedollarization seems to have represented, according to qualified observers,321 as almost a \"must\" for Argentina, in order to devaluate effectively, avoid unbearable asymmetries in the allocation of the burden that devaluation entails and to stimulate the recovery.322 Finally, contrary to the Claimant's allegations, the de-dollarization of 2002 by Argentina was not without precedents in recent financial crises.323\n\n*Calomiris,* 1 ff.\n\n*Calomiris*, 3, the author further explains, at 12, that \"Argentine private sector debt was much more heavily dollarized than those of the other four countries with similar of higher dollarization score.\" See also IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 20.\n\n*Calomiris*, 8, reports, among others, the opinion of the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz who \"argued that devaluation would produce financial distress for borrowers with dollar-denominated claims, and that a redenomination of debts or some other economy-wide plan to reduce the value of the dollar-denominated debt would soften the blow of devaluation.\" As to the need of de-dollarization together with the large scale depreciation of the pesos see also *Lessons from the Crisis*, 32, and IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 66.\n\nSee Krugman's Editorial, quoted footnote 166 above: \"[a]dmittedly, the fact that much private debt in Argentina is indexed to the dollar means that a peso devaluation might create financial problems. Simply issue a decree canceling the indexation. It's a radical solution, but the situation is desperate, and there is a precedent: it's more or less what President Roosevelt did in 1933.\" According to **Calomiris**, 8, \"[t]he Argentine government had observed the consequences of devaluation without debt redenomination in Mexico post-1994 crisis and in East Asia post-1997, and was keenly aware of the severe adverse consequences of not combining devaluation with debt redenomination.\" **Calomiris**, 13-15, concludes that devaluation with debt redenomination had salutary effects on the investment behaviour of debtor firm and \"was a positive surprise at the time it was enacted.\"\n\nAccording to *Calomiris*, 10, Mexico's devaluation of 1982 had included \"a similar debt-relief policy of reducing the dollar value of its dollar-denominated bank loans and dollar denominated deposits in 1982.\" Notably: \"[t]he real value of loans was reduced through the conversion of foreign currency loans to pesos at an exchange rate that overstated the value of the peso relative to the dollar.\" Indeed, as *Mann*, 471, recalls this operation led to litigation in the U.S. by affected investors unsuccessfully claiming that they had been partially expropriated by the forced conversion of their dollar-denominated deposits into pesos at an artificial rate, *West v. Multibanco Comermex S.A.* (C.A. 9th Cir.), 807 F. 2d 820 (1987).\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that de-dollarization was inevitable in the situation facing Argentina, in order to achieve a balanced distribution of the burden of the devaluation and of the abandonment of the convertibility at par with the dollar, once the fiction that pesos and dollars were equivalent had been discredited by the massive flight from peso to dollar (which had become a cause for the unsustainability of the very convertibility at par). The asymmetry of the exchange rates adopted reflected as far as possible, although only partially, the expectations of depositors in dollars within Argentina that they would\n\nbe more secure than holders in pesos in case of crisis.324 That burden was charged to the entire economy.325\n\nThe expectation that dollars could be immune from a financial and exchange crisis of the magnitude of the one which occurred was legally misplaced. Dollar denominated deposits and secured were not \"real\" dollars, backed by the U.S. Treasury. They were the result of conversions of pesos within Argentina's economic and financial system and were backed by the foreign exchange reserves of Argentina.\n\nAccording to *Calomiris*, 10, the ultimate result of the asymetric pesification, adopted as \"an attempt to placate depositors, who complained of the loss of value of their deposits,\" and which entailed the government issuing bonds to the banks to cover the losses the latter suffered as a consequence, was that \"citizens as taxpayers paid for the cost of the relative subsidy received by citizens as depositors.\"\n\n*(d) In respect of the suspension of payments, default and rescheduling of the* *governmental financial instruments held by CNA*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nFirst of all, the Claimant complains that Argentina defaulted at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002 on various financial instruments issued by the Government and held by CNA. Moreover it also complains that interest payments due to CNA under these financial instruments were delayed substantially in 2002, even in respect of the new terms that Argentina had unilaterally set. Argentina submits that in the first months of 2002 its financial administration was in such a state of disarray and the public finances in such a shortage of funds due to the crisis (and specifically due to the lack of access to international capital markets) that both forms of conducts, namely as to default and as to lack of punctual payment of interest, appear to have been inevitable. Overdue payments were in any case made when, where and as far as payments restarted on a regular basis in the second half of 2002.326\n\nClaimant's Memorial at p. 15.\n\n216.\n\nThe other complaints of Continental relate to specific aspects of the conditions of the restructuring process of the various obligations and similar instruments on which Argentina had defaulted at the end of 2001 and at the beginning of 2002. As described by Argentina itself, under the restructuring process, which ended in June 2005, \"the Argentine Government offered to swap all Argentine government debt securities issued before December 31, 2001, on default, for new securities with an extended term and for a minor principal and/or interested value but adjusted to Argentina's capacity payment.\"327\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 722-723.\n\n217.\n\nSpecifically as to the GGLs, the evidence shows that they were pesified and indexed to the CER and that they were to earn a reduced interest rate in accordance with Decree 471/02. The guarantee that had initially been provided for the case of default (consisting in the proceeds of the financial transaction tax) was thereafter withdrawn by Decree 644/02 specifically dealing with GGLs: within the restructuring of Argentina's public finances the proceeds of this tax were now to be shared by the Government with the provinces. Since there was no interest for a holder to opt for the return of the securities which had been swapped for the GGLs (since these were also in default), CNA opted to accept the new terms. In view of the situation of the public finances of Argentina in the crisis of 2002, we conclude that these Measures can be considered reasonably necessary within the pesification of the economy. The treatment of GGLs compares with that of other financial instruments held by the public. The special guarantees (that had been provided in the original conditions, in order to induce depositors to accept a swap intended to avert the risk of an impending crisis), once the crisis had arrived, had either lost their value or could not escape being subjected to the same necessity and hence to the need of being restructured.328\n\nSee particularly Argentina's Counter Memorial, paras. 589-600 and paras. 705 ff. According to Argentina (Counter Memorial, para. 710) \"[t]he manner of servicing the PGNs offered to the creditors was the only way that the Federal State was able to meet, allowing making payments in line with the resources available with considerable fiscal effort and under distressful economic and social conditions.\"\n\n218.\n\nAs to dollar-denominated Term Deposits (CD), the evidence shows that they had been first frozen under the *Corralito*, then \"reprogrammed\" (so-called CEDROS) under Res. 6/2002, thereafter pesified at 1.4 plus CER adjustment (Decree 471/2002), and further frozen under Res. 73. Short term deposits were thus frozen for a considerable length of time, except for the possibility of withdrawals as introduced for insurance companies. As Continental explains, it opted in July 2002 for a dollar denominated bond (BODEN 2012) in exchange of deposits held with the bankrupt Scotiabank.329 As to the rest of its deposits, Continental preferred not to accept the Government's offers in May and July 2002 (Decree 905 and 1836) to exchange them against long terms bonds in dollars.330 The Claimant accepted instead the conditions of the repeal of the *Corralon*, that is the subsequent de-freezing, or thawing provided by Decree 739 of March 28, 2003: this entailed a further rescheduling of 120 days with a 2% annual interest and receiving a dollar bond (BODEN 2013) \"to compensate for the difference between the market exchange rate at the date of the enactment of the Decree and the government imposed rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar as adjusted by CER.\"331 According to Argentina, thanks to this mechanism a holder like CNA was able through indexation and the dollar bond to recover a substantial amount of the initial capital loss.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 54.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 617.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 58.\n\n219.\n\nWe are of the view that in the state of necessity faced by Argentina the elaborate mechanism described above was appropriate and reasonable to cope with the need urgently to stabilize the financial markets and the banks, reinstating progressively the rights of depositors. The burden that depositors had to bear initially was alleviated *pari passu* with the improvement of the conditions of the economic and financial system: this entailed also a partial \"re-dollarization\" of their claims through the dollar-denominated BODEN.\n\n220.\n\nAs to the Treasury Bills (LETE)332, the evidence shows333 that Argentina offered to restructure them through Decree 1735/04 of December 9, 2004 by offering a swap of these securities, as well as of several other securities also in default, against newly issued securities, specifically GDP-linked derivative instruments.334 CNA did not accept this conversion, since it would have received in exchange \"only U.S.$0.30 per dollar and would have been required to waive its rights. It would have also been required to accept long maturities on bonds from a government that had demonstrated its willingness to repeatedly default on its debt.\"335\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 78; Argentina's Counter-Memorial, para 717 ff.\n\nSee above para. 151.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 717, 414; Claimant's Reply, para 78.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 78. Argentina indicates that 76.15 % of the holders of eligible securities took part to the swap (Counter-Memorial, para. 415). According to Claimant (Claimant's Reply, para. 386) it has suffered as to LETEs losses of 0.7 million due to pesification and of 2.8 million \"due to the further default and revocation of contractual rights.\"\n\n221.\n\nIn respect of this restructuring the Tribunal rejects the defense of necessity by Argentina based on Art. XI of the BIT, in the light of the following factors:\n\n(a) the late date in which the swap was offered, when Argentina's financial conditions were evolving towards normality;336\n\n(b) the reduced percentage of the original value of the debt that Argentina unilaterally offered to recognize;\n\n(c) the condition that any other rights would be waived, which entailed also waiving the protection of the BIT.337\n\nWe recall that Argentina had returned to the U.S. capital market with an issuance of securities in September 2004, see above para. 159.\n\nWe note in this respect that Argentina has justified the waiver requirement imposed for the participation to the restructuring of the GGLs at a much earlier date, in the midst of the crisis (Decree 471 of March 8, 2002) with the need to avoid that creditors might obtain a kind of double recovery by petitioning domestic courts: these had at the time often disregarded the emergency legislation, and had ordered the Government to respect the original conditions (including the dollar denomination) of various instruments (see Argentina's Counter Memorial, para. 598). This \"danger\" no longer existed in 2004 after the *Bustos* decision by the Supreme Court which fully recognized the validity of the emergency legislation.\n\n222.\n\nSince, as stated above under (a), Argentina's financial situation was evolving towards normality when the LETEs were restructured, Argentina cannot avail itself in this respect of the alternative defense based on state of necessity in customary international law. The fundamental requirement that the conduct be \"the only way for a State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril\" (Art. 25 (1) (i) ILC Articles) was lacking for the reasons stated hereabove under (a). The Tribunal rejects, therefore, also this alternative defense by Argentina as to the restructuring of the LETEs. We consider separately below the consequences of this adverse decision for Argentina.\n\n*(ii) Whether Argentina could have adopted at an earlier time different policies that would have avoided or prevented the situation that brought about the adoption of the challenged measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimant developed a further argument in order to reject Argentina's plea of necessity. In the Claimant's submission, Argentina could have avoided the devaluation and the pesification if it had adopted a different economic policy, specifically if it had implemented in a timely manner those accompanying policies and measures (especially relating to budgetary and fiscal discipline) required for the sustainability of the parity arrangement, convertibility and the currency board. This argument points also to a contribution by Argentina itself to the crisis and hence to the impugned Measures:\n\n\"Argentina could have implemented economic policies that would have supported the ability of the currency board to withstand an economic recession.\"338\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 36.\n\n224.\n\nIn this respect too, the analysis by the Tribunal is circumscribed in drawing appropriate conclusions in respect of the necessity for Argentina's impugned measures under the BIT. States are basically free to adopt economic and monetary policies of their choice; and this Tribunal is not subjecting past economic policies to any judicial, administrative or political review. It is a fact that economic observers and institutions, looking retrospectively at the causes of Argentina's crisis, have pointed out that Argentina had not carried out, fully or adequately, the various policies that the Fund had recommended, especially as to fiscal balance (in order to sustain the currency board system) and as to cost of labour (in order to maintain the economy's competitiveness). It is also a fact that, at the time, the IMF recognized favourably Argentina's efforts towards the implementation of the recommended policies, even if they had not been enacted fully and had not obtained the expected results. Thus the IMF had continued supporting Argentina all along. It is also a fact that the IMF had recognized the negative impact of various exogenous factors in this failure.339 Even *ex post facto*, however, qualified observers remain in disagreement as to the exact causes of the crisis and the mix of measures that might have avoided it.340\n\nSee specifically the various IMF *Reviews* of the Stand-By Arrangement of March 2000 highlighted above.\n\nSee IMF, *Evaluation Report*, at p. 14.\n\n225.\n\nWe have highlighted above, based on the chronology of relevant facts, contemporary accounts and later analyze, that Argentina's authorities made serious efforts in 2000-2001 to take a number of measures and policies in order to implement the Fund's advice (as part of the IMF Stand-By conditions) and to redress the economic and financial situation under the convertibility regime. These efforts culminated with the zero-deficit law in the summer of 2001, with the IMF recognising these efforts by continuing to extend its support.\n\n226.\n\nIt is a fact that the results were not those expected. The harsh measures recommended were met by public resistance (notably the labour force), could not be successful in the short time span that was available, and could not be realistically implemented as such in view of the organizational shortcomings of Argentina's administrative apparatus. Nor does it appear to the Tribunal that the Argentinean Government can be faulted for not having more energetically pursued these policies. The lenient and benevolent attitude of the Fund which acknowledged in 2001 the difficulties that Argentina had encountered in implementing the conditions of the Stand-By arrangement has also to be taken into account.341 Significantly, even retrospectively, some analysts have expressed the opinion that those measures would have been ineffective to avoid the crisis in any event.342\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, 40: \"[t]he IMF's decision to continue its support during the pre-crisis period, including through its endorsement of policies under the its precautionary arrangement, despite repeated policy slippages, must be evaluated in the context of available alternatives. There was an evident fear among the IMF's shareholders, and the international community at large, that policies would quickly deteriorate in the absence of IMF oversight.\"\n\nSee *Lessons from the Crisis*, 32: \"[t]hus, once the depression was under way, there was no easy way out, as the authorities had no policy instruments that could have enabled them to stimulate the economy without compromising debt sustainability\" (with reference to 1998).\n\n227.\n\nFor the purpose of this Award, we conclude that Argentina made reasonable efforts to take measures that would have, or might have maintained convertibility thus respecting its international obligations connected thereto. In conformity with the concept of \"necessity\" discussed above, we consider that the Government's efforts struck an appropriate balance between that aim and the responsibility of any government towards the country's population: it is self-evident that not every sacrifice can properly be imposed on a country's people in order to safeguard a certain policy that would ensure full respect towards international obligations in the financial sphere, before a breach of those obligations can be considered justified as being necessary under this BIT. The standard of reasonableness and proportionality do not require as much.343\n\nWe recall as to the cost factor that in the GATT-WTO case law an alternative is not to be considered reasonably available if it imposes an \"undue burden\" or \"prohibitive costs.\"\n\n228.\n\nIn exploring alternative policies that Argentina might have pursued in the preceding months that would have made resort to the impugned Measures unnecessary, an early abandonment of the currency board system and of convertibility at par must be considered. In fact several observers, retrospectively, have criticized Argentina and the Fund not for having failed to implement those accompanying policies envisaged by the Stand-By Arrangement that had been recommended at the time, but rather for not having abandoned convertibility earlier, once the sustainability of convertibility appeared to be unlikely under realistic conditions.344\n\nAccording to *Mussa*, 35, \"[i]t is impossible to know at what point sovereign default and a likely collapse of the Convertibility Plan became unavoidable. Perhaps it was already too late by the autumn of 2000.\"\n\n229.\n\nSuch an exit from convertibility could be considered a reasonable alternative if it could have been carried out in an orderly fashion, without forcing upon holders a reduction of the value of their security, by unilateral restructuring below par or by pesification. However, contrary to the Claimant's position, the dominant view in retrospect is that a voluntary restructuring, respectful of holders' rights, within an abandonment of the currency board would not have been viable from at least early 1998345 or 1999.346 Any abandonment of the convertibility in 2000347 or by mid-2001 would have entailed an even more significant reduction of the value of the debt for the creditors in order to avert a general crisis as the one that materialized at the end of the year.348 In legal terms, such a debt forced restructuring would have represented a breach of the terms of the debt instruments being restructured, exactly as was the case for the relevant Measures enacted by Argentina at the end of 2001 - beginning of 2002. Such a pre-emptive or anticipatory default could have been more easily challengeable as to the absence of any \"necessity\" under the BIT.\n\nSee IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 20: \"[i]n retrospect, the years 1996-97 may well have been the last opportunity for Argentina to exit from the peg without facing very high costs. It should be noted however that exit was never an easy option, either politically or economically. The legal consequences of an exit would have been just as significant, given the extensive dollarization of contracts and that it would have meant the breach of a social contract between the state and the public.\"\n\nWith reference to 1998-1999, according to *Lessons from the Crisis*, 34, \"[a] possible alternative approach, at this stage, would have been a preemptive sovereign debt restructuring, which would have provided both sufficient liquidity and net present value relief, combined with a strategy to limit the adverse repercussion on banks' balance sheets (...) However, at that stage, the authorities were understandably reluctant to adopt such a drastic approach, as a sovereign default was regarded as a last resort that should be taken only after all other policy options were exhausted.\" See also IMF, *Evaluation Report*, 66.\n\nAccording to *Mussa*, 19-20, in late autumn 2000 \"[n]ecessarily, this rescheduling of private credits could not be entirely voluntarily, as private creditors would be required to accept significant modifications of their existing claims that would reduce their market value... would be viewed as a *de facto* sovereign default and would likely to be very messy.\"\n\n*Lesson from the Crisis*, 36, 40.\n\n230.\n\nEven if practicable, these \"alternatives\" cannot however be invoked fruitfully by the Claimant as measures that would have respected its dollar-denominated investments in Argentina whilst being sufficient to avoid the crisis. If Argentina had abandoned the parity and convertibility at 1:1 before 2000, Continental could not have made those U.S. dollars denominated investments exchanging at par CNA's income made in peso that it complains have been affected by Argentina devaluation/pesification. If the convertibility board system had been abandoned later, the probability is, as indicated above, that the Claimant would have been subject to the same losses that it challenges here. Therefore the alternative would not have put it in any better situation.\n\n*E. The effect of the applicability of Article XI*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) In general*\n----------------\n\n231.\n\nConcluding that the measures taken by Argentina were necessary to address, through painful means and by retreating from a number of commitments to the public as to the stability and convertibility of the national currency, an impending situation of complete breaking down of the economy, does not imply that the crisis was inevitable. If a different economic and exchange policy had been introduced years before this could have avoided the crisis of 2001-2002. While we have examined this scenario, the causative link between these \"pre-emptive\" policies and the Measures at issue would have been possibly too tenuous to consider them as alternatives that would have rendered these measures unnecessary under Art. XI. In any case, for the reasons just stated, the Claimant would not have profited in respect of its dollar-denominated investments that it made in 2001 on the basis of the fix parity/free convertibility system in place that was soon thereafter to become unsustainable. At the stage when the Measures were adopted it does not appear to the Tribunal that Argentina had the choice to resort generally to alternatives that would have been economically and legally less disruptive.\n\n232.\n\nThe measures were sufficient in their design to address the crisis and were applied in a reasonable and proportionate way at the end of 2001 - 2002.349 They have led to recovery in a context favorable to Argentina's exports. We also note that the relevant Measures were basically limited to the economic and financial aspects of the economic crisis. They did not interfere otherwise with the ordinary conduct of private business activities; they did not entail (re)nationalization of private owned business, nor otherwise interfere with private contracts, including insurance companies (nor does the Claimant complain of any such measure). None of the impugned Measures differentiated between national or companies of Argentina, on the one hand, and foreign or foreign owned companies and businessmen, be they investors or not, on the other hand. CNA was in all respect treated as any other Argentine (insurance) company.\n\nCf. WTO Appellate Body, *EC-Asbestos*, 168, for relying on the aptitude of the design of a measure to reach its objectives as one of the yardsticks in order to uphold its admissibility.\n\n233.\n\nIn sum, based on the evidence adduced by the Parties in these proceedings, we consider that Argentina's conduct in the face of the economic and social crisis conformed, by and large,350 with the conditions required for derogating from its obligations under Art. XI of the BIT as to the Measures challenged in the present dispute. The examination of the Claimant's challenges under the various BIT provisions it has invoked will have therefore to take into account Art. XI, evaluating in more detail whether and how far the defense based on necessity under that provision is relevant and available as to the specific claims of breach and with what effects.351\n\nWe have stated at para. 220 ff. that the restructuring of the LETEs, as concerns CNA, does not appear having met the requirements that would have made it \"necessary.\"\n\nThe concept and evaluation of necessity does not require nor allow the Tribunal to go into the merits in detail and to substitute its own judgment to that of the national authorities, such as considering whether a conversion rate of, let us say, 1.50 would have been more appropriate than the one chosen of 1.40. As already indicated, a margin of discretion and appreciation is generally recognized to national authorities in this respect whenever their conduct is tested under international standards.\n\n*(ii) Has Argentina contributed to necessity?*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nBefore concluding our decisions on necessity, the Tribunal must also deal with the argument that necessity is unavailable to Argentina \"because Argentina contributed\" itself to the state of necessity it invokes. Art. 25 ILC, which excludes the plea of necessity in such a case at para. 2(b), and on which the Claimant relies, cannot be the yardstick as to the application of Art. XI of the BIT for the reasons stated above. Arguably, under Art. XI a Contracting Party may invoke necessity even if the need to protect its essential security interest has materialized as a consequence of a deliberate but still legitimate policy of that very State.352 On the other hand, if a Contracting Party to the BIT has contributed to endangering its essential security interest, for the protection of which it has then adopted the challenged measures, those measures may fail to qualify as \"necessary\" under Art. XI, since that Party could have pursued some other policy that would have rendered them unnecessary.\n\nOne could imagine that country A, which has a BIT in force with country B, adopts an unfriendly attitude or policy towards the latter. Country B reacts in a way that country A considers endangers some of its essential security interests. In order to protect those interests, country A then considers it \"necessary\" to adopt measures limiting movements of funds to country B, or prohibiting investors from country B from engaging senior managerial personnel of nationality B against provisions granting such rights as those found in the Argentina - USA BIT.\n\n235.\n\nIt cannot be denied that a country is always ultimately responsible of its economic policy and of its consequences, at least politically and economically.353 The conduct of economic affairs, as any other affairs, pertains to the Government, so that the state bears the ultimate responsibility for any failure. The Claimant points out that Argentina's own senior authorities did in fact recognize this responsibility.354 Legal evaluation is based however on different parameters. Our analysis in the preceding paragraphs shows that the economic and exchange policies whose ultimate unsustainability led to the crisis were regarded as sound economic policies which had been beneficial for years to Argentina's economy. The fixed parity/convertibility/currency board system was praised by the international financial community and by many qualified observers. It had been recommended by the IMF and received its massive financial assistance, as well as the political support of the United States.355\n\nThe IMF *Evaluation Report*, 64, summing up its \"Major Findings\" states the following: \"[t]he catastrophic collapse of the Argentine economy in 2001-2002 represents the failure of Argentine policy makers to take necessary corrective measures at a sufficiently early stage. The IMF on its part, supported by its major shareholders, also erred in failing to call an earlier halt to support for a strategy that, as implemented, was not sustainable.\" The subsequent (2006) External Evaluation of the IEO Report of 2004, 14, (Argentina's doc. R-294) has criticized this text, as a rearrangement in its final version in order to reduce the Fund's role in the ultimate failure of its program of assistance to Argentina: \"[t]he IEO draft summary of missteps leading up to Argentina's currency collapse focuses on misjudgement by IMF staff and management; the final version of the paragraph focuses on misjudgements by Argentine authorities.\"\n\nThis had been recognized by President Duhalde in the Financial Times, US Edition of February 7, 2002 (\"in the case of Argentina, no one bears more of the blame for the crisis than Argentina itself\"), as the Claimant emphasises, see Claimant's doc. C-111 and Claimant's Reply, para. 13.\n\nSee *Scott*, 576: \"[d]uring the two years leading up to the crisis, the IMF repeatedly loaned Argentina funds. US government officials were involved in each IMF decision.\" This is confirmed in more detailed journalistic terms by *Blustein*, 145 ff, focusing on the support of the US administration in summer 2001 to the IMF policy of assistance to Argentina.\n\n236.\n\nIt is argued that Argentina could have changed course and rejected the advice it was receiving, or on the contrary, that it might have tried to enforce with more determination those supporting policies that had been recommend to it. In either scenario conflicting qualified views have been expressed retrospectively on the soundness and feasibility of those policies or of the alternatives.356 In the light of the analysis available and of the evidence submitted to us we have come to the conclusion that the most likely means to avoid the crisis and the measures adopted to face and overcome it, would have been to adopt different policies years before, against the advice and support that Argentina was receiving from the outside. In this context we do not consider that Argentina because of its own conduct is barred from invoking Art. XI of the BIT.\n\nIn economic matters, the analysis of causation, that is the determination of which facts caused a certain other fact, or whether a certain fact was among the contributory causes of that certain other fact and whether its impact was material, does not lend itself to the same scientific analysis as in the domain of the so-called exact sciences and of natural phenomena. The IMF *Evaluation Report*, dealing with \"Factors Contributing to the Crisis\" at p. 14, notes that \"[t]here is a general agreement that a combination of domestic and external factors contributed to the crisis, but different authors have emphasised different factors as relatively more important,\" such as the weak fiscal policy, the rigid exchange rate regime and adverse external shocks. The Report also distinguishes between \"the underlying factors that generated vulnerability and the immediate factors that triggered the crisis.\"\n\n**VII. Specific Claims of Breaches**\n------------------------------------\n\n*A. Claim of breach of Article V (Freedom of Transfer)*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant complains that CNA was prevented from transferring to the U.S. at par free funds amounting to U.S.$19,000,000 by Decree 1570 of 2001 (*Corralito*) which forbade withdrawals from banks and transfers of funds (which CNA had converted in dollars) out of Argentina. The amount of damages it claims as the loss from devaluation of those funds equivalent to U.S.$14,631,000.357 Continental claims that this prohibition breached its right as an investor to effect \"all transfers related to an investment\" provided for by Art. V of the BIT.358 According to Continental, the proposed transfer concerned \"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\" (Art. V(1) (e)), based on the following reasoning: \"Continental's shares in CNA ART are definitely an investment protected under the BIT. The transfer of the asset of an investment is a transfer related to an investment. Transfers of U.S. dollar term deposits on maturity are also \u2018proceeds from the liquidation of.part of an investment.'\"359\n\nThis amount corresponds to the difference between the original amount calculated in dollars plus interests it would had earn if it would have remained in dollars, minus the pesified amount increased by the interest earned thereon, reconverted in dollar at the current exchange rate at March 2006. See Schedule 8 of the Reply Report of Mr. H. Rosen, expert witness for the Claimant at page 43.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 193 ff.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 195.\n\n238.\n\nAs mentioned above at para. 82, Argentina denies having breached Art. V of the BIT in regards to transfers. First of all, Argentina claims that Art. V concerns only foreign investors and not local subsidiaries as CNA ART. Argentina indicates that Art. V(1)(e) is not applicable here, because it \"protects transfers of the proceeds of the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment,\" that is by the parent company (Continental), while here the bank deposits were held by CNA. Argentina further argues that Art. V does not prevent \"specific regulations for balance-of-payment difficulties\" in view of Art. XI of the BIT and of the \"standards established in multilateral agreements which both Argentina and the United States. have signed,\" with specific mention of the GATT, the GATS and the IMF.360 Argentina also claims that its regulation of monetary transfers conforms with international customary law, as a manifestation of the exercise of monetary sovereignty by States, in view of the severe difficulties in its balance-of-payment.361 Argentina claims that \"if CONTINENTAL wanted to make transfers abroad of money derived from revenues and dividends, they could be made by previously requesting the authorization from the corresponding authority, i.e., \u2018the BCRA,' a request that neither CNA nor Claimant ever made.\"362\n\nArgentina's Rejoinder, para. 295.\n\nArgentina's Rejoinder, para. 297.\n\nArgentina's Rejoinder, para. 306.\n\n239.\n\nThe first issue here is to determine whether the transfer that Continental claims it would have made if the *Corralito* had not prevented it, falls within those \"transfers related to an investment\" which the Parties to the BIT undertook in Art. V to permit \"freely and without delay into or out of its territory.\" This type of provision is a standard feature of BITs: the guarantee that a foreign investor shall be able to remit from the investment country the income produced, the reimbursement of any financing received or royalty payment due, and the value of the investment made, plus any accrued capital gain, in case of sale or liquidation, is fundamental to the freedom to make a foreign investment and an essential element of the promotional role of BITs.363 This explains moreover the detailed list of permitted transfers that most BITs set forth.364 On the other hand, the Treaty terms show that such freedom is not without limit.\n\nUNCTAD, *Transfer of Funds*, Executive Summary, sums up the point as follows: \"[...] a transfer provision ensures that at the end of the day, a foreign investor will be able to enjoy the financial benefits of a successful investment.\"\n\nFor a systematic review of clauses see UNCTAD, *Bilateral Investment Treaties in the Mid-1990s*, 1998, 75; *Dolzer*, *Stevens,* 85.\n\n240.\n\nThe first issue is to determine which transfers are \"related to the investment.\" This is important since in respect of those transfers the U.S. BITs \"prohibit virtually all restrictions,\" thus limiting the Parties' prerogatives under customary international law to impose currency exchange restrictions.365 Guidance is to be found in the detailed (though non-exclusive) list in Art. V(1) and the purpose identified above of this kind of provision. Protected transfers are those essential for, or typical to the making, controlling, maintenance, disposition of investments, especially in the form of companies; or in the form of debt, service and investment contracts, including the making, performance and enforcement of contracts; the acquisition, use, protection and disposition of property of all kinds, including intellectual and industrial property rights; and the borrowing of funds, to name the kind of investments and associated activities mentioned in Art. I of the BIT more relevant to this issue.\n\nSee *Vandevelde*, 139-141.\n\n241.\n\nThe type of transfer at issue here does not fall into any of these categories, nor specifically does it represent the \"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment.\" It was merely a change of type, location and currency of part of an investor's existing investment, namely a part of the freely disposable funds, held short term at its banks by CNA, in order to protect them from the impending devaluation, by transferring them to bank accounts outside Argentina.\n\n242.\n\nThe transfer did not correspond to, nor was it required to satisfy any payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other; nor would it involve the transfer of ownership of the funds involved to some different entity. It was clearly a legitimate operation from a business point of view, permissible under the convertibility regime of Argentina until the *Corralito*. This does not mean that it would fall within the \"transfers related to an investment\" under Art. V. The fact that the BIT does not limit these transfers to those made by the foreign investor itself and that these transfers may be made by the local subsidiary, in favor of its parent company as well of other entities (thus in case of payment of royalties, payments related to loans received etc.), does not mean that any trans-border movement of funds by such subsidiary is \"related to an investment.\"\n\n243.\n\nBoth parties have relied also on the IMF provisions and the connected principles of the multilateral regulation of international payments in support of their position. As is well known, the IMF distinguishes between current transactions and capital movements.\n\nThe \"avoidance of restrictions on current payments\" (Art. VIII), except with the approval of the Fund, is a \"general obligation\" of IMF members, adhered to by their vast majority that do not avail themselves of the transitional regime of Art. XIV. It reflects one of the key purposes of the Fund, \"to assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of payments in respect of current transactions\" as stated in Art. I (iv), as was the case of Argentina when its currency was freely convertible. On the other hand, capital movements may be subject to exchange controls by individual members, *inter alia* in view of their possible speculative nature and destabilizing effects on national economies.\n\n244.\n\nThe above distinction is of limited assistance here, because transfers \"related to an investment\" listed in and allowed by Art. V of the BIT includes both current transactions and capital movements: Art. V may be considered a *lex specialis* in respect of the IMF regime and more liberal than the latter. In any case, capital movements are defined *a contrario* by the definition of \"current transactions\" in Art. XXX of the Fund. Not all capital movements are in themselves \"investments,\" such as direct investments or portfolio investments listed in Art. V of the BIT. In the IMF terminology and classification, widely accepted beyond the Fund's ambit, the movement of capital at issue here was or would have been more specifically a short-term deposit abroad, a transaction which may be subject to tighter controls than direct or portfolio investment transactions.366 This confirms the Tribunal in its conclusion that the transfer which the Claimant complains it could not carry out because of the *Corralito*, namely a short-term placement out of Argentina of the equivalent of $19,000,000, was not a transfer related to an investment protected by Art. V of the BIT.\n\nSee IMF, *Balance of Payments Manual*, 5\u00b0 edition, 1993, Chapters XV and XX. When States commit themselves to allow capital movements, they focus especially on direct investments and reserve the right not to liberalize short term monetary placements abroad of the type discussed here; see OECD *Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements*, and its List B-XI; European Community, *Directives on Capital Movements*, May 11, 1960 and December 18, 1962 (not in force any more), Annex I, List D, and Annex II- IX.\n\n245.\n\nAs a consequence Argentina has committed no breach of Art. V of the BIT to the detriment of the Claimant, so that the latter's claim in this respect must be and is rejected by the Tribunal. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine the subordinate arguments of the Parties: namely (a) whether in view of the acute foreign exchange crisis Argentina was encountering, Argentina was allowed, notwithstanding its obligations under Art. V BIT to introduce the exchange restrictions of Decree 1570, based on Art. XI of the BIT, on the IMF Agreement or under customary international law; (b) whether the Claimant cannot invoke Art. V because neither itself (Continental) nor CNA ever decided to make, or asked to be authorized to effect the transfers at issue;367 and (c) whether the derogations allowed under the *Corralito* would have made those transfers possible.368\n\nAs Argentina correctly points out, there is no cogent evidence in the evidential record that the Claimant intended actually to shift its funds out of Argentina at the time of the *Corralito*. Up to then, the Claimant had made the deliberate choice of keeping its funds in Argentina (see above para. 132), converting them from pesos into dollar-denominated instruments.. CNA thus acted as \"a good corporate citizen\" of Argentina and did not participate in the capital flight of the second part of 2001 which lead to the imposition of the *Corralito.*\n\nSee above footnote 197.\n\n*B. Claim of breach of Article II (2)(a) (Fair and Equitable Treatment)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) In general*\n---------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant has severely criticized the behavior of Argentina towards its investments during the crisis; in its view Argentina \"promised to refrain from interference with Bank Deposits, then froze and pesified them;\"369 \"promised to honor its government debt, then defaulted on and pesified it.\"370 The Claimant submits that these Measures breached the BIT's obligation to treat it, as a U.S. investor, in a fair and equitable manner and according to the international law standard of treatment, contrary to Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT. This Article provides that: \"[i]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\" Specifically according to the Claimant, this article obliges Argentina \"to provide a stable legal and business environment\"371 and \"to protect investors' legitimate expectations.\"372\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 53.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 70.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 181 ff.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 188 ff.\n\n247.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in the light of what it considers to be the legal import of these Treaty standards and in view of the commitments Argentina had undertaken in respect of its monetary system, of the protection of private investments and of the terms of the debt instruments it had issued, Argentina has breached the standards of Art. II (2)(a) BIT: through Decree 1570 (*Corralito*); by pesification of bank deposits through Decree 214; by pesification of government debt through Decree 471; by the unilateral rescheduling of deposits and default on debt.373\n\nClaimant's Reply, paras. 216-229.\n\n248.\n\nArgentina opposes the Claimant's claim concerning the alleged violation of Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT.374 According to Argentina, the fair and equitable treatment standard (as well as the other treatment standards mentioned in the same paragraph) must be applied considering especially the circumstances under which such measures were adopted, namely the \"dramatic economic situation\" that Argentina was experiencing when the challenged Measures were enacted. According to Argentina, the traditional \"minimum standard\" of treatment of aliens is the one relevant under Art. II(2)(a), so that \"investments made by Continental, as it happens with the remaining foreign investments, have been considered in accordance with international law.\"375 Argentina then explains why in its view the Measures it had adopted since December 2001 are in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment: \"[t]hese measures constituted a reasonable, good faith and non discriminatory answer to the most serious crisis that the country had ever suffered which, over time, had a positive effect on the country in general and on the investments of Continental and CNA ART in particular.\"376 Argentina opposes the reliance by the Claimant on the alleged respect required for the Claimant's \"legitimate expectations,\" submitting that the standard at issue does not justify the foreign investor expecting that regulation will never change; specifically it does not prevent re-adaptation in an exceptional situation of emergency. In any case, as already indicated Argentina claims that the Measures challenged were necessary to counteract the crisis and are thus covered by its invocation of Art. XI of the BIT.377\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 492.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 501 ff.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 571 and 625.\n\nArgentina's Reply, paras. 22-23, 56, 71, 80 and 365 ff.\n\n249.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the legal content of the \"fair and equitable\" standard of treatment in Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT. They especially disagree as to whether, factually, the abrupt radical change of the legal setting concerning Argentina's currency, exchange mechanism, and the regime of financial instruments in circulation in the crisis period, as it affected the Claimant's investments, was a breach of such standard.\n\n250.\n\nOne of Claimant's central arguments is that this standard requires as an essential element \"a stable legal and business environment,\"378 an obligation that (in its view) is also entailed by the undertaking of the host State to provide full protection and security.379 The Claimant submits that since such a stable environment must be granted by a host State acting in good faith, an investor such as Continental has a \"legitimate expectation\" that this will be the case.\n\nSee *CMS* Award, paras. 274-280; *Occidental Exploration and Product Company* Award, paras. 183-186; *Tecmed* Award, paras. 153-156 which the Claimant refers to. See Claimant's Reply, para. 182 ff.\n\nClaimant relies on *Azurix* Award, para. 408. See Claimant's Reply, para. 186.\n\n251.\n\nThus the Claimant had \"legitimate expectations\" that the convertibility regime of Argentina would not be changed, so that free transfer would be maintained, existing dollar-denominated securities and deposits would not be compulsory transformed in pesos at a below-market rate and their terms would be respected (all of which did not happen in Argentina's crisis). The Claimant concludes that since Argentina subverted the business environment it failed to respect the Claimant's rights.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant relies as a basis for its alleged legitimate expectations on a series of acts and pronouncements by Argentina's authorities from different sources and having unequal legal value. Thus, the Claimant invokes the Intangibility Law of September 24, 2001 by which \"Argentina assured investors that Argentina would not interfere with bank deposits. The Investor relied on Argentina's representations to keep its money in Argentina. Argentina's subsequent asset freeze failed to fulfill the Investor's legitimate expectation that Argentina would not interfere with its deposits.\"380 Also the pesification in itself is claimed to be contrary to this standard in conjunction with the Intangibility Law.381 The Claimant also relies on certain public statements by Minister Cavallo, undertaking not to abandon the convertibility regime, as well as on the terms of the GGLs382 and of the LETEs.383\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 219.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 223 with reference to the *CMS* Award, paras. 275 and 281.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 228.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 230.\n\n253.\n\nArgentina on the other hand submits that the fair and equitable treatment standard does not oblige further treatment or treatments beyond what is required by virtue of the minimum standard of international customary law. This standard is related to notions such as natural justice or lack of discrimination and does not refer, as results also by the more recent agreements amongst states, to the legal and business framework stability, or the expectations or \"basic assumptions\" of foreign investors. Argentina relies on the NAFTA arbitral awards concerning the application of fair and equitable treatment standard. Quoting the NAFTA Tribunal in the *Waste Management II* case, Argentina submits that the minimum standard of fair and equitable treatment is breached if the State's conduct is \"arbitrary, grossly unfair unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offense judicial propriety- as might be the case with the manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process.\"384 Argentina relies also on the position recently taken by several states, including the United States of America, with regard to the content of this standard, as expressed in the context of the NAFTA, the FTA with Chile, and the U.S. Model BIT of 2004.385 In summary, according to Argentina, \"to determine whether the Argentine Republic acted in accordance with the principle of good faith it is necessary to evaluate whether allegedly offensive measures invoked adopted by the Argentine Republic were dishonest, unreasonable or unfair.\"386 Applying the abovementioned criteria, the challenged measures appear honest, reasonable and fair, so Argentina submits that that it did not act in bad faith.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 538-543.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, paras. 501-516.\n\nArgentina's Counter-Memorial, para. 567.\n\n254.\n\nIt is generally accepted that the \"fair and equitable\" standard of treatment has an important role in the protection of foreign investments, which explains the inclusion of this standard in BITs and other international instruments dealing with foreign investment. It is especially important for direct investments which are usually made for a considerable duration and whose profitability and economic contribution to the host country's economy are dependent on them being treated by local authorities in a way which is coherent with the ordinary conduct of business activity. While the requirements of a lawful expropriation focuses on the preservation of the value of the investment when the host State precludes its further operation for some public reasons, the fair and equitable standard is aimed at assuring that the normal law-abiding conduct of the business activity by the foreign investor is not hampered without good reasons by the host government and other authorities. However, in every case, it is first necessary to interpret the wording of the particular Fair and Equitable Treatment standard incorporated in the BIT at issue. It does not follow that, whatever that wording, the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard should always be the lower minimum standard under customary international law.\n\n255.\n\nMoreover, the content of the obligation incumbent upon the host state to treat a foreign investor in a fair and equitable manner, even when applicable \"at all times\" as specified in Art. II(2)(a) of the BIT, varies in part depending on the circumstances in which the standard is invoked: the concept of fairness being inherently related to keeping justice in variable factual contexts.387 This explains the considerable debate surrounding the main features of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard generally as well as its relations, especially in the context of BITs and similar instruments, with others standards that are often spelled out in conjunction with it, such as \"full protection and security\" and, of course, the minimum international standard.388\n\n*Noble Ventures* Award, para. 181.\n\nSee generally OECD, *International Investment Law, A Changing Landscape,* 2005, Chapter 3 \"Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law,\" 73-125.\n\n256.\n\nIt is not necessary for us here to go more into that debate. The issue here is relatively straightforward: whether certain abrupt and fundamental changes made by Argentina to its exchange and currency regime because of the 2001-2002 economic and financial crisis, with the aim of resolving it, including the traumatic blocking of bank accounts, the pesification of deposits and financial instruments, the default and subsequent restructuring of the same, made the treatment of the Claimant's investment not \"fair and equitable.\"\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimant has framed its claim in terms of \"legitimate expectations.\" It submits that it was entitled to rely legally under the BIT on the existing exchange and currency regime which existed when it made its investment in the insurance sector of Argentina, so that when this was changed to its detriment, it was entitled to claim indemnification. The Claimant does not rely on the convertibility regime of 1991 *per se*. It rather points out to certain specific legislative enactments and contractual undertakings of Argentina (the Intangibility Law and the terms of issuance of the GGL's respectively) in order to support its claim that its expectations of stability were \"legitimate.\" In respect of GGLs, the Claimant also points to the circumstances that the complete subversion of the monetary regime happened just weeks after the solemn and formal statements contained in those instruments.\n\n258.\n\nStability of the legal framework for investments is mentioned in the Preamble of the BIT. It is not a legal obligation in itself for the Contracting Parties, nor can it be properly defined as an object of the Treaty. It is rather a precondition for one of the two basic objects of the Treaty, namely the promotion of the investment flow, rather than being related to its other objective, that of granting protection for investments on a reciprocal basis. Stability of the legal framework is undoubtedly conducive to attracting foreign investments, especially direct investments where business plans can extend over a number of years; and even more so in respect of those where initial investments are substantial and are recouped only over a long period of time. On the other hand, it would be unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose. Such an implication as to stability in the BIT's Preamble would be contrary to an effective interpretation of the Treaty; reliance on such an implication by a foreign investor would be misplaced and, indeed, unreasonable. In any case, it is uncontested that the legal and regulatory regime for CNA's insurance business in general remained stable throughout the crisis.\n\n259.\n\nThe situation of the foreign investor at issue here is therefore different from that raised in other cases relied upon by the Claimant, many of them concerning different Measures that Argentina adopted in the crisis. In the present case, general pronouncements are mostly at issue, predominantly of a legislative type. Moreover, the features of the legal or contractual regime at issue here were applicable or addressed either to the generality of Argentina's public, or to a wide range of depositors and subscribers of certain financial instruments. Moreover, the general legislative \"assurances\" were not the basis on which Continental had relied in making its investment in Argentina, since it had entered in that market before such assurances.\n\n260.\n\nBy contrast, in most cases invoked by Continental as \"precedents,\"389 specific undertakings were at issue, legislative, administrative or contractual (some of them by local authorities) directed or agreed with the investor, on the basis of which and in reliance upon the aggrieved investor had actually made its investment and committed long term resources. Without here entering into an evaluation of those cases, there are significant factual and contextual differences with the present case as to the application of the abstract concept of \"reasonable legitimate expectations.\"\n\nContrary to the case before this Tribunal, the **CMS** Tribunal evaluated the pesification as a breach of the BIT not *per se* but in connection with Argentina's obligations under the Gas sector special legal regime (i.e. the tariff regime calculated in dollars and the US PPI adjustment of the gas tariffs). The pesification was adjudged there to be contrary to the BIT's obligations in its relationship with those specific guarantees that were addressed by Argentina to foreign investors under the Gas sector legal regime and \"were crucial for the investment decision\" (**CMS** Award, para. 275).\n\n261.\n\nIn summary, in order to evaluate the relevance of that concept applied within Fair and Equitable Treatment standard and whether a breach has occurred, relevant factors include:\n\ni) the specificity of the undertaking allegedly relied upon390 which is mostly absent here, considering moreover that political statements have the least legal value, regrettably but notoriously so;\n\nii) general legislative statements engender reduced expectations, especially with competent major international investors in a context where the political risk is high. Their enactment is by nature subject to subsequent modification, and possibly to withdrawal and cancellation, within the limits of respect of fundamental human rights and *ius cogens* ;\n\niii) unilateral modification of contractual undertakings by governments, notably when issued in conformity with a legislative framework and aimed at obtaining financial resources from investors deserve clearly more scrutiny, in the light of the context, reasons, effects, since they generate as a rule legal rights and therefore expectations of compliance;\n\niv) centrality to the protected investment and impact of the changes on the operation of the foreign owned business in general including its profitability is also relevant; - good faith, absence of discrimination (generality of the measures challenged under the standard), relevance of the public interest pursued by the State, accompanying measures aimed at reducing the negative impact are also to be considered in order to ascertain fairness.\n\nSuch as those inherent in contractual obligations undertaken by Argentina abroad subject to foreign law, such as bond issuances on international financial markets.\n\n262.\n\nIn light of the above criteria the Tribunal concludes on the facts of this case that:\n\ni) Continental cannot invoke legitimate expectations as to the change of the convertibility regime of 1991, notwithstanding political declarations by various authorities that convertibility would not be abandoned.\n\nii) Continental should have maintained a reduced trust in the Intangibility Law of September 2001, since this was enacted when the worsening of the crisis was evident and indeed made in order to try to support dwindling confidence in the sustainability of the convertibility. (Even more so since Continental and CNA were professional operators in the financial sector).\n\niii) As far as the de-dollarization and its specific modalities could be considered contrary to any fair and equitable treatment in the light of previous assurances by Argentina (including the Intangibility Law),391 the Tribunal considers that the necessity defense under Art. XI is available to Argentina for the reasons explained above.\n\niv) The Measures were not discriminatory;392 they were general, affecting all sectors of the national economy and all classes of depositors and investors, nor did they affect the carrying-on of the insurance business of Continental in respect of which the reliance on stability of the legal environment could have been properly focused.393\n\nThe Intangibility Law was explicitly suspended for the duration of the public emergency by Art. 15 of the Public Emergency Law 25,561 of January 6, 2002.\n\nOn the contrary, Argentina did consider the special position of depositors and their expectations where it converted only these US dollar denominated deposits at the different rate of 1.4:1, at the cost of the Nation's Treasury.\n\nAs it results from the Annual Reports and accounts of CNA, its pre-tax earnings amounted to pesos 2,083,067 at June 30, 2000; pesos 1,706,399 at June 30, 2001 (Claimant's doc. C-354); pesos 17,596,761 at June 30, 2002; pesos 51,761,466 at June 30, 2003 (Claimant's doc. C-355); pesos 28,610,648 at March 31, 2004; pesos 25,286,027 at March 31, 2005; pesos 17,596,761 at June 30, 2002 (Claimant's docs. C-355), (Claimant's doc. C-90 and C-91).\n\n263.\n\nAs to Measures which directly affected the investor in subverting certain contractual obligations, the Claimant impugns them for having been taken shortly after investors such as CNA had been induced to accept those obligations (namely the GGLs). In this respect the Tribunal considers that the plea of necessity by Argentina under Art. XI of the BIT precludes any further analysis aimed at evaluating their compatibility with Art. II (2)(a). The Tribunal recalls that it has signaled above that in any case the impugned Measures, including the subsequent restructuring of the GGLs, comply with the requirements of non discrimination, correspondence to their objective, and good faith.\n\n264.\n\nAs to the LETEs, on the contrary, we have already decided that the defence of necessity, both under Art. XI of the BIT and under the principles of customary international law, is not available to Argentina as to the conditions of their restructuring in December 2004 and that the terms of the unilateral restructuring were by then unreasonable;394 notably where they implied a waiver of all rights by the holders, who were being subjected to a substantial loss of their investment, in addition to having been previously subjected to losses due to pesification.\n\nSee above paras. 220-222.\n\n265.\n\nThe breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment concerns the restructuring (not the pesification of the LETEs), since we have found that the pesification generally is covered by the defense of necessity. The loss sustained by the Claimant to be made good by Argentina because of its breach of the Fair and Equitable standard in the BIT amounts, therefore, to the dollar equivalent of the pesified amount of the LETEs in November-December 2004, as indicated by the Claimant in U.S.$2.8 million, plus interest as determined hereunder.395\n\nAs to the calculation of interest see hereunder para. 303 ff.\n\n266.\n\nIn conclusion, save for the LETEs, the Tribunal considers that the invocation of necessity by Argentina under Art. XI of the BIT is applicable to all other claims by the Claimant for breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard by Argentina's Measures. The Tribunal decides accordingly that Argentina has not breached its obligations under Art. II (2) (a), by these Measures, except as to the LETEs.\n\n*b) Capital gain tax*\n---------------------\n\n267.\n\nContinental complains of the capital tax that was imposed in accordance of existing tax legislation on the gain allegedly made by CNA, when its investments in dollar-denominated financial assets up to then accounted for at one peso for one dollar, were converted in pesos at 1.4:1. Continental submits that the increase of the peso value was purely nominal: through the pesification it had suffered a substantial loss in the real value of its investment which amounted also to a partial expropriation. In any case the imposition of the tax on such a non-existent profit amounts to unfair treatment.396\n\nClaimant's Memorial, paras. 216-218.\n\n268.\n\nArgentina denies any wrongdoing under the BIT. It points out that CNA's accounts were in pesos (as were all corporate accounts in the country) and that the tax is a general pre-existing fiscal measure applicable to capital gains by companies. It was thus properly due by CNA since its accounts showed a capital value increase due only to the conversion of dollar-denominated assets at 1.4:1, thanks to the preferential rate of the pesification applied, while before they had be valued under the convertibility / par regime at 1:1.\n\n269.\n\nWe recognize that, at first glance, it seems odd that a company holding dollar-denominated assets which by effect of the forceful conversion is left with a peso amount much inferior to the peso equivalent resulting had a market rate been applied, must also pay a capital gain tax on such a nominal increase of value. However, such a tax regime is far from unusual. Moreover, it has to be kept in mind that, in conformity with the nominalistic principle, the currency of Argentina was the peso; CNA's corporate accounts were naturally expressed in pesos, as were both its revenues from its insurance activity and its costs. Thus, during the convertibility regime any of CNA's assets (and income) denominated in dollars was necessarily recorded in its accounts in pesos at the rate of 1:1. When these assets held in Argentina were converted in pesos at 1.4:1, CNA realized an \"exchange gain,\" to be recorded in the assets part of the balance sheet and which was not balanced by any corresponding item in the liability side. As a result, this gain was properly considered a capital gain, subject to the general applicable tax regime. The reduced external value of all peso assets of CNA was not something that could be recorded and have an effect within those accounts governed by Argentina's legislation. The reduced net value of CNA, as an effect of the devaluation of the peso vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar, diminished the value of any Argentina-based assets in term of any other stable currency. This was material for the U.S. parent company and was properly registered in its accounts. However, from an accounting perspective within Argentina it was neutral and irrelevant.\n\n270.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the claim of Continental concerning the application of the capital gain tax has therefore no basis under Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT, nor for the same reasons does it constitute an expropriation under Art. IV of the BIT. It is therefore rejected by the Tribunal.\n\n*C. Claim of breach of Article IV (Prohibition of Direct and Indirect Expropriation)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimant has also impugned several of Argentina's Measures as representing an indirect, creeping or partial expropriation of CNA's investments in breach of Art. IV(1) of the BIT. According to this provision:\n\nInvestments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2).\n\n272.\n\nMore specifically Claimant considers that such an expropriation has resulted from:\n\ni) the pesification of CAN's dollar-denominated deposits and securities at a much \"below market exchange rate;\"\n\nii) the restructuring of the GGLs at terms that did not reflect their acquisition value; and\n\niii) the fact that the LETEs have been deprived of their value after CNA had not accepted the \"unreasonable\" terms of their restructuring offered by Argentina on May 31 and September 16 of 2002.397\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 55.\n\n273.\n\nArgentina opposes this claim as being groundless.398 Argentina invokes the principle that each state is sovereign as to the management of the exchange rate of its currency, so that devaluation does not give rise to a claim of damages by those affected neither under general international law nor under the BIT. Argentina further claims that the pesification consisted in a new regulation of the pegging of the peso to the dollar, in respect to domestic deposits and financial instruments which had until then benefited from the convertibility-at-par regime. Argentina claims that it was within its prerogatives to put an end to convertibility, compulsorily reconverting the domestic dollar-denominated instruments in pesos at the same rate of 1:1, especially in view of the serious reasons that had led it to abandon convertibility at par.399 The fact that as a result the peso devaluated so much more on the free market, so that the real value of the formerly dollar-denominated instruments decreased at the same rate as the peso vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar is for Argentina immaterial. Argentina also points out that depositors such as CNA received a preferential treatment in that their holdings were converted at 1:1.4.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 321-326, 571 ff.\n\nArgentina refers as a relevant precedent to the prohibition of the gold-indexation of obligations in the USA in 1933. See U.S. Supreme Court, *Perry v. United States*, 249 U.S. 330 (1935), 294 U.S. 330, also referred to extensively in the *Bustos* decision of the Supreme Court. See also in this respect *Nussbaum*, 415, pointing out that \"[a]lmost all the of the gold dollar bonds floated after World War I by foreign debtors in the United States are uncontestedly subject to American law.\"\n\n274.\n\nArgentina in any case invokes the defense of necessity, both under Art. XI of the BIT and under the principles of customary international law. It points out that, in view of the economic emergency the country was facing, the Emergency Law expressly suspended the application of the Intangibility Law which had declared deposits \"intangible.\" It also points out that Argentina's Supreme Court, reversing its initial position, has recognized since the *Bustos* decision of October 26, 2004, that the emergency situation in which the country had fallen at the end of 2001 justified for public purposes a restriction on the right of private property such as those introduced by the emergency legislation. The Supreme Court had considered that this was a general regulation that had been applied fairly and reasonably and that therefore did not give rise to indemnification under Argentina's Constitution, which in that respect reflects an approach shared by most democratic constitutions and by international law.400\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 366.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that most of the allegations brought by the Claimant under the heading of expropriation (breach of Art. IV of the BIT) are substantially the same and are addressed to the same Measures impugned as breaches of the fair and equitable standard of Art. (II)(2)(a) of the BIT. We have already found that the defense of necessity under the BIT is available to Argentina as concerns most claims of breach that Continental has raised against the Measures, namely the pesification of dollar-denominated deposits and the restructuring of GGL's.401 The same defense based on Art. XI, leading to the nonapplicability of the various BIT substantive obligations, is available in respect of Art. IV of the BIT. We do not need therefore to go further into the claims for breach of Art. IV than is required for our decision.\n\nIn fact the Claimant agreed that should the Tribunal find a breach of the BIT in its favour under both accounts, the damages claimed should not be duplicated. See Claimant's Reply, para. 380.\n\n276.\n\nIt is appropriate to distinguish those Measures adopted by Argentina that appear to be legitimate under the BIT, from those which are carved out because of the application of Art. XI. As a starting point we refer to the distinction generally accepted in international law and spelled out in some treaties,402 notably in recent BITs,403 between two types of encroachments by public authorities on private property: (i) On the one hand, there are certain types of measures or state conduct that are considered a form of expropriation because of their material impact on property, and which are legitimate only if adopted for public purpose, without discrimination, and against the payment of compensation according to the general or specific applicable standards. One may distinguish between: (a) outright suppression or deprivation of the right of ownership, usually by its forced transfer to public entities; (b) limitations and hampering with property, short of outright suppression or deprivation, interfering with one or more key features, such as management, enjoyment, transferability, which are considered as tantamount to expropriation, because of their substantial impact on the effective right of property. Both of these types of measures entail indemnification under relevant international treaties, as well as under most constitutions which respect fundamental human rights.404 (ii) On the other hand, there are limitations to the use of property in the public interest that fall within typical government regulations of property entailing mostly inevitable limitations imposed in order to ensure the rights of others or of the general public (being ultimately beneficial also to the property affected). These restrictions do not impede the basic, typical use of a given asset and do not impose an unreasonable burden on the owner as compared with other similarly situated property owners.405 These restrictions are not therefore considered a form of expropriation and do not require indemnification, provided however that they do not affect property in an intolerable, discriminatory or disproportionate manner.406\n\nNotably Art. 1, Protocol I European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedom (ECHR).\n\nSee US Model BIT 2004, Annex B [Expropriation].\n\nSee generally R. Higgins, *The Taking of Property under International Law*, RC (1982), vol. III, 268; C. Leben, *La libert\u00e9 normative de l'\u00c9tat et la question de l'expropriation indirecte*, C. Leben (Ed.), *Le contentieux arbitral transnational relatif \u00e0 l'investissement*, 2006, 163 ff.; *Feldman* Award, para. 112.\n\nThese limitations should not burden without good reason certain owners only, which would otherwise be made to bear the burden of an advantage that benefits instead a wider group.\n\nSee Art. 1, First Protocol to the ECHR; US Model BIT 2004, Annex B [Expropriation]; Third Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987), 712 (g). For an overview see OECD, *International Investment Law, A Changing Landscape*, 2005, Chapter 2 \"Indirect Expropriation\" and the \"Right to Regulate\" in International Investment Law, 43-72.\n\n277.\n\nIt is well known that the distinction is not always easy, that in different historical and social contexts the line has been drawn differently and that different international tribunals, including arbitration tribunals under various BITs, have relied on different criteria and have given different weight to them, such as those recognizing the public interest on the one side and those protecting the integrity of property rights on the other. Different tribunals have come to different evaluations as to the definition of a specific measure brought forward for their decision and its classification in the first or second category.407\n\nThus the *Saluka* and *Methanex* Tribunals have emphasized the different qualitative nature of the regulation at issue in those cases (see also *Olguin* and *LG&E*), while other Tribunals, such as *Vivendi*, have relied on the criterion of the intensity of the encroachment on property (the effect-doctrine).\n\n278.\n\nThe fixing of an exchange rate and deciding the mechanism by which the national currency may be exchanged for foreign currency and its conditions, including the possibility of maintaining accounts and deposits denominated in a foreign currency within the country, pertain to the monetary sovereignty of each State. These policies fall under the second above-mentioned category (ii); they do not render the State liable for the burden or losses that may be suffered by those affected, provided there is no discrimination or unfairness in their application. The above-mentioned and related prerogatives may be of course limited by international obligations, such as those applying to the members of the IMF. The Argentina-U.S. BIT does not contain specific limitations in this respect, except for the \"freedom of transfer\" provision of Art. V. Other Treaty provisions may have, however, an impact, such as the MFN commitment and the fair and equitable treatment obligations, if breached by a Contracting Party in the management of its exchange policy. The Claimant itself recognizes that the BIT does not afford protection against devaluation, nor was it subject to discrimination in that respect.\n\n279.\n\nAs to the pesification of existing dollar denominated financial assets within Argentina, subject to its domestic law, there is no basis in our view for the Claimant's case that any compulsory conversion in peso has to be measured against the floating market value of the peso against the dollar at the time of the conversion, to the effect that the difference amounts to an expropriation that Argentina has to make good in damages.408 The issue is rather whether Argentina had given a commitment to the foreign investor that those assets would be linked to the U.S. dollar, thereby meaning the convertible currency of the U.S. under U.S. law, and would be immune from any evolution of the currency regime within Argentina. We cannot detect from the evidence any such specific commitment. Any commitment in this respect would relate, as we have already mentioned, to the fair and equitable treatment standard; namely whether Argentina had given rise to some specific \"legitimate expectations\" addressed to and relied upon by the foreign investor that its dollar denominated domestic deposits would be immune from any encroachment. We have already discussed this issue under the fair and equitable standard above, denying generally the Claimant's claim of breach. We came there also to the conclusion that, as far as these expectations might have had a basis, the proper invocation of Art. XI of the BIT by Argentina does not allow us to analyze the matter further under Art. II(2)(a) of the BIT (except in respect of the LETEs restructuring).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that other international tribunals have also denied that in most instances of devaluation an expropriation of private property under international standards is present, except in extreme situations of improper conduct by the State. This is the consistent jurisprudence of the ECHR under Protocol 1 to the ECHR protecting private property. See its presentation by former ECHR President Wildhaber, 253 ff. See also for the absence of any\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the invocation by the Claimant of the Intangibility Law also under Art. IV of the BIT protecting U.S. investors in case of expropriation. The argument is to the effect that since Argentina itself has declared the dollar deposits as protected property in their \"real dollar value\" under the Constitution, thus precluding the Government from affecting their value by pesification, the contrary action by the Government during the crisis must result in an expropriation of private property under Art. IV since assets defined as property in Art. I (a) of the BIT were thereby materially affected.\n\n281.\n\nWe recall that the claims before us are brought under the BIT and not Argentina's law and that breaches of a treaty standard and breach of similar protection in domestic law are not necessarily interconnected. A given act or conduct by public authorities that constitute a breach of domestic law does not necessarily represent also a breach of international law.409 The law of Argentina is therefore of limited relevance for us, such duty under international law as to obligations in domestic currency subject to the nominalistic principle *Mann*, 465 ff; Genevi\u00e8ve Burdeau, *L'exercice des comp\u00e9tences mon\u00e9taires par les Etats*, RC 1988-V, 261 (except for \"des conditions totalement arbitraires.\") including Supreme Court's decisions interpreting the Constitution.410 On the other hand, if some of the Measures at issue here had been found finally unconstitutional by the highest judicial authority of Argentina because in breach of the basic protection to property rights that Argentina's Constitution grants in line with principles generally accepted, it would appear awkward that the same measure would not be in breach of the BIT standards.\n\nICJ, *Elsi*, para. 73.\n\nThe parties have argued at length the issue of the constitutionality of certain Measures at issue (especially the *Corralito* and the pesification) under Argentina's Constitution. The parties have drawn opposite conclusions from the fact that initially the Supreme Court decided against the constitutionality (*Smith* and *San Luis* decisions of February 1, 2002 and March 5, 2003 respectively, Claimant's doc. C-80 and C-81) while it thereafter reversed its stance in 2004 after a majority of judges had been replaced by the executive power (*Bustos* decision of October 26, 2004, Argentina's doc. RA-33).\n\n282.\n\nIn this respect the Supreme Court of Argentina has always relied on generally accepted principles, recognized beyond the legal system of Argentina. They had been spelled out and applied most recently before the 2001-2002 crisis in the leading *Peralta* case of 1990. At issue was one of the restrictive measures taken in Argentina to cope with the inflation of the 1980s, namely that providing the reimbursement of deposits in part with long term bonds.411 The Supreme Court held in that case that in a situation of emergency there is no violation of fundamental property rights \"when for reasons of necessity a regulation is enacted that does not deprive individuals of their economic rights recognized by law nor denies their property, but restraints temporally the enjoyment of those benefits or the use that may be made of that property.\" As to the crisis of 2001-2002, the decisions *Smith* of 2002 and *San Luis* of 2003 had adhered to that standard, but had concluded that the Measures challenged (pesification and postponement of due dates of deposits) had restricted unreasonably the substance of the right of property of those affected. In the *Bustos* decision of 2004 instead, the Supreme Court (consistently followed thereafter) held that in a situation of generalized necessity, duly determined by the legislative power, non-discriminatory Measures such as the forced conversion of deposits in foreign currency were lawful under Art. 17 of the Constitution, in that they were reasonable limitations to private property in face of the severe emergency of 2001-2002. In its 2004 decision the Court balanced differently the compression of individual economic rights against the need to preserve society in a state of adversity and of serious perturbation of physical, economic or other nature.412 It is the acute crisis, and possibly only the acute nature of the crisis, that ultimately has justified the judicial upholding of the \"suspension,\" or rather the revocation of the legislative pronouncement contained in the Intangibility Law, by which just a few months before Argentina's Parliament had aimed to reassure the citizens of the country of the stability of the convertibility regime also for the future.413\n\nDecision of December 27, 1990, Claimant's doc. C-276.\n\nSee at p. 4496: *\"[e]l derecho positivo argentino es particularmente expl\u00edcito en lo que concierne a la legitimidad de la suspensi\u00f3n de los derechos personales como recurso propio del poder de polic\u00eda, a fin de proteger el inter\u00e9s p\u00fablico en presencia de desastres o graves perturbaciones de car\u00e1cter f\u00edsico, econ\u00f3mico, o de otra \u00edndole, siempre que no se altere la sustancia de tales derechos.\" See also at p. 4497: \"[p]ara superar el estado de aversidad que implica una situaci\u00f2n de emergencia, todos los sectores deben deponer sus intereses individuales en pos del bienestar general y, con tal fin, la medidas no se limitaron a convertir a pesos los depositos constituidos en monedas extranjeras, sino que previeron mecanismos de compensation para morigerar la p\u00e9rdida de valor que necessariamente trae aparejado el abandono del sistema de convertibilitad, decision de politica economica sobre cuyo acierto no pueden pronunciarse los jueces.\"*\n\nIn evaluating the nature of Argentina's crisis and in holding reasonable the Measures adopted to cope with it the *Bustos* decision appears to have benefited also from the temporal perspective that was absent in the earlier decisions; see. for the relevance of this perspective WTO Appellate Body, *EC-Tyres* on necessity, supra at footnote 294.\n\n283.\n\nWe reject therefore Continental's claims of breach of Art. IV, as far as the matter is not excluded from our scrutiny by the application of Art. XI.\n\n284.\n\nExpropriation, even indirect, requires a certain level of sacrifice of private property in order to be found. Minor losses that are an incidental consequence to a general regulation of the economy adopted in the public interest are not considered to be expropriation giving rise to indemnification as highlighted before. This is applicable to the delays in payments of interest (that were subsequently made) and in the issuance of certain bonds (that were in any case delivered later to CNA) of which Continental complains. In the disarray Argentina was facing in 2002, these non compliances are covered in any case by the plea of necessity under the BIT.\n\n285.\n\nBefore concluding, we recall that we have found above that the restructuring of the LETEs held by CNA was not covered by the defense of necessity both under the BIT and the principles of customary international law and caused substantial loss to the Claimant. This has led the Tribunal to hold that the restructuring as concerns CNA was in breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT and that Claimant is entitled to indemnification for that loss in the form of damages. Continental has claimed that the restructuring and its implementation constitute at the same time an expropriation and has asked indemnification under either provision of the BIT in an amount corresponding to the original dollar nominal value of those LETEs. Having already decided the same issue under Art. II(2)(a) BIT, we do not need to pronounce further on the alternative claim of violation of Art. IV submitted by the Claimant.\n\n*D. Claim of Breach of Article II (2)(c) (\"Umbrella clause\")*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nContinental claims that a) the obligations observance clause of Art. II (2)(c) requires Argentina to observe contractual obligations entered into with American investors, including the ones given to their Argentinean subsidiaries; and b) that forum selection clauses do not bar claims for a breach of the obligations observance clause. Art. II (2)(c) BIT states that: \"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" This form of clause is often known and described as an \"umbrella clause.\"\n\n287.\n\nRelying principally on the *CMS* Award, Continental claims that, \"when the investment is a local company, the ordinary meaning of obligations entered into \u2018with regard to investments' includes obligations entered into with that investment. An obligation entered into with an investment is an obligation entered into with regard to the investment.\"414 In other words, the Claimant considers that the object of the BIT is to encourage and protect investment and that CNA is a Continental investment protected under the BIT. Therefore the so\u2014called umbrella clause in the BIT has to be interpreted as covering not only the obligations Argentina entered into directly with the Claimant investor as a U.S. company, but also those Argentina entered into with Continental's investment (namely the local subsidiary of the foreign investor), thus CNA.\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 138.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant submits accordingly that \"Argentina breached its obligations under Art. II (2)(c) by not observing its contractual obligations to CNA ART\" under the following debt contacts: the GGLs (Guaranted Loan contracts), the LETEs (Treasury Bills contracts) and the BODEN 2013 bond contracts.415\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 122.\n\n289.\n\nMore specifically, with regard to the GGLs416 the Claimant submits that \"the government breached the contractual term requiring payment in U.S. dollars\": a) \"by forcefully converting the dollar-denominated GGL into pesos through Decree 471 on March 8, 2002; and b) by diminishing the security interest underlying the GGLs through Decree 644 of April 18, 2002.\"417\n\nAs to the issuance of the GGLs in swap for others governmental securities held by CNA see above para. 133 ff.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 124.\n\n290.\n\nAs to the LETE's, the Claimant submits further that Argentina breached the US dollar denominated LETE contracts by enacting Decree 471, converting them into pesos. Furthermore, on March 15, 2002 \"Argentina breached its contractual obligation to pay CNA ART its principal and interest.\" Finally, on April 25, 2002, Resolution 73 made the default of Argentina on its public debt (with some exceptions) official, in that payment of the public debt of the national government was thereby deferred through December 31, 2002 \"or until financing thereof has been completed if the latter is completed before that date.\" As a result, \"to date CNA ART has not received payment as required by the contract.\"418\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 128.\n\n291.\n\nIn respect of its dollar denominated deposits, Continental recalled that in 2003 CNA accepted \"under protest\" the terms of Decree 739 of March 28, 2003 that provided for an elaborate scheme of \"partial thawing of the bank freeze,\" after a further rescheduling of 120 days, earning 2% p.a. interest, and the distribution of a BODEN 2013 (State Bond) \"to compensate for the difference between the market exchange rate at the date of issuance of the Decree and the government imposed rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar adjusted by CER.\"419\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para 58.\n\n292.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina also failed to perform according to its terms the BODEN 2013 contract when, upon the expiry of the 120 day period in late August of 2003, it failed to deliver in a timely manner the instruments themselves or credit them in CNA ART's favor.420 Besides complaining that these bonds were not issued at the due dates, Continental also complains that the payments of the initial interests were delayed from April 30 and September 30 of 2003 to February 11, 2004, when the interest in arrears was paid.421\n\nContinental claims also that \"to date, two financial institutions have not credited the BODENs in CNA ART's favor.\" See Claimant's Memorial, paras. 130-131. Claimant has not reiterated this complaint in subsequent proceedings so that the Tribunal assumes that this failure has been by now cured as it was indeed incumbent upon Argentina to do.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, para. 64.\n\n293.\n\nArgentina opposes the Claimant's arguments. First, Argentina contends that in accordance with the principle of *pacta tertiis nec nocent nec prosunt*, Continental cannot invoke any \"commitment\" allegedly assumed with CNA, because the latter would have been entered with \"legal entities which are evidently independent, and which have different rights, even though they are interconnected....\" According to Argentina, Continental cannot invoke the following commitments, because they were entered into with CNA and not with Continental: \"1) the bank deposit agreement was executed between CNA ART and those banks in which Argentine citizens had placed their deposits; 2) the guaranteed loans that CNA ART received from the Argentine Government as the first measure of the so-called local phase of restructuring program of the obligations assumed by the latter; 3) the offer and subsequent purchase of LETEs by CNA ART; and 4) the BODEN 2013 Agreements.\"422\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 628-630.\n\n294.\n\nSecond, relying on the *El Paso* Decision, Argentina submits that umbrella clauses cover only a particular type of contract: an \"investment agreement\" that host States conclude with foreign investors. In such a case, \"not applicable to this dispute, the violations that the Claimant could allege would be due to rights that it actually exercises and which are contemplated in a legal document governed by international law.\"423\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 643-644.\n\n295.\n\nThe umbrella clause is intended to protect the commitments assumed by the Argentine Republic towards foreign investors protected by the BIT, not contractual obligations,424 and \". does not apply to contracts entered into between CNA ART and the Argentine Republic.\"425 In fact, even accepting that the observing obligations clause includes contractual obligations, \"everything relating to the existence and extent of the commitments that may be invoked under the umbrella clause is governed by domestic law.\"426 Therefore because the GGLs, the LETEs and BODEN 2013 are exclusively governed by the laws of Argentina, \"in order to evaluate performance by the Argentine Republic of the obligations contained in such contracts, the tribunal will necessarily [have] to consider the contracts as well as the Argentine laws that set the conditions under which the contracts could be executed and amended.\"427\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 689.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 690.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 694.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 701.\n\n296.\n\nThe preliminary task of the Tribunal is thus to determine the scope of the umbrella clause in the BIT. The Tribunal is conscious that the interpretation of umbrella clauses, such as the one found in Art. II (2)(c) of the BIT, remains controversial and that there is a lack of consistency in the practice of investment arbitral tribunals on the matter.\n\n297.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the type of obligations that Argentina must observe under this umbrella clause, it is necessary to begin with the analysis of the text of Art. II (2)(c). The covered obligations must have been entered \"with regard to\" investments. Thus they must concern one or more investments and, moreover, must address them with some degree of specificity. They are not limited to obligations based on a contract. Finally, provided that these obligations have been entered \"with regard\" to investments, they may have been entered with persons or entities other than foreign investors themselves, so that an undertaking by the host State with a subsidiary such as CNA is not in principle excluded.\n\n298.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the obligation at issue arises under a contract or a unilateral commitment and is governed by local law does not exclude the operation of the umbrella clause, although the determination of the content of the obligation under the applicable national law may be a pre-requisite. It is well established that \"compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions.\n\nWhat is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.\"428\n\nICJ, *Elsi*, para. 73.\n\n299.\n\nThe Parties provided in the BIT, however, for an additional guarantee to their investors, that is \"to observe any obligation\" that they have assumed specifically with regard to investments, irrespective of the law applicable to them. As stated by the LG&E tribunal, \"the umbrella clause is a general provision included in a fairly large number of bilateral treaties that creates a requirement for the host State to meet its obligations towards foreign investors, including those that derive from a contract. Hence such obligations receive extra protection by virtue of their consideration under the bilateral treaty.\"429\n\nSee *LG&E* Decision, para. 170.\n\n300.\n\nIn light of the above it should be clear that this umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State.430 This interpretation of the BIT's Art. II (2)(c) by the Tribunal is also supported by the conclusions on the scope of the same wording reached by other tribunals. As decided in the *CMS Annulment Decision*, \"it seems clear that Article II (2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT itself (*i.e.* under the law of the host State or possibly under international law). Further they must be specific obligations concerning investment. They do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the Host State.\"431\n\nSee F.A. Mann, *British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments*, 52 BYIL, 241, 246 (1981), \"the provision only covers an obligation arising from a particular commitment either of the Contracting Parties may have entered into. Such obligations may arise from contract with the State or from the terms of the licence granted by it. It may be express or implied, it may be in writing or oral. But it must clearly be ascertainable as an obligation of the State itself arising from its own commitments.\" It follows therefore that \"where the contract is made with a private person, then the provision only applies if and in so far as an obligation of the State arising from its own particular commitment (as opposed to existing general legislation) may be discerned.\"\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision, para. 95(a).\n\n301.\n\nThe obligation that a State must observe under an umbrella clause \"will often be a bilateral obligation,\" such as a contractual obligation, \"or will be intrinsically linked to obligations of the investment company.\"432 This can include the unilateral commitments arising from provisions of the law of the host State regulating a particular business sector and addressed specifically to the foreign investors in relation to their investments therein. For example, according to the award of the *LG&E* tribunal,433 this was the case of the obligations that were made by Argentina to foreign investors under the Gas Law and its implementing regulations because they were the basis on which the original investors relied to make investments in the gas sector.\n\n*Ibid* para. 95(d).\n\n*LG&E* Decision at para. 175: \"[a]s such, Argentina's abrogation of the guarantees under the statutory framework - calculation of the tariffs in dollars before conversion to pesos, semi-annual tariff adjustments by the PPI and no price controls without indemnification - violated its obligations to Claimants' investments. Argentina made these specific obligations to foreign investors, such as LG&E, by enacting the Gas Law and other regulations, and then advertising these guarantees in the Offering Memorandum to induce the entry of foreign capital to fund the privatization program in its public service sector. These laws and regulations became obligations within the meaning of Article II(2)(c), by virtue of targeting foreign investors and applying specifically to their investments, that gave rise to liability under the umbrella clause.\"\n\n302.\n\nTherefore, the provisions of the Convertibility Law and those of the Intangibility Law cannot be a source of obligations that Argentina has assumed specifically with regard to the Claimant's investment company434 and which are protected under the BIT's umbrella clause. Moreover, the provisions of the legislative regime that were changed were addressed either to the generality of Argentina's public or to a wide range of depositors and subscribers of a number of financial instruments.435 As to the GGLs, they were undoubtedly more specific and of a contractual nature. They could therefore be considered as guaranteed by the umbrella clause, subject to the caveat that they were not directed to foreign investors nor specifically addressed to their investments. In any case we have already recognized necessity under Art. XI, while as to the LETEs, we have instead found a breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment436 and therefore we do not need to investigate the matter any further.\n\nSee Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 18-22.\n\nMoreover those \"general legislative assurances\" were not the basis on which the private parties or investors involved had relied to make investments, since they were already present in Argentina.\n\nSee above para. 264 ff.\n\n303.\n\nTo summarize, a number of obligations that the Claimant alleges to have been breached by Argentina are not covered by the BIT's umbrella clause, while, as to the GGLs, in as far as they may have been covered by this clause, the defense of necessity under Art. XI is upheld. The claim of Continental that Argentina has breached Art. II (2)(c) is, therefore, dismissed.\n\n**VIII. Conclusions of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nSumming up, Continental fails entirely on its claims based on Art. V (Freedom of transfer), on those based on Art. II (2)(c) (Umbrella Clause) relating to non-contractual instruments. The Tribunal's rejection of those based on Fair and Equitable Treatment (except for the claim concerning the LETEs) and on those based on the Umbrella Clause (as they relate to contractual instruments such as the GGLs) is the result of the Tribunal having decided that Argentina is entitled to avail itself of the defense based on necessity under Art. XI of the BIT. For the above reasons, the only claim of breach of the BIT on which the Claimant prevails is that of the breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment obligation of Art. II (2)(a) concerning the restructuring of the LETEs.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimant submits it has suffered as to LETEs losses amounting to U.S$700,000 due to pesification and to U.S$2,800,000 \"due to the further default and revocation of contractual rights.\"437 For the reason stated above, the Claimant is entitled to be compensated only for the latter amount that corresponds to its capital loss. The Claimant is accordingly entitled to payment of compensation in the principal sum of U.S.$2,800,000.\n\nSee Claimant's Reply, para. 386.\n\n*A. Calculation of Interest*\n----------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimant also claims interest. The Claimant has not expressly specified whether such interest is simple or compound interest or at what rates.438 Argentina has made no submissions on these matters.\n\nIn the final paragraph of its Memorial, the Claimant asks a compensation \"including interest on such amounts computed at a commercial interest rate from the date of loss to the date of payment of the award, compounded on an annual basis, plus costs of this arbitration.\"\n\n307.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the claim for interest covers both simple and compound interest. Accordingly, the first issue to be decided by the Tribunal is whether to award simple or compound interest.\n\n308.\n\nAs a general principle, almost invariably, justice requires that the wrongdoer who has deliberately failed to pay compensation should pay interest for the period during it has withheld that compensation unlawfully. The claimant, in addition to suffering from the wrongdoing giving rise to compensation, has suffered a further loss from nonpayment of that compensation when it should have been paid by the wrongdoer. Moreover, a wrongdoer withholding payment may be unjustly enriched by its deliberate non-payment of such compensation, at the expense of the claimant. In these circumstances, therefore, full reparation will include an order for interest. However, there has been until recent times a controversy attaching to compound interest, as distinct from simple interest, in international law.\n\n309.\n\nIn Professor Crawford's Third Report on State Responsibility, the summary records:439\n\n\"[...] although compound interest is not generally awarded under international law or by international tribunals, special circumstances may arise which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation. Care is however needed since allowing compound interest could result in an inflated and disproportionate award, with the amount of interest greatly exceeding the principal amount owed.\"\n\nThis caution is perhaps surprising: compound interest reflects economic reality in modern times, and the hesitation may be directed more at extreme rates and rests rather than compound interest in principle. The time value of money in free market economies is measured in compound interest; simple interest cannot be relied upon to produce full reparation for a claimant's loss occasioned by delay in payment; and under many national laws recently enacted, an arbitration tribunal is now expressly empowered to award compound interest.440\n\nProfessor James Crawford, *Third Report on State Responsibility*, August 4, 2000, (ILC 2000).\n\nFor example, Section 49(3) of the English Arbitration Act 1996 grants arbitrators the power to award compound interest on any principal amount awarded.\n\n310.\n\nUnder international law, the Tribunal concludes that it may order compound interest if it is necessary to ensure full reparation. There is nothing in the BIT, the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, that restricts the Tribunal's power to award compound interest under international law for breach of the Respondent's obligations under the BIT. In reaching this general conclusion, the Tribunal has considered, in particular, Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility; Dr. F. A. Mann's Article \"Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in International Law,\" in \"Further Studies in International Law,\"441 and Judge Schwebel's Article \"Compound Interest in International Law.\"442\n\nF. A. Mann, *Further Studies in International Law*, (Oxford 1990) pp. 377 ff; see also Mann, \" *Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in* *International Law*,\" 21 U.C.Davis Law Review, 557 ff (1988).\n\nStephen M. Schwebel, \" *Compound Interest in International Law*,\" TDM Volume 2, Issue 5, November 2005.\n\n311.\n\nThere is a significant convergence between the views of these experienced jurists. Dr. Mann concluded: \"on the basis of compelling evidence, compound interest may be and, in the absence of special circumstances, should be awarded to the claimant as damages by international tribunals.\" Judge Schwebel likewise concluded, more than a decade later: \"[i]t is plain that the contemporary disposition of international law accords with that found in the national law of States that are commercially advanced, namely, it permits the award of compound interest where the facts of the case support the conclusion that it is appropriate to render just compensation.\"\n\n312.\n\nIt is unnecessary to recite here other well-known legal materials (many of which are considered in these two articles), save to record the position succinctly expressed in the ICSID award in *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica* (2000).443\n\nNo uniform rule of law has emerged from the practice in international arbitration as regards the determination of whether compound or simple interest is appropriate in any given case. Rather, the determination of Interest is a product of the exercise of judgment, taking into account all the circumstances of the case at hand and especially consideration of fairness which must form part of the law to be applied by this Tribunal.\n\nIn particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nThis discretionary approach to the award of compound interest under international law may now represent a form of \" *jurisprudence constante* \" in ICSID awards. A recent study of 45 ICSID arbitrations resulting in 14 awards of compensation demonstrates that, of the latter, 8 ordered compound interest, 3 simple interest, and 1 no interest (the remaining 2 did not disclose whether compound or simple interest was ordered).444\n\nC *ompa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of February 17, 2000, 15 ICSID Rev. -F.I.L.J. 169 (2000), 39 ILM 1317 (2000) at paras. 103-104.\n\nJames Gray, Jason Cain and Wayne Wilson, \" *ICSID Arbitration Awards and Cost*,\" TDM Volume 3, Issue 5, December 2006.\n\n313.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal considers that full reparation to Continental should include compound interest on the compensation due from but unpaid by Argentina. The Tribunal bears much in mind that Continental's loss consists of the deprivation of an interest-bearing financial instrument, measurable by reference only to compound interest. It would be unjust in these circumstances to order simple interest, because it would fall significantly short of such full reparation.\n\n314.\n\nAs regards the rate of compound interest, the Tribunal exercises its discretion to select the rates for U.S.$ 6 months Libor (as published in the Financial Times) plus 2 per cent compounded annually until payment.\n\n315.\n\nAs regards the commencement date for compound interest, since Decree 1735/04 restructuring the LETEs was issued in December 2004, the Tribunal fixes January 1, 2005 as the initial date to this purpose.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of Argentina's submission that unrestructured LETEs have a market price. Accordingly, the Tribunal's orders for payment of principal and interest by Argentina are subject to Continental first procuring the surrender of all LETEs held by CNA not previously tendered pursuant to Argentina's restructuring offer.\n\n*B. Apportionment of the arbitral costs*\n----------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nAs to costs, each party has asked the Tribunal that its expenses in connection with these proceedings, including the amount of the deposits made to ICSID for the Centre's charges and the expenses and fees of the arbitrators (Art. 59 and 60 of the ICSID Convention), be reimbursed to it by the other party. To this effect each party has submitted detailed calculations.445 This is an issue that the Tribunal has to decide as part of the award pursuant to Art. 61 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThe Claimant has quantified its costs in the amount of US$ 3,323,849.91 besides ICSID fees. Respondent has quantified its own costs, net of ICSID fees, in the amount of US$ 844,776.43.\n\n318.\n\nThe Convention and the attendant Rules and Regulations give ICSID tribunals' broad discretion in awarding costs and offer little guidance on how this discretion is to be exercised. Moreover, the practice of ICSID tribunals in apportioning costs \"is neither clear nor uniform.\"446 In a number of cases the principle \"the loser pays,\" commonly applied in international commercial arbitration, has been followed; in many others the tribunals decided that the parties were to bear equal shares of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and of the charges for the use of Centre's facilities and services. In their decisions on awarding costs, besides assessing them against the unsuccessful party, arbitral tribunals have often taken into account the nature of the dispute, the novelty of the legal issues, and the conduct of the parties in the proceedings.\n\nSee *Schreuer*, 1225, 1230.\n\n319.\n\nAs to this case, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant is succeeding in only one of the many claims of breaches of the BIT it has put forward, namely only in relation to the restructuring of the LETEs. As to the other claims, most of them (except the one under Art. V (Freedom of Transfer) and in part those under the Umbrella Clause, (which are being rejected as groundless in the merits)) are being dismissed because the Tribunal has accepted the preliminary exception raised by Argentina that Art. XI of the BIT removes the Measures challenged by the Claimant from the Treaty's coverage. This leads the Tribunal to conclude that there are good reasons to decide, as it is hereby decided, that each party shall bear any and all of its own expenses in connection with the presentation and preparation of the case, as well as half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the charges for the use of the Centre's facilities and services.\n\n**IX. Decision of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finally decides as follows:\n\n(A) Save for the Claimant's claim relating to the LETEs, all substantive claims made by the Claimant are dismissed;\n\n(B) As regards the claim relating to the LETEs, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the Claimant in the principal sum of U.S. $2,800,000 (United States dollars two million eight hundred thousand) and compound interest thereon at the rates for U.S.$ 6 month Libor (as published in the Financial Times) plus 2 per cent compounded annually from January 1, 2005 until payment, subject to the Claimant first procuring the surrender of all LETEs held by its subsidiary, not previously tendered to and accepted by Argentina;\n\n(C) The Parties shall bear all their own legal costs and expenses, without recourse to each other; and\n\n(D) The Parties shall bear equally the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID.\n\n**XI.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") an application in writing (\"Argentina\u2019s Application\" or \"Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment\") requesting the partial annulment of the Award of 5 September 2008 (the \"Award\") rendered by the tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") in the arbitration proceeding between Continental Casualty Company (\"Continental\") and Argentina.\n\n2.\n\nIn Argentina\u2019s Application, Argentina seeks annulment of the Award on two of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; and\n\n(b) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n3.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Committee\u2019s decision of October 23, 2009 sets out the procedural history to that date of Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment.1\n\n\"Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Preliminary Objection to Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment\" of 23 October 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 4-15.\n\n5.\n\nOn June 29, 2009, in accordance with a request made by the Committee in a letter of 12 June 2009, Argentina and Continental both filed written submissions in relation to Argentina\u2019s request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. Oral submissions were presented by both parties on Argentina\u2019s request at the preliminary procedural consultation meeting held in Washington on 2 July 2009. In accordance with a direction given by the Committee, on 2 October 2009 Argentina filed further written submissions in relation to its request and Continental confirmed that it had no need to make further submissions.\n\n6.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication, and have taken into consideration the parties\u2019 entire written and oral arguments and submissions on Argentina\u2019s request for a stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**B. The parties\u2019 submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia* that:\n\n(a) In general, a stay should be granted under Article 52(5) if requested.2 Since the beginning of the history of the ICSID Convention, no *ad hoc* Committee has failed to grant a stay of enforcement of the award.3 There are no exceptional circumstances in this case under which the stay should not continue. The grounds for annulment invoked by Argentina and their seriousness and merit show that Argentina\u2019s annulment request is serious and not dilatory.\n\n(b) The fact that Continental\u2019s Application for Annulment seeks annulment of the same portions of the Award that gave rise to Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment militates in favour of continuing the stay of enforcement of the Award until the Committee definitively settles the questions raised by both parties to this proceeding.\n\n(c) Continental will suffer no harm as a consequence of the continued stay of enforcement since if the Award is finally upheld the interest accrued during the annulment proceedings would compensate Continental for the time it had to wait to collect the Award.4\n\n(d) There is no risk of non-compliance with the Award by Argentina if it is not annulled. Argentina\u2019s legal system guarantees compliance with Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations and ICSID awards,5 and Argentina has historically complied with decisions of international tribunals.6\n\n(e) Those who argue that Argentina is in default of its international obligations under the ICSID Convention point only to the *CMS* Award.7 However, CMS has refused to follow the administrative formalities under Argentine law for a final decision of a local court to be paid, as provided for by Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, CMS\u2019s rights under the *CMS* Award were transferred to a third party.\n\n(f) In any event, Continental bears the burden of proof to show that Argentina will not comply with its international obligations under the Award if the damages portion of the Award is not annulled.\n\n(g) Allowing enforcement of the Award would have systemic consequences, and would bring about serious harm to States\u2019 trust in the investment arbitration mechanism under the ICSID Convention.8\n\n(h) Argentina should not be required to provide any financial security as a condition for the continuation of the stay. Such a requirement is contrary to the object and purpose and spirit of the ICSID Convention,9 the text and negotiating history of which does not foresee the possibility of requiring that a party seeking annulment post a guarantee.10 The requirement of a guarantee has been incorrectly imported from the commercial arbitration practice.\n\n(i) Requiring a guarantee as a condition of a stay of enforcement impairs the use of the protection of the annulment mechanism contained in the ICSID Convention.11 The right of either party to request annulment cannot be restricted.12\n\n(j) Requiring a guarantee as a condition of a stay of enforcement would place Continental in a more favourable situation than it is now and than it was prior to the filing of Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment,13 since \"it converts the undertaking of compliance under Article 53 of the convention into a financial guarantee and avoids any issue of sovereign immunity from enforcement, which is expressly reserved by Article 55 of the Convention\".14\n\n(k) Both Continental and Argentina have applied for annulment of the Award, and requiring the provision of a financial guarantee would penalise one of the parties while favouring the other.15\n\n(l) It is not the task nor the jurisdiction of ICSID annulment committees to secure compliance with awards should annulments not be granted.\n\n(m) It would be extremely costly for Argentina to access an adequate financial guarantee.\n\n(n) It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for Argentina to recover the amount of the Award if it were partially annulled,16 since as long as Argentina would have a right to retrieve those amounts such right could be attached by other unrelated creditors of Argentina.17\n\n(o) The posting of a bank guarantee is unnecessary since the Argentine domestic legal system already guarantees compliance with the Award. In any event, Continental should bear the burden of proof that there are circumstances requiring that an additional guarantee be furnished.18\n\n(p) Argentina will comply in good faith with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, but requires ICSID award creditors to follow the same formalities that are followed by any creditor of a final judgment of a local court in Argentina, a position that is consistent with Articles 53 and Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.19 Several countries have provisions similar to Argentina\u2019s legal framework and adopt the same *rationale* that Argentina has adopted.20\n\nReferring to *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. & Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

However, Argentina is notorious for failing to comply with ICSID arbitral awards,22 and the requirement of security is clearly and compellingly warranted in this case.\n\n(d) Argentina has repeatedly reaffirmed that it will not comply with its obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention unless and until enforcement action is taken under article 54.23 However, under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention and Article Vll(6) of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment24 (the \"BIT\"), Argentina is required to carry out without delay the provision of any award without the award creditor having to submit to any agency of the state party to enforce the award as envisaged by Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(e) The guarantee would not place Continental in a better situation than it would otherwise be in a case where Argentina were to comply with its obligations under Article 53.25 Posting security is simply intended to assure that Argentina ultimately complies with its obligations, and serves as a counterbalance to the fact that the award creditor is prejudiced by a stay.26\n\n(f) The possibility that other creditors of Argentina might attach Argentina\u2019s right to receive the security it has posted in the event that its application for annulment is granted should not be a relevant factor. The fact that Argentina has other creditors which have not been paid should make the requirement to post security more likely rather than less likely.\n\n(g) However, if Argentina were ordered to deposit the full amount of the award plus interest into an escrow or trust account administered by the World Bank, this would avoid the potential problem of attachment by unrelated creditors of Argentina as the World Bank is exempt from that type of attachment.\n\n(h) This would also avoid what Argentina claims would be the very high cost of other forms of security.\n\n(i) Continental does not seek to annul the portion of the Award awarding Continental USD 2.8 million in damages for breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in the BIT.\n\nReferring to *AMCO I* Stay Decision, especially \u00b6 8; *Vivendi* Stay Decision, especially \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; *Sempra* Stay Decision, especially \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, 67-76, 102, 104, 110, 112; *Wena* Stay Decision, especially \u00b6 6; *MINE* Stay Decision; *Repsol* Stay Decision, especially \u00b6 10; *CDC* Stay Decision.\n\nReferring to I.

Relevant provisions**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General*\n\n*(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n10.\n\nArticles 53 to 55 of the ICSID Convention provide:\n\n***Article 53***\n\n*(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n*(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.*\n\n***Article 54***\n\n*(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.*\n\n*(2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.*\n\n*(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.*\n\n***Article 55***\n\n*Nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.*\n\n11.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules applies to the present case and provides:\n\n**Sfay** ***of Enforcement of the Award***\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final* *decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.*\n\n**D. The Committee\u2019s views**\n----------------------------\n\n12.\n\nContinental maintains that there is a substantial risk of non-compliance with the Award by Argentina in the event that it is not annulled. In this respect, the Committee notes that at the 2 July 2009 first session, a representative of Argentina stated Argentina\u2019s position that in order for Continental to obtain payment of the Award, it would be necessary for Continental to follow the formalities applicable to enforcement in Argentina of final judgments of Argentine courts, pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention. The Committee notes that in three other cases, *ad hoc* committees have found that this position of Argentina is inconsistent with Argentina\u2019s obligation under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention to carry out without delay the provisions of the award without the need for enforcement action under Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.27 The Committee agrees with the conclusions in those earlier cases in respect of the obligation of the award debtor under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. For similar reasons, the Committee concludes that because Argentina continues to maintain the same position in the present proceedings notwithstanding the findings of the *ad hoc* committees in those three other cases, there is, in the event that the Award is not annulled, no prospect that Argentina will comply with its obligation under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention to abide by and comply with its obligation under Article 53.28\n\n*Enron* First Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 54-85; *Vivendi* Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 31-37; *Sempra* First Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 32-53\n\n*Enron* First Stay Decision \u00b6 101; *Enron* Second Stay Decision \u00b6\u00b6 21-29; *Sempra* First Stay Decision \u00b6 104; *Vivendi* Stay Decision \u00b6 45; *Sempra* First Stay Decision \u00b6 22.\n\n13.\n\nThe Committee finds this to be a fundamentally important consideration in determining whether to impose a condition of security as a requirement for any stay of enforcement. However, even so, that consideration is not of itself necessarily conclusive as the Committee must base its decision entirely on the relevant circumstances.\n\n14.\n\nA distinguishing feature of the present case is that each of Continental and Argentina has made applications for annulment of the Award. Of course Continental has not sought annulment of that part of the Award which was in Continental\u2019s favour, and which Continental seeks to be at liberty to enforce in the event that the stay of enforcement is terminated. Nevertheless, in the Committee\u2019s view, it would not in general be appropriate for an award to be enforced in circumstances where neither of the parties considers the award to be final with extant applications for Annulment having been made for the entire Award. This is a factor to which the Committee gives particular weight in deciding whether it is necessary or appropriate to impose a condition of security for any continuation of the stay.\n\n15.\n\nAnother matter to which the Committee has regard is the amount of the Award. The Tribunal determined that Argentina is liable to pay Continental compensation of USD 2.8 million, which is but a fraction of the amount of USD 46 million that was claimed by Continental in the proceedings before the Tribunal.29 In the Committee\u2019s view, the fact that the Award is for such a small proportion of the amount that would still remain in dispute in the event that Continental\u2019s own Application for Annulment were to succeed, and for such a small amount by comparison with other ICSID awards, remains a further relevant circumstance to be taken into account where the party opposing a stay of enforcement is itself also an applicant for annulment.\n\nAward \u00b6 19\n\n16.\n\nHaving considered all of the arguments of the parties, and all of the circumstances as a whole, the Committee concludes that in consideration of the exceptional circumstances of this annulment proceeding, consisting in the combination of the relatively small amount of the Award and the presence of cross applications for annulment, practical considerations may allow a continued stay of the enforcement of the Award pending the conclusion of the annulment proceedings without imposing any condition of security.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n**Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee determines that the stay of enforcement of the Award will continue in effect for the duration of these annulment proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Claimant's Preliminary Objection to Argentina's Application for Annulment", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2009-10-23T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Claimant's Preliminary Objection to Argentina's Application for Annulment\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") an application in writing (\"Argentina\u2019s Application\" or \"Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment\") requesting the partial annulment of the Award of 5 September 2008 (the \"Award\") rendered by the Tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") in the arbitration proceeding between Continental Casualty Company (\"Continental\") and Argentina.\n\n2.\n\nIn Argentina\u2019s Application, Argentina seeks annulment of the Award on two of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; and\n\n(b) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n3.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered Argentina\u2019s Application on 8 June 2009, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 9 June 2009, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee had been constituted to consider Argentina\u2019s Application, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., a national of Australia, Judge Bola A. Ajibola, a national of Nigeria, and Mr. Christer Soderlund, a national of Sweden (\"the Committee\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 29 June 2009, in accordance with a request made by the Committee in a letter of 12 June 2009, Argentina and Continental both filed written submissions in relation to Argentina\u2019s request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n7.\n\nCommunications of the parties dated 29 June 2009 respectively addressed the provisional agenda for the preliminary procedural consultation meeting. Continental supplemented its communication by a further letter dated 30 June 2009.\n\n8.\n\nOn 2 July 2009, at the headquarters of the World Bank in Washington, the preliminary procedural consultation meeting was held in relation to Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment and in relation to the separate application for annulment filed by Continental (\"Continental\u2019s Application\" or \"Continental\u2019s Application for Annulment\") which was registered on 14 January 2009. In the case of Argentina\u2019s Application, this meeting constituted the Committee\u2019s first session, the first session in relation to Continental\u2019s Application having already been held by telephone conference on 22 April 2009.\n\n9.\n\nAt the 2 July 2009 meeting, the parties confirmed their agreement that the Committee had been properly constituted to hear both Continental\u2019s Application and Argentina\u2019s Application. The parties further confirmed that they had no objections to its Members. Copies of the Committee Members\u2019 declarations concerning Argentina\u2019s application were distributed by the Secretary at the end of the meeting. Several issues of procedure were agreed and decided at the meeting. Subsequently, the parties addressed the Committee with their respective arguments concerning the question of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. During the session, the Committee put questions to the parties.\n\n10.\n\nIn the course of presenting its arguments at the 2 July 2009 meeting, Continental raised a preliminary objection that Argentina\u2019s Application was not made within the time limit stipulated in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and was therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Committee. It was agreed and decided that Continental was within 14 days from the 2 July 2009 meeting to file a written submission setting out its preliminary objection, that Argentina was to file its response within 30 days from receipt of Continental\u2019s submission, and that both parties reserved their right to request leave from the Committee for further procedures concerning Continental\u2019s submission on its preliminary objection.\n\n11.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Continental filed a written submission on its preliminary objection.\n\n12.\n\nOn 21 August 2009, Argentina filed its written response to Continental\u2019s submission on the preliminary objection.\n\n13.\n\nBy a letter dated 31 August 2009, Continental requested the Committee to direct Argentina to provide Continental with the English language version of certain documents referred to in Argentina\u2019s response that were not available to Continental, namely documents from annulment proceedings in other ICSID cases involving Argentina, and to grant Continental leave to file a reply submission, if necessary, after receipt of those documents.\n\n14.\n\nBy an e-mail dated 17 September 2009, Argentina submitted copies of the documents requested by Continental, noting that one of the requested documents was produced only in its Spanish original as no English translation existed.\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, Continental filed observations on Argentina\u2019s response to Continental\u2019s submission on the preliminary objection.\n\n16.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication, and have taken into consideration the parties\u2019 entire written and oral arguments and submissions on Continental\u2019s preliminary objection.\n\n**B. The parties\u2019 submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nContinental argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Pursuant to Article 52(2) of the lCSID Convention, the 120 day time limit for an application for annulment applies in all cases other than in cases of alleged corruption on the part of a Tribunal member, and no such allegation of corruption has been made in the present case.\n\n(b) The Award was rendered and issued to the parties on 5 September 2008. Pursuant to Regulation 29 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the 120 day time limit under Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention for an annulment application was therefore Sunday 4 January 2009, resulting in a filing deadline of Monday 5 January 2009. However, Argentina\u2019s application for annulment was not filed until 5 June 2009, 150 days after expiry of the 120 day period for applications for annulment.\n\n(c) ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(3)(b) provides that the Secretary-General shall refuse to register an application for annulment if it is not made *\"within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (or any subsequent decision or correction)\".* Argentina\u2019s Application was so registered, but the determination of whether an annulment application complies with the terms of the ICSID Convention rests with the Committee and not with the Secretary-General.1\n\n(d) It is a general principle of interpretation in international law that exceptions to a treaty obligation are construed restrictively *(exceptio est strictissimae applicationis).* Annulment is an extraordinary remedy that amounts to a general exception to the final and binding effect of an ICSID award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. As an exception to finality, the availability of annulment must be interpreted and applied strictly, and be limited to extraordinary circumstances. Annulment is not to be encouraged as a routine step to be taken by a party that has lost a case to assist in delaying or avoiding payment of an award.\n\n(e) The ICSID Arbitration Rules are subsidiary to the ICSID Convention and cannot be read in any way that is contrary to the proper interpretation of the ICSID Convention itself.\n\n(f) Properly understood in a manner consistent with a strict interpretation, the extension of time in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention for making an annulment application in cases where there is an application for rectification of the award is limited to an annulment application related to determinations made in the rectification decision, or to a finding that has been rectified in the rectification decision, since only in that case does the applicant for annulment have to consider new legal points in relation to its annulment application which justify the extra time.2 Any other interpretation opens the floodgates to dilatory and obstructive conduct on the part of award debtors.3\n\n(g) In the instant case Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment only challenges determinations made in the original Award and findings of the Tribunal that are entirely unrelated to the rectification, and Argentina\u2019s Application is therefore out of time. Argentina, in waiting for such a long period to file its annulment application, is dilatory.\n\nRelying on *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), *Ad hoc* Committee Decision on the Application for Annulment, 16 May 1986, 25 *ILM* 1439 (1986); 1 *Int'l Arb. Rep.* 649 (1986); 12 *Y.B. Com. Arb.* 129 (1987); 89 *I.L.R.* 514 (1992); 1 *ICSID Rep.* 509 (1993) \u00b647; C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2001) **(\"Schreuer\")** at 109 \u00b6 333.\n\nReferring to *History of the ICSID Convention,* Vol II, Part 2, at 988 \u00b6 49.\n\nReferring to Schreuer at 894.\n\n18.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) In accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment was properly filed on 5 June 2009, 102 days after the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Rectification of the Award of 23 February 2009.\n\n(b) Nothing in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, nor in any other provision of the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules, makes the extension of the time limit for submitting an application for annulment conditional on the application for annulment being related to determinations made in the rectification decision or in the supplementary decision. Continental is trying to amend the ICSID Convention.\n\n(c) The negotiating history of the ICSID Convention confirms this.4 Also, when explaining the content of what is now ICSID Arbitration Rule 50, the ICSID Secretariat did not make any distinctions between applications for annulment that relate to determinations made in the rectification decision and applications for annulment that do not.5\n\n(d) Given the very severe consequence that follows non-compliance with the 120-day deadline for annulment applications, and the uncertainties that may arise as to whether a request for annulment is or is not related to the rectification decision or to the supplementary decision, the drafters of the ICSID Convention decided to adopt a clear rule in this regard, namely that a decision on rectification or a supplementary decision *generally* extends the time limits for requesting revision or annulment, regardless of whether or not the application for revision or annulment addresses questions dealt with in that decision.6\n\n(e) In the present case the Acting Secretary-General reviewed Argentina\u2019s Application and found that it was duly and timely submitted because otherwise the Acting Secretary-General would have refused to register the application in accordance with Article 50(3)(b)(i) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Although this determination does not bind the Committee, it should be accorded considerable weight.\n\n(f) A certain delay in the proceeding is a normal consequence of the rectification and supplementation process under Article 49 of the ICSID Convention.7 In the present case, Continental itself caused the delay it complains about, since Continental was the first to request a rectification or supplementation of the Award which was decided by the Tribunal at the same time as Argentina\u2019s request for rectification.\n\n(g) It is not an accurate to state that the right of annulment is an \"exception\" or \"extraordinary remedy\" as it is a specific right provided for in the ICSID Convention that has the particular feature of protecting the \"integrity of the ICSID arbitration system\".8\n\nReferring to Summary Proceedings of the Legal Committee Meeting, December 10, 1964, afternoon, SID/LC/SR/21 (11 January 1965), in *History of the ICSID Convention,* Vol II, Part 2, at 881,884.\n\nReferring to 1968 ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings with Explanatory Notes prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, Note E to Arbitration Rule 49.1 *ICSID Rep.* 63, 110\n\nReferring to Schreuer at 854; UNCTAD, *Course on Dispute Settlement: ICSID - 2.8 Post-Award Remedies and Procedures,* at 8, U.N. Doc. UNCTAD/EDM/Misc.232/Add.7 (2003) (prepared by Wang Dong).\n\nReferring to Schreuer at 855\n\nReferring to *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 30 November 2004, \u00b6 40.\n\n**C. The Committee\u2019s views**\n----------------------------\n\n19.\n\nArticle 51 (2) of the ICSID Convention provides that an application for annulment shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered (with an exception, that is immaterial to the present proceedings, in cases where annulment is requested on the ground of corruption).\n\n20.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention states that:\n\n*The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.*\n\n21.\n\nIt is not disputed by the parties that in the present case the Tribunal gave a decision under Article 49(2) rectifying the Award on 23 February 2009. It is not disputed by the parties that Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment was filed well within 120 days of that rectification decision. It is similarly not disputed by the parties that Argentina\u2019s Application was not filed within 120 days of the date on which the original Award was rendered.\n\n22.\n\nContinental argues that Article 49(2) of the lCSID Convention only extends the time limit for an annulment application where the annulment application relates to determinations made in the rectification decision. Continental\u2019s position is that even if a rectification decision has been given by the Tribunal under Article 49(2), the time limit for an annulment application remains 120 days from the original Award, and not 120 days from the rectification decision, in cases where the annulment application relates to determinations in the original award that were not affected by the rectification decision. Argentina on the other hand argues that in cases where a rectification decision is given under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, that provision applies to extend the time limit for the making of any application for annulment, whether or not the application relates to matters in the award that were affected by the rectification decision.\n\n23.\n\nThe Committee considers that this issue is one of interpretation of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. In interpreting that provision, the Committee applies the principles in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\").9 These provisions reflect the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation as they already existed at the time that the text of the ICSID Convention was adopted.10\n\nVienna, May 23, 1969; 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\nE.g., *Enron Corp and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 October 2008, \u00b6 25.\n\n24.\n\nArticles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention state:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.*\n\n25.\n\nFor purposes of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, the Committee considers that the plain meaning of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is abundantly clear: where a rectification decision is given under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the period of time provided for under Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention runs from the date of the rectification decision, rather than from the date of the original award.\n\n26.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is nothing in the context or objects and purposes of the ICSID Convention that would require this provision to be understood as having a completely different meaning to what it plainly says. If Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention had intended to establish separate time limits for different categories of annulment applications, depending on whether or not an annulment application relates to a matter affected by a rectification decision, it would have said so. It may well be that good reasons could be advanced in favour of adopting such an approach. However, there are no doubt equally good reasons that could be advanced against adopting such an approach. For instance, it could lead to the inconvenience of a single application for annulment having to be split into two separate applications for annulment subject to different time limits, in cases where a party seeks annulment both of parts of an award that were affected by the rectification decision and parts that were not. Such an approach might also lead to unnecessary arguments about whether or not an application for annulment relates to matters that were affected by a rectification decision.\n\n27.\n\nUltimately, it was a matter for the drafters of the ICSID Convention to determine which approach to adopt, and the approach that was adopted is the one that is embodied in the clear language of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee does not consider that it would in any way be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention to interpret this provision in accordance with its plain meaning.\n\n28.\n\nThe Committee therefore does not consider that there is any need to resort to supplementary means of interpretation in accordance with Article 32 of the Vienna Convention: the interpretation in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention is neither ambiguous nor obscure, nor one that leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. The Committee considers that the wording of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is clear and that it is entirely reasonable for the ICSID Convention to maintain a single time limit for all annulment applications in cases where there is a rectification decision, regardless of whether or not the rectification decision affects the part of the award that is sought to be annulled.\n\n29.\n\nIn any event, even if the Committee were to consider supplementary means of interpretation, no supplementary means of interpretation to which the Committee has been directed would, in the Committee\u2019s view, require Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention to be given any interpretation other than its plain meaning.\n\n30.\n\nThe Committee finds nothing in the ICSID Arbitration Rules that would affect its conclusions above, and in any event, the ICSID Arbitration Rules cannot prevail over the terms of the ICSID Convention.\n\n31.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Continental\u2019s preliminary objection.\n\n**D. Costs**\n------------\n\n32.\n\nArgentina requests the Committee to order Continental to pay for all expenses and costs arising out of its preliminary objection, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee, the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, the fees and expenses incurred by Argentina and any other expenses incurred in connection with Continental\u2019s preliminary objection, with interest.11\n\nRelying on ICSID Convention, Article 61(2).\n\n33.\n\nThe Committee considers it appropriate to reserve issues of costs until the end of these annulment proceedings.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n**Pursuant to Article 41(2) of the lCSID Convention and Rule 41(4) of the lCSID Arbitration Rules, the Committee overrules Continental\u2019s preliminary objection that Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment was not filed within the applicable time limit under the lCSID Convention and lCSID Arbitration Rules.**\n\n**The issue of the parties\u2019 costs of the proceedings relating to Continental\u2019s preliminary objection is reserved until the end of these annulment proceedings.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application for Partial Annulment of Continental Casualty Company and the Application for Partial Annulment of the Argentine Republic", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2011-09-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application for Partial Annulment of Continental Casualty Company and the Application for Partial Annulment of the Argentine Republic\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATED REFERENCES** | |\n| **Case law** | |\n| *Azurix* Annulment Decision | *Azurix Corp. v.

INTRODUCTORY MATTERS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, Continental Casualty Company **(\"Continental\")** filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the **\"Centre\"** or **\"ICSID\")** an application in writing **(\"Continental\u2019s Application\")** requesting the partial annulment of the Award of September 5, 2008 (the **\"Award\"),** rendered by the tribunal (the **\"Tribunal\")** in the arbitration proceeding between Continental and the Argentine Republic **(\"Argentina\").**\n\n2.\n\nContinental\u2019s Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n3.\n\nOn January 14, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered Continental\u2019s Application and sent a copy to Argentina.\n\n4.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the Centre informed the parties of the ensuing recommendation to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the appointment of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., from Australia, Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen, from Guyana, and Mr. Christer Soderlund, from Sweden, to the *ad hoc* Committee, each of whom was designated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by their respective countries.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of March 19, 2009, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (the **\"Committee\")** had been constituted, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., Judge Mohamed Shahabuddeen and Mr. Christer Soderlund. On the same date the parties were informed that Mr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 20, 2009, the Centre informed the parties of the designation of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C. as President of the Committee.\n\n7.\n\nOn April 22, 2009, the Committee held a first session by telephone conference.\n\n8.\n\nOn May 13, 2009 the Centre informed the parties of the resignation of Judge Shahabuddeen for health reasons and notified the parties of the vacancy on the *ad hoc* Committee and of the suspension of the proceeding.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 20, 2009, the Centre informed the parties of the ensuing recommendation to the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the appointment of Judge Bola A. Ajibola of Nigeria designated by Nigeria to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of June 3, 2009, the Centre informed the parties that the *ad hoc* Committee was reconstituted composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C. (Australian), President; Judge Bola A. Ajibola (Nigerian); and Christer Soderlund (Swedish).\n\n11.\n\nOn 5 June 2009, Argentina filed with the Centre an application in writing **(\"Argentina\u2019s Application\")** requesting the partial annulment of the Award and a stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 8, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered Argentina\u2019s Application, and notified the parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the award.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of June 9, 2009, the Centre informed the parties that the Chairman of the Administrative Council had appointed the same *ad hoc* Committee to consider Argentina\u2019s Application.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of June 10, 2009, the Centre informed the parties that the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C. (Australian), President; Judge Bola A. Ajibola (Nigerian); and Christer Soderlund (Swedish). The parties were further informed that the Committee would hear Argentina\u2019s application for partial annulment in conjunction with the pending Application for Annulment by the Claimant.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 29, 2009, Continental presented a submission on Argentina\u2019s application for stay of enforcement of the Award. On the same date, Argentina submitted its observations on the continued stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n16.\n\nOn July 2, 2009, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., a procedural meeting was held in relation to both Continental\u2019s Application and Argentina\u2019s Application. In the case of Argentina\u2019s Application, this meeting constituted the Committee\u2019s first session. At the meeting, the Committee asked the parties whether they agreed to retain the services of an assistant, Dr. Christopher Staker, in addition to the Secretary of the Committee. Argentina and the Claimants agreed to Dr. Staker\u2019s appointment by letters dated October 19, 2009 and January 27, 2010, respectively.\n\n17.\n\nIn the course of presenting its arguments at the July 2, 2009 meeting, Continental raised a preliminary objection that Argentina\u2019s Application was not made within the time limit stipulated in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention and was therefore outside the jurisdiction of the Committee. It was agreed and decided that Continental was within 14 days from the July, 2 2009 meeting to file a written submission setting out its preliminary objection, that Argentina was to file its response within 30 days from receipt of Continental\u2019s submission, and that both parties reserved their right to request leave from the Committee for further procedures concerning Continental\u2019s submission on its preliminary objection.\n\n18.\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Continental filed an objection to Argentina\u2019s Application.\n\n19.\n\nOn August 21, 2009, Argentina submitted a response to Continental\u2019s objection to Argentina\u2019s Application.\n\n20.\n\nUpon analysis of each party\u2019s position, on October 23, 2009, the Committee issued a decision on the Argentina\u2019s application for a stay of enforcement of the award, determining that the stay of enforcement of the Award would continue throughout the proceeding; and a decision on Continental\u2019s preliminary objection to the Argentina\u2019s Application, rejecting Continental\u2019s objections and reserving the issue of costs until the end of the annulment proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 30, 2009, Continental filed a memorial on annulment with regard to its application for partial annulment.\n\n22.\n\nOn December 22, 2009, Argentina filed a memorial on annulment with regard to its application for partial annulment.\n\n23.\n\nOn January 26, 2010, the parties were informed that Mr. Tom\u00e1s Sol\u00eds had accepted a position outside the Centre and that Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein,, ICSID, would be appointed to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n24.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, Argentina filed a counter-memorial on annulment with regard to Continental\u2019s Application.\n\n25.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, Continental filed a counter-memorial on annulment with regard to Argentina\u2019s Application.\n\n26.\n\nOn May 7, 2010, Continental filed a reply on annulment with regard to its application for partial annulment.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 2, 2010, Argentina filed a reply on annulment with regard to its application for partial annulment.\n\n28.\n\nOn July 16, 2010, Argentina filed a rejoinder on annulment with regard to Continental\u2019s Application.\n\n29.\n\nOn September 7, 2010, Continental filed a rejoinder on annulment with regard to Argentina\u2019s Application.\n\n30.\n\nPursuant to the Committee\u2019s directions, on November 1, 2010, each party provided a statement of the findings and orders sought by that party.\n\n31.\n\nAfter consulting with the parties, the Committee determined the order of address by the parties at the hearing, which was communicated to the parties on November 2, 2010.\n\n32.\n\nFrom November 8 to 10, 2010, a hearing for Continental\u2019s Application and Argentina\u2019s Application (the **\"Hearing\")** was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Present at the Hearing were:\n\n(1) The Committee:\n\nDr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., President\n\nJudge Bola A. Ajibola Mr. Christer Soderlund;\n\nAssistant to the Committee: Dr Christopher Staker\n\n(2) ICSID Secretariat: Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Secretary of the Committee\n\n(3) Representatives of Continental:\n\nMr. Rick Ehlers, Vice-President & Associate General Counsel, Continental Casualty\n\nMr. Barry Appleton, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Mr. Martin Endicott, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Mr. Kyle Dickson-Smith, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Ms. Mona Devi Davies, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Mr. Ugljesa (Ugo) Popadic, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Ms. Sue Ki, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Mr. Martin Paul Kocandrle, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Ms. Juliet Rebecca French, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers Ms. Ke-Ying Andrea See (Andrea See), Appleton & Associates\n\nInternational Lawyers\n\nMs. Evgheni Gusilic, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers\n\n(4) Representatives of Argentina:\n\nDr. Horacio Diez, Deputy Treasury Attorney General\n\nDr. Gabriel Bottini, National Director of International Affairs and Controversies, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\nDr. Ignacio Torterola, Liason PTN/ICSID\n\nDr. Silvina Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano, Counsel, National Direction of International Affairs and Controversies, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\nDr. Alejandro Turyn, Counsel, National Direction of International Affairs and Controversies, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\nDr. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista, Counsel, National Direction of International Affairs and Controversies, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\nDr. Mariana Lozza, Counsel, National Direction of International Affairs and Controversies, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\nMr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde, Counsel, Office of the Treasury Attorney General\n\n33.\n\nBy letters dated December 8, 2010, Continental submitted a statement of its costs in the proceedings, as well as a document entitled \"Issues before Continental Tribunal: Summary of References made by Continental at November 8-10, 2010 Annulment Hearing\" and three decisions of the Tribunal in the *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* case.\n\n34.\n\nBy a communication dated December 9, 2010, Argentina submitted a statement of its costs in the proceedings.\n\n35.\n\nBy a communication to the Committee dated December 16, 2010, Argentina requested leave to file a response to Continental\u2019s submission dated December 8, 2010.\n\n36.\n\nBy a communication to the Committee dated December 16, 2010, Continental opposed Argentina\u2019s request.\n\n37.\n\nBy a communication to the Committee dated December 17, 2010, Argentina renewed its request for leave to file a reply to Continental\u2019s submission of December 8, 2010, on the basis that Continental\u2019s submission went beyond a mere list of references that had been requested by the Committee at the Hearing.\n\n38.\n\nOn December 21, 2010, the parties were advised that the Committee was of the view that Continental\u2019s request *en passant* at the Hearing to be permitted to give references to the Committee of issues relevant to its Application for Annulment and a copy of the *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* case may be characterized as limited leave for a post-hearing submission. The Committee took the view that procedural fairness accordingly demanded that Argentina be permitted to respond to those two issues within 14 days.\n\n39.\n\nOn January 4, 2011, Argentina filed its comments on the additional submissions of Continental dated December 8, 2010.\n\n40.\n\nThe Committee declared the proceedings closed on September 8, 2011.\n\n41.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication and have taken into account all pleadings, documents and evidence before them.\n\n**B. The dispute**\n------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe nature of the dispute between Continental and Argentina that was the subject of the Award, as found by the Tribunal, was in summary as follows.\n\n43.\n\nContinental is a company incorporated under the law of the State of Illinois, United States of America.\n\n44.\n\nCNA Aseguradora de Riesgos del Trabajo S.A. **(\"CNA ART\"** or **\"CNA\"),** a company incorporated in Argentina in 1996, provides workers compensation insurance services in Argentina. Continental claimed1 that with the privatisation in Argentina of the workers\u2019 accident insurance sector in 1996, Continental acquired a 70% interest in CNA, and subsequently increased its participation to virtually 100% in 2000.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 16.\n\n45.\n\nContinental further claimed2 that CNA, like other insurance companies, maintains a portfolio of investment securities in order to earn a return on its capital, consisting mainly of \"low-risk assets such as cash deposit, treasury bills and government bonds\", and that with minor exceptions, investments were required to be in Argentina. Continental additionally claimed3 that Argentina\u2019s Superintendent of Insurance (SSN) lays down criteria for insurance companies such as CNA concerning the ratio of reserves they have to hold and the types of investment they may make.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 16.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 130.\n\n46.\n\nIn 2001-2002, Argentina suffered a severe economic crisis. The history of that economic crisis, and the measures adopted by the Government of Argentina to seek to address it, are described in the Award, in particular, at paragraphs 100 to 159. At paragraph 108 of the Award, the Tribunal said that *\"Argentina\u2019s crisis of 2001-2002 has been described both as \u2018one of the worst economic crises in its history\u2019 and \u2018among the most severe of recent economic crises\u2019 worldwide\".*\n\n47.\n\nContinental\u2019s claim was that certain of the measures adopted by the Government of Argentina in response to this economic crisis caused loss to Continental in breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations under the bilateral investment treaty between Argentina and the United States of America (the **\"BIT\").4**\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, signed November 14, 1991; entered Into force October 20, 1994.\n\n48.\n\nPrior to the economic crisis, under Argentina\u2019s Convertibility Law, the Argentine peso was freely convertible with the U.S. dollar at parity.5\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 105, 230.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to Continental, from about 2001, CNA held a portfolio of low risk U.S. dollar denominated assets in Argentina to a value of U.S.$ 100,998,000.6 This was said to be the result of a conscious decision by CNA\u2019s management to convert peso denominated assets into U.S. dollar denominated assets due to concerns about the possible devaluation of the peso,7 and Continental claimed that *\"CNA ART\u2019s policy of shifting its portfolio to U.S. dollar denominated assets Involved a deliberate choice to forego the higher yields of peso-denominated assets in favor of the greater capital security of U. S. dollar assets\"8*\n\nSee Award \u00b6 18.\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 18, 131-132.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 132, quoting Continental\u2019s Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, para. 26 ff.\n\n50.\n\nWith the developing economic crisis, Argentina adopted Decree 1387 on November 1, 2001 **(\"Decree 1387\").** This provided *Inter alia* for the voluntary swap of Government bonds for Government Guaranteed Loans **(\"GGLs\").** CNA decided to take advantage of this offer. Although the GGLs had longer maturities and lower interest rates than the Argentine Government bonds held by CNA, there were a number of advantages associated with entering into a swap, in particular in relation to legal security. The GGLs were denominated in U.S. dollars and their governing law was Argentinean law.9\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 121, 133-135.\n\n51.\n\nFollowing this swap, CNA\u2019s investment portfolio included GGLs totalling USD 17,295,320 at market value, Argentine Government Treasury Bills **(\"LETEs\")** totalling USD 2,805,000 at market value, term deposits **(\"CDs\")** held at full branch international banks and subsidiaries of international banks totalling USD 63,510,278, and a U.S. dollar cash account at Citibank also used for operational purposes. According to the Claimant, 92% of its portfolio of investments was expressed in U.S. dollar denominated assets.10\n\nSee Award \u00b6 135.\n\n52.\n\nThe next significant measure adopted by Argentina was Decree 1570 of December 1, 2001, known as the ***\"Corralito\".*** This decree limited cash withdrawals from bank accounts and prohibited transfers of funds out of the country with the exception of certain current transactions.11\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 100, 124, 126, 137-140.\n\n53.\n\nThe following month Argentina adopted Public Emergency Law 25,561 of January 6, 2002 (the **\"Emergency Law\").** This proclaimed a public emergency under Article 76 of the Argentine Constitution. It provided for the abolition of the convertibility regime, and for the abolition of the pegging of the peso to the U.S. dollar, and for forced conversion into pesos of all U.S. dollar denominated financial instruments, indebtedness and contracts **(\"pesification\").** It also granted extensive extraordinary powers in the above matters to the Government.12\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 100, 137, 141.\n\n54.\n\nResolution 6 of January 9, 2002, known as the ***\"Corral\u00f3n\",*** rescheduled maturity dates and reduced interest rates for all demand term deposits within the banking system (both in pesos and U.S. dollars). CNA's term deposits with various banks were subject to this measure.13\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 137, 139, 143.\n\n55.\n\nDecree 214 of February 3, 2002 **(\"Decree 214\")** provided for the conversion into pesos of \"all obligations to pay money expressed in dollars\" (compulsory pesification). Contracts between private persons and debts owed to financial institutions were converted at the rate of 1:1. U.S. dollar deposits within the banking system were converted at the rate of 1.40 peso for each dollar (\"asymmetric\" pesification), and granted an indexation to compensate for future inflation (\"CER\"). CNA\u2019s cash deposits with its banks were also subject to this measure.14\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 137, 144.\n\n56.\n\nDecree 260/02, effective February 11, 2002 **(\"Decree 260/02\"),** abolished this dual system of pesification. On the date it came into force, the exchange rate depreciated to 1.8 peso per U.S. dollar. The peak devaluation was reached on June 25, 2002 (almost 4 pesos to a dollar). Later, the exchange rate stabilized around three pesos for one U.S. dollar.15\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 137, 142.\n\n57.\n\nOn March 8, 2002, Decree 471/02 **(\"Decree 471/02\")** converted all U.S. dollar denominated government debt, \"the law applicable to which is only Argentine law,\" into pesos (pesification) at the rate of 1 U.S. dollar to 1.4 pesos. The U.S. dollar denominated LETEs and GGLs held by CNA were thereby converted into pesos. The pesified instruments were to be indexed at the CER rate and would earn a reduced interest.16\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 137, 145.\n\n58.\n\nOne effect of this particular measure was that, since the peso value of these holdings had increased by 40%, the balance sheet of CNA showed a capital gain, as was the case of all companies in the same situation. This capital gain was taxed at the statutory rate.17\n\nSee Award \u00b6 145.\n\n59.\n\nDecree 644/02 of April 18, 2002 **(\"Decree 644/02\")** requested the holders of GGLs to accept their conversion in pesos and a reduction in their original security in order to receive payment. Holders that did not accept these conditions would receive back the bonds they had handed in for the swap. CNA opted to continue to hold the GGLs as the bonds they had swapped for them were in default.18\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 137, 146.\n\n60.\n\nResolution 73 of April 25, 2002 deferred payment of the public debt of the national Government to December 31, 2002 \"or until financing thereof has been completed if the latter is completed before that date.\" Although GGLs were not subject to the deferral, interest payments due in April, May, June and July 2002 were only made on August 8, 2002.19\n\nSee Award \u00b6 147.\n\n61.\n\nDecree 905 of May 31, 2002 offered U.S. dollar denominated bonds (BODEN 2012) in exchange for the term deposit dollars that had been pesified by Decree 214. It also provided a choice as to the receipt of BODEN 2012 for depositors in financial institutions in distress, including a bank where CNA held term deposits. CNA opted for converting these deposits into USD 4,470,900 worth of BODEN 2012.20\n\nSee Award \u00b6 149\n\n62.\n\nDecree 739 of March 28, 2003 provided for an elaborate scheme of \"partial thawing\" of the bank freeze, involving amongst other matters the distribution of further bonds. Continental complained that these bonds were not issued on the due dates and that payments of the initial interest were delayed.21\n\nSee Award \u00b6 150.\n\n63.\n\nDecree 1735/04 of December 2004 **(\"Decree 1735/04\")** offered a swap of the LETEs and several other securities in default, against newly issued securities. CNA did not accept this conversion, since it would have received in exchange \"only U.S.$ 0.30 per dollar and would have been required to waive its rights\" and to accept long maturities on bonds from a Government \"that had demonstrated its willingness to repeatedly default on its debt\".22\n\nSee Award \u00b6 151, quoting Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, para 78.\n\n64.\n\nIn January 2003, Continental commenced ICSID arbitration proceedings against Argentina, alleging that measures taken by Argentina in respect of Continental\u2019s investment in CNA breached Continental\u2019s rights as investor under the BIT. Continental invoked in particular the provisions in the BIT that:\n\n(a) each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments (Article ll(2)(c) of the BIT) (the **\"umbrella clause\");**\n\n(b) investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law (Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT) (the **\"fair and equitable treatment clause\");**\n\n(c) each Party shall permit all transfers related to an investment to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory (Article V of the BIT) (the **\"transfers clause\");** and\n\n(d) investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization except, amongst other conditions, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation (Article IV of the BIT) (the **\"expropriation clause\").**\n\n65.\n\nContinental claimed compensation for the damages said to have been suffered in consequence of these breaches of the BIT.\n\n66.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal considered that measures taken by Argentina to deal with the 2001-2002 economic crisis were capable of falling within the scope of Article XI of the BIT, which provides that:\n\n*This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of International peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security Interests.*\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal found, at paragraph 179 of the Award, that the crisis which Argentina faced in the latter part of 2001, and which continued into 2002, was covered by the application of Article XI, and that *\"Measures that would have been otherwise in breach of the Treaty could be lawfully Implemented by Argentina In that crisis, provided that all other requirements are respected, first of all that of actual \u2018necessity\u2019\".*\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that each of the measures taken by Argentina complained of by Continental satisfied the requirements of Article XI, other than Decree 1735/04 of December 2004 (paragraph 63 above).\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal found that there was no breach of the transfers clause in Article V of the BIT because the transfers that Continental claimed that it was prevented from making were not transfers of a kind to which Article V applied.23\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 237-245.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the imposition of capital gains tax on the increase in the peso value of assets following their pesification (paragraphs 57-58 above) did not breach either the fair and equitable treatment clause or the expropriation clause. The Tribunal found that the currency of Argentina was the peso and that CNA\u2019s corporate accounts were expressed in pesos, and that the increase in peso value was properly considered a capital gain, subject to the general applicable tax regime.24\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 267-270.\n\n70.\n\nExcept in relation to Decree 1735/04, the Tribunal found that there had been no violation of the fair and equitable treatment clause by virtue of Article XI of the BIT.25\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 246-266.\n\n71.\n\nIn relation to Decree 1735/04, the Tribunal found that there had been a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in relation to the *restructuring* of the LETEs.26 it found that there was no such breach in relation to the *pesification* of the LETEs because the pesification was covered by Article XI of the BIT.27 The Tribunal reached this conclusion in respect of Decree 1735/04 in the light of its late date when Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality, the reduced percentage of the original value of the debt that Argentina unilaterally offered to recognise, and the condition that any other rights including those under the BIT would be waived.28 The Tribunal found that the loss sustained by Continental to be made good by Argentina in relation to the restructuring of the LETEs was USD 2.8 million.29\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 220-222.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 265.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 221.\n\nSee Award \u00b6 265.\n\n72.\n\nExcept in relation to Decree 1735/04, the Tribunal found that there had been no violation of the expropriation clause, by virtue of Article XI of the BIT. In relation to Decree 1735/04, the Tribunal considered that having already decided the claim under Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, there was no need to pronounce further on the alternative claim under Article IV of the BIT.30\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 271-285.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal found that there had been no breach of the umbrella clause. The Tribunal considered that except as regards the GGLs, the obligations which Continental alleged to have been breached were not covered by the umbrella clause. In so far as the GGLs might have been covered by the umbrella clause, the Tribunal found that Article XI of the BIT was applicable.31\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 286-303.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly found that the only claim of breach of the BIT on which Continental prevailed was that referred to in paragraph 71 above. The Tribunal awarded Continental damages of USD 2.8 million with interest.\n\n75.\n\nBoth parties now apply for partial annulment of the Award.\n\n76.\n\nIn their November 1, 2010 statements (see paragraph 30 above) the parties requested the Committee to make the following findings and orders.\n\n77.\n\nIn respect of Continental\u2019s Application, Continental requests that the Committee:\n\n(1) pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning that the Argentine Republic may rely on Article XI of the Treaty to preclude its liability and obligation to compensate Continental;\n\n(2) pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b), 52(1)(d), and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and any possible associated *[sic]* in relation to Continental\u2019s claim for compensation for unfair treatment and breach of the terms of its financial instruments and other assets (other than the LETEs) after the period in which Article XI was held to apply;\n\n(3) pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b), 52(1)(d) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning that, as regards the application of Art. XI of the Treaty, Continental bore the burden of proving that the Argentine Republic had alternative measures reasonably available and was required to do so beyond reasonable doubt;\n\n(4) pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning in relation to Continental\u2019s claim under Article V of the Treaty;\n\n(5) pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b), 52(1)(d) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, annuls the finding of the Tribunal and associated reasoning in relation to Continental\u2019s claim in respect of the LETEs under Article IV of the Treaty;\n\n(6) consequently to (1)-(5) above, annuls the decision of the Tribunal in paragraphs 320 (A), (C) and (D) of the Award;\n\n(7) confirms that the decision of the Tribunal in paragraph 320(B) of the Award is not affected by the annulment of paragraph 320(A);\n\n(8) decides that the Argentine Republic shall bear all of the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee;\n\n(9) decides that the Argentine Republic shall bear Continental\u2019s litigation costs and expenses with respect to this annulment proceeding, including Continental\u2019s costs of legal representation.\n\nArgentina for its part requests that the Committee find that:\n\n(1) the Tribunal did not fail to decide Continental\u2019s claim for loss after the \"State of Necessity\" was over;\n\n(2) the Tribunal did not fail to apply the right principle of burden of proof;\n\n(3) the Tribunal did not fail to determine Continental\u2019s expropriation claim in relation to the LETEs;\n\n(4) the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in relation to the alleged breach of Article V (Transfer of Funds) of the Treaty.\n\n78.\n\nIn respect of Argentina\u2019s Application, Argentina requests that the Committee find that:\n\n(1) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based regarding the restructuring of the Argentine Republic\u2019s (domestic and foreign) sovereign debt;\n\n(2) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in deciding on an extremely complex issue without relying upon any evidence and without stating the reasons why it reached its conclusions;\n\n(3) the fact that the Tribunal, without evidence, has described and decided on Argentina\u2019s payment capacity, the \"unilateral\" nature of the swap offer, the amount offered to the holders by means of the swap, and the limitation on future claims, and the fact that such completely unfounded descriptions have been used as grounds to state that Argentina violated the BIT entail such arbitrariness that it amounts to a manifest excess of powers;\n\n(4) in addition, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based in considering that Argentina violated Article Il(2)(a) of the BIT by restructuring the LETEs (Award paragraphs 264-265) and that the Argentine Republic could not invoke the defence provided for by Article XI of the BIT or the state of necessity under customary international law;\n\n(5) the Tribunal clearly contradicted itself and manifestly exceeded its powers in stating that the default is protected under Article XI of the BIT, but then determining that the solution to such default entailed a substantive loss, without providing any reason why the offer made by Argentina to escape default was unreasonable;\n\n(6) such lack of evidence caused the Tribunal to manifestly exceed its powers and fail to state the reasons on which the Award and the Decision on Rectification were based regarding Claimant\u2019s uninterrupted holding of the LETEs as from their acquisition until the time of the alleged collection;\n\n(7) the Tribunal also exceeded its powers when making unfounded determinations regarding the LETEs in respect of which the parties did not discuss during the hearing or the proceeding, and even an alert reader would not be able to understand the manner in which the Tribunal arrived at the conclusions drawn regarding the restructuring of the LETEs;\n\nArgentina therefore requests the Committee to find:\n\n(1) that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers in relation to its conclusions regarding Argentina\u2019s debt restructuring;\n\n(2) that pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 50, the Award rendered on September 5, 2008 in this case be partially annulled, in particular paragraphs 220-222, 264-266 and 320(B), exclusively with regard to the determination that Argentina\u2019s restructuring of the LETEs was in breach of the BIT, and that Argentina could not avail itself of the defence based on Article XI of the BIT or on the state of necessity in customary international law, and the subsequent decision to award a compensation on that basis (together with the relevant portion of the Decision on Jurisdiction);\n\n(3) that the other provisions and paragraphs of the Award remain unchanged; in effect, as the Tribunal was right in finding that Argentina\u2019s actions were protected under

The grounds for annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n79.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n80.\n\nIn the present annulment proceedings, both parties invoke the grounds in Article 52(1)(b) and (e) in their applications, and Continental additionally invokes the ground in Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**(b) The role of an** ***ad hoc*** **annulment committee**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAn ICSID award is not subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the ICSID Convention.32 In annulment proceedings under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* committee is thus not a court of appeal, and cannot consider the substance of the dispute, but can only determine whether the award should be annulled on one of the grounds in Article 52(1).33\n\nlCSID Convention, Article 53(1).\n\n*M.C.I.

Nor can it direct a tribunal on a resubmission how it should resolve substantive issues in dispute. All it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal: it can extinguish a* res judicata *but on a question of merits it cannot create a new one.

The annulment mechanism is not designed to bring about consistency in the interpretation and application of international investment law. The responsibility for ensuring consistency in the jurisprudence and for building a coherent body of law rests primarily with the investment tribunals. They* *are assisted in their task by the development of a common legal opinion and the progressive emergence of* \"une jurisprudence constante\"...35\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 24.\n\n84.\n\nNotwithstanding this, in relation to matters which fall within the competence of an *ad hoc* committee to decide, it is in the Committee\u2019s view to be expected that the *ad hoc* committee will have regard to relevant previous ICSID awards and decisions, including other annulment decisions, as well as to other relevant persuasive authorities. Although there is no doctrine of binding precedent in the ICSID arbitration system, the Committee considers that in the longer term the emergence of a *jurisprudence constante* in relation to annulment proceedings may be a desirable goal.\n\n85.\n\nIt has been observed that while it has been a frequent feature of ICSID annulment applications to submit that one and the same aspect of an award constitutes a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and a failure to state reasons, Article 52(1) is carefully divided into separate clauses, each dealing with a separate ground for annulment. Thus, if a party wishes to contend that a single aspect of an award constitutes simultaneously more than one ground for annulment under Article 52(1), *\"it must identify separately how the very different considerations involved in each of these enquiries are nevertheless provoked by the same aspect of an impugned award\u2019.36*\n\nDuke Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\n**(c) Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b))**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThis ground of annulment will exist where the tribunal lacked jurisdiction, for instance because the dispute is not covered by the arbitration agreement. This ground of annulment may also exist where the tribunal disregards the applicable law or bases the award on a law other than the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.37\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 136, and the earlier case law there cited; *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 67; *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 78.\n\n87.\n\nAdditionally, it is an express requirement of Article 52(1)(b) of the lCSID Convention that:\n\n*the error must be \"manifest\", not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough38*\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 47 quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 48; also *MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51, 55; *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-69; *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 78; *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 69; *Duke* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 98-99, 160, 182.\n\n88.\n\nIn the present case, the submissions of Continental on the scope of this ground of annulment included the following:\n\n*Another basic requirement is that the Tribunal must exercise its power properly. Its power must be exercised in good faith and for the purpose intended, taking into account all relevant considerations while ignoring all irrelevant considerations; and with a demonstrable rational connection between those considerations and the Tribunal\u2019s determination of each of the questions submitted to it. To fail to do so is an abuse of power and thereby to manifestly exceed its power.39*\n\nHearing transcript, November 8, 2010, p. 24.\n\n89.\n\nContinental further submitted that where the applicable law is an investment treaty, it amounts to a failure to apply the applicable law for the Tribunal to apply one provision of the treaty, but to fail to apply or to consider the application of other relevant provisions of the treaty.40 Continental also contended that it amounted to a failure in this case for the Tribunal to apply a provision of the applicable BIT (in this case, Article XI), but to fail to consider relevant principles of public international law.41 An additional submission of Continental was that it amounts to a manifest error of law for the Tribunal to fail to have regard to the different legal effect of two different provisions of the BIT.42 Indeed, Continental goes further to suggest that if the Tribunal, in interpreting a provision of the BIT, refers by analogy to a provision of the GATT regime, it will be a manifest excess of powers for the Tribunal to refer to the inappropriate GATT provision.43\n\nFor instance, Hearing transcript, November 8, 2010, pp. 29-32 (contending that the Tribunal in this case failed to apply Article X of the BIT), p. 59 (contending that the Tribunal failed to apply Article 11(1) of the BIT). Continental submitted in this respect: \"... [the Tribunal] was required to apply all of the Treaty. It was not allowed to pick and choose like a bit of a smorgasbord. You can\u2019t just go to the buffet and pick what you like. You have to apply the whole Treaty.\" *(ibid.,* p. 55). Also Hearing transcript, November 9, 2010, p. 261: \"Did the Tribunal fail to apply the law that it was required to apply? That is the simple test of annulment. And in this case, it is clear that the Tribunal failed to apply Article X of the Treaty\".\n\nFor instance, Hearing transcript, November 8, 2010, pp. 32-33 (contending that the Tribunal failed to apply \"well-known principles of International law such as proportionality, duration and reasonableness\", p. 34 (contending that it \"cannot be an application of Article XI when [the Tribunal has] missed an Integral part of the test that is required In its application\"), pp. 38-40 (contending that the Tribunal failed to take any position on the relationship between Article XI of the BIT and the customary International law principles reflected in Articles 25, 27, 30 and 31 of the ILC Articles).\n\nFor Instance, Hearing transcript, November 8, 2010, pp. 65-66 (contending, in relation to what Continental submitted was the different basis for calculating damages for breaches of the expropriation clause and fair and equitable treatment clause respectively, that the Tribunal \"flagged, in fact, the difference, and then... just ignored it\").\n\nFor instance, Hearing transcript, November 8, 2010, pp. 42-45 (contending that \"the Vienna Convention principles do not permit reference to irrelevant materials like GATT Article XX\", that the relevant GATT provision analogous to Article XI of the BIT is GATT Article XXI rather than GATT Article XX, and that \"[b]y relying on [GATT] Article XX, the Tribunal simply applied the wrong legal standard addressing a very different legal context and in a very different Treaty\").\n\n90.\n\nIt appears to the Committee that these contentions overstate the effect of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention to the extent that, if accepted, an annulment proceeding would be reconstituted as an appellate proceeding. In any event, the Committee considers that Continental\u2019s submission reaches beyond a proper construction of the effect of Article 52(1)(b). For instance, although Continental acknowledged that *\"it is not for this annulment Committee to decide whether the Tribunal was right or wrong\",44* at one point counsel for Continental submitted that: *\"The Tribunal got the test wrong. They got the law wrong and that is the test. That\u2019s what they did wrong\"45* Counsel for Continental also argued, for instance, that *\"the Tribunal failed to properly address the international law rules on treaty interpretation including the Vienna Convention\",* in that the Tribunal *\"took into account irrelevant provisions in its interpretation while completely ignoring the mandatory provisions of the Treaty\"46* The Committee considers that erroneous application of principles of treaty interpretation is also in itself an error of law, rather than a manifest excess of powers, at least where the error relates to the substantive issue before the Tribunal for decision, rather than to an issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nHearing transcript, November 8, 2010, p. 40.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 74,\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 87,\n\n91.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it will amount to a non-application of the applicable law for a tribunal to apply, for instance, the law of State X to determine a dispute when the applicable law is in fact the law of State Y or public international law. However, if the applicable law is the law of State X, and if the tribunal in fact applies the law of State X, it is not the role of an annulment committee to determine for itself whether the tribunal correctly identified all of the provisions of the law of State X that were relevant to the case before it, or whether the tribunal gave adequate consideration to each of those specific provisions and to the relationship between them, since this would be to venture into an enquiry into whether the tribunal applied the law correctly. Questions as to the relevance of particular provisions of the applicable law, and of their legal effect and interaction with other provisions of the applicable law, go to the substantive legal merits of the case and are within the power of a tribunal to decide. A tribunal\u2019s decision on such questions cannot amount to a manifest excess of power.\n\n92.\n\nWhere a tribunal fails to give any consideration *at all* to a particular provision of the applicable law, the logical inference is that the tribunal implicitly did not consider it to be relevant. For the tribunal to take such a view, rightly or wrongly, even merely by implication, is an exercise of the tribunal\u2019s power, and not an excess of power. Provided that the tribunal:\n\n(a) applies the applicable law (be it a treaty, or general international law, or the law of a particular State), and\n\n(b) gives reasons for its decision on all of the questions presented to it for decision,\n\nthe tribunal is not required to deal expressly with every provision of the applicable law that a party has invoked in its argument, and a *fortiori,* provisions that the parties did not invoke in their arguments before the tribunal.47\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edn 2009) **(\"Schreuer Commentary\"),** p. 964 \u00b6 226: \"... the inadvertent oversight of a detail in the law is one of the most common legal errors. A *pars pro toto* argument holding that disregard of one provision amounts to non-application of the law does not appear tenable. Partial non-application and erroneous application are Indistinguishable.\" See also *Duke* Annulment Decision \u00b6 144.\n\n93.\n\nIn some cases it may be an annullable error if a tribunal fails to consider a specific provision of the applicable law. For instance, suppose that a claimant brings a claim for damages under provision A of an investment treaty, and the respondent State specifically pleads in response that it has a defence to the claim under provision B of the treaty. In this case, it may well be an annullable error for the tribunal to find that there has been a breach of provision A, and to award damages to the claimant, without giving any consideration at all to the potential application of the defence in provision B.\n\n94.\n\nHowever, in such a case the annullable error most appropriately would be characterised as either a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (if it is determined that the tribunal allowed the claimant\u2019s claim without even considering the defence raised by the respondent), or a failure to state reasons for the decision (if it can be determined that the tribunal rejected the defence invoked by the respondent but failed to give reasons for doing so). The failure to consider provision B would be unlikely of itself to constitute a manifest excess of power by reason of failure to apply the applicable law, as the tribunal has nonetheless applied the investment treaty, which is the law that it was required to apply.\n\n**(d) Serious departure from fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAs was stated in the *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision:\n\n*... [u]nder Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure,\" that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision48*\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

However, no fundamental rule of procedure requires a tribunal to give express consideration to *every* argument or issue advanced by a party in support of its position in relation to a particular question.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 244.\n\n**(e) Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e))**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nFailure to deal with *questions* submitted to the tribunal has been considered by previous *ad hoc* annulment committees to be a failure to state reasons for purposes of this provision. On the other hand, while a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions* submitted to it (Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention), it is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions.53 it was said in the *Enron* Annulment Decision that *\"it is not the role of an annulment committee to examine* *meticulously the reasoning of the tribunal on a given issue to check that every* *point raised by a party has been given a clear answer\",54* and that:\n\n*... the tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the* questions. *This requires the tribunal* *to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or did not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its* decision, *but not necessarily reasons for its* reasons.55\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 66-67; *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 72, 222.

In the *MINE* Annulment Decision it was said that:\n\n*[T]he requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph 1(e)...*\n\n*In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.57*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.08-5.09, quoted In *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 53 and *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 74, 221.\n\n101.\n\nFurthermore, the tribunal\u2019s reasons *\"may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred* *from the terms used in the decision\"58* In the *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision, it was further said that:\n\n*It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal\u2019s decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the* ad hoc *Committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions can be explained by the* ad hoc *Committee itself.59*\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 81, quoted In *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 54; also *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

See also *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 83, stating that \"if reasons are not stated but are evident and a logical consequence of what is stated in an award, an *ad hoc* committee should be able to so hold\", but that \"if such reasons do not necessarily follow or flow from the award\u2019s reasoning, an *ad hoc* committee should not construct reasons in order to justify the decision of the tribunal\".\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 83, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 54 and *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 77. However, an annulment proceeding cannot cause an entire reopening of a case, and it is not for an *ad hoc* committee \"to intrude into the legal and factual decision-making of the Tribunal\": *Fraport* Annulment Decision \u00b6272.\n\n102.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in the *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision, which stated that:\n\n*[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state* any *reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.... Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.*\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article (52)(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are* *genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.60* [footnote omitted]\n\n*Vivendi* First Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65, quoted in *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 55 and *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 76. See also *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 82.\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee adds that for genuinely contradictory reasons to cancel each other out, they must be such as to be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision. An example might be where the basis for a tribunal\u2019s decision on one question is the existence of fact A, when the basis for its decision on another question is the *non-existence* of fact A. In cases where it is merely arguable whether there is a contradiction or inconsistency in the tribunal\u2019s reasoning, it is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument. Nor is it the role of an annulment committee to express its own view on whether or not the reasons given by the tribunal are logical or rational or correct.\n\n**II.

Failure to decide Continental\u2019s claim for loss after the state of necessity was over**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected all but part of one claim made by Continental on the basis that the measures adopted by Argentina that caused the claimed losses were within the scope of Article XI of the BIT.61\n\nSee paragraphs 42-74 above.\n\n105.\n\nThe first ground on which Continental seeks partial annulment of the Award is that:\n\n*The Tribunal failed to apply the governing law of the dispute by holding that the applicability of Article XI of the Treaty meant that Argentina was not required to pay compensation* *to the Applicant for measures taken during the economic difficulties, even after the economic difficulty was over62*\n\nContinental\u2019s Application, paragraph 2(b).\n\n106.\n\nContinental contends that in the proceedings before the Tribunal, Continental had argued that even if the Tribunal were to find that Article XI of the BIT were applicable, Argentina was still required to compensate Continental and cease its actions in breach of the BIT once any threat to Argentina\u2019s essential security interests or public order had passed, and once continuation of those measures could no longer be justified under Article XI of the BIT.63\n\nContinental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, paragraphs 57-59, referring to Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraphs 360-364.\n\n107.\n\nContinental contends that:\n\n*Despite having jurisdiction to do so, the Tribunal failed to determine this claim in manifest excess of their powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the lCSID Convention and/or failed to give reasons for any determination of this claim within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention64*\n\nContinental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, paragraph 60.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nContinental argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Relevant international law establishes that an exceptions provision cannot continue to justify breaches of a treaty commitment when the required situation or condition no longer exists.65\n\n(b) The Tribunal made a specific factual finding that Argentina\u2019s economic emergency was over on December 9, 2004, and, as a result, Argentina was from that time no longer able to rely upon a state of necessity to justify actions that would otherwise violate its Treaty obligations. The Tribunal further stated that Argentina\u2019s return to international financial markets occurred in September 2004.66 As a result, the Tribunal ruled that Argentina\u2019s actions with respect to its LETEs were not consistent with its Treaty obligations.67 However, the Tribunal failed to address the resumption of normal economic conditions on the remaining investments in the Continental\u2019s portfolio.\n\n(c) Argentina\u2019s refusal to pay the amounts due under the original terms of the financial instruments is a continuing breach that could not be justifiable after the state of necessity has passed.68\n\n(d) The Tribunal has thus rendered an Award that has allowed the emergency conditions to continue in perpetuity with respect to the majority of the Applicant\u2019s investments, which is an absurd and unfair result at odds with international jurisprudence on exceptions clauses such as Article XI.69\n\n(e) The Tribunal itself found that *\"None of the measures reinstated the \u2018status quo ante\"\u2019* and that measures introduced by Argentina to reestablish normal conditions in the financial market *\"failed to give any sufficient satisfaction to CNA or Continental; on the contrary, certain of these Measures are challenged by the Claimant as having caused further damage to its subsidiary in breach of the BIT\u201970*\n\n(f) Nothing in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning suggests that Argentina established that it could not, within a certain time frame, fully restore the value of Continental\u2019s investment that had been impaired by measures adopted during the \"state of necessity\" period. There is no doubt that Argentina has the power and fiscal capacity to honour the original terms of the financial instruments now that the emergency period has passed, nor is there any doubt that Argentina continues to refuse to pay on the basis of unilateral measures imposed during the state of necessity.\n\n(g) Continental\u2019s claim for its continuing post-\"state of necessity\" period loss (including its claim based on customary international law as reflected in Article 27 of the ILC Articles71) merited serious and detailed consideration but received none whatsoever.\n\n(h) The Tribunal reasoned that Article XI was to be understood in the context of Article XX GATT 1947, but failed to acknowledge that there is a *lex specialis* in the GATT concerning exceptions for economic crisis-based measures (Article XII). The Tribunal also failed to consider that while Article XI refers to security interests, these are dealt with not under Article XX of the GATT but Article XXI. In determining whether a particular measure was necessary, the Tribunal failed to consider the legal standard in the GATT applicable to balance-of-payments-based measures.72\n\n(i) The Tribunal failed to apply general principles of treaty interpretation, including the principle of effectiveness, notwithstanding Continental\u2019s specific submissions on this issue. The Tribunal took no position on the relationship between Article XI of the BIT and Article 25 of the ILC Articles, except in the case of the LETEs. The Tribunal did not consider the principles of customary international law reflected in Articles 27, 30 and 31 of the ILC Articles, which are essential legal elements that need to be applied in conjunction with Article XI. Article XI of the BIT does not itself state that its effect is to exempt Argentina totally from all responsibility for any breach under the BIT, and Article XI does not permit the Tribunal to ignore other provisions of the BIT. In general international law, \"necessary\" is understood as incorporating a need for proportionality, and the Tribunal failed to consider whether the measures affecting Continental were being eased or removed promptly, as they were no longer necessary because of the abatement of the crisis. The Tribunal was required to apply the customary international law test of proportionality at various points in time.\n\n(j) Applying the correct onus and standard of proof are fundamental legal requirements of a valid award. It is established international law that the party relying on an exceptions clause bears the onus of proving that it applies. The Tribunal apparently understood73 the proposition that measures need not be indispensable in order to be \"necessary\" within the meaning of an exception clause as placing the onus on Continental to prove that Argentina\u2019s measures were not necessary. This amounts to a reversal of the burden of proof under international law which places a burden on Argentina to prove on a balance of probabilities the elements of the defence it was invoking. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of whether Argentina\u2019s measures were necessary consists of the Tribunal assessing and rejecting Continental\u2019s arguments,74 and the Tribunal nowhere suggests that Argentina has met the burden of proof on necessity.\n\n(k) The Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the correct burden of proof was of material significance because there was expert evidence that suggested a difference of expert views on what was or was not in fact a reasonably available alternative.\n\n(l) The manner of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning suggests that it also applied the wrong *standard* of proof, requiring Continental to prove that there were reasonably available alternatives beyond a reasonable doubt. The mere existence of some evidence that put in question whether the alternatives suggested were reasonably available was apparently sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that Argentina\u2019s chosen measures were necessary.\n\n(m) The Tribunal either failed to consider Continental\u2019s claim for its postdate of necessity\" period loss and associated arguments, or if it did consider them, failed to give \"reasons for its rejection as an indispensable component of the statement of reasons on which its conclusion was based\", and ignored a decisive argument that it was required to address.75\n\n(n) The Award in this case is inconsistent with the *LG&E* Award, which found that under Article XI of the BIT, once the emergency situation has been overcome, *\"the State is no longer exempted from responsibility for any violation of its obligations under the International law and shall reassume them Immediately\"76*\n\nReferring to *United States - Import Prohibition on Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products (Recourse to Article 21.5 by Malaysia)* (2001), WT/DS58/RW (Panel Report) at paras. 6.1-6.2; *US-Tuna* (1982) GATT \u00b6 4.6; *United States - Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline* (29 April 1996) WT/DS2/AB/R (Report of the Appellate Body) p. 22; *Phillips Petroleum Co.

The Tribunal said that it would first analyse Article XI as its application \"may be such as to render superfluous a detailed examination of the defense of necessity\".77 That ultimately proved to be the case.\n\n(b) The Tribunal clearly distinguished between the doctrine of state of necessity and Article XI of the Treaty,78 which shows that the Tribunal did not confuse the two concepts.79\n\n(c) The Tribunal concluded that each of the measures complained of by Continental were within the scope of Article XI,80 except for the restructuring of Treasury Bills (LETEs),81 which the Tribunal expressly stated also did not fall within the scope of the customary international law doctrine of state of necessity.82\n\n(d) Continental\u2019s argument is misplaced, since the application of Article XI entails that there is no breach of the Treaty whatsoever, whereas the application of the state of necessity doctrine *presupposes* the existence of a Treaty violation.\n\n(e) An ICSID Tribunal is not bound to follow the decisions of Tribunals in other cases, and failure to do so does not mean that it has failed to decide on the matters on which it had to. The Award is in any event consistent with the *CMS* Annulment Decision.83\n\n(f) It was not the case that the Tribunal required Continental to prove its case without demanding that Argentina meet its burden of proof. Argentina presented a great deal of evidence to the Tribunal indicating that Article XI was applicable to the facts, and Argentina ultimately proved that it was.\n\n(g) The Award explained and applied in an accurate and correct fashion the standard of proof in relation to Article XI of the BIT.84 Because Argentina\u2019s position was that there was no other alternative measures that it could have taken, the Tribunal had to analyse the issues by reference to the alternative measures that Continental claimed could have been taken by Argentina. The Award first correctly established that Argentina discharged its obligation to prove that it was acting under the protection of Article XI after considering that each of the requirements set forth in the BIT had been met, and subsequently analyzed the arguments and evidence provided by Continental, which were deemed to be insufficient. The Tribunal took into consideration and rendered a decision on each of the alleged alternatives, bearing in mind the evidence produced.85 Continental cannot specifically identify any part of the Award in which the Tribunal has incorrectly applied the principles governing the burden of proof\u2014which would not in any event amount to a ground for annulment.\n\n(h) The Tribunal determined, in application of Article XI, that the pesification of the economy and the other related measures were valid and lawful measures which produced their effects at the time when they were adopted. The measures had their effects at the time when implemented, notwithstanding the survival of the legal relationships arising out of those contracts. They are not continuing acts, in the same way as the continuing detention of a hostage.\n\n(i) Article XI of the BIT does not require measures to be temporary in nature, unlike the provisions of article 27(1) of the Draft Articles of the ILC with respect to the situations which preclude wrongfulness, such as the state of necessity.\n\n(j) The cases relied on by Continental refer to facts which are very different from those upon which the Tribunal had to render its decision in the Award.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 162.\n\nReferring to Award, Part IV.A, especially \u00b6\u00b6 163-168.\n\nDistinguishing *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P.,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, May 22, 2007 and *Sempra Energy International v.

Continental\u2019s argument is, in essence, that the Tribunal failed to consider or decide upon this argument at all, and that this failure amounted to an annullable error.\n\n111.\n\nThe relevant paragraphs of Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial read as follows:\n\n***5. In the Alternative, Any Threats To Argentina\u2019s Essential Security Interests or To Public Order Have Passed***\n\n*360. Even if Article XI does disrupt the BIT parties\u2019 obligation to compensate, Argentina must still compensate the Investor* *and cease its actions in breach of the Treaty because any threat to Argentina\u2019s essential security interests or public order has passed. In rejecting Argentina\u2019s argument that Argentina could rely on Article XI of the US-Argentina BIT to avoid compensating the Claimant, the* CMS *Tribunal found that \"[e]ven if the plea of necessity were accepted, compliance with the obligation would reemerge as soon as the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer existed, which is the case at present. \"'(362)*\n\n*361. Indeed, the* CMS *Tribunal states that Professor Slaughter confirmed this view during her cross-examination before that Tribunal.(363)*\n\n*362. The view of Argentina\u2019s expert and the* CMS *Tribunal on this point is consistent with the ordinary meaning of Article XI. The Article preserves the application of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order or to protect essential security interests; the Article says nothing about the application of measures no longer necessary for the maintenance of public order or to protect essential security interests.*\n\n*363. The view of Argentina\u2019s expert and the* CMS *Tribunal on this point is also consistent with \"relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\" Article 27(a) of the ILC Articles captures the customary international law rule, supported by the ICJ in the* Rainbow Warrior *and* Gabcikovo-Nagymaros *cases, that a state must comply with its international obligation as soon as the circumstances precluding wrongfulness no longer exist.(364) The Edwards Report confirms that the economic circumstances on which Argentina relies to invoke Article XI no longer exist(365)*\n\n*364. Argentina has accepted that its economy has improved. The Commentary to Article 27 of the* ILC Articles *clarifies that states invoking the defense of necessity must fulfill their obligations to the extent that the circumstances giving rise to the defense have changed.(366) Article 27 of the ILC Articles, therefore, obliges Argentina to pay compensation in light of the improvement in Argentina\u2019s economy.*\n\n*(360) See Part Two, Section V(C) above.*\n\n*(361) See Part Two, Section VI(B)(4) above.*\n\n*(362)* CMS v. Argentina, *Award at para. 382**. (Claimant\u2019s Book of Authorities, Tab CLA 85).*\n\n*(363)* CMS v. Argentina, *Award at para. 392**: \"The answer to this question by the Respondent\u2019s expert clarifies the issue from the point of view of both its temporary nature and the duty to provide compensation: while it is* *difficult to reach a determination as long as the crisis is unfolding, it is possible to envisage a situation in which the investor would have a claim against the government for the compliance with its obligations once the crisis was over; thereby concluding that any suspension of the right to compensation is strictly temporary, and that this right is not extinguished by the crisis events.\" (Claimant\u2019s Book of Authorities, Tab CLA 85).*\n\n*(364) See section V of this Reply Memorial.*\n\n*(365) Edwards Report at paras. 143-146 and para. 147: \"The crisis situation created in late 2001 and early 2002, is now past history.

Crawford,* The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility *at 189. The Commentary says the \"words \u2018and to the extent\u2019 [in Article 27(a)] are intended to cover situations in which the conditions preventing compliance gradually lessen and allow for partial performance of the obligation.\" (Claimant\u2019s Book of Authorities, Tab CLA 132).*\n\n112.\n\nContinental does not refer to any other part of the proceedings before the Tribunal where Continental advanced this argument. However, the Committee notes that the argument does appear to have been reflected in at least two other paragraphs of Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial:\n\n*Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial acknowledges that the economy has now recovered and that the conditions that Argentina relies upon to justify its measures no longer prevail.* *Yet, Argentina falls to draw the logical conclusion from this state of affairs - that its default on its public debt should be cured and deposit holders should be fully compensated for the confiscatory pesification of their deposits.* (Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, para 106 (footnote omitted).)\n\n*The Argentine economy has now recovered from its former condition. The defences Invoked by Argentina, even If they were properly made out, would still require compensation to be paid in these circumstances* (Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, para 407).\n\n113.\n\nThe only specific reference in the Award to this particular argument of Continental appears to be in the final sentence of paragraph 64, where the Award refers to paragraph 106 of Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial (quoted above) and paraphrases Continental\u2019s argument as follows: *\"Since Argentina\u2019s economy has now fully recovered, the Claimant concludes in this respect that \u2018deposit holders should be fully compensated for the confiscatory pesification of their deposits\"\u2019.*\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s main findings on the legal effect of Article XI of the BIT are contained in paragraphs 160 to 169 of the Award. In these paragraphs, the Tribunal made findings of law in respect of the differences between Article XI of the BIT and the principle of necessity under customary international law. In the proceedings before the Tribunal, it was not disputed by either party that Article 25 of the ILC Articles codified the customary international law principles,86 and the Tribunal proceeded on this basis.87\n\nAward \u00b6 165, footnote 238.\n\nAward \u00b6 165 (although the Tribunal\u2019s comments In footnote 238 may suggest that the Tribunal Itself refrained from expressly pronouncing on the point).\n\n115.\n\nArticle XI of the BIT is quoted in paragraph 66 above. Article 25 of the ILC Articles provides as follows:\n\n*1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:*\n\n*(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril;*\n\n*and*\n\n*(b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.*\n\n*2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:*\n\n*(a) The International obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or*\n\n*(b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity88*\n\nThe principle of customary international law which this provision was accepted as codifying is referred to below for convenience as the \"principle of necessity\". Article 27 of the ILC Articles then adds as follows:\n\n*The invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to:*\n\n*(a) compliance with the obligation in question, If and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists;*\n\n*(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.*\n\nAward \u00b6 303.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal found two main differences between Article XI of the BIT and the principle of necessity.\n\n117.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal found that the principle of necessity can be invoked in any context against any international obligation (other than a norm *ius cogens).* Because of this, the Tribunal considered that the principle of necessity is of an \"exceptional nature\",89 and \"can only be accepted on an exceptional basis\",90 and that its application is subject to *\"strict conditions\".91* On the other hand, Article XI of the BIT was considered to be a specific provision which could potentially apply only to the particular investment protection obligations in the bilaterally agreed BIT itself.92 Because of this, the Tribunal considered that Article XI of the BIT *\"is not necessarily subject to the same conditions of application as the plea of necessity under general international law\"93*\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 167, footnote 244, quoting the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 167, footnote 244, quoting *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (HungarylSIovakia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1997,* p. 7, at p. 40, para. 51.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 166 and 167.\n\nAward \u00b6 167.\n\nAward \u00b6 167.\n\n118.\n\nIt is clearly implicit from this that the Tribunal was contemplating that the potential application of Article XI of the BIT was not necessarily subject to the same \"strict conditions\" as the application of the principle of necessity. However, the Tribunal did go on to say that the customary international law principle of necessity might nonetheless be relevant to its interpretation.94\n\nAward \u00b6 168.\n\n119.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal considered that the *effect* of the application of Article XI of the BIT was different to the effect of the principle of necessity. The Tribunal described the effect of Article XI of the BIT as follows:\n\n*The consequence would be that, under Art. XI, such measures would lie outside the scope of the Treaty so that the party taking it would not be in breach of the relevant BIT provision. A private investor of the other party could therefore* *not succeed in its claim for responsibility and damages in such an instance, because the respondent party would not have acted against its BIT obligations since these would not be applicable, provided of course that the conditions for the application of Art. XI are met. In other words, Art. XI restricts or derogates from the substantial obligations undertaken by the parties to the BIT in so far as the conditions of its invocation are met. In fact, Art. XI has been defined as a safeguard clause; it has been said that it recognizes \"reserved rights,\" or that it contemplates \"non-precluded\" measures to which a contracting state party can resort.95*\n\nAward \u00b6 164 (footnotes omitted).\n\n120.\n\nThe difference in this effect of the application of Article XI of the BIT and of the application of the principle of necessity was explained by the Tribunal in footnote 236 of the Award as follows:\n\n*This Tribunal is thus minded to accept the position of the* Ad Hoc *Annulment Committee in the ICSID case* CMS v. Argentina, *where it states: \"Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations\"* (CMS Annulment Decision, *para. 129)**. On the one hand, if Art. XI is applicable because the measure at issue was necessary in order to safeguard essential security interest, then the treaty is inapplicable to such measure. On the other hand, if a State is forced by necessity to resort to a measure in breach of an international obligation but complying with the requirements listed in Art. 25 ILC, the State escapes from the responsibility that would otherwise derive from that breach.*\n\n121.\n\nSubsequently, in footnote 241 of the Award, the Tribunal quoted from one of the reports of the Special Rapporteur produced in the course of the ILC\u2019s work on the ILC Articles, to the effect that *\"when a State invokes the state of necessity, it has full knowledge of the fact that it deliberately chooses a procedure that does not abide an international obligation\".* The Tribunal then added that *\"This is an argument that would not be applicable to the invocation of Art. XT.*\n\n122.\n\nAt footnote 242 of the Award, the Tribunal again proceeded to state that it agreed with paragraphs 129 to 134 of the *CMS* Annulment Decision. Paragraph 129 of the *CMS* Annulment Decision was already referred to in footnote 236 of the Award, quoted above. The full text of that paragraph is as follows:\n\n*The Committee observes first that there is some analogy in the language used in Article XI of the BIT and in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. The first text mentions \"necessary\" measures and the second relates to the \"state of necessity\". However Article XI specifies the conditions under which the Treaty may be applied, whereas Article 25 is drafted in a negative way: it excludes the application of the state of necessity on the merits, unless certain stringent conditions are met. Moreover, Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations.*\n\n123.\n\nAt footnote 242 of the Award, the Tribunal then proceeded further to state that it disagreed with the position taken at paragraph 55 of the *Mitchell* Annulment Decision. In the latter, it was stated in relation to a similarly worded provision in a different bilateral investment treaty that:\n\n*Article X(1) of the Treaty is a provision relating to the causes for exemption from liability, or, in other words, a provision which precludes the wrongfulness of the behavior of the State in certain exceptional circumstances, and not a provision which delimits the scope of application of the Treaty [footnote omitted].*\n\nBy expressly disagreeing with this paragraph of the *Mitchell* Annulment Decision, the Tribunal in the present case by necessary implication took the position that Article XI of the BIT *does* delimit the scope of application of the BIT.\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee considers it abundantly clear from the Award that the Tribunal considered that where the host State takes a measure of the kind referred to in Article XI of the BIT, the substantive obligations under the BIT simply do not apply to that measure. The logical consequence of this conclusion is that the measure cannot amount to a violation of any provision of the BIT.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Article XI applied to relevant measures taken by Argentina in this case because they were taken *\"in the face of the social and economic crisis\",96* and found that they *\"were sufficient in their design to address the crisis and were applied in a reasonable and proportionate way at the end of* *2001-2002\"97* However, while the Tribunal reached this conclusion in respect of the measures taken by Argentina in 2001 -2002, it reached a contrary conclusion in relation to the restructuring of the LETEs through Decree 1735/04, a measure that was adopted in December 2004. One of the reasons for finding that Article XI did not apply to Decree 1735/04 was that by that time *\"Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality.\"98*\n\nAward \u00b6 233.\n\nAward \u00b6 232.\n\nAward \u00b6 221 (a).\n\n126.\n\nIt is true that the Tribunal does not *expressly* address the question of whether Argentina could have any responsibility under the BIT in respect of the 2001-2002 measures once the economic crisis was over. However, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal\u2019s position on this issue is sufficiently implicit from a reading of the Award as a whole, and in the particular light of the passages referred to above. As the Tribunal found that the BIT was simply inapplicable to the 2001-2002 measures by virtue of Article XI, due to the crisis then prevailing, it must be understood as implicit that the Tribunal was of the view that Argentina was under no obligation to compensate Continental for having taken those measures, once the crisis was over. If it is the case, as the Tribunal found, that the BIT was simply inapplicable to the 2001-2002 measures by virtue of Article XI, due to the crisis then prevailing, then it would follow that those measures cannot be a violation of the BIT, even if their *consequences* continue to be felt after the crisis is over. Whether the measures were temporary or permanent, and in either case, whether the temporary or permanent effects continued to be felt after the period of crisis was over, was considered by the Tribunal not to be material. If, as the Tribunal found, those measures were within the scope of Article XI, the logical conclusion would be that the BIT did not apply to the continuing consequences of those measures even after the end of the economic crisis.\n\n127.\n\nThe argument advanced in paragraphs 360 to 364 of Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, quoted at paragraph 111 above, relies primarily on Article 27 of the ILC Articles. However, the Tribunal expressly found, as set out above, that the effect of the application of Article XI of the BIT is different to the effect of the application of Article 25 (and by logical implication, of Article 27) of the ILC Articles. The argument in Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial also relies on paragraphs 382 and 392 of the *CMS* Award.99 However, the findings of the tribunal in the *CMS* Award were subsequently criticised by the *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* Annulment Decision. The *ad hoc* committee in that case said with reference to the *CMS* Award that:\n\n*... the Tribunal evidently considered that Article XI was to be interpreted in the light of the customary international law concerning the state of necessity and that, if the conditions fixed under that law were not met, Argentina\u2019s defense under Article XI was likewise to be rejected.100*\n\nThe *CMS* Annulment Decision also went on to criticise the *CMS* Award for *\"simply assuming that Article XI and Article 25 are on the same footing\",101* and for failing to recognise that *\"Article XI and Article 25 are substantively different\".102* As set out above, the Tribunal in the present case expressly agreed with paragraphs 129 to 134 of the *CMS* Annulment Decision.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, May 12, 2005 ***(\"CMS*** **Award\").**\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 124. The *ad hoc* committee said that the tribunal \"evidently considered\" this, because although the tribunal\u2019s reasoning had been \"Inadequate\" and \"could certainly have been clearer\", both parties had understood the award in this sense, and the tribunal\u2019s reasoning was found to be sufficiently Implicit *(ibid,* at \u00b6\u00b6 124-127).\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 131 (and see \u00b6\u00b6 128-136 generally).\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 130.\n\n128.\n\nIt may have been preferable for the Tribunal to deal with this argument expressly. However, its failure to do so might be explained by the fact that the only part of the proceedings before the Tribunal that Continental has referred to in which this argument was advanced consisted of several relatively brief paragraphs in its Reply Memorial. On the basis of the material before it, it does not appear to the Committee that this was a major argument of Continental in the proceedings before the Tribunal. Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial was some 155 pages long, of which this argument occupied some two pages. Continental\u2019s initial Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, dated 27 April 2004, which was some 70 pages long, does not appear to raise this argument at all.\n\n129.\n\nIt has not been suggested to the Committee that the argument was raised in Continental\u2019s original request for arbitration. Continental has not provided the Committee with transcripts of oral argument before the Tribunal in which this argument is advanced. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to address the argument more directly might therefore well be a result of the limited degree of prominence with which this argument was advanced by Continental in the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n130.\n\nFurthermore, some of the authorities relied on by Continental in relation to this ground of annulment appear not to have been cited by Continental in its Memorial or Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal.103 Other authorities appear to have been cited by Continental before the Tribunal in relation to different arguments.104 In any event, the Tribunal is not required to cite or expressly deal with every authority cited to it in relation to a particular argument. It certainly cannot be expected to consider authorities that have not been cited to it in relation to a particular argument.\n\nFor instance, *United States - Import Prohibition on Certain Shrimp and Shrimp Products (Recourse to Article 21.5 by Malaysia)* (2001), WT/DS58/RW (Panel Report); *United States - Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline* (29 April 1996) WT/DS2/AB/R (Report of the Appellate Body).\n\nFor instance, *Phillips Petroleum Co. Iran v. Iran, Iran - United States Claims Tribunal,* Case No. 39, Award 425-39-2, 29 June 1989, 21 Iran-US CTR 79, 78-82, which is cited in paragraph 245 of Continental\u2019s Memorial before the Tribunal In support of the proposition that the assessment of damages by a tribunal can take into account opportunity loss.\n\n131.\n\nWhatever the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s omission to deal with this argument more directly, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for rejecting the argument are *\"implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award\"* (see paragraph 102 above). The Committee rejects the contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, for not accepting the argument in paragraphs 360 to 364 of Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee also considers that the Tribunal, in reaching the conclusion that it did, did not fail to apply the applicable law. The Committee is of the view that the law applicable to the Claimant\u2019s claims was the ICSID Convention, the BIT and applicable international law,105 and that this is the law that the Tribunal applied.\n\nSee *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 139, 225 and 246 and the authorities there cited.\n\n133.\n\nContinental argues that the Tribunal erred in its analysis of the law of the GATT-WTO. However, the Tribunal was clearly not purporting to apply that body of law, but merely took it into account as relevant to determining the correct interpretation and application of Article XI of the BIT.106 Even if it could be established by Continental that the Tribunal reached an erroneous interpretation of Article XI of the BIT based on an erroneous understanding of GATT-WTO law, that would amount only to an error of law, which is not a ground of annulment (see paragraphs 88 above).\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6\u00b6 192-195.\n\n134.\n\nContinental also argues that the Tribunal applied the incorrect burden of proof and standard of proof.107 Thus, in paragraph 67 of Continental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment it is argued:\n\n*Furthermore, following its review of WTO case law, the Tribunal apparently understood the proposition that measures need not be indispensable in order to be \"necessary\" within the meaning of an exception clause as placing the onus on Continental to prove that Argentina\u2019s measures were not necessary. This amounts to a reversal of the burden of proof under international law. It was for Argentina to prove on the balance of probabilities the elements of the defence it was invoking. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of whether Argentina\u2019s measures were necessary consists of the Tribunal assessing and rejecting Continental\u2019s arguments. At no point does the Tribunal ever suggest or state that Argentina has met the burden of proof on necessity; the question for the Tribunal is whether Continental proved that the measures are not necessary. At paragraph 204 of the Award, for example, the Tribunal\u2019s statement that \"[t]he evidence does not permit the Tribunal to conclude\" is a clear indication that it had reversed the applicable burden of proof. This is in itself a ground for annulment amounting to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) and/or the manifest excess of power within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b).* [Footnotes omitted.]\n\nThis argument was not raised In Continental\u2019s Application. In Continental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, this argument was raised in connection with Continental\u2019s ground of annulment that the Tribunal failed to decide Continental\u2019s claim for loss after the state of necessity was over, and the argument is dealt with in that context in the present decision. In Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial on Annulment, it was presented as a separate ground of annulment.\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee notes that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules contain no provisions with respect to the burden of proof or standard of proof. Accordingly, there cannot be any requirement that a tribunal expressly apply a particular burden of proof or standard of proof in determining the dispute before it. Indeed, the tribunal is not obliged expressly to articulate any specific burden of proof or standard of proof and to analyse the evidence in those terms, as opposed simply to making findings of fact on the basis of the evidence before it.\n\n136.\n\nIn any event, the Committee does not accept Continental\u2019s suggestion that *\"The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of whether Argentina\u2019s measures were necessary consists of the Tribunal assessing and rejecting Continental\u2019s arguments\"* or that *\"the question for the Tribunal is whether Continental proved that the measures are* not *necessary.\"108* Even if it could be argued to be an annullable error, such as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, for a tribunal to place the burden on a claimant to disprove the applicability of a defence, rather than on the respondent to establish the defence, the Committee is not persuaded that this is what occurred in the present case.\n\nContinental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, para 67.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with the applicable legal standard for determining whether a measure was \"necessary\" within the meaning of Article XI of the BIT in paragraphs 189-195 of the Award. The Tribunal reached its initial conclusion of fact in paragraphs 196-197 of the Award, in which it found that:\n\n*... According to these principles, the next step for us is to assess whether the Measures contributed materially to the realization of their legitimate aims under Art. XI of the BIT, namely the protection of the essential security interests of Argentina in the economic and social crisis it was facing.* *More specifically, whether the Measures were apt to and did make such a material or a decisive contribution to this end.*\n\n*... In light of the analysis we have carried out above, we believe that this was the case. In general terms, within the economic and financial situation of Argentina towards the end of 2001, the Measures at issue (the* Corralito, *the* Corral\u00f3n, *the pesification, the default and the subsequent restructuring of those debt instruments involved here) were in part inevitable, or unavoidable, in part indispensable and in any case material or decisive in order to react positively to the crisis, to prevent the complete break-down of the financial system, the implosion of the economy and the growing threat to the fabric of Argentinean society and generally to assist in overcoming the crisis. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was* *undoubtedly \"a genuine relationship of end and means in this respect.\"* [Footnotes omitted.]\n\n138.\n\nThat conclusion was clearly based on all of the findings of the Tribunal in Part V of the Award (paragraphs 100 to 159), which in turn were based on the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence in the case as a whole.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal then said at paragraph 198 that it would proceed specifically to consider the further questions:\n\n(a) whether there were alternatives to the measures taken by Argentina, not in breach of the BIT, that might have been available when the Measures challenged were taken and that would have yielded equivalent results/relief; and\n\n(b) whether Argentina could have adopted at some earlier time different policies, that would have avoided or prevented the situation that brought about the adoption of the measures challenged.\n\nThese further questions were then considered by the Tribunal at paragraphs 200 to 222, and 223 to 230, of the Award respectively. In these paragraphs (especially paragraphs 200 to 205 of the Award), the Tribunal deals with certain specific alternative measures that Continental claimed could have been adopted by Argentina to deal with the crisis, and (especially paragraph 223) with specific measures that Continental claimed could have been adopted by Argentina to have prevented the crisis. These alternatives having been specifically raised by Continental, they were unsurprisingly expressly considered by the Tribunal. The Committee does not see any basis for suggesting that by doing so, the Tribunal thereby placed the burden of proof on Continental.\n\n140.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal applied a standard of proof of \"beyond reasonable doubt\", as Continental contends. No particular standard of proof is prescribed by the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, and the Tribunal did not articulate any particular standard of proof that it was applying. The Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal made its finding otherwise than upon its own evaluation of the evidence in the case as a whole. That was consistent with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules. Even if there was, as Continental contends, \"a *difference of competent views on what was or was not in fact a reasonably available alternative\",* that difference was one for the Tribunal to resolve on the evidence. Dissatisfaction with the Tribunal\u2019s finding of facts in this respect cannot amount to an annullable error.\n\n141.\n\nFinally, the argument that the Award is inconsistent with the *LG&E* Award clearly cannot establish an annullable error. The Tribunal was not bound by previous decisions of other ICSID Tribunals. Even if it were assumed that another ICSID Award were correct on a particular issue of law and that the Award was wrong, that would be merely an error of law. Error of law is not a ground of annulment, and it is therefore not for the Committee to determine whether the Tribunal applied the law correctly.\n\n142.\n\nThe Committee finds it unnecessary to express any view on whether \"a *manifest error of law may, in an exceptional situation, be of such egregious nature as to amount to a manifest excess of powers\",109* since even if it may, the Committee is not persuaded that there has been any such manifest error in this case.\n\nSee paragraph 88 above.\n\n143.\n\nThe Committee concludes that this ground of annulment must therefore be rejected.\n\n**B. Failure to determine Continental\u2019s expropriation claim in relation to the LETEs**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n144.\n\nAs has been observed, while the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the measures taken by Argentina in 2001-2002 were outside the scope of the BIT by virtue of Article XI, it reached a contrary conclusion in relation to the December 2004 measures for the restructuring of the LETEs.110\n\nSee paragraphs 42-74 above.\n\n145.\n\nHaving found that Article XI was not applicable to these December 2004 measures, the Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether those measures violated any of the substantive provisions of the BIT which had allegedly been invoked by Continental. At paragraphs 264 and 265 of the Award, the Tribunal found that the December 2004 measures for the restructuring of the LETEs were in breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of the BIT (Article ll(2)(a)).\n\n146.\n\nIn relation to this part of its request for annulment, Continental argued that in the proceedings before the Tribunal it claimed that the December 2004 measures for the restructuring of the LETEs were a breach not only of the fair and equitable treatment clause, but also of the expropriation clause of the BIT (Article IV). In relation to this latter claim, the Tribunal said at paragraph 285 of the Award as follows:\n\n*Before concluding, we recall that we have found above that the restructuring of the LETEs held by CNA was not covered by the defense of necessity both under the BIT and the principles of customary international law and caused substantial loss to the Claimant. This has led the Tribunal to hold that the restructuring as concerns CNA was in breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT and that Claimant is entitled to indemnification for that loss in the form of damages. Continental has claimed that the restructuring and its implementation constitute at the same time an expropriation and has asked indemnification under either provision of the BIT in an amount corresponding to the original dollar nominal value of those LETEs. Having already decided the same issue under Art. Il(2)(a) BIT, we do not need to pronounce further on the alternative claim of violation of Art. IV submitted by the Claimant.*\n\n147.\n\nThe second ground on which Continental seeks partial annulment of the Award is that:\n\n*After finding that Argentina had breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment with respect to the Applicant\u2019s investment in Argentine Government Treasury Bills (known as \"LETEs\"), the Tribunal refused to answer the Applicant\u2019s question of whether Argentina owed the Applicant compensation for its expropriation of the same investments even though the amount of compensation mandated by the Treaty for such an expropriation would have been different than the standard applied for a breach of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty.111*\n\nContinental\u2019s Application, paragraph 2(c).\n\n148.\n\nContinental contends that:\n\n*In its Award, the Tribunal wrongly construed the Article ll(2)(a) and Article IV(1) claims as made in the alternative.* *The Tribunal\u2019s consequent failure to apply Article IV(1) and to determine the expropriation claim in relation to the LETEs placed before it by Continental is a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) and/or a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e). This failure had a very significant impact because Article IV(1) provides a specific formula for the calculation of damages for expropriation. This formula would have led to Continental being awarded significantly higher damages.112*\n\nContinental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, paragraph 79 (footnote omitted).\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nContinental argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) At paragraph 272 of the Award, the Tribunal sets out its understanding that Continental claimed that its property had been expropriated by (1) the pesification of [CNA\u2019s] U.S. dollar denominated deposits and securities at a much below market exchange rate; (2) the restructuring of the GGLs at terms that did not reflect their acquisition value; and (3) the fact that the LETEs have been deprived of their value after CNA had not accepted the \"unreasonable\" terms of their restructuring offered by Argentina on May 31 and September 16 of 2002.113 The Tribunal rejected the first two of these claims by virtue of its interpretation of Article XI of the BIT,114 and this ground of annulment relates principally to the Tribunal\u2019s finding in relation to the third.\n\n(b) In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Continental accepted that compensation due for breaches of Article IV and Article Il(2)(a) would not be cumulative. However, Continental made clear that it sought the higher amount of compensation due under the expropriation clause (Article IV).115 Continental argued that damages for expropriation are measured at the date of expropriation, without the benefit of hindsight.116\n\n(c) Continental claimed that the compensation due in the event that Argentina was found to have expropriated the LETEs to be some USD 633,000 more than that which would be due if Argentina was found to have breached the fair and equitable treatment provision in respect of the LETEs (USD 4,126,000 as against USD 3,493,000).117\n\n(d) Article IV of the BIT establishes a standard of compensation for expropriation, which is different to other types of compensatory damages. Under the BIT, the Tribunal was required to fix the date of the expropriation, and determine its value at that time using information only available at that time. The Tribunal did not do this.\n\n(e) Although the question of the different basis of assessing damages for expropriation contrary to the BIT was expressly before the Tribunal, it simply ignored the question and failed to consider or apply the BIT.\n\n(f) At paragraph 285 of the Award, the Tribunal stated that Continental was seeking indemnification *\"under*  ***either***  *provision of the BIT in an amount corresponding to the original dollar nominal value of those LETEs\"* (emphasis added), and that having decided the issue under the fair and equitable treatment clause, the Tribunal did *\"not need to pronounce further on the*  ***alternative***  *claim\"* under the expropriation clause.\n\n(g) However, Continental did not plead or otherwise argue the Article ll(2)(a) and Article IV(1) claims in the alternative, but on the contrary asked the Tribunal to declare that Argentina breached both provisions individually.118\n\n(h) Continental was entitled to make independent claims in respect of the LETEs under both the fair and equitable treatment clause and under the expropriation clause. A finding on the former does not render a finding on the latter unnecessary, especially as Continental claimed a significantly higher amount of damages in respect of the latter.\n\n(i) The Tribunal\u2019s consequent failure to determine the expropriation claim in relation to the LETEs is a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) and/or a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e).119\n\n(j) The Tribunal\u2019s failure to determine the expropriation claim is also a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 272.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 275.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 22, 77, 275; Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, paragraph 380.\n\nReferring to paragraphs 17 of the Second Rosen Report.\n\nReferring to Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, paragraph 379.\n\nReferring to Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, paragraphs 379, 380, 408.\n\nReferring to *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on Annulment, November 1.2006 *(\"Mitchell* Annulment Decision\") \u00b6 21 ; *CDC Group plc v. Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005 (\"CDC Annulment Decision\") \u00b670.\n\n150.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) The Award analysis should be interpreted as a whole, complementary to the rest of the decision. Continental bases its argument solely on paragraph 285 of the Award, isolating it from the rest of the content of the Award and distorting the findings of the Tribunal with respect to this issue.\n\n(b) At paragraph 265, the Tribunal found that the breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause related only to the restructuring of the LETEs, and that the pesification of the LETEs generally fell within Article XI of the BIT.\n\n(c) In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Continental\u2019s expropriation claim related to the pesification of the LETEs and the default on the LETEs; Continental did not claim before the Tribunal that the expropriation claim related to the restructuring of the LETEs.120 The Tribunal found that Article XI of the BIT applied to the pesification of the LETEs and the default on the LETEs. Thus, the expropriation claim was basically covered by Article XI.\n\n(d) At paragraphs 276 and 284, the Tribunal distinguished between types of measures that amount to expropriation and types of measures that do not.\n\n(e) The Tribunal found that the restructuring of the LETEs was inconsistent with the fair and equitable treatment clause,121 but did not find that there was any expropriation, which finding would have been inconsistent with its previous finding that the pesification of the LETEs was permitted under Article XI.\n\n(f) it is evident that the Tribunal found that there had been no expropriation of the LETEs in terms of Article IV, which always continued being held by Continental\u2019s subsidiary. Paragraph 285 refers to \"the restructuring of the LETEs held by CNA\". It is inconceivable that the Tribunal would accept the validity of a measure adopted by a State with regard to an investor\u2019s asset, while considering, at the same time, that such asset has been expropriated by another of the measures under consideration.\n\n(g) Paragraph 254 considered the difference between an expropriation and a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The restructuring of the LETEs involved an offer to start repaying the debt securities in default. Regardless of any assessment of such restructuring which might be carried out, that measure could have never amounted to expropriation in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n(h) In paragraph 285 of the Award, the Tribunal found it unnecessary to examine again the issue of the restructuring of the LETEs, as the issue had already been dealt with in the treatment of the fair and equitable treatment clause.\n\n(i) Even if Continental did not argue the Article ll(2)(a) and Article IV(1) claims in the alternative, it was open to the Tribunal itself to regard the claims as alternative *perse.*\n\n(j) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on this matter are fully grounded and any attentive and *bona fide* reader could understand them. There has been no manifest excess of power or departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or failure to state reasons.\n\n(k) The Committee should reject *in limine* Continental\u2019s contention that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, as this contention was raised for the first time in Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the annulment proceedings. Continental does not even state what the rule of procedure that has allegedly been departed from is, let alone provide reasons for such claim.\n\n(l) Continental did not argue before the Tribunal that the standard of compensation for expropriation is different to the standard of compensation under the fair and equitable treatment clause. Rather, Continental argued that the principle in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case122 applied to both.123 This is the principle that the Tribunal applied in assessing damages for breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in respect of the restructuring of the LETEs. Continental itself acknowledged that it was not asking for an accumulation of damages under both the fair and equitable treatment clause and the expropriation clause.\n\n(m) In Article IV of the BIT there is a reference to \"fair market value\", but that is a condition for an expropriation being legal, rather than a standard of compensation for illegal expropriation.\n\n(n) In Continental\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, the damages it claimed for expropriation of the LETEs was in fact a smaller amount than the damages claimed for breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in respect of the LETEs. In the second round of submissions before the Tribunal, the damages claimed in respect of expropriation became greater than the damages claimed for breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause, but this was only because of the calculation of interest. In Continental\u2019s claim, the interest rate was applied from an assumed date of expropriation of 8 March 2002. However, calculating interest from this date is inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the pesification and default were covered by Article XI, and that there was no breach of the BIT until November-December 2004.\n\n(o) The Tribunal had a discretion, which it exercised, to apply an interest rate different to the rate requested by Continental.\n\n(p) The Tribunal thereby gave detailed consideration to the expropriation claim.\n\nReferring to Continental\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, quoting paragraph 188 of Continental\u2019s Memorial on the Merits\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 220-222.\n\nReferring to Permanent Court of International Justice, *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, Merits, 1928, Series A No. 17, p. 47.\n\nReferring to Continental\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paragraph 236.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s views**\n-----------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Award must be understood in the light of what was argued before the Tribunal by the parties.\n\n152.\n\nParagraph 369 of Continental\u2019s Merits Reply Memorial stated the following, with respect to the amount of damages Continental was claiming:\n\n*Calculation of the Claimant\u2019s damages from Argentina\u2019s breaches of the Treaty is straightforward. But for Argentina\u2019s actions in breach of the Treaty, the Claimant would have received the value of the principal and interest payable on CNA ART\u2019s financial securities in accordance with their terms.* *The Claimant would have received the value of its US dollar deposits and the value of its government loans at the agreed rate of interest.*\n\n153.\n\nParagraph 371 stated:\n\n*The Claimant\u2019s damages are simply the value of CNA ART\u2019s financial securities but for Argentina\u2019s actions in breach of the Treaty minus the value of those securities given Argentina\u2019s actions.*\n\n154.\n\nAt paragraph 375, Continental stated that Argentina had not challenged the principle that *\"an award of damages must compensate the Investor so that the Investor is in the position it would have enjoyed \"but for\" Argentina\u2019s unlawful acts\",* and cited the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case as one authority for that principle.\n\n155.\n\nParagraph 376 stated:\n\n*For the purposes of the Investor\u2019s claims for breaches of the BIT\u2019S fair and equitable treatment, free transfers and obligations observance articles, events occurring since Argentina\u2019s unlawful actions influence the value of CNA ART\u2019s assets but for those actions. For example, in assessing the interest that the Investor would have earned on its matured certificates of deposit, but for Argentina\u2019s breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation, Mr. Rosen applies actual interest rates since the breach.*\n\n156.\n\nParagraph 377 added:\n\n*Article IV(1) of the US-Argentina BIT prevents this Tribunal from applying such subsequent information by requiring that compensation on expropriation \"shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken...\" Accordingly,*\n\n*Article IV(1) of the BIT requires the Tribunal to assess the value of expropriated investments using only information available immediately before the expropriation.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\n157.\n\nParagraph 380 further added:\n\n*... if the Tribunal finds that both of these expropriation and fair and equitable treatment/full protection and security obligations have been violated for a given asset, it should award only the higher of the two calculations.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\n158.\n\nThe damages sought by Continental, and the basis on which they were calculated, were set out in a \"Reply Report\" of Howard N. Rosen, dated August 14, 2006 (the **\"Second Rosen Report\"),124** which was submitted to the Tribunal by Continental,125 and which relevantly stated as follows:\n\n(a) Paragraphs 80 and 85 indicated that it proceeded on the basis that as at December 31, 2001, CNA held USD 3.3 million in U.S. dollar denominated LETEs, and that but for the \"Events\",126 by March 31, 2006 they would have earned an additional USD 192,400, such that their value on the latter date would have been approximately USD 3.5 million.\n\n(b) Paragraph 86 explained that it was considered that the value of the LETEs on March 31.2006, given the Events, was USD 2.78 million.\n\n(c) Paragraph 87 then explained that the claimed loss due to pesification was the difference between the \"expected value\" that the LETEs would have had but for the Events, and the \"expected value\" given the Events (USD 3.5 million minus USD 2.78 million, which was said to be approximately USD 716,000). It was further explained that the claimed loss due to default was USD 2.78 million, being the \"current defaulted value\".\n\n(d) Schedule 3 set out in tabular form the \"Calculation of Loss on Treasury Bills (LETEs)\". It accordingly stated that the total loss from pesification (rounded) was USD 716,000, and that the loss due to default (rounded) was USD 2,777,000. The total loss on the LETEs was stated to be the sum of these two figures, USD 3,493,000.\n\n\"Reply Report\" of Howard N. Rosen, dated August 14, 2006.\n\nSee, e.g., Award \u00b6\u00b6 76, 77 and footnote 357.\n\nOn the meaning of the \"Events\", see further paragraphs 238 and 240 below.\n\n159.\n\nSchedule 9 of the Second Rosen Report set out in tabular form a \"Calculation of Investment Loss Due to Expropriation\".\n\n160.\n\nIn relation to the LETEs, this schedule indicated that the amount expropriated was USD 3.3 million, and indicated that this figure was \"per Schedule 3\". That amount was stated in the Second Rosen Report to be the value of the US dollar denominated LETEs held by CNA as at December 31, 2001. Schedule 3 indicated that this was the \"Maturity value of T-bills at date of pesification\".\n\n161.\n\nParagraph 54 of the Second Rosen Report stated that \"We have assumed that CNA-ART\u2019s... Treasury Bill assets [LETEs] were expropriated on March 8, 2002 being the dates that these assets were first impacted by Argentina\u2019s measures\". March 8, 2002 was the date of pesification of the LETEs by Decree 417.\n\n162.\n\nSchedule 9 of the Second Rosen Report indicated that the claimed damages for expropriation of the LETEs included, in addition to their claimed USD 3.3 million value as at March 8, 2002, an additional amount of USD 825,937, stated in footnote (1) to represent interest at 5.6 per cent from March 8, 2002 to March 31.2006.\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee considers it important to note that the damage calculations presented in the First and Second Rosen Reports are based on the \"Events\" undertaken by Argentina in 2001 and 2002, and that they do not take into account any economic implications of the adoption of Decree 1735/04 (quite on the contrary, as is indicated below: the swap constituted by Decree 1735/04 was expressly disregarded).\n\n164.\n\nAt paragraph 272 of the Award, the Tribunal sets out its understanding that Continental claimed that its property had been expropriated by (1) the pesification of [CNA\u2019s] U.S. dollar denominated deposits and securities at a much below market exchange rate; (2) the restructuring of the GGLs at terms that did not reflect their acquisition value; and (3) the fact that the LETEs have been deprived of their value after CNA had not accepted the \"unreasonable\" terms of their restructuring offered by Argentina on May 31 and September 16 of 2002.\n\n165.\n\nAt paragraph 275 of the Award, the Tribunal said that it:\n\n*... notes that most of the allegations brought by the Claimant under the heading of expropriation (breach of Art. IV of the BIT) are substantially the same and are addressed to the same Measures impugned as breaches of the fair and equitable standard of Art. (H)(2)(a) of the BIT. We have already found that the defense of necessity under the BIT is available to Argentina as concerns most claims of breach that Continental has raised against the Measures, namely the pesification of dollar-denominated deposits and the restructuring of the GGL\u2019s.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\n166.\n\nThe Committee considers it sufficiently implicit from the Award, as a whole, that the Tribunal was of the view that even if there had been an expropriation of the LETEs within the meaning of the expropriation clause, that expropriation would have occurred either on March 8, 2002 (pesification) as claimed by Continental, or, additionally or alternatively, on April 25, 2002 (default), and that this took place at a time when Argentina could avail itself of the Article XI exception in the BIT. This is reinforced, for instance, by paragraph 266 of the Award, where the Tribunal says that *\"save for the LETEs, the Tribunal considers that the invocation of necessity by Argentina under Art. XI of the BIT is applicable to all other claims by the Claimant for breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard by Argentina\u2019s Measures\".*\n\n167.\n\nHaving reached that conclusion in paragraph 275, the Tribunal followed the logical consequence of holding that this was covered by Article XI at the time when any expropriation action was undertaken: *\"Having already decided the same issue under Art. Il(2)(a) BIT, we do not need to pronounce further on the alternative claim of violation of Art. IV submitted by the Claimant\".*\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately found that the pesification was not contrary to the BIT by virtue of Article XI, but found in relation to the LETEs that Article XI was not applicable to *\"the conditions of their restructuring in December 2004\"127* (that is, Decree 1735/04). At paragraph 305 of the Award, the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The Claimant submits it has suffered as to LETEs losses amounting to U.S$700,000 due to pesification and to U.S$2,800,000 \"due to the further default and revocation of contractual rights. \" For the reason stated above, the Claimant is entitled to be compensated only for the latter amount that corresponds to its capital loss. The Claimant is accordingly entitled to payment of compensation in the principal sum of U.S.$2,800,000.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\nAward \u00b6 264.\n\n169.\n\nThus, the amount of damages ultimately awarded by the Tribunal was the amount claimed by Continental to be, following the pesification, the \"expected value\" or \"current defaulted value\" of the LETEs on March 31.2006.\n\n170.\n\nContinental\u2019s ground of annulment focuses particularly on paragraph 285 of the Award, in which the Tribunal states that:\n\n*... Continental has claimed that the restructuring and its implementation constitute at the same time an expropriation and has asked indemnification under either provision of the BIT in an amount corresponding to the original dollar nominal value of those LETEs. Having already decided the same issue under Art. Il(2)(a) BIT, we do not need to pronounce further on the alternative claim of violation of Art. IV submitted by the Claimant.*\n\n171.\n\nContinental contends that this sentence assumes that the Claimant asked for identical amounts of damages in respect of the alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause and in respect of the alleged breach of the expropriation clause. Continental argues that in fact it had sought higher damages in respect of the alleged breach of the expropriation clause, and that it had claimed before the Tribunal that if there had been a breach of both clauses, the Tribunal \"should award only the higher of the two calculations\".128 Thus, according to Continental, even after the Tribunal found that there had been a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause by virtue of Decree 1735/04, the Tribunal still had to consider whether there had been a breach of the expropriation clause, in order to determine whether Continental was entitled to the higher level of damages claimed in respect of the latter.\n\nParagraph 380 of Continental\u2019s Reply on the Merits.\n\n172.\n\nHowever, if, as the Committee considers to be implicit from the Award, the Tribunal found that any expropriation would have occurred in 2002 at a time when Article XI applied to the measures in question, that provides an answer to the question whether Decree 1735/04 was a measure amounting to an expropriation. If the LETES had already been expropriated in 2002, they could not be expropriated again in 2004 by Decree 1735/04. It follows that any expropriation in 2002 was not a breach of the expropriation clause, by virtue of Article XI, and that there was no expropriation in 2004. It was thus immaterial whether higher damages would have been awarded for a breach of the expropriation clause had there been any such breach, and the Tribunal did not need to decide this question.\n\n173.\n\nIn view of this reading of the Award, the reference to \"an amount corresponding to the original dollar nominal value of those LETEs\" in paragraph 285 of the Award cannot be given an independent reading that would call for an examination also of Argentina's liability under Article IV in the context of Decree 1735/04, which liability, as the Tribunal, found, was precluded by operation of Article XI of the BIT.\n\n174.\n\nFurthermore, even though it is not necessary to decide this question, the Committee considers it apparent from the Award that even if the Tribunal had hypothetically found Decree 1735/04 itself to amount to an expropriation (in addition to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause), it would not have awarded any higher damages for the breach of the expropriation clause than it did for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause.\n\n175.\n\nThe fact that the Second Rosen Report claimed higher damages for the former than for the latter cannot have been material. As explained above, the quantification of the claimed damages in the Second Rosen Report was premised on Continental\u2019s view that expropriation occurred in 2002. That analysis would not apply to an expropriation occurring in 2004.\n\n176.\n\nIn considering the interest on the damages awarded for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause, at paragraph 315 of the Award, the Tribunal said that \"As *regards the commencement date for compound interest, since Decree 1735/04 restructuring the LETEs was issued in December 2004, the Tribunal fixes January 1, 2005 as the initial date to this purpose\".* In the Committee\u2019s view, it is sufficiently implicit from the Award that the Tribunal considered that if it had found Decree 1735/04 to constitute a breach also of the expropriation clause, it would have found the date of expropriation to be January 1.2005.\n\n177.\n\nThe damages awarded by the Tribunal in respect of the breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause was the amount claimed by Continental to be the \"expected value\" or \"current defaulted value\" of the LETEs in March 2006. No reason has been advanced to suggest that this amount was lower than the \"expected value\" or \"current defaulted value\" on January 1, 2005. To this the Tribunal added interest from 1 January 2005.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee regards it as sufficiently implicit from the Award, as a whole, that the Tribunal was of the view that even if Decree 1735/04 were to be found to be an expropriation of the LETEs in addition to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause in respect of the LETEs, the amount of damages in respect of each breach would have been the same. As the Tribunal said at paragraph 285, it was therefore logically the case that *\"Having already decided the same issue under Art. Il(2)(a) BIT, we do not need to pronounce further on the alternative claim of violation of Art. IV submitted by the Claimant\u2019.*\n\n179.\n\nHence, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal thereby sufficiently dealt with the issue of expropriation. When the Award is read as a whole in the light of the submissions made to the Tribunal, the reasoning in the Award is sufficiently clear.\n\n180.\n\nIt follows that the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal thereby applied the applicable law (in particular, the provisions of the BIT itself). In the circumstances, the Committee considers that the error contended for by Continental is merely an alleged error of law, or a disagreement with the findings of the Tribunal, which does not constitute an annullable error.\n\n181.\n\nFor these reasons, this ground of annulment must be rejected.\n\n**C. Alleged breach of Article V of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n182.\n\nThis ground of annulment relates to the claim made by Continental in the proceedings before the Tribunal under Article V of the BIT, which provides as follows:\n\n*Article V*\n\n*1. Each Party shall permit all transfers related to an investment to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory. Such transfers include: (a) returns; (b) compensation pursuant to Article IV; (c) payments arising out of an investment dispute; (d) payments made under a contract, including amortization of principal and accrued interest payments made pursuant to a loan agreement directly related to an investment; (e) proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment; and (f) additional contributions to capital for the maintenance or development of an investment.*\n\n*2. Except as provided in Article IV paragraph 1, transfers shall be made in a freely usable currency at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of transfer with respect to spot transactions in the currency to be transferred. The free transfer shall take place in accordance with the procedures established by each Party; such procedures shall not impair the rights set forth in this Treaty.*\n\n3. *Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, either Party may maintain laws and regulations (a) requiring reports of currency transfer; and (b) imposing income taxes by such means as a withholding tax applicable to dividends or other transfers. Furthermore, either Party may protect the rights of creditors, or ensure the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings, through the equitable, nondiscriminatory and good faith application of its law.*\n\n183.\n\nAs has been referred to at paragraph 52 above, one of the measures adopted by Argentina to deal with the economic crisis was Decree 1570 of December 1, 2001 (referred to as the *\"Corralito\"),* which limited cash withdrawals from bank accounts and prohibited transfers of funds out of the country with the exception of certain current transactions.129\n\nSee Award \u00b6\u00b6 100, 124, 126, 137-140.\n\n184.\n\nIn the proceedings before the Tribunal, one of the claims of Continental was as follows:\n\n*The Claimant complains that CNA was prevented from transferring to the U.S. at par free funds amounting to U.S.$19,000,000 by Decree 1570 of 2001* (Corralito,) *which forbade withdrawals from banks and transfers of funds (which CNA had converted in dollars) out of Argentina. The amount of damages it claims as the loss from devaluation of those funds equivalent to U.S.$14,631,000. Continental claims that this prohibition breached its right as an investor to effect \"all transfers related to an investment\" provided for by Art. V of the BIT. According to Continental, the proposed transfer concerned \"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\" (Art. V(1) (e)), based on the following reasoning: \"Continental\u2019s shares in CNA ART are definitely an investment protected under the BIT. The transfer of the asset of an investment is a transfer related to an investment. Transfers of U.S. dollar term deposits on maturity are also \u2018proceeds from the liquidation of...part of an investment. \"130*\n\nAward \u00b6 237 (footnotes omitted).\n\n185.\n\nThis claim was rejected by the Tribunal in paragraphs 237 to 245 of the Award. The Tribunal found that the transfer that Continental claimed it would have made if the *Corralito* had not prevented it was not a transfer \"related to an investment\" of the kind to which Article V of the BIT applied, and then concluded:\n\nAs a *consequence Argentina has committed no breach of Art.* *V of the BIT to the detriment of the Claimant, so that the* *latter\u2019s claim in this respect must be and is rejected by the Tribunal. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine the subordinate arguments of the Parties: namely (a) whether in view of the acute foreign exchange crisis Argentina was encountering, Argentina was allowed, notwithstanding its obligations under Art. V BIT to introduce the exchange restrictions of Decree 1570, based on Art. XI of the BIT, on the IMF Agreement or under customary international law; (b) whether the Claimant cannot invoke Art.* *V because neither itself (Continental) nor CNA ever decided to make, or asked to be authorized to effect the transfers at issue; and (c) whether the derogations allowed under the* Corralito *would have made those transfers possible.131*\n\nAward \u00b6 245 (footnotes omitted).\n\n186.\n\nContinental seeks annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of this claim under Article V of the BIT, contending that the Tribunal both manifestly exceeded its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention in rejecting this claim, and failed to state reasons for its Award within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Specifically, Continental claims that:\n\n(a) *\"... [t]he Tribunal failed to apply the governing law with respect to Argentina\u2019s obligations to protect transfers of foreign investors under Article V of the Treaty, and, as a result, the Tribunal failed to properly apply the terms of the Treaty\u2019\u2019132* and\n\n(b) *\"... the Tribunal ignored the express provisions of the Treaty which afford protection to transfers essential for the \u2018maintenance\u2019 of investments. In addition, instead of focusing on the Treaty requirement of whether the transfer at issue was \"related to\" an investment, the Tribunal also based its analysis on an irrelevant consideration, the fact that capital movements are not investments in-and-of-themselves. As a result, not only did the Tribunal totally ignore the express wording of the governing Treaty, but again it also failed to provide any coherent reasoning to explain its approach\".133*\n\nContinental\u2019s Application \u00b6 2(d).\n\nContinental\u2019s Application \u00b6 23.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nContinental argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) The Tribunal failed to provide comprehensible reasons for its conclusion that the transfer at issue did not \"relate to an investment\" and fell outside the protection of Article V.134 Nowhere in Article V of the BIT is it required that a transfer be an investment in itself. Rather, Article V requires merely that the transfer be *\"related to* an investment\", which the transfer in question undoubtedly was.\n\n(b) There is nothing in the language of the BIT, nor of any other relevant legal instrument including the Articles of the IMF and related IMF norms or the GATS, that limits directly or indirectly the transfers covered under Article V to transfers required to satisfy \"a *payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other, or involve a transfer of funds to some different entity';135*\n\n(c) These novel and unexplained restrictions introduced by the Tribunal are contradicted by paragraph 240 of the Award, where the Tribunal says that Article V is for the protection of transfers *\"essential for, or typical to the [inter alia]... maintenance...of investments\"* and for the *\"protection... of property of all kinds\",* and paragraph 241 of the Award, where the Tribunal says that the funds in question in this particular case were *\"part of [the] investor\u2019s existing investment\"* and that the purpose of the transaction was to *\"protect them from the impending devaluation\",* as well as the finding in paragraph 242 that the transfer was *\"clearly a legitimate operation from a business point of view\".* On the basis of these findings, the Tribunal had no choice in law or logic but to conclude that Argentina had breached Article V of the BIT.\n\n(d) The statement in paragraph 241 of the Award that the transfer in question does not fall within any of the categories referred to in paragraph 240 of the Award is a bland assertion and a bare postulate, without any supporting reasoning.136 The key statement in paragraph 241 contradicts and does not follow from that in paragraph 240.\n\n(e) The reasons given by the Tribunal are *\"so inadequate that the coherence of the reasoning is seriously affected\",137* and are incomprehensible and contradictory,138 and incoherent, and the Tribunal refers to nothing to support its assertions.\n\n(f) The Tribunal was required to apply the whole of the BIT. Article V was modified by a Protocol to the BIT, and Article XIV(4) of the BIT provides that the Protocol is an integral part of the BIT. Article 10 of the Protocol139 is a most favoured nation (MFN) clause with respect to transfers. Despite the evidence before the Tribunal about the better treatment for transfers of investments of other nationals,140 nowhere in the Award did the Tribunal apply this part of the governing law to the less favourable treatment of Continental with respect to transfers.\n\n(g) The Argentina-Chile BIT provides that transfers cannot be held up for more than two months, and the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT contains no exception at all in respect of the essential security interests of the host State. This was the treatment that the Tribunal had to consider under the governing law of the arbitration. The Tribunal failed to apply Article 10 of the Protocol to the BIT which was an annullable manifest excess of power, and gave no reason for its failure to apply the governing law.\n\n(h) The same question was raised by Continental as a violation of the MFN provision in Article 11(1) of the BIT.141\n\n(i) Continental did assert MFN obligations in the proceedings before the Tribunal, and the Tribunal failed to consider or rule on the evidence of better treatment given to investors of other States, and failed to give reasons for not doing so.\n\n(j) There was evidence before the Tribunal that Continental did intend to make the transfer in question.142 The evidence was that Continental intended to sell certificates of deposit and transfer the proceeds out of Argentina. The certificates of deposit were an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article I of the BIT. The Tribunal failed to apply Article I of the BIT to the certificates of deposit indirectly held by Continental, and this failure to apply the BIT is an annullable error.\n\n(k) The Tribunal\u2019s finding in paragraph 205 of the Award, that Article XI of the BIT justified the *Corralito,* must be limited to aspects of the *Corralito* other than those which restricted Continental\u2019s ability to make the transfer, since the Tribunal expressly stated at paragraph 245 of the Award that it was not deciding whether or not the exchange rate restriction in the *Corralito* was justified by Article XI.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 244.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 242.\n\nReferring to *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH et al v. United Republic of Cameroon & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985 *(\u2018Klockner* Annulment Decision\") \u00b6 144.\n\nReferring to *Mitchell* Annulment Decision \u00b6 21.\n\nReferring to *CDC* Annulment Decision \u00b6 70.\n\nThe text of Article 10 of the Protocol to the BIT is set out In paragraph 215 below.\n\nContinental says that it made reference In the proceedings before the Tribunal to the better treatment provided to investors from Chile under the terms of the Argentina-Chile BIT, and to investors from the United Kingdom under the terms of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT.\n\nReferring to Argentina\u2019s Merits Memorial paras 5 and 6.\n\nReferring to a witness statement of Mr Sametier, chief financial officer of Continental\u2019s Argentine subsidiary.\n\n188.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Continental attempts to turn this application for annulment into an appeal against the Award.\n\n(b) Continental seeks to challenge the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the transfer in question did not entail a \"transfer related to an investment\", and even suggests other criteria on the basis of which the Tribunal should have reached a different conclusion, but does not and cannot state that the Tribunal failed to interpret and apply the standard set by the BIT (whether or not there was a \"transfer related to an investment\"). An annulment proceeding is not open to any party who merely disagrees with a Tribunal\u2019s way of interpreting and applying a provision of the applicable law. Continental\u2019s arguments are mere disagreements, even over factual conclusions.\n\n(c) Continental takes out of context a statement made by the Tribunal. The Tribunal explained in detail when a transfer is considered to be related to an investment, and why this specific requirement was not met in this particular case.143\n\n(d) Continental also cites out of context paragraphs of the *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision,144 which provide precisely the contrary of what Continental contends, and which were used in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision145 where it was stated that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Award *\"concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not a failure to state correct or convincing reasons\".*\n\n(e) The Tribunal\u2019s reasons for rejecting Continental\u2019s claim under Article V of the BIT are contained not only in paragraphs 237 to 245 of the Award, but also in other paragraphs including paragraphs 54, 82, 124, 131, 132, 138 to 140, 202 and 205. In particular, in paragraph 205 of the Award, the Tribunal concluded that the *Corralito* was justified under Article XI of the BIT. This finding renders this ground of annulment moot, because even if the Committee were to annul the part of the Award rejecting Continental\u2019s claim under Article V, it would have no practical effect.\n\n(f) Article V of the BIT applies to *\"transfers related to an investment\".* If there is no *\"transfer related to an investment\",* Article V is inapplicable, and everything else becomes moot, including Continental\u2019s arguments in respect of MFN provisions. The Tribunal applied the correct law (Article V of the BIT), interpreted that provision to determine what transfers were covered by that provision, and stated the reasons for its decision (that there was no *\"transfer related to an investment\"* and that the provision therefore did not apply). What the Tribunal subsequently said in paragraphs 243-244 of the Award concerning IMF, GATT or GATS provisions was merely confirmatory of what the Tribunal decided, and did not form the basis of the decision, such that this could have no effect on the rest of the Award.146\n\n(g) There was no contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s finding in paragraph 240 of the Award as to the kind of transfers to which Article V applies, and its finding that the transfer in this case was not *\"related to an investment\".* The Tribunal did not find that the transfer was necessary to protect the funds from the impending devaluation. The Tribunal expressly stated that \"As *Argentina correctly points out, there is no cogent evidence in the evidential record that the Claimant intended actually to shift its funds out of Argentina at the time of the* Corralito\".147 In annulment proceedings, Continental cannot request the Committee to revise the evidence put before and considered by the Tribunal.\n\n(h) In the proceedings before the Tribunal, Continental relied on the MFN provision in relation to the word \"delay\" in Article V of the BIT, claiming that while the BIT did not define \"delay\", the Argentina-Chile BIT contained an obligation to permit transfers within two months. However, the issue of delay does not arise if, as the Tribunal found, Article V of the BIT is inapplicable on the ground that there has been no transfer *\"related to an investment\".*\n\n(i) Apart from this, Continental did not rely on MFN obligations in relation to the scope of operation of Article V of the BIT.\n\n(j) The Tribunal\u2019s Award with regard to the issue of Article V of the BIT is perhaps the most thorough and complete analysis to have ever been made in relation to the subject. The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons, and it is possible to follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. The Tribunal\u2019s assertions in paragraphs 240 and 241 of the Award are not contradictory, but contain a logical and consistent reasoning.\n\n(k) In any event, there was no evidence on record that Continental actually intended or wanted to transfer anything out of Argentina.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 241 -242.\n\nReferring to *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\nReferring to *Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 55.\n\nReferring to *Helnan* Annulment Decision.\n\nReferring to Award footnote 367.\n\n**(c) The Committee\u2019s views**\n-----------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal explicitly distinguished in its reasons between two different effects of the *Corralito,* namely the introduction of bank deposit freezes, and the introduction of a prohibition of the transfer of funds abroad and their exchange in freely convertible and transferable currencies.148\n\nIn particular, Award \u00b6 137(1) and (ii); also for instance \u00b6\u00b6 100, 124.\n\n190.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal did not make any finding that the second effect of the *Corralito,* preventing the transfer of funds abroad, was justified by Article XI of the BIT. This is abundantly clear from a number of paragraphs of the Award.\n\n191.\n\nParagraphs 201 to 205, under a heading *\"In respect of the Corralito (the imposition of the*  *bank freeze* *in December 2001)\"* (emphasis added), found that the *bank freeze* introduced by the *Corralito* was justified by necessity under Article XI of the BIT. Paragraph 205 stated that separate consideration would be given subsequently to the question of the *restrictions on transfers* imposed by the *Corralito.*\n\n192.\n\nIn paragraph 245, the Tribunal ultimately concluded that it did not have to consider whether the restrictions on *transfers* imposed by the *Corralito* were justified by Article XI, in view of the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of Continental\u2019s Article V claim on other grounds.\n\n193.\n\nParagraph 319 noted that in contrast to most of Continental\u2019s claims, the dismissal of the Article V claim was not on Article XI grounds.\n\n194.\n\nThe Committee therefore cannot accept Argentina\u2019s submission that even if the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of the Article V claim was tainted by annullable error, this would make no practical difference because the Tribunal concluded in any event that the *Corralito* was justified under Article XI of the BIT. The Tribunal did not decide this question one way or the other, and this is not a question that can be considered or decided by the Committee in annulment proceedings.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal also said, at paragraph 245, that in view of the basis on which it had dismissed the Article V claim, it did not need to examine the question *\"whether the Claimant cannot invoke Art. V because neither itself (Continental) nor CNA ever decided to make, or asked to be authorized to effect the transfers at issue\", or* the question *\"whether the derogations allowed under the* Corralito *would have made those transfers possible\".*149 These two questions arose from arguments made by Argentina in response to the Article V claim, as referred to for instance in paragraphs 52, 84 and 238 of the Award. These questions also cannot now be determined by the Committee in annulment proceedings.\n\nIt is noted that although the Tribunal did not decide these two Issues, it did state at footnote 367 as follows: \"As Argentina correctly points out, there is no cogent evidence in the evidential record that the Claimant Intended actually to shift its funds out of Argentina at the time of the *Corralito.* Up to then, the Claimant had made the deliberate choice of keeping its funds in Argentina (see above para. 132), converting them from pesos Into dollar-denominated Instruments.. CNA thus acted as \"a good corporate citizen\" of Argentina and did not participate In the capital flight of the second part of 2001 which lead to the Imposition of the *Corralito.\"* it also stated at footnotes 197 and 368 as follows: \"The Central Bank (BCRA) was empowered to authorize certain other transactions with the exterior and did so in the following months. From September 2002 onwards, exports of funds under certain ceilings have been gradually admitted (Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 34)\".\n\n196.\n\nAs the Tribunal did not decide these questions, and as they cannot be determined by the Committee in annulment proceedings, they are not directly relevant to the present annulment proceedings. Rather, the issue for the Committee is whether the way in which the Tribunal *did* reject the Article V claim was tainted by annullable error. The decision by the Tribunal not to decide questions that were unnecessary for it to decide is not itself an annullable error. In the event of the annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s rejection of the Article V claim, these questions might need to be decided by a Tribunal in any resubmission proceedings, but that would be a matter for the Tribunal in that event.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s particular reasons for rejecting Continental\u2019s claim under Article V of the BIT are set out in particular in paragraphs 237 to 245 of the Award.\n\n198.\n\nAfter setting out the parties\u2019 positions in relation to the Article V claim at paragraphs 237 and 238, at paragraph 239, the Tribunal then said that:\n\n*The first issue here is to determine whether the transfer that Continental claims it would have made if the* Corralito *had not prevented it, falls within those \"transfers related to an investment\" which the Parties to the BIT undertook in Art. V to permit \"freely and without delay into or out of its territory.\"*\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to state that *\"This type of provision is a standard feature of BITs\",* and that:\n\n*... the guarantee that a foreign investor shall be able to remit from the investment country the income produced, the reimbursement of any financing received or royalty payment due, and the value of the investment made, plus any accrued capital gain, in case of sale or liquidation, is fundamental to the freedom to make a foreign investment and an essential element of the promotional role of BITs.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\nThe Tribunal then added that:\n\n*This explains moreover the detailed list of permitted transfers that most BITs set forth. On the other hand, the Treaty terms show that such freedom is not without limit.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reference to *\"the detailed list of permitted transfers that most* *BITs set forth\"* was clearly intended to apply to the BIT in the present case. The \"detailed list\" in the BIT is in Article V(1), which states, in relation to the \"transfers\" to which it applies, that:\n\n*Such transfers include: (a) returns; (b) compensation pursuant to Article IV; (c) payments arising out of an investment dispute; (d) payments made under a contract, including amortization of principal and accrued interest payments made pursuant to a loan agreement directly related to an investment; (e) proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment; and (f) additional contributions to capital for the maintenance or development of an investment.*\n\nThe words *\"Such transfers include\"* suggest that the list that follows those words is non-exhaustive. However, at paragraph 239, the Tribunal considered that this list of permitted transfers nonetheless indicates that the freedom of transfer *\"is not without limit\u2019.* In the last sentence of paragraph 242, the Tribunal also stated that although the BIT is not limited to transfers made by the investor itself and may include transfers made by a subsidiary, that *\"does not mean that any trans-border movement of funds by such subsidiary is \u2018related to an investment\"\u2019.*\n\n200.\n\nThe Committee considers it logical for the Tribunal to begin its consideration of the Article V claim by determining the types of \"transfers related to an investment\" to which Article V applies, and this is what the Tribunal did in paragraphs 239 and 240 of the Award. At paragraph 240, the Tribunal said:\n\n*The first issue is to determine which transfers are \"related to the investment. \" This is important since in respect of those transfers the U.S. BITs \"prohibit virtually all restrictions,\" thus limiting the Parties\u2019 prerogatives under customary international law to impose currency exchange restrictions. Guidance is to be found in the detailed (though nonexclusive) list in Art. V(1) and the purpose identified above of this kind of provision. Protected transfers are those essential for, or typical to the making, controlling, maintenance, disposition of investments, especially in the form of companies; or in the form of debt, service and investment contracts, including the making, performance and enforcement of contracts; the acquisition, use, protection and disposition of property of all kinds, including intellectual and industrial property rights; and the borrowing of funds, to name the kind of investments and associated activities mentioned in Art. I of the BIT more relevant to this issue.* [Footnote omitted.]\n\n201.\n\nThe wording of this long last sentence is derived from the definitions of \"investment\" and \"associated activities\" in Article l(a) and (e) of the BIT. The use of the word \"including\" before the wording taken from the definition of \"associated activities\" indicates that the Tribunal regarded such \"associated activities\" as included within the more general expression *\"making, controlling, maintenance, disposition of investments\".* In essence, in this paragraph the Tribunal finds that *\"Protected transfers are those essential for, or typical to the making, controlling, maintenance, disposition of investments\".* The remaining wording of that paragraph is illustrative of what is meant by that expression.\n\n202.\n\nIn following paragraphs 241 to 245, the Tribunal considered the application of this interpretation to the circumstances of this case:\n\n*241. The type of transfer at issue here does not fall into any of these categories, nor specifically does it represent the \"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment.\" it was merely a change of type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment, namely a part of the freely disposable funds, held short term at its banks by CNA, in order to protect them from the impending devaluation, by transferring them to bank accounts outside Argentina.*\n\n*242. The transfer did not correspond to, nor was it required to satisfy any payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other; nor would it involve the transfer of ownership of the funds involved to some different entity. It was clearly a legitimate operation from a business point of view, permissible under the convertibility regime of Argentina until the* Corralito. *This does not mean that it would fall within the \"transfers related to an investment\" under Art. V. The fact that the BIT does not limit these transfers to those made by the foreign investor itself and that these transfers may be made by the local subsidiary, in favor of its parent company as well of other entities (thus in case of payment of royalties, payments related to loans received etc.), does not mean that any trans-border movement of funds by such subsidiary is \"related to an investment. \"*\n\n*243. Both parties have relied also on the IMF provisions and the connected principles of the multilateral regulation of international payments in support of their position. As is well known, the IMF distinguishes between current transactions and capital movements. The \"avoidance of restrictions on current payments\" (Art. VIII), except with the approval of the Fund, is a \"general obligation\" of IMF members, adhered to by their vast majority that do not avail themselves of the transitional regime of Art. XIV. It reflects one of the key purposes of the Fund, \"to assist in the establishment of a multilateral system of payments in respect of current transactions\" as stated in Art. I (iv), as was the case of Argentina when its currency was freely convertible. On the other hand, capital movements may be subject to exchange controls by individual members,* inter alia *in view of their possible speculative nature and destabilizing effects on national economies.*\n\n*244. The above distinction is of limited assistance here, because transfers \"related to an investment\" listed in and allowed by Art. V of the BIT includes both current transactions and capital movements: Art. V may be considered a* lex specialis *in respect of the IMF regime and more liberal than the latter. In any case, capital movements are defined* a contrario *by the definition of \"current transactions\" in Art. XXX of the Fund. Not all capital movements are in themselves \"investments,\" such as direct investments or portfolio investments listed in Art. V of the BIT. In the IMF terminology and classification, widely accepted beyond the Fund\u2019s ambit, the movement of capital at issue here was or would have been more specifically a short-term deposit abroad, a transaction which may be subject to tighter controls than direct or portfolio investment transactions. This confirms the Tribunal in its conclusion that the transfer which the Claimant complains it could not carry out because of the* Corralito, *namely a short-term placement out of Argentina of the equivalent of $19,000,000, was not a transfer related to an investment protected by Art. V of the BIT.*\n\n*245. As a consequence Argentina has committed no breach of Art. V of the BIT to the detriment of the Claimant, so that the latter\u2019s claim in this respect must be and is rejected by the Tribunal. This conclusion makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine the subordinate arguments of the Parties: namely (a) whether in view of the acute foreign exchange crisis Argentina was encountering, Argentina was allowed, notwithstanding its obligations under Art. V BIT to introduce the exchange restrictions of Decree 1570, based on Art. XI of the BIT, on the IMF Agreement or under customary international law; (b) whether the Claimant cannot invoke Ali.* *V because neither itself (Continental) nor CNA ever decided to make, or asked to be authorized to effect the transfers at issue; and (c) whether the derogations allowed under the* Corralito *would have made those transfers possible.* [Footnotes omitted.]\n\n203.\n\nThese paragraphs are to be read in the light of preceding paragraphs 130 to 132 that set out the relevant facts of this case, based on Continental\u2019s memorial:\n\n*130. As explained by the Claimant,(184) CNA ART, like other insurance companies, maintains a portfolio of invested securities in order to earn a return on its capital, reserves and other funds. CNA has a history of making conservative investments, so that its \"portfolio consists mainly of low-risk assets, such as cash deposits, treasury bills and government bonds.\" These investments derive from its business activity, its capital, reserves and undistributed profits. The proceeds of its insurance business drive from the underwriting of its policies; the clients of CNA are business companies that satisfy their statutory and contractual obligations to cover their employees against worker\u2019s risks. CNA\u2019s insurance operations are regulated by two Argentine state agencies: the Superintendent of Insurance (SSN), which regulates the financial aspects of the business, while the handling of workers\u2019 compensation claims and services (such as medical treatment, etc.) is regulated by the Superintendent of Workers Compensation of the Ministry of Labor (SRT). More specifically, SSN lays down criteria for insurance companies such as CNA concerning the ratio of reserves they have to hold and the types of investment they may make.*\n\n*131. The business of CNA was successful. As explained by Claimant, its premiums \"have consistently been among the highest in the market. CNA ART also maintained the highest reserves and investments per insured worker in the market.\"(185) Furthermore, \"[p]rior to March 2001, CNA ART\u2019s investment portfolio was primarily in assets denominated in Argentinean pesos. At the time, pesos were fully convertible to U.S. dollars at a one to one exchange rate. However, CNA ART\u2019s management was concerned about the risk of devaluation. As a result, CNA ART\u2019s senior management prepared an analysis of the options available to CNA ART to hedge the risk of devaluation. These options consisted of:*\n\n*i) maintaining the portfolio in peso denominated assets, which were earning a much higher return than comparable dollar denominated assets;*\n\n*ii) transferring all of CNA ART\u2019s assets in excess of minimum capital requirements out of Argentina to be held by CNA; and*\n\n*iii) moving CNA ART\u2019s investment portfolio to lower return U. S. dollar assets with greater credit worthiness. \"(186)*\n\n*132. As to the option of moving capital out of Argentina, \"CNA ART's management made a recommendation to its American controlling shareholder that it should not transfer assets out of Argentina at that time, but that it should choose to invest assets within Argentina in low risk U.S. dollar denominated assets. \"(187) CNA management accepted this recommendation so that its investment agent CADISA* (Citicorp Administradora de Inversiones S. A) \"was *then instructed to liquidate peso denominated cash deposits, treasury bills and bonds as they matured and to reinvest the proceeds in U.S. dollar denominated assets.\"(188) Thus, \"CNA ART\u2019s policy of shifting its portfolio to U.S. dollar denominated assets involved a deliberate choice to forego the higher yields of peso-denominated assets in favor of the greater capital security of U.S. dollar assets.\"(189) As against capital flight, this was of course a socially responsible policy by Continental and CNA.*\n\n*(184) Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 15 ff.*\n\n*(185) Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16, footnote 33.*\n\n*(186) Claimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 19-20.*\n\n*(187) Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 21.*\n\n*(188) Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 22. The Claimant explains further that, in addition, CADISA was instructed to move cash deposits out of Argentinian owned banks and into either the local subsidiaries of international banks or, preferably, into full branches of international banks. These steps were meant to improve the credit worthiness of its investment portfolio and to protect it from currency risk and credit risk. Cash deposits at full branch banks earned a lower return than at other banks but there was little credit risk associated with them (Claimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 22-24).*\n\n*(189) Claimant\u2019s Memorial, para. 24.*\n\n204.\n\nAt paragraphs 133 to 136, the Tribunal added, again with reference to what was claimed in Continental\u2019s pleadings, that CNA decided to take advantage of Argentina\u2019s offer through Decree 1387 of November 1, 2001, to exchange certain bonds for GGLs, that instructions were given to CADISA on November 29, 2001 for the swap of certain bonds for GGLs, and that by early December 2001, CADISA had *\"largely completed the re-balancing of CNA ART investment portfolio\",* following which it held \"a *conservative portfolio of investments\",* 92 % of which was expressed in USD denominated assets (as compared to 21 % in July 2001).\n\n205.\n\nIn this context, Continental\u2019s Article V claim before the Tribunal was expressed in paragraphs 65-66 of its Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal:\n\n*By late 2001, CNA ART had approximately $19.8 million in its portfolio in excess of capital requirements. It had considered transferring these funds back to the United States, but kept them in the country, re-invested in US dollar securities. In particular, by December 2001, the funds available for transfer were all in term deposits in Argentine banks. These deposits were to mature between mid-December 2001 and early February 2002.... Had CNA ART been free to transfer these assets, it would have avoided the pesification of deposits that occurred on February 3, 2002.*\n\n206.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the first sentence of paragraph 241 and first sentence of 242 may be read as necessarily suggesting that Article V would apply to the transfers only if they \" *correspond[ed] to\"* or were *\"required to satisfy any payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other* or if they *\"would... involve the transfer of ownership of the funds involved to some different entity\",* or if they were *\"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\".* It appears to the Committee that the Tribunal here was merely giving examples of the main types of transfers that could be said to be *\"transfers... essential for, or typical to the making, controlling, maintenance, disposition of investments\".* It contrasted this type of transfer to what it considered to be the appropriate characterisation of the transfer in the present case, namely a mere *\"change of type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment, namely a part of the freely disposable funds, held short term at its banks by CNA\".*\n\n207.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is sufficiently clear from paragraph 241 of the Award that the Tribunal considered that Article V of the BIT, properly interpreted, did not apply to a mere *\"change of type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment\u2019,* and it is clear, from paragraphs 241 and 242, that the Tribunal considered this to be so, on the proper construction of the Treaty, regardless of whether the *\"change of type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment\u2019* was \"a *legitimate operation from a business point of view\",* and regardless of whether its purpose was *\"to protect them from... impending devaluation, by transferring them to bank accounts outside [the host State]\".*\n\n208.\n\nHence, on first impression, the Committee considers it apparent that the Tribunal applied the applicable law, and gave reasons for its decision. It determined what it considered to be the scope of protection afforded by Article V and it found that even if the facts as claimed by Continental were correct, the transactions that it claimed to have been prevented from making would not have fallen within any of the categories of transactions protected by Article V as correctly interpreted. It therefore gave a reasoned rejection of the Article V claim, without the need to consider whether or not the facts claimed by Continental were established.\n\n209.\n\nContinental also argues, on annulment, that the proposed transfer concerned funds that were *\"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\u2019,* within the meaning of Article V(1)(e).\n\n210.\n\nThis argument was expressly referred to in paragraph 237, and was expressly rejected in paragraph 242. The Tribunal clearly considered that a *\"change of type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment\u2019* was not a transfer of *\"proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment\"* for purposes of Article V.\n\n211.\n\nContinental also argues that the Tribunal found, in paragraph 244 of the Award, that a transfer protected by Article V must \"in itself\" be an investment, when there is nothing in the wording of Article V itself to support this conclusion.\n\n212.\n\nIn this regard, paragraphs 243 and 244 in fact deal with arguments of the parties150 in relation to the Article V claim that had relied on *\"IMF provisions and the connected principles of the multilateral regulation of international payments in support of their position\".* The Tribunal noted that under IMF provisions there was an obligation of \"avoidance of restriction on current payments\" but that \"capital movements\" may be subject to exchange controls. The Tribunal said that it found the distinction in IMF provisions between \"current payments\" and \"capital movements\" to be of limited assistance since transfers protected by Article V of the BIT could include both. It noted that in that respect, the BIT was \"lex specialis *in respect of the IMF regime and more liberal than the latter.*\u00a0It added that *\"Not all capital movements are in themselves \u2018investments\u2019, such as direct investments or portfolio investments listed in Art. V of the BIT\u2019.*\n\nReferred to in Award \u00b6 82, 238.\n\n213.\n\nThe Committee considers that this last sentence cannot be read as suggesting that the Tribunal found that a transfer protected by Article V must \"in itself\" be an investment. The Tribunal addressed directly the types of transfers to which Article V applies in paragraphs 240 and 241, and they contain no such suggestion. By paragraph 242, the Tribunal had determined that the transfer in issue in the present case did not fall within any of the categories to which Article V applied, and paragraphs 243 and 244 were concerned with explaining, additionally, why the distinction in IMF provisions between \"current transactions\" and \"capital movements\" was of limited assistance to determining the scope of application of Article V. This was said to be because Article V could apply to both \"current transactions\" and \"capital movements\", and because a capital movement was not necessarily an investment within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n214.\n\nOn any rational reading of the Award as a whole, the Committee considers that it could not be concluded that the Tribunal rejected the Article V claim on the ground that the transfer in question was not in itself an investment. Furthermore, even if the Tribunal had rejected the claim on this basis, and even if it were assumed that the Tribunal erred in so doing, this would be an error of law within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and not an annullable error.\n\n215.\n\nContinental also refers to paragraph 242 of the Award, in which the Tribunal said that the transfer in this case *\"did not correspond to, nor was it required to satisfy a payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other; nor would it involve the transfer of ownership of the funds to some different entity\",151* Continental argues that there is nothing in the language of the BIT, nor of any other relevant legal instrument, that limits directly or indirectly the transfers covered under Article V to transfers required to satisfy \"a *payment obligation of CNA, commercial, financial or other, or involve a transfer of funds to some different entity\"152*\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 242.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 242.\n\n216.\n\nIn addition to its observations above on this issue, the Committee does not consider that this sentence, in paragraph 242, of itself may be considered the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. It is clear to the Committee on reading the relevant paragraphs of the Award as a whole that the Tribunal considered Article V to be inapplicable because the transfer in question was *\"merely a change of the type, location and currency of part of an investor\u2019s existing investment, namely a part of the freely disposable funds, held short term at its banks by CNA\"* (paragraph 241). Despite finding concepts in the IMF regime to be of limited assistance, at paragraph 244, the Tribunal considered that the transfers in this case, in IMF terms, would be \"a *short-term deposit abroad, a transaction which may be subject to tighter controls than direct or portfolio investment transactions\".* In support of this proposition, it cited in footnote an IMF publication for the proposition that *\"When States commit themselves to allow capital investments, they focus especially on direct investments and reserve the right not to liberalise short term monetary placements abroad of the type discussed here\".*\n\n217.\n\nHence, the Tribunal found that Article V did not apply to a mere change of type, location and currency of part of an existing investment, such as a short term monetary placement abroad. The rationale for interpreting Article V in this way is found in paragraph 239, which explains that the freedom of transfer is not without limit, and that ultimately the rationale of the provision can be summed up as being *\"to ensure that at the end of the day, a foreign investor will be able to enjoy the financial benefits of a successful investment\".* In the subsequent paragraph 240, the Tribunal indicated that in interpreting the words \"related to the investment\" in Article V, *\"Guidance is to be found in... the purpose identified above for this kind of provision\".*\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal plainly considered that the transfer in the present case was not the kind of transfer that needed to be protected to give effect to this rationale. It distinguished such transactions which were excluded from the operation of Article V from other transactions that were within the scope of Article V, such as a transfer *\"to satisfy a payment obligation..., commercial, financial or other* or a *\"transfer of ownership of the funds to some different entity\"* (paragraph 242) or the transfer of the proceeds of sale or liquidation of all or part of an investment (paragraph 241), or the kinds of transactions referred to in paragraph 240.\n\n219.\n\nThe Committee considers it sufficiently clear what the Tribunal decided, and the basis on which it so decided, and that the decision was based on the Tribunal\u2019s view of the correct interpretation of Article V of the BIT, which was the governing legal provision.\n\n220.\n\nContinental further argues that on the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s findings in paragraphs 240 and 242 of the Award, *\"the Tribunal had no choice in law or logic but to conclude that Argentina had breached Article V of the BIT\u2019.* Continental argues that in paragraph 240, the Tribunal says that Article V protects transfers for the *\"protection...of property of all kinds\",* and that in paragraph 241, the Tribunal found that the funds in question in this case were *\"part of [the] investor\u2019s existing investment\",* and that the intended purpose was to *\"protect them from the impending devaluation\".* In effect, Continental argues that it is inconsistent for the Tribunal to find in paragraph 240 that protected transfers include those for the *\"protection... of property of all kinds\",* but to find that it did not include the transfer in this case which the Tribunal expressly found, in paragraph 242, to have the purpose to *protect* funds forming part of the investment from devaluation.\n\n221.\n\nAs has been observed above, the phrase *\"the acquisition, use, protection and disposition of property of all kinds including intellectual and industrial property rights\"* is taken from the definition of \"associated activities\" in Article 1(1)(e) of the BIT. The Tribunal said in paragraph 240 that protected transfers are those *\"essential for, or typical to\", inter alia, \"the acquisition, use, protection and disposition of property of all kinds\".* In finding that the transfer in this case was not a transfer \"related to the investment\" for purposes of Article V, it is evident that the Tribunal considered that, even if its purpose was to protect funds forming part of the investment from impending devaluation, this was not a transfer *essential for, or typical to \"the... protection... of property\"* within the meaning of that phrase as used by the Tribunal in paragraph 240. The Committee sees no inherent contradiction between paragraphs 240 and 242 in the way claimed by Continental.\n\n222.\n\nContinental claims that the statement in paragraph 241 (to the effect that the transfer in question does not fall within any of the categories referred to in paragraph 240 of the Award) is a bland assertion and a bare postulate by the Tribunal, without any supporting reasoning.153 For the reasons stated, the Committee disagrees. The Committee is satisfied that the rationale of the Tribunal\u2019s decision is sufficiently discernible from a reading of the relevant paragraphs of the Award, as indicated above. It considers that the Award *\"enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion\"* and that the reasons are not *\"contradictory or frivolous\",154* or incoherent as claimed by Continental.\n\nReferring to *Vivendi* First Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; *Klockner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 144.\n\nSee paragraph 101 above.\n\n223.\n\nContinental also claims that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in failing to apply Article 10 of the Protocol to the BIT that provides:\n\n*10. The Parties note that the Argentine Republic has had and may have in the future a debt-equity conversion program under which nationals or companies of the United States may choose to invest in the Argentine Republic through the purchase of debt at a discount.*\n\n*The Parties agree that the rights provided in Article V, paragraph 1, with respect to the transfer of returns and of* *proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment, remain or may be, as such rights would apply to that part of an investment financed through a debt-equity conversion, modified by the terms of any debt-equity conversion agreement between a national or company of the United States and the Government of the Argentine Republic, or any agency or instrumentality thereof*\n\n*The transfer of returns and of proceeds from the sale or liquidation of all or any part of an investment shall in no case be on terms less favorable than those accorded, in like circumstances, to nationals or companies of the Argentine Republic or any third country, whichever is more favorable.*\n\n224.\n\nIt is the last paragraph of this article that is relevant to this argument of Continental.\n\n225.\n\nUnlike the preceding paragraph, this final paragraph does not state expressly whether it contains an agreement between the parties on the interpretation of Article V of the BIT, or whether it establishes a free-standing obligation, *additional to* Article V.\n\n226.\n\nTo the extent that this provision establishes a free-standing obligation, *additional to* Article V, any consideration of the application of this provision would be separate to the consideration of the application of Article V. It does not appear that Continental ever made a claim in the arbitration proceedings for damages for breach of Article 10 of the Protocol. If it did, and if the Tribunal failed to consider it, Continental\u2019s remedy would have been to request the Tribunal under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention to give an additional decision, dealing with the Article 10 claim. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to decide one claim could not be a ground for annulling its decision with respect to a separate Article V claim which it did decide.\n\n227.\n\nTo the extent that the third paragraph of Article 10 of the Protocol establishes the parties\u2019 agreement of the interpretation of Article V of the BIT, it can logically only be of relevance in circumstances where Article V itself applies. In effect, the Tribunal found that Article V applies to *\"all transfers related to an investment\u2019,* that the transfer that Continental claimed to have been prevented from making was not a *\"transfer related to an investment\u2019,* and that Article V was therefore inapplicable. In these circumstances it is not apparent to the Committee how Article 10 of the Protocol could have been of relevance.\n\n228.\n\nEven if Continental did rely on Article 10 of the Protocol in its arguments before the Tribunal in respect of the Article V claim, the Committee is not persuaded that this reliance was such a prominent or fundamental basis of Continental\u2019s Article V claim that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to mention Article 10 made it impossible to see how the Tribunal *\"proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion\".*\n\n229.\n\nWhile a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions (\"pretensiones\")* submitted to it, it is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions.155 The question submitted to the Tribunal was whether there had been a breach of Article V. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to comment on any arguments of Continental based on Article 10 of the Protocol, or on claims of more favourable treatment under BITs between Argentina and other States, did not in the Committee\u2019s view mean that there was a failure of the Tribunal to state reasons for its decision on the Article V point.\n\nSee paragraph 99 above.\n\n230.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, or failed to give reasons for its decision, in respect of Continental\u2019s claim under Article V of the BIT.\n\n231.\n\nIn relation to this ground of annulment, Continental argued in its Application for Annulment that *\"the Tribunal failed to properly apply the terms of the Treaty\",* and that *\"the Tribunal ignored the express provisions of the Treaty\"* and that *\"Tribunal totally ignore[d] the express wording of the governing Treaty\".* The Committee recalls that alleged error of fact or alleged error of law are not grounds of annulment under Article 52 of the Convention. The applicable law was the BIT, the ICSID Convention, and international law generally. The Tribunal applied Article V of the BIT to determine Continental\u2019s claim under that provision, and gave reasons for its decision. Whether or not the Tribunal decided the claim correctly is not a matter to be determined by an annulment committee.\n\n232.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee concludes that this ground of annulment is rejected. As a consequence, the Committee denies Continental\u2019s application for annulment of all parts of the *dispositif* of the Award with the exception of para. 320(b), and all of Continental\u2019s requests for annulment of findings of the Tribunal and associated reasoning referred to in paragraph 77 above.\n\n**III. ARGENTINA\u2019S APPLICATION FOR PARTIAL ANNULMENT**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Background**\n-----------------\n\n233.\n\nArgentina seeks annulment of the part of the Award that was adverse to Argentina, namely that the finding that Argentina\u2019s restructuring of the LETEs effected by Decree 1735/04 was in breach of the BIT.\n\n234.\n\nIn its application for partial annulment, Argentina invokes the grounds in Article 51 (1)(b) - manifest excess of powers - and Article 51 (1)(e) - failure to state reasons - respectively, of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Arguments of the parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n*Alleged manifest excess of powers*\n\n(a) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to explain why it concluded (i) that the swap offer in Decree 1735/04 was \"late\"; (ii) that the original value of the LETEs was \"reduced\" by the swap offer; (iii) that the offer was \"unilateral\", and (iv) that the condition that any other right should be waived if the swap offer was accepted was unreasonable.156\n\n(b) Argentina\u2019s was the largest sovereign debt restructuring in history, involving a swap of over USD 100 billion comprising more than 152 types of securities held by hundreds of thousands of creditors around the world, and the fairness of that process could not be resolved in a mere two paragraphs in the Award.\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the swap offer was \"late\" implies that, due to the characteristics of the operation, the offer should have been made earlier, or that Argentina was in a position to make it earlier. Such a conclusion would involve extremely challenging assessments of the complexity of the operation which had to be carried out in order to determine whether it was feasible to conduct it within a shorter term, the evolution of Argentina\u2019s situation at both an economic and a political-institutional level in order to determine whether the country would have been in a position to make an offer before it actually did, and so forth. The Award does not deal with these issues or with any other issue which might serve as basis for the conclusion that the date of the swap was \"late\".\n\n(d) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the original value of the debt that Argentina offered to recognize was \"reduced\" implies that, under similar circumstances of debt restructuring, the offer should have been better or that Argentina was in a position to make a better offer. Again, such a conclusion would involve extremely complex assessments of Argentina\u2019s actual payment capacity throughout a considerable number of years, the situations experienced in other comparable debt restructuring processes and the offers made therein, and so forth. The Award again fails to address these issues or any other issue which might serve as basis for the conclusion that the value of the offer made by Argentine was \"reduced\".\n\n(e) The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the December 2004 swap offer in Decree 1735/04 was \"unilateral\" would require an analysis of the complex swap process, which lasted for approximately three years, in order to determine the steps involved in the preparation of the offer, the measures taken by the Government, the degree of participation of the creditors, and other critical factors.\n\n(f) The Award provides no explanation why requiring the waiver of other claims as a condition for accepting the swap offer was unreasonable.\n\n(g) The Tribunal determined in an arbitrary and groundless manner that the restructuring of the LETEs violated the BIT, and was not protected by Article XI of the BIT or by the defence of necessity, by simply postulating that Article XI and the defence of necessity were inapplicable due to (i) the late date in which the swap was offered, when Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality; (ii) the reduced percentage of the original value of the debt that Argentina unilaterally offered to recognize; and (iii) the condition that any other rights would be waived, which entailed also waiving the protection of the BIT.157\n\n(h) By holding that the restructuring of its public debt violated the BIT *\"where they implied a waiver of all rights by the holders, who were being subjected to a substantial loss of their investment, in addition to having been previously subjected to losses due to pesification\",* the Tribunal clearly contradicted itself and manifestly exceeded its powers, in finding that the restructuring entailed a substantial loss of Continental\u2019s investment (a matter which was not even raised in the proceeding), and in linking this conclusion to an occurrence that was already protected under Article XI of the BIT. The Tribunal also contradicted itself in stating that the default was protected under Article XI of the BIT158 and the defence of necessity, but then determining that the solution to such default entailed a substantial loss without discussing or providing any reason why the restructuring of the LETEs to escape default was unreasonable.\n\n*Alleged failure to state reasons*\n\n(i) The Tribunal failed to state reasons for its three main conclusions relating to the LETEs, namely \"(a) the late date in which the swap was offered, when Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality;\n\n(b) the reduced percentage of the original value of the debt that Argentina unilaterally offered to recognize; and (c) the condition that any other rights would be waived, which entailed also waiving the protection of the BIT.\"159\n\n(j) The Tribunal did not provide reasons for stating that Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality or explain the manner in which they affected the restructuring (conducted in a situation of default which, on the contrary, had been declared as protected by the BIT as a non-precluded measure pursuant to Article XI). Neither did the Tribunal explain how Argentina\u2019s restructuring offer was evaluated nor why such offer was determined to be unilateral or why \"the condition that any other rights [regarding the restructuring] would be waived\" entailed a violation of the BIT.\n\n(k) The Tribunal failed to deal with substantial questions submitted by Argentina in this regard, such as the argument in its Counter-Memorial that:\n\n*Under the debt restructuring, the Argentine Government offered to swap all Argentine government debt securities issued before 31 December 2001, on default for new bonds with an extended term and for a minor principal and/or interest value but adjusted to Argentina\u2019s payment capacity. The offer was accepted by the holders of 76.1% of bonds eligible for the swap.* I*t should be noted that Section 32 of Decree No.* *905/02 provided that the holders of Argentine Treasury bonds outstanding by 3 February 2002, denominated in US dollars, governed by Argentine law and pesified (as in the case of LETEs) would be allowed to convert those bonds into the original currency at the exchange rate applicable to the conversion into pesos (under the same conditions as those in effect as of February 3,* *2002) in the event that they took part in any invitation made by Argentina to swap their debt securities or loans. It is noteworthy that, on the one hand, Continental believes that it has sustained damages because CNA ART has not received any payments on the LETEs, when in fact the payment deferral was announced for the entire government debt issued* *before 31 December 2001, and not only for the debt securities held by CNA ART.160*\n\nIt was also Argentina\u2019s argument that \"[f]or swap purposes, the holders of LETEs could select an instrument denominated in Argentine pesos. The foreign exchange rate to be used to determine the nominal value of the new bond was fixed at ARS/USD 2.9175, equivalent to the market rate. The new securities included the capital adjustment per the consumer price index\".\n\n(l) The Tribunal not only failed to deal with all these questions but also failed to deal with other questions which were not addressed during the hearing or otherwise in the proceeding,161 yet it made unfounded determinations regarding the LETEs. The Tribunal reached these conclusions without providing any reason for them. Not even an attentive reader of the Award would be able to understand, even through inference, the manner in which the Tribunal arrived at the conclusions drawn regarding the December 2004 Offer.\n\n*Continental\u2019s title to the LETEs*\n\n(m) The LETEs are registered in an electronic account and Continental should have provided evidence that the securities concerned were not transferred at any time from their acquisition. Such lack of evidence caused the Tribunal to manifestly exceed its powers and fail to state the reasons on which the Award and the Decision on Rectification were based in respect of the Claimant\u2019s uninterrupted ownership of the LETEs.\n\n*Non ultra petita*\n\n(n) The Tribunal concluded that the restructuring of the LETEs constituted a breach of the fair and equitable standard and awarded Continental damages on that basis. However, Continental never asked the Tribunal to conclude that the restructuring of the LETEs was contrary to the fair and equitable treatment clause. Indeed, Argentina raised the issue of the restructuring as a *defence.*\n\n(o) Continental only ever claimed that the default and pesification of the LETEs were a breach of the BIT. Decree 1735/04 which provided for the restructuring of the LETEs was adopted after the proceedings before the Tribunal had commenced and after Continental\u2019s Memorial on the merits before the Tribunal had been filed. Even after Decree 1735/04 had been adopted, Continental did not seek to argue that the restructuring of the LETEs was a breach of the BIT. Even if, procedurally, it might have been possible for Continental to add a new claim during the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal to allege that the restructuring was a breach of the BIT, it did not do so. Argentina never defended itself against this claim, because Continental never put it forward.\n\n(p) The decision on the restructuring of Argentina\u2019s sovereign debt was *ultra petita,* as it was never put forward by Continental, and was never responded to by Argentina. This constitutes a manifest excess of powers as well as a failure to provide reasons.\n\n(q) Continental never filed a claim under the BIT related to the Argentine debt restructuring carried out in 2004 and 2005; it never raised before the Tribunal the question of whether that claim was included in the claim brought with the Tribunal, and Argentina never defended itself or explained its position on whether the debt swap violated the BIT or not, simply because that claim had not been made. The granting of a claim that had never been made by the Claimant was a manifest excess of powers and a failure to state reasons.\n\n(r) The case of *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* does not assist Continental.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 221 (citations omitted).\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 221 (citations omitted).\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 217.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 221.\n\nReferring to Argentina\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras 721-725. Argentina claims that the Tribunal similarly failed to deal with and appreciate the importance of other aspects of its position, such as its Counter-Memorial, paras 51,398, 717, 400, 401 and 419.\n\nReferring to Argentine Republic\u2019s Memorial on the Merits: Counter-Memorial (Exhibit AR 5), Rejoinder (Exhibit AR 7), First and Second AGM Report (Exhibit AR 6 and 8, respectively) and Stenographic Transcripts of the Hearing in both languages (A RA 90).\n\n236.\n\nContinental argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n*Alleged manifest excess of powers and alleged failure to state reasons*\n\n(a) The Award is well-founded insofar it deals with the restructuring of the LETEs and fully explains the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Argentina could not rely on Article XI of the BIT or the necessity defence under customary international law in this respect. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions were clearly reasoned and based on the evidence. The Tribunal did not engage in any excess of powers, let alone any manifest excess, nor did it fail to state reasons for its conclusions.\n\n(b) The Tribunal accepted Continental\u2019s submission that the restructuring of the LETEs constituted a breach of the fair and equitable standard,162 having regard to the fact that Argentina offered only USD 0.30 per dollar, that Continental would have been required to waive its rights and that Continental would have also been required to accept long maturities on bonds from a government that had demonstrated its willingness to repeatedly default on its debt.\n\n(c) The Tribunal rightly rejected the defences raised by Argentina based on Article XI of the BIT and necessity under customary international law in respect of the December 2004 Offer, by reason of the late date on which it was offered, the reduced percentage of the original value of the debt, and the condition that any other rights would be waived.\n\n(d) The Tribunal clearly explained its conclusion that the offer was made at a \"late date\" by reference to its finding that by that time \"Argentina\u2019s financial conditions were evolving towards normality\".163 it further explained this finding by referring to its earlier findings that Argentina had \"re-entered the international financial market by filing a prospectus concerning the future issuance of debt securities up to more than U.S.$ 12 billion.\"164 This finding was consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s related findings that Argentina\u2019s financial situation *\"improved slowly but progressively from the end of 2002\",* that *\"[t]he regular functioning of the democratic institutions was re-established with the general elections held* *on May 25, 2003 when Nestor Kirchner was duly elected president of Argentina\",* and that *\"the improved balance of payment situation enabled Argentina to repay in a short time-span all of the sizeable amounts outstanding to the IMF, in 2005 (SDR 2,417 billion) and January 2006 (SDR 6,655 billion)\"165* The Tribunal logically and reasonably concluded that by December 2004, Argentina could not rely on either Article XI of the Treaty or the customary international law defence of necessity because financial conditions in the country were normalizing.\n\n(e) The Tribunal also assessed Continental\u2019s evidence that it did not accept the restructuring of the LETEs since it would have received \"only U.S.$ 0.30 per dollar\".166 This is consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s earlier indication that *\"the new instruments offered in exchange were worth only about 30% of the original securities in dollar terms.\"167* The Tribunal also contrasted the fact that Argentina repaid the amounts due to the IMF with the fact that *\"the swap finally offered to foreign bondholders entailed a \u2018haircut, \u2019 that is a reduction of the face value of thir bonds, of about 70%, if not more.\"168*\n\n(f) The Tribunal rightly held that the restructuring of the LETEs was \"unilateral\" in that it was imposed by Argentina, rather than the product of balanced negotiations. On the basis of the evidence before it, including the terms of the restructuring of the LETEs itself, the Tribunal accepted Continental\u2019s position that the offer to restructure was a *\"coercive, take-it-or-leave-it offer.*\n\n(g) Argentina cannot raise new arguments in the annulment proceeding that it failed to raise before the Tribunal.\n\n(h) The Tribunal concluded that the terms of the restructuring of the LETEs were unreasonable, *\"notably where they implied a waiver of all rights by the holders, who were being subjected to a substantial loss of their* *investment, in addition to having been previously subjected to losses due to pesification\",169* Considering the substantial losses incurred by the bondholders, the Tribunal found it unreasonable to require them to waive all rights of action in return for a swap worth only USD 0.30 per dollar of their original LETEs holding.\n\n(i) The Tribunal held the waiver requirement to be unreasonable because: (i) there was no risk of double recovery by December 2004; (ii) the investors were being subjected to a substantial loss of their investment, in addition to having been previously subjected to losses due to pesification; and (iii) the term did not meet the requirements of either Article XI or the customary international law defence of necessity.\n\n*Continental\u2019s title to the LETEs*\n\n(j) The Tribunal found that CNA bought the first LETEs on 25 September, 2001 and the second LETEs on 18 October 2001. The LETEs had been issued under Resolution 4/5 of January 2001.170 This finding alone confirms Continental\u2019s title to the LETEs.\n\n*Non ultra petita*\n\n(k) The Tribunal acted entirely within its powers and clearly put forth its reasons by identifying *\"the issue as being whether Argentina\u2019s default and subsequent restructuring of the Claimant\u2019s investment was fair and equitable\"171* Thus, the Tribunal found,172 correctly, that Argentina\u2019s treatment of the LETEs was unfair and inequitable.\n\n(l) The restructuring offer was just another symptom of the unfair and inequitable treatment. It was a declaration that holders of LETEs either could accept 30 percent of the value of their LETEs or would never receive anything. That was what the Tribunal fixed upon in terms of making its decision. The attempted restructuring in December 2004 brought Argentina\u2019s modification of the terms of the LETEs into even sharper relief. Continental\u2019s original complaint in its Merits Memorial was sufficient to encompass further treaty-inconsistent actions taken by Argentina, as well as breaches that were ongoing. The restructuring of the LETEs thus formed part of Continental\u2019s claims.\n\n(m) In *Pope & Talbot v Canada* case, the Tribunal found that new actions taken by Canada after the investor had filed its statement of claim, while not specifically pleaded, were covered by the broad wording of the original claim as pleaded. The fairness and reasonableness of the restructuring of the LETEs was an issue placed before the Tribunal by Continental in its pleadings.\n\nIn Continental\u2019s own application for partial annulment, Continental maintains that the Tribunal should have considered whether it also constituted unlawful expropriation.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 221.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 159 and footnote 336.\n\nReferring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 152, 157 and 159.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 220.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 159.\n\nReferring to Award footnote 231.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 264.\n\nReferring to Award footnote 195.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 256.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 263 and 264.\n\n**C. The Committee\u2019s views**\n----------------------------\n\n237.\n\nArgentina\u2019s complaints as developed in its submissions have focused on the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Argentina could not rely on Article XI of the BIT or the defence of necessity under customary international law to preclude Argentina\u2019s liability under the fair and equitable treatment clause in relation to the LETEs.\n\n238.\n\nArgentina contends that its invocation of Article XI and the customary international law principle of necessity was summarily dismissed by the Tribunal in paragraph 221 of the Award, with cursory references to the \"late date\" of the offer in Decree 1735/04, the \"reduced percentage\" of the original value of the LETEs and the \"waiver requirement\" as a condition of the offer.\n\n239.\n\nArgentina invokes two annulment grounds in relation to this challenge, namely manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) and failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n240.\n\nIn relation to Article 52(1)(b) Argentina contends that the Tribunal determined this matter in an arbitrary and groundless manner by simply postulating the nonapplication of Argentina\u2019s defences rather than satisfying the minimum requirement for the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of its powers that it bases its conclusions on the parties\u2019 arguments. Argentina contends that the Tribunal failed to appreciate the exceptional complexity of the Argentinean financial crisis and the country\u2019s efforts to come to grips with this extremely difficult situation with its far-reaching repercussions for the welfare of the entire population and the threats posed to the fabric of the Argentine society. Argentina contends that this involved exceedingly complex issues, and that matters could not be determined by the Tribunal without an in-depth review of all pertinent factors.\n\n241.\n\nIn relation to Article 52(1)(e), Argentina\u2019s objection is that the summary references in paragraph 221 of the Award to the offer to restructure the LETEs in December 2004 being \"late\", \"reduced\" and \"unilateral\", lack any satisfactory rationale and are therefore deficient in conveying any reasoned content.\n\n242.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, Argentina also raised a further argument, to the effect that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on this point was *ultra petita.* Argentina maintains that Continental never requested the Tribunal to find that the offer to restructure the LETEs made in Decree 1735/04 was a breach of the BIT. In the circumstances, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by awarding damages on a basis other than that which was claimed by the Claimant.\n\n243.\n\nArgentina additionally contends that the Award is illogical, in that Argentina\u2019s default on the LETEs had occurred in 2002, at a time when the Tribunal found that Article XI of the BIT applied to the measures taken by Argentina to deal with its economic crisis. Thus, it is said, the Tribunal found that Argentina\u2019s default on the LETEs in 2002 was not a breach of the BIT. Argentina argues that it therefore flies in the face of logic for the Tribunal to find that the subsequent adoption of Decree 1735/04 in 2004 could be a breach of the BIT, given that this Decree *Improved* the position of LETEs holders by offering them a restructuring that provided them with 30% of the original value of the LETEs on which they would otherwise have received nothing.\n\n244.\n\nThe Committee considers that the starting point in addressing these arguments is to identify what it was that Continental claimed, and what the Tribunal decided.\n\n245.\n\nIt is relevant that Continental\u2019s Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal was filed in April 2004, prior to the adoption of Decree 1735/04. In relation to the LETEs, Continental\u2019s claim in the proceedings before the Tribunal had two aspects.173 The first related to the pesification of the LETEs in March 2002 by Decree 471. The second related to the default on the LETEs. According to Continental\u2019s Memorial, *\"The LETEs matured on March 15, 2002, but CNA ART did not receive any payment on that day. The default of these LETEs continues to this day\"174*\n\nContinental\u2019s Memorial In the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraphs 44-45.\n\nQuoted in Award footnote 207.\n\n246.\n\nContinental provided an expert report of Mr. Howard Rosen dated April 27, 2004 (the **\"First Rosen Report\"),** which quantified the losses claimed by Continental as a result of the actions taken by Argentina complained of by Continental. These actions of Argentina are referred to in that report as the \"Events\", which are defined in paragraph 9 of that report to begin with Decree 1570 in December 2001, and to end with Decree 644 in April 2004. The definition of the \"Events\" did not of course extend to Decree 1735/04, which had not yet been adopted at the time of the First Rosen Report.\n\n247.\n\nDecree 1735/04 had been adopted by the time Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial was filed in August 2006. At paragraphs 78-79 of the Continental\u2019s Reply Memorial, reference was made to Decree 1735/04, but only for the purpose of refuting Argentina\u2019s argument that Continental should have accepted the offer contained in that Decree.175 However, Continental\u2019s claim in respect of the LETEs remained in effect a complaint as to the pesification of the LETEs,176 and the default on the LETEs since March 2002.177 Continental claimed that as a result of the default on the LETEs, it had received \"nothing at all\",178 and that the value of the LETEs was \"nothing\".179\n\nReferred to in Award \u00b6 151 and footnote 219.\n\nContinental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraph 224.\n\nContinental\u2019s Reply Memorial In the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraphs 229-230.\n\nContinental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraph 370, quoted in Award \u00b6 76.\n\nContinental\u2019s Reply Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, paragraph 389, referred to in Award footnote 437.\n\n248.\n\nContinental subsequently submitted the Second Rosen Report dated August 14, 2006 (see paragraph 159 above), updating the quantification of losses claimed by Continental. (The quantification of the loss in relation to the LETEs as set out in the Second Rosen Report has already been set out in paragraph 159 above.) This report set out what it claimed would have been the value of the LETEs but for the \"Events\", and the \"expected value\" or \"current defaulted value\" of the LETEs given the \"Events\". Paragraph 1 of this report defined \"Events\" to have the same meaning as in the First Rosen Report (such that it did not include Decree 1735/04). It set out separately the losses arising as a result of the pesification of the LETEs, and the losses arising as a result of the default on the LETEs.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the pesification of the LETEs was a measure that fell within the scope of Article XI of the BIT, and that Argentina was therefore not liable under the BIT to compensate Continental for losses arising as a result of the pesification. The Tribunal therefore concluded, in relation to Continental\u2019s claim in respect of the LETEs, as follows:\n\n*The Claimant submits it has suffered as to LETEs losses amounting to U.S$700,000 due to pesification and to U.S$2,800,000 \"due to the further default and revocation of contractual rights. \" For the reason stated above, the Claimant is entitled to be compensated only for the latter amount that corresponds to its capital loss. The Claimant is accordingly entitled to payment of compensation in the principal sum of U.S. $2,800,000.180*\n\nAward \u00b6 305 (footnote omitted).\n\n250.\n\nIt is apparent that the Tribunal was granting Continental\u2019s claim in part. It did not award the claimed losses in respect of pesification, but did award the claimed losses in respect of *\"further default and revocation of contractual rights\".*\n\n251.\n\nHowever, even in respect of the claimed losses in respect of *\"further default\u2019,* the Tribunal allowed the claim in part only. Continental claimed that the default occurred in March 2002, when the LETEs matured. The Tribunal found on the other hand that the date of default was the later date of January 1.2005.181\n\nAward \u00b6 315.\n\n252.\n\nIn the course of reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal considered the significance of Decree 1735/04.\n\n253.\n\nIn paragraphs 220-222 and 264-266 and footnote 350 of the Award, the Tribunal found that Article XI of the BIT did not apply to Decree 1735/04, on the basis that by the time of its adoption in December 2004, \"Argentina\u2019s financial situation was evolving towards normality\". This meant that Argentina could not rely on Decree 1735/04 as a justification for its subsequent failure to observe the original terms of the LETEs.\n\n254.\n\nThe Committee notes in this respect that the Award does not specify a date on which Argentina\u2019s economic crisis ended. That is understandable, because an economic crisis of this nature does not normally have an abrupt termination on a particular day. Paragraphs 152 to 159 of the Award deal with the evolution of the situation from the apogee of the crisis in the second half of 2002, until January 2006 when repayment of all sizable amounts outstanding to the IMF had been completed. On the Committee\u2019s reading of the Award, the Tribunal did not find that Argentina\u2019s economic crisis had necessarily \"ended\" by December 2004, when Decree 1735/04 was adopted. Rather, its finding was that by December 2004, the economic situation had sufficiently evolved \"towards normality\" that the particular measures contained in Decree 1735/04 could not in all of the circumstances then prevailing be considered \"necessary\" for purposes of Article XI of the BIT.\n\n255.\n\nIn paragraphs 265 and 285 of the Award, the Tribunal indicates that the restructuring of the LETEs provided for in Decree 1735/04 was itself a breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause. From a reading of the Award as a whole, it is clear that the reasons for this were the same as reasons for concluding that Article XI did not apply, namely that in circumstances where it was no longer necessary to do so in order to deal with the economic crisis, the Decree unilaterally offered to recognise only 30 percent of the value of the LETEs, and only on condition that rights under the BIT were waived.\n\n256.\n\nArgentina argues that this finding is illogical, since Argentina was absolved of liability for its default on the LETEs in 2002 by virtue of Article XI of the BIT, such that the offer in Decree 1735/04 in 2004 *improved* the position of LETEs holders. Even were this one possible reading of the Award, where it is merely arguable whether an award contains an inconsistency, it is not for an annulment committee to determine that the correct reading of the award is one which contains an annullable error.182 If two possible readings of an award are fairly open, where one would contain an annullable error and the other would not, the latter reading should be assumed to be what a tribunal intended.\n\nSee paragraph 104 above.\n\n257.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is implicit in the Award that the Tribunal considered that prior to Decree 1735/04 the LETEs had not already been rendered worthless by measures to which Article XI applied. If the obligations under the LETEs had been restructured by a permanent measure to which Article XI applied, then such measure would continue to apply even after the economic crisis had ended, as the Tribunal for instance found in relation to the pesification of the LETEs. However, as Article XI was found not to apply to Decree 1735/04, it is implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s decision that if Decree 1735/04 had never been adopted, at some point Continental would have had a BIT claim in respect of default on the LETEs if the default had continued indefinitely, since not all rights under the LETEs had been permanently abrogated by a measure to which Article XI applied.\n\n258.\n\nIt is implicit that the Tribunal regarded Decree 1735/04 as having effectively abrogated the remaining rights of LETEs holders who, like Continental, did not accept the offered restructuring. The result was that Decree 1735/04 itself was found by the Tribunal to constitute a breach of the BIT, for which Argentina was liable to pay damages.\n\n259.\n\nThe Committee therefore does not consider that there is any inherent contradiction in the reasoning of the Tribunal.\n\n260.\n\nArgentina complains further that the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for finding that Article XI of the BIT did not apply to Decree 1735/04 were too brief. Argentina argues that the question of what measures were \"necessary\" to deal with the economic crisis is enormously complex, and that the Tribunal dealt with it in a brief two paragraphs of the Award. It is said that this was arbitrary, amounting to a manifest excess of powers, or a failure to give reasons for the decision.\n\n261.\n\nThe fact that reasons may have been short is not in the Committee\u2019s view a meaningful criterion for determining whether the discussion offered by a tribunal falls short of its duty to state reasons.183 Furthermore, in determining whether the reasons given for a conclusion on a particular question are sufficient, is it necessary not to look in isolation at the particular paragraphs of the award dealing specifically with that question. Those paragraphs must always be read together with the award as a whole. In the present case, the Award contained a long discussion of the factual background to the Argentinean economic crisis, detailing the course of events from the late 1990s to the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.184 The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions specifically relating to the default on the LETEs and Decree 1735/04 must be understood in the light of the circumstantial framework which the Tribunal obviously took into consideration when reaching its conclusions.\n\nSee paragraphs 99-102 above.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 100-159.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal could only decide the questions before it on the basis of the evidence and submissions placed before it by the parties. On the basis of that evidence and those submissions, the Tribunal was required to determine whether Article XI of the BIT applied to various measures that were taken by Argentina from the beginning of the economic crisis. On the basis of that evidence and those submissions, the Tribunal held that Article XI applied in relation to various of those measures taken in 2001 and 2002, but was satisfied that it did not apply to Decree 1735/04. The Committee considers that the Award, when read as a whole, *\"enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion\".* The Committee is not persuaded that this is a *\"clear case\"* of reasons that *\"leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale\".* Even if the reasons are stated succinctly and even if Argentina may not be persuaded by them, there has been no failure to state reasons.\n\n263.\n\nAt the Hearing before the Committee, Argentina for the first time raised a further argument as the basis for annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s finding in respect of the LETEs, namely that the Tribunal had awarded damages *ultra petita,* that is to say, on a ground which had not been invoked by Continental. Argentina says that this is because Continental never advanced a claim before the Tribunal that Decree 1735/04 amounted to a breach of the BIT.\n\n264.\n\nIn respect of this argument, the Committee observes that even where a Tribunal does grant a claim which is *ultra petita,* this will only amount to an annullable error where one of the grounds of annulment in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is applicable. In its Application for Annulment in these proceedings, the only grounds of annulment invoked by Argentina were failure to state reasons and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Argentina\u2019s Memorial on Annulment similarly invoked these two grounds only, as did Argentina\u2019s Reply on Annulment. At the Hearing, Argentina ultimately relied on the same two grounds.185\n\nHearing transcript, November 9, 2010, pp. 222-224.\n\n265.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal did give sufficient reasons for its decision in this respect.\n\n266.\n\nFurthermore, even if it is assumed that it is an excess of powers for a tribunal to decide a claim *ultra petita,* this will only be a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention if the excess of powers is \"manifest\".\n\n267.\n\nIt has been said that \"it is generally understood that exceeding one\u2019s powers is \u2018manifest\u2019 when it is \u2018obvious by itself\u2019 simply by reading the Award, that is, even prior to a detailed examination of its contents\",186 and that this ground of annulment requires that the excess of power should be \"textually obvious\"187 The Committee considers that even if it were to be accepted that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in this case by finding a breach of the BIT on an *ultra petita* basis, the excess of powers was not \"manifest\" in this sense. In order to establish whether there was any excess of powers in this case it is necessary to engage in a careful review of the arguments that have been advanced by the parties in the underlying arbitral proceedings. Even if there were said to be an excess of powers, the Committee does not consider that it is \"obvious by itself\", or \"textually obvious\".\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador SA v. Empresa Estatal P\u00e9troleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, *Decision on the Application for Annulment,* 8 January 2007 \u00b6 36.\n\n*Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, *Decision of the Ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki,* 5 June 2007 \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\n268.\n\nArgentina did not expressly argue that the making of an *ultra petita* determination by a tribunal amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee has nonetheless considered whether it is empowered, under the principle of *jura novit curia,* to determine whether Argentina\u2019s *non ultra petita* argument establishes a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n269.\n\nThe Committee considers that in its consideration of this issue, it must have regard to the stage at which Argentina raised the *non ultra petita* argument. At the Hearing, Continental expressed its view that Argentina had not presented this argument in its written submissions and that, for this reason, the argument raised by Argentina at the Hearing was \"technically inadmissible\". Argentina contended for its part that the matter of *ultra petita* had, in fact, been raised in Argentina\u2019s written submissions.188 Argentina referred to the following passages in its submissions:\n\n*In the Award, the Tribunal reached severe conclusions regarding the restructuring of the Argentine debt without taking into consideration the evidence and arguments presented by the parties, which were merely not mentioned as grounds for such conclusions.189*\n\n*The Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision on this matter as regards certain questions submitted by the parties and, particularly, by the Argentine* *Republic, and failed to deal with other questions which were not addressed at the hearing or during the course of written proceedings, yet it made unfounded determinations concerning the restructuring of the LETES190*\n\nHearing transcript, November 9, 2010, pp. 346-347.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Annulment, para 24.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply Memorial on Annulment, para 30.\n\n270.\n\nContinental, for its part, argued that these references in Argentina\u2019s written annulment pleadings were merely \"some obscure and oblique passages\"191 which were so subtle that they could not possibly be said to have raised the *non ultra petita* argument before the Hearing. Continental therefore took the view that the *non ultra petita* argument was \"technically inadmissible\".192\n\nHearing transcript, November 10, 2010, p. 425.\n\nHearing transcript, November 10, 2010, p. 425.\n\n271.\n\nNotwithstanding that position, Continental proceeded to argue why the Tribunal\u2019s dealing with the December 2004 Offer did not constitute a manifest excess of powers or a failure to state reasons. No request for dismissal was made by Continental, and no ruling on the matter was rendered by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n272.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Continental\u2019s view that Argentina cannot be said to have invoked properly the *non ultra petita* argument prior to the Hearing. The Committee was in the circumstances ultimately prepared to consider the argument. However, in the circumstances, the Committee is not prepared to go further, and to consider of its own motion, under the principle of *jura novit curia,* whether there may have been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n273.\n\nFor the sake of completeness it may be added that the Parties at the Hearing discussed the implications of invoking events taking place after the commencement of proceedings on the basis of an earlier investment arbitration case, *Pope & Talbot v Canada.* However, as Argentina did not reject the possibility that such subsequent events could be taken into account on condition that they were properly argued, there is no reason for the Committee to discuss the Parties\u2019 argument in relation to this prior NAFTA case.\n\n274.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee finds no basis to annul the Award (to the extent requested by Argentina) on the basis of Argentina's *ultra petita* argument.\n\n275.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds no annullable error in the Tribunal\u2019s decision partially to allow Continental\u2019s claim in respect of the LETEs.\n\n276.\n\nArgentina raised an additional issue in its application for partial annulment. In the Award, Argentina was declared liable to compensate Continental \"subject to the Claimant first procuring the surrender of all LETEs held by its subsidiary, not previously tendered to and accepted by Argentina\". This provision of the dispositive part of the Award was later the object of an application for rectification of the Award by Continental, pointing out that the securities in question were *\"maintained by the Argentine Ministry of Finance in an electronic registe/\u2019* and that it was not, therefore, feasible to surrender any physical certificates.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal, in dealing with Continental\u2019s request for rectification, noted that *\"the Claimant did not supply any evidence that \u2018the LETEs acquired on 25 September and 18 October [2001] remained uninterruptedly in possession of Claimant\u2019s subsidiary up to the present date\"\u2019193* However, the Tribunal held that such evidence would not be necessary as the LETEs were clearly identified. Argentina argues that this finding was a manifest excess of powers or a failure to state reasons, as Continental *\"should have demonstrated, by means of the relevant account statement, that the LETEs concerned were not transferred at any time as from their acquisition\".*\n\nRectification of the Award of 23 February 2009, para 10.\n\n278.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that *\"additional evidence of such continuous possession would be superfluous\"* was a conclusion that the Tribunal was entitled to make and it does not attest to any manifest excess of powers or failure to state reasons.\n\n279.\n\nConsequently, the Committee denies Argentina\u2019s request for annulment of paragraph 320(b) of the Award, and all of Argentina\u2019s requests for annulment of findings of the Tribunal and associated reasoning referred to in paragraph 78 above.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n280.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee has rejected the respective applications for annulment of Continental and Argentina in their entirety. It follows that the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in the Award on the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal stands.\n\n281.\n\nAs to the costs of the present annulment proceedings, under Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), read in conjunction with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has a discretion to determine how and by whom shall be paid the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n282.\n\nThe Committee notes that there are suggestions in some decisions on applications for annulment that the normal practice in annulment proceedings, regardless of the outcome,194 is to order that each party shall bear its own costs195 and to order that the parties shall bear equally the costs of the annulment proceedings.196\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 369-370 and *Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 419-420, giving references; *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 183. This general rule has been said to be subject to a possible exception In cases where the annulment application was *\"fundamentally lacking in merit\u2019.*\n\nOther recent decisions adopting this practice include *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for Annulment of the Award Rendered on 20 August 2007, August 20, 2010 *(\"Vivendi* Second Annulment Decision\") \u00b6 268; *Fraport* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 283-285; *Helnan* Annulment Decision, *dispositif, Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 184; *Duke* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 266-268.\n\nOther recent decisions adopting this practice include *Vivendi* Second Annulment Decision \u00b6 269; *Fraport* Annulment Decision \u00b6 286; *Helnan* Annulment Decision, *dispositif.*\n\n283.\n\nA different approach was taken in the *Azurix* Annulment Decision. The *ad hoc* committee in that case did follow the practice of ordering that each party should bear its own litigation costs and expenses.197 However, in relation to the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* committee, it was concluded that the normal rule should be for a wholly unsuccessful applicant for annulment carry the burden of the whole of the costs, but that this normal rule could be departed from where exceptional circumstances so justify.198 In the circumstances of that case, a departure from the general rule was found not to be justified.199 A similar approach was taken in the *MCI* Annulment Decision200 and the *Duke* Annulment Decision.201\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 380. *Rumeli* Annulment Decision \u00b6 184\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 371-378.\n\n*Azurix* Annulment Decision \u00b6 379.\n\n*MCI* Annulment Decision \u00b6 88.\n\n*Duke* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 263 and 265 (on the basis that Peru, the party unsuccessfully applying for annulment, had stated that it was not requesting to be reimbursed for any portion of the ICSID costs that it had already advanced).\n\n284.\n\nIn the *Enron* Annulment Decision, a case where an annulment application succeeded only in part, it was considered that it would be appropriate, in the circumstances and in the light of previous annulment decisions, for the costs of the proceedings to be borne equally by the parties,202 and for each party to bear its own litigation costs.203\n\n*Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 424.\n\n*Enron* Annulment Decision \u00b6 425.\n\n285.\n\nIn the present case, applications for partial annulment of the Award were made by both parties. Each party has been entirely unsuccessful in their applications, and no part of the Award has been annulled. Whilst inclined to the approach noted in paragraph 283 above, in these circumstances the Committee concludes that it is appropriate, in the light of previous annulment decisions, for the costs of the proceedings to be borne equally by the parties, and for each party to bear its own litigation costs.\n\n286.\n\nDuring these annulment proceedings, the Committee ordered pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(1) and (2) that the stay of enforcement of the Award will continue in effect for the duration of these annulment proceedings.204 Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3) that stay automatically terminates on the date on which the present decision on the respective applications for annulment of Continental and Argentina is rendered.\n\nSee the Committee\u2019s \"Decision on Argentina\u2019s Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award\" of October 23, 2009.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n**For the reasons given above, the Committee:**\n\n**(1) dismisses in its entirety the application for annulment of Continental Casualty Company;**\n\n**(2) dismisses in its entirety the application for partial annulment of the Argentine Republic;**\n\n**(3) decides that each Party shall bear one half of the costs incurred by the Centre in connection with these annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee;**\n\n**(4) decides that each Party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to these annulment proceedings, including its costs of legal representation;**\n\n**(5) decides pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3) that the stay of enforcement of the Award ordered by the Committee in its decision of 23 October 2009 is terminated.**"}]}
