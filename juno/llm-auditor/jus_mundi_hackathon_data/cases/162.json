On behalf of the Tribunal, the PCA provided the Claimants with a copy of the Respondent\u2019s Letters, invited them to respond, and informed the Parties that the Tribunal considered the content of the Respondent\u2019s Letters to constitute an objection by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the admissibility of the Claimants\u2019 claims under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Draft Terms of Appointment and draft Rules of Procedure were also circulated to the Parties for their comments.\n\n15.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n16.\n\nOn 18 August 2015, having considered the Claimants\u2019 comments and sought the Respondent\u2019s views but received no reply, the Tribunal issued the document previously circulated under the title \"Terms of Appointment\" as its **Procedural Order No. 1,** providing, *inter alia,* that the International Bureau of the PCA would act as registry in these proceedings.

Having sought the Parties\u2019 views, the Tribunal denied Ukraine\u2019s request on 7 July 2016.\n\n**E.** **Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and Post-Hearing Events**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility was held from 12 to 14 July 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n49.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal sets out in outline the facts giving rise to this arbitration, insofar as they are material for purposes of this Interim Award on jurisdiction and admissibility. Where relevant to this Interim Award, the facts are discussed in greater detail in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis below.\n\n50.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, it is useful to give a brief explanation of terminology. In this Interim Award, **\"Crimea\"** refers to the region known as the \"Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" under the Ukrainian Constitution and the \"Republic of Crimea\" under the Russian Constitution. **\"Sevastopol\"** or the **\"the city of Sevastopol\"** refers to the city known as the \"city of special status Sevastopol\" under the Ukrainian Constitution and the \"city of federal significance Sevastopol\" under the Russian Constitution. Crimea and Sevastopol together are referred as the **\"Crimean Peninsula.\"** Save where otherwise indicated, the Tribunal uses the translations of original Russian and Ukrainian documents provided by the Claimants. The Tribunal\u2019s use of the Claimants\u2019 translations should not be taken as an acceptance of the correctness of these translations, even if the Tribunal has raised a number of material issues arising from these translations in the course of the proceedings and addressed them as necessary in this Interim Award.\n\n**A.** **The Claimants and their Business in the Crimean Peninsula**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 1 above, the first claimant, PrivatBank, is a commercial banking institution registered in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine.4 It operates under a banking license from the National Bank of Ukraine.5 It was founded in 1992 and established its \"Crimean Division\" and \"Sevastopol Division\" in 1994.6 [REDACTED]\n\nExtract of Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations of Ukraine, 1 April 2016 (CE-187).\n\nNational Bank of Ukraine Banking License No. 22 issued to Public Joint Stock Company Commercial Bank PrivatBank, 5 October 2011 (CE-16).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n52.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n53.\n\nThe second claimant, Finilon, was first registered as a company on 1 October 2013 and as a financial institution (other than a bank) on 24 October 2013.9 [REDACTED]\n\nExtract of Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations of Ukraine, 1 April 2016 (CE-188); Finilon Extract from the Financial Institutions Register [REDACTED]\n\n54.\n\nShortly before the issuance of this Interim Award, the Tribunal learned from public sources that PrivatBank was nationalized by Ukraine in December 2016.12 This development was not brought to the attention of the Tribunal by the Claimants and the Parties have not briefed the Tribunal on any potential impact it may have on the Claimants\u2019 capacity to bring their claims. For this reason, insofar as this development may be relevant to any issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, its consideration is reserved for the next stage of these proceedings.13\n\nUkraine Government Press Release, \"PJSC PrivatBank Transferred to 100% State Ownership,\" 18 December 2016 (in Ukrainian), http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/uk/publish/article?art\\_id=249597705&cat\\_id= 244276429, website last visited on 24 February 2017; World Bank Press Release, \"Statement Regarding the Nationalization of PrivatBank,\" 19 December 2016, http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/12/19/regarding-the-nationalization-of-privatbank, website last visited on 24 February 2017.\n\n*See also* para. 199 below.\n\n**B.** **The Crimean Events of February-March** **2014**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThese proceedings arise, in the first instance, out of the events in the Crimean Peninsula in February-March 2014. The Claimants submitted a detailed factual narrative of these events as part of their pleadings. The Tribunal has not, however, simply accepted the Claimants\u2019 account. The following summary of events, while drawing on the Claimants\u2019 submissions, as appropriate, also draws upon publicly available information of which the Tribunal considers that it can properly take judicial notice.\n\n56.\n\nAs widely reported in the media, in late November 2013, then President of Ukraine Mr. Viktor Yanukovych suspended negotiations of a political and economic association agreement with the European Union in favour of developing closer ties with the Russian Federation, sparking anti-government protests in Kiev14 that culminated in violent clashes on 18-21 February 2014.15 On 22 February 2014, President Yanukovych left Kiev and was removed from office by the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament), replaced on 23 February by the speaker of the Rada, Mr. Oleksandr Turchinov, as interim President.16\n\nSee *e.g.* New York Times, *Facing Russian Threat, Ukraine Halts Plans for Deals with E.U.,* 21 November 2013, http://www.nytimes.com/2013/l 1/22/world/europe/ukraine-refuses-to-ffee-ex-leader-raising-concems-over-eu-talks.html, website last visited on 24 February 2017; New York Times, *Thousands protest Ukraine's rejection of trade pacts,* 24 November 2013, http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/world/europe/thousands-of-ukrainians-protest-scrapping-of-trade-pact-with-eu.html?\\_r=0, website last visited on 24 February 2017; Reuters, *Ukraine pro-Europe protesters hold first big rally of 2014,* 12 January 2014, http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ukraine-idUKBREA0B0KE20140112, website last visited on 24 February 2017; TASS, *Ukrainian Government Put on Hold the Preparation for Signature of the Association Agreement with the EU,* 21 November 2013, http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/778055 (in Russian), website last visited on 24 February 2017.\n\n*See e.g.* TASS, *The Situation in Ukraine.

The Respondent\u2019s Letters are reproduced in full at paragraphs 11-12 above.\n\n**VI. THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION OF UKRAINE**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nIn its Non-Disputing Party Submission, Ukraine states that the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol continue to form \"an inseparable part\" of Ukraine.144 In consequence, \"any treaty right or obligation pertaining to sovereignty\" over the Crimean Peninsula, bilateral or multilateral, remains in effect.145 At the same time, Ukraine acknowledges the \"practical reality of the Russian occupation and, accordingly, its current exercise of jurisdiction and effective control\" over Crimea.146 Accordingly, Ukraine notes, it \"is presently unable to fulfill its obligations in respect of Crimea.\" In its stead, the Russian Federation has \"assumed international obligations in its administration of Crimea,\" including obligations pertaining to Crimea-based investments under the Treaty.147\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 2.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 43.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 45.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 45.\n\n130.\n\nUkraine therefore argues in its Non-Disputing Party Submission that the Treaty is applicable to investments made by Ukrainian nationals in Crimea. In particular, Ukraine takes the position that neither the Treaty\u2019s use of the term \"territory\", nor any temporal nexus derived from the treaty text operate to exclude the Treaty\u2019s application to Ukrainian investors and investments in the Crimean Peninsula. These arguments are detailed below in turn.\n\n**A.** **Territorial Application of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nAccording to Ukraine, the territorial scope of the Treaty\u2019s application extends to all \"territory\" over which the Respondent exercises effective control, consistent with: (i) the ordinary meaning of \"territory\" interpreted in the light of the Treaty\u2019s context, object and purpose; (ii) other \"relevant rules of international law,\" including Article 29 of the VCLT; and (iii) the general principle of good faith.\n\n132.\n\nUkraine first cites a number of dictionary references in which the term \"territory\" is used broadly; it notes, for instance, definitions \"refer[ring] to all lands 'under the jurisdiction of a ruler or state,\u2019\" including those under the effective jurisdiction or control of an occupying power.148 Ukraine then suggests that \"the 'common[] use[]\u2019 of the term in international law\" also supports a broad interpretation,149 which is further bolstered by, and \"specifically recognized\" in, Article 29 of the VCLT, the latter establishing a \"default rule that a treaty applies to the 'entire territory\u2019 of the signatory.\"150\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 7.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 8.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 9, referring to Karl Doehring, \"The Scope of the Territorial Application of Treaties: Comments on Art. 25 of the ILC\u2019s 1966 Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties,\" 27 Heidelberg J. Int\u2019l L. 483, 488-489 (1967) (CA-101).\n\n133.\n\nUkraine submits, in this connection, that the term \"territory\" is worded broadly in the Treaty itself. In Ukraine\u2019s view, the word \"territory\" in the Treaty neither \"entail[s] the concept of a State\u2019s sovereignty, [n]or even lawful rule.\"151 Despite \"available models for defining 'territory\u2019 in a more restrictive way,\" *i.e.,* so as to confine the application of a treaty to areas over which the Contracting States exercise sovereignty, the Contracting States agreed to a \"non-restrictive approach\" in the Treaty.152 Ukraine adds:\n\nMany of Ukraine\u2019s bilateral investment treaties do specifically define territory with reference to \"sovereignty,\" but Ukraine deferred to Russia\u2019s preferred practice of leaving references to territory open-ended. A restrictive definition should not be imposed where the parties to an investment treaty could have chosen to adopt one, but did not.153\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 7.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 13-14.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 14.\n\n134.\n\nUkraine, moreover, considers that this interpretation is supported by the context of the Treaty, particularly by other provisions incorporating references to \"territory\". In this regard, Ukraine notes that the term \"territory\" in the Treaty is \"not limited to sovereign territory,\" but is used throughout the Treaty in ways that demonstrate \"a practical focus on effective control,\" rather than on sovereignty as the appropriate interpretive framework.154 Examples of such usage are found in Articles 2(1), 3(1) and 4 of the Treaty, relating to the encouragement, favorable treatment of, and guarantee of \"openness and availability\" of legislation with respect to, investments on the Contracting States\u2019 territories.155 Because these provisions require \"affirmative measures\" on the territory of the Contracting States, the term \"territory\" must be understood to \"bind[] the party that is in a position effectively to carry out those obligations.\"156 An alternative reading, Ukraine suggests, would \"leave gaps in the Treaty\u2019s coverage\" in a manner \"not contemplated\" by the Contracting States.157\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 16-17.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 16.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 17.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 17.\n\n135.\n\nSimilarly, Ukraine submits that the object and purpose of the Treaty supports the broad interpretation of \"territory\" which it advocates. Specifically, Ukraine suggests that the objective of the Treaty, to \"enhanc[e] the legal framework under which foreign investment operates,\" is furthered by construing the Treaty to apply to \"protect Ukrainian investors in Crimea under the Russian occupation.\"158 In its view, the Tribunal\u2019s \"task... is to construe the Treaty\u2019s geographic application\" in a manner that \"furthers the Treaty\u2019s investment protection and rule of law objectives.\"159 Any other interpretation would create \"a legal black hole for investment protection.\"160\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 22.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 23.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 24.\n\n136.\n\nIn addition to undermining the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose, Ukraine adds, the consequent \"vacuum\" would also stand in tension with \"relevant rules of international law applicable between Ukraine\" and the Respondent, including: (i) the Russian Federation\u2019s obligations under the customary law on belligerent occupation, including obligations to \"respect property rights in Crimea, a territory it occupies\";161 and (ii) human rights treaties including the European Convention on Human Rights.162 With respect to the latter, Ukraine invokes arguments similar to those advanced by the Claimants in respect of \"the application of rights-protective treaties to occupied territories,\" with particular reference to the ICJ\u2019s *Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa))163*\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 26.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 27.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 28-29.\n\n137.\n\nJudicial and State practice confirms this understanding, Ukraine suggests.164 It points to State practice recognizing the application of treaties to territories considered to be unlawfully occupied, citing practice relating to the Baltic States,165 including the decision, under the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, to \"specifically define[] the USSR\u2019s 'territory\u2019 to include\" the Baltic States despite those territories having been viewed as unlawfully occupied.166\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 10.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 11-12.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 9.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, in Ukraine\u2019s view, a \"good faith reading\" of the Treaty requires \"territory\" to be interpreted so as to include \"occupied territory that the Russian Federation administers,\" including the Crimean Peninsula.167 Ukraine explains:\n\n[T]he Russian Federation cannot invade, occupy, and claim sovereignty over Crimea, yet refuse to be bound by its treaty obligations within that territory. The Russian Federation has unlawfully occupied Crimea by force ... [and] has informed the Tribunal of its view that Crimea \"forms an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation.\" Yet it simultaneously maintains that its actions in Crimea \"cannot be regulated by the [Treaty].\" A restrictive interpretation of the term \"territory\" in the Treaty that would allow Russia to profit from this inconsistency is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle of good faith interpretation.168\n\nIn Ukraine\u2019s view, while \"illegitimate and invalid\", the Respondent\u2019s claims to have lawfully integrated the Crimean Peninsula into the territory of the Russian Federation \"nonetheless carry legal consequences.\"169 In other words, by \"claiming the benefits of sovereignty\" over Crimea, the Russian Federation must also \"accept the obligations that follow,\" including respect for treaty rights of Ukrainian investors in Crimea.170 Ukraine accordingly submits that well-established principles of good faith or \"consistency\" legally bind the Russian Federation to guarantee Treaty protection to investors in the Claimants\u2019 position, even as the annexation itself remains unlawful.171\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 18.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 20.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 34.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 34.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, paras. 37-41.\n\n**B.** **Temporal Application of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nUkraine submits that Ukrainian investors may avail themselves of the Treaty\u2019s protections \"regardless of when such investors initially commenced their investment.\"172\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 30. *See also* paras. 34-41.\n\n140.\n\nUkraine first observes that Article 1(1) of the Treaty \"uses the present tense\" to define investments covered under the Treaty173\u2014implying, in effect, that the Contracting States did not contemplate requiring a particular temporal nexus as of the moment when the investment was first \"made\". Ukraine additionally argues that Article 12, which confirms that the Treaty applies to any qualifying investments made after 1 January 1992, evinces a \"clear intent\" on the part of the Contracting States to \"maximize the temporal application of the Treaty\" and to \"cover investments that were not protected by the Treaty at the time they were initiated.\"174 It explains:\n\nLike most bilateral investment treaties of its era ... [the Treaty] protect[s] \"both 'old\u2019 and 'new\u2019 investments\" as part of a general commitment ... even when the investment was initiated without any expectation of treaty protection. It is a widely-held view that application of an investment treaty to pre-existing investments is generally presumed even where the agreement is silent on the question of temporal application. Under the Treaty, so long as the investment was made after January 1, 1992, it is irrelevant whether the Treaty applied at that time.175\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 31.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 32.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 32, referring to Rudolf Dolzer & Margrete Stevens, BILATERAL Investment Treaties (Martinus Nijhoff, 1995) (CA-187), pp. 45-46.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONSIDERATIONS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **Preliminary Considerations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n141.\n\nThis Interim Award addresses the threshold jurisdictional issue of the application of the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in respect of the Crimean Peninsula in the period from February 2014. It also addresses the issues of: (i) the existence of a \"dispute\" between the Parties arising in connection with the Claimants\u2019 claimed investments; (ii) whether the Claimants\u2019 claimed investments are protected under the Treaty notwithstanding the fact that PrivatBank made its investments before the events of February-March 2014; and (iii) whether any notice or negotiation requirements of Article 9 of the Treaty have been satisfied.\n\n142.\n\nAny and all other issues of jurisdiction and admissibility that may warrant consideration and decision are joined to the merits of the proceedings. In particular, the Tribunal defers to the next phase of the proceedings consideration of the issues of whether: (i) the Claimants are \"investors\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, including in the light of PrivatBank\u2019s nationalization by Ukraine; (ii) the Claimants\u2019 \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1) of the Treaty; and (iii) the dispute between the Parties arose \"in connection with\" those investments.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that its jurisdiction derives from the Treaty alone. It is not an inter-State tribunal of general jurisdiction. While the Tribunal has an incidental jurisdiction under the Treaty to address ancillary issues that are properly engaged by the proceedings of which it is seised and which are necessary for its decisions, its jurisdiction does not in principle go beyond that conferred upon it by the Contracting Parties under Article 9 of the Treaty. Given the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal emphasises these limits on its jurisdiction, which it considers to be axiomatic.\n\n144.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that this Interim Award does not reach any view on the legality or illegality under international law of the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation or on the sovereignty claims of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in respect of the Crimean Peninsula. None of the findings contained in this Interim Award are intended to take any position on such matters.\n\n**2. Applicable law and burden of proof**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs just noted, the Tribunal\u2019s competence derives from the Treaty. The Treaty defines the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as well as the rights and obligations of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty and of investors of a Contracting Party. The Treaty is thus the primary source of law and of legal obligation that the Tribunal is called upon to apply.\n\n146.\n\nThe Treaty does not, however, address issues of applicable law more widely or set out any rules concerning its interpretation and application. As regards interpretation, the Tribunal will be guided by the rules on interpretation of treaties set out in Articles 31-33 of the VCLT, to which both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are party and have been, respectively, since April and May 1986. Insofar as may be material, the Tribunal observes that it is commonly accepted that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflect customary international law. Although the same attention has not been given to the issue of the customary international law status of the principles expressed in Article 33 of the VCLT, the Tribunal considers that these principles can also safely be said to reflect customary international law.\n\n147.\n\nArticle 9(1) of the Treaty defines the scope of the disputes that may be submitted to an arbitral tribunal constituted under its terms, namely those \"arising in connection with investments, including disputes concerning the amount, terms, and payment procedures of the compensation provided for by Article 5 hereof, or the payment transfer procedures provided for by Article 7 hereof.\" This language will be controlling of the question of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as regards the application of the Treaty. The interpretation and application of this provision is addressed further below.\n\n148.\n\nWithout prejudice to, and reaffirming, the preceding, it nonetheless bears emphasis that the Treaty does not stand in isolation. The Treaty and the rights and obligations that it creates exist within the framework of general international law. The Tribunal will therefore have regard as appropriate to other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties, either because they are incorporated into the Treaty by reference or as may be necessary to address incidental questions regarding the interpretation and application of the Treaty.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that it may equally be necessary and appropriate for it to have regard to relevant and applicable national law insofar as the provisions of the Treaty direct the Tribunal to do so or where questions regarding the interpretation and application of the Treaty can only be addressed by reference to national law.\n\n150.\n\nAs regards the burden of proof, Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied upon to support its claim or defence. Article 25(6) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered. Without prejudice to any given issue, the Tribunal observes that it is uncontroversial in international proceedings such as this, at least at a level of generality, that the burden of proof rests in the first instance with the party advancing a proposition. A claimant cannot prevail without meeting a minimum standard of proof, even if the burden shifts to the respondent at some point to establish that its conduct was permitted under the treaty or under international law more generally. The issues of the burden of proof in jurisdictional proceedings, as well as the consequences that flow from the non-participation of the Respondent in these proceedings, are addressed further below.\n\n151.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the present proceedings are jurisdictional proceedings. As a result, a prior question that needs to be considered, before looking to the particular circumstances of the present case, is the date on which the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is to be assessed. It is settled law that the critical date for such evaluation is the date on which the proceedings were commenced.176 This does not, however, preclude a tribunal properly seised of a case from taking account of situations and facts arising prior to the date of the institution of the proceedings in its evaluation of the merits of the claims before it.177\n\n*See e.g.* *Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. United States of America),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 27 February 1998, ICJ Reports 1998, paras. 36-37, 42-43; *Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo* v. *Belgium),* Judgment of 14 February 2002, ICJ Reports 2002, para. 26. *See also* Obligations Concerning Negotiations Relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands v.

United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award of 11 October 2002; *Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA)* v. *The Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, Interim Award of 1 December 2008.\n\n**3. The Respondent\u2019s non-participation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\n[REDACTED]178 Since this correspondence, the Russian Federation has not participated in these proceedings in any way.\n\nThe full text of this correspondence is reproduced at paragraphs 11-12 above.\n\n153.\n\nArticle 28 of the UNCITRAL Rules addresses some of the consequences of default by a party. Article 28(1) provides that \"[i]f, within the period of time fixed by the arbitral tribunal, the respondent has failed to communicate his statement of defence without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings continue.\" Article 28(2) provides that, \"[i]f one of the parties, duly notified under these Rules, fails to appear at a hearing, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration.\" Pursuant to these provisions, after affording the Parties an opportunity to present their views, the Tribunal ordered that these proceedings continue notwithstanding the Respondent\u2019s failure to file a statement of defence within the relevant time period, and proceeded with the arbitration despite the Respondent\u2019s failure to participate in the hearing.\n\n154.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal has taken every measure to safeguard the Russian Federation\u2019s procedural rights. The Tribunal has, *inter alia:* (i) ensured that all communications and materials submitted in the proceedings have been promptly delivered, both electronically and physically, to the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Netherlands in The Hague; (ii) afforded the Russian Federation, as with the Claimants, an opportunity to express its views on each proposed procedural step throughout the proceedings; (iii) granted the Russian Federation equal and sufficient time to submit responses to the written pleadings and other communications from the Claimants; (iv) invited the Russian Federation, as with the Claimants, to comment on the proposed candidates and terms of reference for the independent experts on Russian and Ukrainian law subsequently appointed by the Tribunal; (v) provided the Russian Federation adequate notice of the hearing in the case; (vi) provided the Russian Federation, in a timely manner, with the transcripts and all other documents submitted in the course of the hearing; and (vii) provided an opportunity for, and invited, the Russian Federation to comment on anything said during the hearing. Thus, at every stage, the Tribunal has given the Russian Federation the opportunity to participate in these proceedings. Moreover, as will be seen from what follows, this Interim Award neither disposes of all issues of jurisdiction and admissibility nor addresses any issue of the merits. It therefore remains open to the Russian Federation to participate in these proceedings going forward.\n\n155.\n\nArticle 28(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that, \"[i]f one of the parties, duly invited to produce documentary evidence, fails to do so within the established period of time, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence before it.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, in a case such as this with a non-participating party, the Tribunal must decide the claim of the participating party in the light of all the available information, rather than accepting the participating party\u2019s case by default. Further, the Tribunal must, as a preliminary step, also satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction to decide the claim put before it. The *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* doctrine, the power of a tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction, has a necessary corollary, namely, that a tribunal must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in respect of the matter of which it would be seised by a claimant.\n\n156.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this proposed approach. As it informed the Parties by letter from the PCA dated 19 March 2016, the Tribunal considers that it is required to determine its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims whether or not objections have been raised by the Respondent.180 The Tribunal does not accept [REDACTED] that its power to do so is limited by Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules.181 While this provision addresses the treatment of pleas as to the jurisdiction of a tribunal, it is silent regarding the tribunal\u2019s power to consider its jurisdiction *proprio motu.*\n\n*See* *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran),* Judgment of 24 May 1980, 1980 ICJ Reports 3, para. 33 (\"... in accordance with its settled jurisprudence, the Court, in applying Article 53 of its Statute, must first take up, *proprio motu,* any preliminary question, whether of admissibility or of jurisdiction, that appears from the information before it to arise in the case and the decision of which might constitute a bar to any further examination of the merits of the Applicant\u2019s case.\"); *South China Sea Arbitration (Philippines* v. *China),* PCA Case No. 2013-19, UNCLOS, Award on Jurisdiction of 29 October 2015, para. 123 (\"... the Tribunal also stated that it would not confine itself to addressing only those issues raised in China\u2019s Position Paper and that, in line with its duty to satisfy itself of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal would consider other issues that might potentially pose an obstacle to the continuation of these proceedings.\"); *Spence International Investments et al.* v. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award of 25 October 2016, para. 225 (\"... the Tribunal notes that an assessment of whether jurisdiction exists in respect of a given dispute is required of all tribunals, whether a party raises the issue or not. It is not in the systemic interests of the effective administration of international justice for a tribunal to adjudicate on matters over which it does not have jurisdiction, whether the parties would wish this to be the case or not. This appreciation does not turn only on issues of consent, although this may be important. It also turns importantly on *ratione materiae, ratione temporis* and *ratione personae* considerations, and is a feature of most courts and tribunals, including in the domestic sphere.\")\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n158.\n\nSuch an argument also ignores the burden of proof. Burden of proof requirements and the Tribunal\u2019s responsibilities as regards the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence are not altered by the absence of one of the Parties to the dispute or a failure to raise jurisdictional objections.182 In respect of arbitral jurisdiction, this means that a State\u2019s consent to arbitration, and the jurisdiction of a tribunal, cannot simply be presumed.183 It is for the claimant in any given case to establish the respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration. Where a claimant fails to meet this burden to the satisfaction of the tribunal, jurisdiction will be justifiably declined, whether or not a jurisdictional objection is expressly raised by the respondent.184 It is also for the Tribunal to determine, *proprio motu,* if necessary, whether the conditions necessary to found it jurisdiction, and the admissibility of the claims under the Treaty, are met.\n\n*See* Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America)*,* Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, 1984 ICJ Reports 14, para. 29.\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, Award of 8 December 2008, paras. 69-71.\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services* v. *Argentine Republic,* PCA Case No. 2010-09, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction of 10 February 2012, para. 280; *Daimler Financial Services AG* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award of 22 August 2012, para. 175. *See also* *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda)*, Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment of 3 February 2006, 2006 ICJ Reports 6, paras. 91-93; Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France*),* Judgment of 4 June 2008, 2008 ICJ Reports 177, para. 62.\n\n159.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal must also take care to avoid prejudice to the Claimants from the non-participation of the Respondent. While the non-participation of the Respondent unavoidably gives rise to evidential and related issues for the proceedings, the Tribunal must in the first instance proceed on the basis that, absent a reason to doubt this, the Claimants\u2019 evidence is presented in good faith and that, subject to enquiry and scrutiny by the Tribunal going to admissibility, relevance and materiality, it can properly be accorded appropriate weight.\n\n160.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that it has not simply accepted without more the allegations, arguments and evidence of the Claimants. On the contrary, it has taken every available opportunity and measure to test the Claimants\u2019 case and to ensure that it has the information necessary to reach the findings contained in this Interim Award. These measures include: (i) putting a detailed series of 25 written questions to the Parties in advance of the hearing on matters of both fact and law that the Tribunal considered not to have been sufficiently canvassed in the Claimants\u2019 submissions, and (ii) the appointment of independent experts to report on issues of Ukrainian and Russian law, which had previously been addressed only by experts appointed by the Claimants. Additionally, during the hearing, the Tribunal put questions both to the Claimants\u2019 and the Tribunal-appointed experts. The Tribunal also put detailed questions to the Claimants\u2019 counsel in the course of the hearing and invited both Parties to address these questions in post-hearing briefs\u2014the Respondent having the opportunity to do so on the basis of the transcripts of the hearing. Having tested the evidence presented by the Claimants, the Tribunal is in a position to decide to what extent such evidence may be relied upon and the weight to be accorded to it.\n\n161.\n\nBy way of example, while, as will be seen below, the Tribunal has had regard to the expert opinion of the Claimants\u2019 Ukrainian law expert, [REDACTED] it has done so only after careful consideration and only on the basis that [REDACTED] evidence was fully supported by the Tribunal-appointed independent expert on Ukrainian law, Dr. Tsirat, who, having reviewed both [REDACTED]expert opinion and the underlying documents on which it was based, indicated her agreement with [REDACTED] evidence.185\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**B.** **Application of the Treaty to the Crimean Peninsula**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the principal issue of concern in this phase of the proceedings, namely, the application of the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in respect of the Crimean Peninsula in the period from February 2014 and, more specifically, whether (as a general matter) the Treaty can be invoked by Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula against the Russian Federation.\n\n163.\n\nAs an initial matter, having regard to the factual developments described in paragraphs 55-72 above, the Tribunal considers that the reality which it is required to address is that of the change in the character of the Crimean Peninsula from part of Ukraine to a territory for the international relations of which the Russian Federation has become responsible. The Tribunal does not consider that the brief interregnum from 17 March 2014 to 18 or 21 March 2014, as may be relevant, in which it might be said that an independent Republic of Crimea came into existence, is relevant or controlling for the purposes of the analysis that follows. It is evident from the developments described above that the 17 March 2014 proclamation of independence by the Supreme Council of Crimea was simply a stepping stone to the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation that followed swiftly thereafter. Indeed, this is readily apparent from the 6 March 2014 resolution of the Supreme Council of Crimea, in which it resolved \"to join the Russian Federation as a member territory of the Russian Federation.\"186\n\n*See* paragraph 61 above.\n\n164.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that this case is *sui generis,* the factual circumstances presented by it not fitting readily into any settled matrix of legal analysis. The geographic scope of application of the Treaty has not changed as a result of the events of February-March 2014 in the Crimean Peninsula. Save that the view might be taken\u2014which the Tribunal emphasises it does not adopt\u2014 that the events of February-March 2014 led to a legal vacuum as regards the Crimean Peninsula in respect of the application of the Treaty, the Treaty continues to apply to investments in the territories of the Russian Federation and of Ukraine. The issue that arises, consequent upon the events in question, is to which Contracting Party is the Treaty opposable in respect of claims as regards claimed investments in the Crimean Peninsula. In other words, the issue is which Contracting Party is responsible under the Treaty to address claims of investors of the other Contracting Party in respect of investments in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n166.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this appreciation is material, as the starting point of any analysis must properly be that the juridical space of the Treaty has not changed. The Treaty applied to investments in the Crimean Peninsula before the events of February-March 2014. There is no suggestion in the submissions of either Party, or of Ukraine in its Non-Disputing Party Submission, that the Treaty ceased to apply to the Crimean Peninsula consequent upon the events in question. [REDACTED] [REDACTED] theTribunal considers such a claim to be both unsubstantiated and unsustainable. Neither Contracting Party has taken any step, following the events of February-March 2014, to disavow, denounce, suspend or terminate the Treaty or to otherwise assert the view that the Treaty no longer applies to investments in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n167.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls the cardinal rule of international law concerning the observance of treaties, namely, *pacta sunt servanda, i.e.,* to quote the language of Article 26 of the VCLT (by which the Contacting Parties to the Treaty are bound, quite apart from the avowedly customary international law character of the rule) that \"[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\" In approaching its task, the Tribunal thus takes as its lodestar the principle that a treaty cannot simply be denuded of effect and that, absent dispositive grounds to the contrary, it remains binding on its parties. As a starting proposition, therefore, the Tribunal cannot presume that the Treaty does not apply to conduct occurring in the geographic space of the Crimean Peninsula in the period in question as that, without more, would be to denude the Treaty of effect and relieve the Contracting Parties of their obligation to perform the Treaty in good faith.\n\n168.\n\nAs a result, the only questions are who may properly be a claimant under the Treaty and against which Contracting Party, assuming *arguendo* that the other conditions under the Treaty for the prosecution of a claim are satisfied. The issue of whether the Treaty \"regulates\" the property that is the subject of the claims in these proceedings [REDACTED] is addressed further in paragraphs 208-239 below.\n\n169.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants\u2019 contentions on these points. As an initial matter, while the Tribunal accepts that the rule expressed in Article 15 of the VCST is properly characterised as the \"moving treaty frontiers rule\", and that the rule as so expressed reflects customary international law, the Tribunal does not consider that this rule is properly described by reference to Article 29 of the VCLT. While the rules expressed in Article 29 of the VCLT and Article 15 of the VCST are related, they are distinct. Article 29 states a rule of general application concerning the territorial scope of treaties. In contrast, the rule expressed in Article 15 of the VCST addresses a narrow subset of circumstances, arising on a succession in respect of part of territory, engaging questions of the change of the territorial scope of application of treaties. Notwithstanding their connection, the two rules ought not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, to be conflated.\n\n171.\n\nMore importantly, the Tribunal does not accept [REDACTED] the appropriate analysis in this case turns on questions of State succession and the application of the moving treaty frontiers rule. The circumstances engaged by this case do not fall within the scope of the rule expressed in Article 15 of the VCST, as a careful reading of this provision discloses. Leaving aside any issue as might be engaged by the limitation expressed in Article 6 of the VCST, the rule expressed in Article 15 of the VCST does not contemplate a situation in which the treaty in question is a bilateral treaty that applies between the \"predecessor State\" and the \"successor State\" as regards, *inter alia,* the territory in respect of which international responsibility is said to have changed.191 Rather, Article 15 addresses circumstances in which treaties of the predecessor State cease to apply in respect of a given territory and, simultaneously, the territorial scope of treaties of the successor State expands to that same territory. The treaty partners of the predecessor State are not necessarily identical with the treaty partners of the successor State. The same goes for the subject-matters of the treaties of the predecessor State and the successor State.192 In the present case, however, the issue is not the replacement, in the territory of the Crimean Peninsula, of Ukrainian treaties with third States by treaties of the Russian Federation with third States, but rather the continued application, after the events of February-March 2014, of the Treaty between Ukraine and the Russian Federation to the territory of the Crimean Peninsula. Especially given that neither Contracting Party to the Treaty has expressed any views about the non-application of the Treaty to the Crimean Peninsula, the Treaty will, and must, continue to apply to the territory of the Crimean Peninsula from the perspective of *both* Contracting Parties.\n\n\"Draft Articles on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties with commentaries\" in Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1974, vol. 2, part I (New York: UN, 1975)(A/CN.4/SER.A/1974/Add.l (Part 1)), p. 177 (\"... the question of succession concerns the triangular position of the predecessor State, the successor State and the other State which concluded the treaty with the predecessor State.\").\n\n*See* \"Draft Articles on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties with commentaries\" in Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1974, vol. 2, part I (New York: UN, 1975)(A/CN.4/SER.A/1974/Add.l (Part 1)), p. 208: \"[In Article 15] the moving treaty-frontiers rule appears in pure form.... Shortly stated, the moving treaty-frontiers rule means that, on a territory undergoing a change of sovereignty, it [the territory] passes automatically out of the treaty regime of the predecessor sovereign into the treaty regime of the successor sovereign.\" The reference to \"regimes\" clearly shows that Article 15 concerns situations other than that of two States directly involved in the transfer of territory between them.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not agree with [REDACTED] that the iteration of the moving treaty frontiers rule under customary international law is in some manner broader than the iteration of the rule in Article 15 of the VCST and in terms that avail the Claimants. The Tribunal can find nothing in the commentary of the International Law Commission, in judicial or scholarly comments, or elsewhere, to sustain such a contention.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly does not consider that an analysis of the circumstances presented by this case predicated on the moving treaty frontiers rule is either correct or useful. As already noted, the circumstances presented by this case are *sui generis.* The juridical space of the Treaty has not changed with the events in question. The question, for purposes of determining the jurisdiction of a tribunal established pursuant to Article 9 of the Treaty, is which investors may avail themselves of the protections of the Treaty and against which Contracting Party.\n\n174.\n\nWithout prejudice to the preceding, the Tribunal takes some guidance from the law on State succession for purposes of its analysis, namely, that the appropriate test for purposes of ascertaining which State will have obligations under the Treaty in respect of investors of the other Contracting Party will be which State is responsible for the international relations of the territory in question.193 This approach also comports with the general, and uncontroversial, rule on the territorial scope of treaties expressed in Article 29 of the VCLT, namely, that \"[u]nless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.\" It is to this issue that the Tribunal now turns.\n\nIn its commentary to Article 2(b) of the VCST, the International Law Commission explained that the formula \"the replacement of one State by another in the responsibility for the international relations of territory\" is \"commonly used in State practice ... to cover in a neutral manner any specific case independently of the particular status of the territory.\" \"Draft Articles on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties with commentaries\" in Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1974, vol. 2, part I (New York: UN, 1975) (A/CN.4/SER.A/1974/Add.l (Part 1)), p. 175.\n\n175.\n\nTwo questions arise for consideration in the circumstances of this case. The first question is whether the Russian Federation can be said to have obligations under the Treaty toward Ukrainian investors in respect of their investments in the Crimean Peninsula in the period from or following February-March 2014, as a general matter. If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, a second question arises regarding the date from which the Russian Federation came to have obligations under the Treaty toward Ukrainian investors in respect of their investments in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n176.\n\nTurning to the first question, it is helpful to begin the analysis with an enquiry as to whether the Russian Federation can be said to be bound by the Treaty in respect of the Crimean Peninsula today or, for purposes more closely analytically related to the present case, at the point at which these proceedings were instituted on 13 April 2015.194 The utility of this enquiry is that it enables an assessment to be made as a matter of general proposition whether the Treaty is opposable to the Russian Federation in respect of the Crimean Peninsula detached from the particular circumstances of the case.\n\n*See* paragraph 151 above.\n\n177.\n\nAs will be evident from the factual recitation given above, the governmental institutions of the Russian Federation took various steps in March 2014 with respect to the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation as a matter of Russian law. On 19 March 2014, following various developments in the Crimean Peninsula in the preceding weeks outlined in paragraphs 55-67 above, culminating with the signing, on 18 March 2014, of the \"Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on the Acceptance of the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and the Formation of New Constituent Parts within the Russian Federation\" (the Incorporation Agreement), the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation held that the Incorporation Agreement was consistent with the Russian constitution and therefore that the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation was constitutional.\n\n178.\n\nTwo days later, on 21 March 2014, the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation (*i.e.*, the Russian Parliament) enacted a law ratifying the Incorporation Agreement195 and a constitutional law \"On Accepting the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and Establishing New Constitutional Entities in the Russian Federation: the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol\" (the Incorporation Law).196 Both laws were signed by President Putin on the same date, *i.e.,* 21 March 2014, and came into force on that date, President Putin\u2019s signature completing the formal constitutional requirements for the entry into force of the laws.\n\nFederal Law of the Russian Federation No. 36-FZ \"On Ratification of the [Incorporation Agreement],\" 21 March 2014(CE-49).\n\n21 March 2014, as amended 31 December 2014 (CE-47).\n\n179.\n\nArticle 1(3) of the Incorporation Law provided that \"[t]he Republic of Crimea [including Sevastopol] shall be deemed admitted to the Russian Federation as of the signing date of the [Incorporation Agreement].\"197 That is, under Russian law, the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation was made retroactive to 18 March 2014.\n\n21 March 2014, as amended 31 December 2014 (CE-47).\n\n180.\n\nThe unavoidable appreciation that follows from the preceding is that, by 21 March 2014, the Russian Federation had taken various constitutional steps, as a matter of Russian law, to incorporate the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation. This incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation as a matter of Russian law was, in parallel, complemented by settled Russian physical control over the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n181.\n\nUkraine, while contesting the claims of the Russian Federation to the Crimean Peninsula, and the legal effect, as a matter of international law, of the Incorporation Agreement and the Incorporation Law, has, in its Non-Disputing Party Submission in these proceedings, expressly acknowledged the practical reality of the Russian exercise of jurisdiction and effective control over the Crimean Peninsula, and that the Russian Federation has \"assumed international obligations in its administration of Crimea.\"198 In April and August 2014, Ukraine enacted legislation establishing a special regime for the Crimean Peninsula precisely to account for the fact of the Russian exercise of jurisdiction and effective control.199 Although this legislation refers to a \"temporary occupation\", an extensive period appears to be contemplated, as the law establishing the special economic regime for the Crimean Peninsula does so for ten years.200 According to Ukraine, the \"occupation\" of the Crimean Peninsula began on 20 February 2014.201\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, para. 45. *See also* paras. 2, 46.\n\nLaw of Ukraine No. 1207-VII \"On Guaranteeing Rights and Freedoms of Citizens and the Legal Regime in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine,\" 15 April 2014 ([REDACTED]; Law of Ukraine No. 1636-VII \"On Establishing Free Economic Zone 'Crimea\u2019 and Special Aspects of Conducting Economic Activity in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine,\" 12 August 2014([REDACTED].\n\nLaw of Ukraine No. 1636-VII \"On Establishing Free Economic Zone 'Crimea\u2019 and Special Aspects of Conducting Economic Activity in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine,\" 12 August 2014([REDACTED]), art. 2.1.\n\nLaw of Ukraine No. 1207-VII \"On Guaranteeing Rights and Freedoms of Citizens and the Legal Regime in the Temporarily Occupied Territory of Ukraine,\" 15 April 2014 ([REDACTED]), art. 1(2).\n\n182.\n\nWhat emerges from the preceding is that, while there is no concordance of views between the Contracting Parties to the Treaty about the status of the Crimean Peninsula as a matter of international law, there is an intersection of the positions of the Russian Federation and of Ukraine as regards Russian Federation jurisdiction and settled, long-term control over the Crimean Peninsula, translating into the assumption by the Russian Federation of the responsibility for the international relations of the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n183.\n\nAssessing these circumstances from the vantage point of the 13 April 2015 institution of these proceedings, or today, the Tribunal considers that it is beyond peradventure that the Treaty must be said to apply vis-\u00e0-vis the Russian Federation in respect of Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula at these points. Analytically, the test that the Tribunal considers emerges from the concept of State succession, namely which State must be said to be responsible for the international relations of the Crimean Peninsula, admits of only one answer, *i.e.,* the Russian Federation. Indeed, the point is not and could not sensibly be denied by the Russian Federation. Its correspondence to the Tribunal of 16 June 2015 states in clear terms that the Crimean Peninsula \"at the present time pursuant to the will of people forms an integral part of the territory of the Russian Federation.\"\n\n184.\n\nThis analysis and conclusion draws additional support from the rule stated in Article 29 of the VCLT. Without prejudice to any issue concerning the application of Article 73 of the VCLT in the circumstances of this case, it is axiomatic that \"[u]nless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.\"\n\n185.\n\nAlthough Article 1(4) of the Treaty contains a definition of the term \"territory\", it does not establish a different intention as to the territorial application of the Treaty. The term \"territory\" is first defined simply as \"the territory of the Russian Federation or the territory of Ukraine,\" thus without indicating any intention to define territory in a different manner to the ordinary meaning of that term in Article 29 of the VCLT. As for the phrase \"in accordance with international law\" in Article 1(4), the Tribunal considers that it only concerns the definition of the two States\u2019 exclusive economic zones and continental shelf, not the definition of \"territory\" as a whole. This reading is consistent with the ordinary meaning of this provision and is supported by the investment treaty practice of the Russian Federation.202\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that the term \"territory\" in the Treaty is used in accordance with the meaning of that term in Article 29 of the VCLT, and that the latter term has a wider meaning capable of encompassing territory for which a State has assumed the responsibility for international relations. 203[REDACTED] the Tribunal construes the term \"territory\" for purposes of the Treaty to include territory over which a State exercises settled jurisdiction or control and on behalf of which it has assumed responsibility for international relations.\n\nMark E. Villiger, Commentary on the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (Martinus Nijhoff, 2009) (CA-135), p. 392 (\"Recognition under international law of the State and its territory is not required.\"); Oliver Dorr and Kirsten Schmalenbach, VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE Law OF TREATIES: A Commentary (Springer, 2012) (CA-103), p. 497 (\"According to [Special Rapporteur, Sir Humphrey Waldock\u2019s] Commentary, States practice showed that in the absence of a territorial clause, treaties were applied to all metropolitan and non-metropolitan territories of a State. Therefore, he proposed to use the formula that 'a treaty applies with respect to all the territory or territories for which the parties are internationally responsible\u2019. The ILC preferred the expression 'its entire territory\u2019. However, this new wording was only chosen to avoid the association of the first term with the colonial clauses. The contents of both expressions were considered equivalent.\"). See also \"Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with commentaries\" in Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1966, vol. 2 (New York: UN, 1967)(A/CN.4/SER. A/1966/Add. 1), p. 213. The Tribunal notes the judgment of the European Court of Justice of 21 December 2016 in Council of the European Union v. Front Polisario (Case No. C-104/16 P). The Tribunal considers, in the light of the commentary of the International Law Commission and the observations of the commentators just noted, that the analysis of the European Court of Justice that places emphasis on \"the fullness of the powers granted to sovereign entities by international law\" (para. 95) is too narrow insofar as it appears to proceed on the basis that an appreciation of the sovereign status of the territory in question is necessary, contrary to the analysis of positive international law undertaken by the International Law Commission.\n\n187.\n\nAssessed at some remove from the hothouse of the events in issue in this case, the Tribunal cannot identify any reason to conclude that the Russian Federation cannot and should not be held to be bound by its formal conduct, as a matter of Russian law, incorporating the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation, together with its settled, long-term control over the Crimean Peninsula. Any different a view would ride roughshod over two settled, cornerstone provisions of the international law on the observance and application of treaties, namely, the principle of *pacta sunt servanda,* addressed in Article 26 of the VCLT, and the entire territory application rule, addressed in Article 29 of the VCLT. In circumstances in which neither the Russian Federation nor Ukraine has taken any step to disavow, denounce, suspend or terminate the Treaty, or to otherwise assert the view that the Treaty no longer applies to investments in the Crimean Peninsula, there is no basis to conclude that the Treaty does not today, or did not on 13 April 2015, bind the Russian Federation as regards conduct in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n188.\n\nGiven this assessment, the second question that arises is from what date must the Russian Federation be said to be bound by the Treaty as regards Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n189.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept either date proposed by the Claimants.\n\n191.\n\nAs regards the 27 February 2014, the Tribunal does not consider that the application of a BIT can be said to have been triggered by the presence of troops of one State on the territory of another, even if those troops are exercising effective *de facto* control over the territory in question. Soldiers do not carry BIT obligations in their backpacks. The application of a treaty such as that in issue in the present proceedings requires something more.204\n\nThe Tribunal is cognisant of the approach adopted by international human rights courts and human rights treaty monitoring bodies regarding the application, or extra-territorial application, of international human rights instruments, including in circumstances of armed conflict and military occupation. Even if there may be elements of coincidence between them, the Tribunal considers that BITs are not normative, standard-setting instruments analogous to multilateral human rights treaties that afford broad protections to an only lightly constrained class of right holders. The Tribunal does not, accordingly, consider that the human rights jurisprudence in question can be relied upon by a claimant under a BIT to found the application of that BIT in circumstances of military engagement that do not rise to the level of settled, effective control *(see* paragraph 192 below). In this regard, the Tribunal reaffirms its observation at paragraph 143 above that its jurisdiction is derived from the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine alone. It is not a tribunal of general jurisdiction.\n\n192.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, while physical control and political expressions of intent as regards the status of a territory may be relevant for purposes of this assessment, and will need to be weighed in the mix, the critical consideration is likely to be an appreciation of settled, long-term control over the territory in question by the State whose responsibility is invoked under the Treaty. Evidence of such settled, long-term control may come, *inter alia,* as in this case, both from legal steps taken by the State whose responsibility is invoked to formalise, and constitutionalise, its control, and by settled, long-term physical manifestations of control. The Tribunal observes that it is the very essence of BITs that they are intended to create and maintain a settled investment framework. Once established, that settled investment framework cannot be presumed to have been displaced in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary pointing to a new dispensation of a sustained character. The Tribunal draws on this appreciation for purposes of arriving at the test here expressed of settled, long-term control, the notion of \"settled\" control signalling a dispensation concerning which there is evidence of sustained character.\n\n193.\n\nHaving regard to these considerations, and to the evidence presented and available to it, the Tribunal considers that it cannot be said that the indicia of Russian Federation control over the Crimean Peninsula were such on 27 February 2014 as to give rise to obligations for the Russian Federation under the Treaty.\n\n194.\n\nThe question is then whether the 18 March 2014 effective incorporation date, as a matter of Russian law, is the critical date for purposes of the application of the Treaty vis-\u00e0-vis the Russian Federation as regards the Crimean Peninsula. While the Tribunal notes the retroactive application, as a matter of Russian law, of the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula in the Russian Federation, it considers that the relevant date, for purposes of the crystallisation of settled, long-term Russian Federation control over the Crimean Peninsula is properly 21 March 2014, the date on which the Incorporation Law was in fact enacted by the Parliament of the Russian Federation, was signed by President Putin, and entered into force. That the Incorporation Law applied, by its terms, retroactively, may be material as a matter of Russian law. As regards the crystallisation of Russian Federation settled, long-term control over the Crimean Peninsula, however, this, in the Tribunal\u2019s assessment, took place on 21 March 2014. As noted at paragraph 129 above, Ukraine also accepts that, by 21 March 2014 (and in fact from 20 February 2014) the Russian Federation had begun its exercise of \"jurisdiction and effective control\" over the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes and so finds that, on 21 March 2014, the Treaty became opposable to the Russian Federation as regards Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula. The Tribunal finds that, as of this date, the Crimean Peninsula is to be treated for purposes of the application of the provisions of the Treaty as part of \"the territory of the Russian Federation.\"\n\n**C.** **Application of the Treaty\u2019s Jurisdictional Requirements**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nHaving concluded that since 21 March 2014 the Russian Federation\u2019s Treaty obligations toward Ukrainian investors extend to the territory of the Crimean Peninsula, the Tribunal now turns to consider whether the Treaty\u2019s requirements for jurisdiction and admissibility have been met in the present case, such as to allow the Claimants to avail themselves of the Treaty\u2019s protection.\n\n197.\n\nArticle 9 of the Treaty, which contains the Contracting Parties\u2019 offer to arbitrate with investors (and is reproduced at paragraph 79 above), raises the issues of whether: (i) the Claimants are \"investors of a Contracting Party\" within the meaning of the Treaty (jurisdiction *ratione personae);* (ii) there exists a dispute between the Parties \"arising in connection with investments\" within the meaning of the Treaty (jurisdiction *ratione materiae);* and (iii) the Claimants have complied with any notice or negotiation requirements of the Treaty. The Tribunal addresses each of these issues in turn below.\n\n**1. Whether the Claimants are \"investors of a Contracting Party\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the Treaty, reproduced in full at paragraph 83 above, sets out the Treaty\u2019s definition of the terms \"investor of a Contracting Party.\" Pursuant to this provision, the questions for the Tribunal are whether Privatbank and Finilon are: (i) \"legal entit[ies] constituted in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory of Ukraine\"; and (ii) \"competent in accordance with the legislation of [their] Contracting Party, to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n199.\n\nAs noted at paragraph 54 above, the Tribunal became aware shortly before the issuance of this Interim Award that PrivatBank was nationalized by Ukraine in December 2016. As it was not briefed by the Parties on the impact that this development may have on PrivatBank\u2019s status as an \"investor of a Contracting Party\", the Tribunal joins consideration of this question to the merits phase of these proceedings.\n\n200.\n\nAs to Finilon, having reviewed the documents submitted by the Claimants and the opinions of the experts on Ukrainian law, [REDACTED] and Dr. Tsirat, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is a legal entity constituted in accordance with Ukrainian law. The Claimants have shown that it has been duly registered in the Ukrainian Corporate Register since 1 October 2013 and in the Ukrainian State Register of Financial Institutions (other than banks) since 24 October 2013.205\n\nExtract of Corporate Register, 1 April 2016 (CE-188); Extract of the Financial Institutions Register (available at: http://nfp.gov.ua/files/reestry/DRFU/38062828-drfu.xlsx) ([REDACTED].\n\n201.\n\nAs for the requirement under Article 1(2) of the Treaty that Finilon be \"competent in accordance with the legislation of its Contracting Party, to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\" the Tribunal understands this to be a requirement of capacity to enter into certain legal relations. The Tribunal accepts the expert evidence that Finilon had legal capacity under Ukrainian law to make investments in the Crimean Peninsula at all times from its acquisition of PrivatBank\u2019s Crimean business to the commencement of this arbitration.206\n\n[REDACTED] Hearing Tr., 13 July 2016 at 318-320 (examination of Dr. Tsirat).\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its understanding of the \"competency\" requirement is based on the second translation of the Treaty provided by the Claimants207 and, in their description, produced by using the controlling English translations of other BITs entered into by the Russian Federation.208 The Tribunal is conscious that the first translation provided by the Claimants stated not that investors had to be \"competent\", but rather that they had to be \"legally authorized\" to make investments. If accepted, the latter translation might suggest that, beyond the question of capacity, the Tribunal should also investigate whether any restrictions applied under Ukrainian law to the making of investments by Finilon in the Crimean Peninsula. As will be seen, the Tribunal is not in a position at this stage to carry out this investigation in full.\n\nCA-137.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n203.\n\n[REDACTED] the Resolution of the National Bank of Ukraine No. 699 dated 3 November 2014, which states that it \"is prohibited for a resident [of Ukraine] to invest in an investment object located (registered) within the territory of Crimea.\"210 While the plain text of Resolution No. 699 could suggest a prohibition on all investments in the Crimean Peninsula, the Tribunal accepts [REDACTED] given the scope of the powers of the National Bank of Ukraine, this Resolution should be understood as prohibiting only monetary transfers to the Crimean Peninsula and only those made after the Resolution came into force.211 [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n204.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n205.\n\n[REDACTED] Resolution the National Bank of Ukraine No. 260 dated 6 May 2014.213 *Inter alia,* the Resolution mandated Ukrainian banks to terminate the operations of their Crimean branches within a month of the Resolution.214 [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nNational Bank of Ukraine Regulation No. 260 \"On withdrawal and cancellation of banking licenses and general licenses to carry out currency transactions of some banks and closure by the banks of their separate departments located on the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol,\" 6 May 2014 [REDACTED] para. 5. The Tribunal notes that the Resolution entered into force on 6 May 2014.\n\n206.\n\nAs noted above, in this Interim Award the Tribunal has considered it appropriate to decide questions of jurisdiction and admissibility on a narrow basis. In order not to prejudge any issue in the absence of complete information, the Tribunal therefore defers to the merits stage of the proceedings the consideration of any jurisdictional questions that might require findings of fact likely also to be relevant to merits issues. Whether the Claimants complied with Resolution No. 260 and whether this Resolution is relevant given the timing of alleged Treaty breaches, are two such questions.\n\n**2. Whether there exists a dispute between the Parties \"arising in connection with investments\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nA second jurisdictional requirement set out in Article 9 of the Treaty is the existence of a dispute between the \"investor of a Contracting Party\" and the other Contracting Party \"arising in connection with investments.\" This requirement gives rises to a number of questions:\n\n(i) Did the Claimants hold \"investments\" falling within the definition of that term in Article 1(1)?\n\n(ii) Is there a dispute between the Parties?\n\n(iii) Did this dispute arise \"in connection with investments\" protected under the Treaty?\n\n(iv) Does the Treaty, and Article 1(1) in particular, require that the Claimants\u2019 investments have been initiated in the territory of the Russian Federation, or does the Treaty also protect investments that were made in the Crimean Peninsula before the Russian Federation assumed responsibility for its international relations?\n\n208.\n\nAs noted above, in this Interim Award the Tribunal has considered it appropriate to decide questions of jurisdiction and admissibility on a narrow basis and therefore to defer to the merits stage of these proceedings the consideration of any jurisdictional questions that might require findings of fact likely also to be relevant to merits issues. Whether Finilon complied with Resolution No. 260, and whether this Resolution is relevant given the timing of alleged Treaty breaches, are two such questions. For the same reason, the Tribunal defers to the merits stage the consideration of the first and third questions noted in the above paragraph, proceeding to answer only the second and fourth questions, which can be addressed in this Interim Award without encroaching on the merits.\n\n209.\n\nWith respect to the second question\u2014whether there is a dispute between the Parties\u2014the Tribunal has no doubt that this is the case. According to the jurisprudence, \"[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"217 While \"[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other\" in order for a dispute to exist,218 \"the existence of a dispute may be inferred from the failure of a State to respond to a claim in circumstances where a response is called for.\"219\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* Judgment No. 2, 1924, PCIJ, Series A, No. 2, p. 11.\n\n*South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v. South Africa*)*,* Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 21 December 1962, 1962 ICJ Reports 319, p. 328; Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

Despite the Claimants\u2019 requests, the Respondent has shown no intention to provide such compensation or otherwise satisfy the Claimants\u2019 claims. The Tribunal finds that, at the latest, the dispute between the Parties crystallized when the Respondent provided no answer (beyond an acknowledgment of receipt) to the letter [REDACTED] The Tribunal concludes on this basis that there exists a dispute between the Parties within the meaning of Article 9 of the Treaty, arising in connection with what the Claimants consider to be their protected investments under the Treaty.\n\n211.\n\nThe fourth question set out in paragraph 207 above\u2014whether the Treaty protects investments that were made in the Crimean Peninsula before the Russian Federation assumed responsibility for its international relations\u2014is raised by the Respondent\u2019s correspondence to the Tribunal. [REDACTED]\n\n212.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n213.\n\nThis is a serious objection that, if accepted, would dispose of PrivatBank\u2019s claims comprehensively as all of its claimed investments were made before the Treaty became opposable to the Russian Federation in respect of the Crimean Peninsula on 21 March 2014. It is also material to ask whether what were \"domestic\" investments of the Claimants at the point at which they were initially made, *i.e.,* investments by Ukrainian investors in Ukraine, can properly be considered to have been internationalised and to have acquired the protection of the Treaty through no action of the investors but only in consequence of the conduct of the Russian Federation in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n214.\n\nIn essence, the Tribunal is faced here with a straightforward question of treaty interpretation: does the use of the phrase \"invested ... in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" in Article 1(1) of the Treaty imply that the Claimants\u2019 investments must have been made initially in the territory of the Russian Federation in order to be covered by the Treaty, or does the Treaty also cover investments that were made in territory in respect of which the Russian Federation has subsequently assumed responsibility for international relations? The former interpretation implies an additional temporal limitation, and thus a narrower scope of application of the Treaty, as compared to the latter, broader interpretation of the definition of \"investment\" under the Treaty.\n\n215.\n\nThe point of departure for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of this question is Article 31(1) of the VCLT, which requires the Treaty to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose. It is according to this rule of interpretation that the Tribunal must determine which of the two possible interpretations is to be preferred.\n\n216.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s assessment, while acknowledging the weight of the Respondent\u2019s objection (as here construed), the objection fails in the light of the construction of the relevant terms of the Treaty, in their context and in the light of the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose. There are four essential reasons for this conclusion: (i) the proper reading of the text of Article 1(1) of the Treaty; (ii) a reading of Article 1(1) in the context of the Treaty as a whole; (iii) a reading of Article 1(1) in the light of the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose; and (iv) the absence of any evidence of an intention to temporally constrain the Treaty\u2019s definition of covered investments.\n\n217.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n218.\n\nThe Treaty was concluded in Russian and Ukrainian, both texts having equal force. Accordingly, the Tribunal must first consider the ordinary meaning of this phrase in those languages. [REDACTED]226\n\nSee Lesson Six: Perfective and Imperfective Verbs, National University of \"Kyiv-Mohyla Academy\" (CE-244); Learn Russian: Aspects of Russian Verbs - Imperfective and Perfective, RT (2012) (CE-213).\n\n219.\n\nOn the basis of its own informed reading of the text, the Tribunal agrees with the explanation of Russian and Ukrainian grammar given by the Claimants. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimants\u2019 proposed addition of the bracketed \"which are\" in its English translation of Article 1(1) accurately reflects the fact that the imperfective aspect of the verb is used in the Russian and Ukrainian texts. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that this grammatical point fully resolves the question of the interpretation of Article 1(1). Read as stating that investments are \"... assets [which are] invested ... in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\" it is apparent that the provision does not obviously and expressly create any temporal limitation, but it appears also not to exclude this possible interpretation. An analysis of the context and the object and purpose of the Treaty remains necessary.\n\n220.\n\nTurning to the wider context of the Treaty, an examination of the terms of the Treaty discloses a number of provisions that either have or do not have (actual or implicit) temporal dimensions that may shed light on the question of whether a temporal limitation ought properly to be read into Article 1(1) such that a nexus must be shown between the initial investment and the Contracting Party whose responsibility is invoked under the Treaty.\n\n221.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal observes that the finding of any such nexus would require the Tribunal to read language creating a nexus into the Treaty, given that the Treaty contains no explicit language to this effect. The Tribunal considers that it should be cautious about reading words into the Treaty where none exist.\n\n222.\n\nBeyond this, the Tribunal notes that four provisions of the Treaty have a bearing on the present analysis, including: (i) the concluding sentence of Article 1(1); (ii) the definition of the term \"investor\" in Article 1(2); (iii) Article 1(2)of the Treaty addressing its application; and (iv) Article 14(3) of the Treaty addressing the consequences of termination of the Treaty.\n\n223.\n\nIt is convenient to start with Article 12, which provides that \"[t]his Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party on or after January 1, 1992.\"\n\n224.\n\nThe material consideration here, from the Tribunal\u2019s perspective, is that Article 12 contemplates expressly that the protections of the Treaty will apply to investments made not simply before the Treaty entered into force but some seven years before the Treaty was concluded. There is no necessary nexus, therefore, flowing from this provision, between the initial making of an investment and the Treaty\u2019s signature or entry into force. It follows, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that the Contracting Parties were concerned to ensure that investments made in either Contracting Party in the immediate aftermath of the breakup of the Soviet Union were afforded the protections provided by the Treaty without regard to considerations of whether the Treaty was yet in force as between the Contracting Parties.\n\n225.\n\nImportantly for the consideration of the Respondent\u2019s objection, the terms of Article 12 suggest that the Contracting Parties contemplated that the protection of the Treaty would be given not only to those investors of a Contracting Party who initiated their investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party in the knowledge that they would be protected by the Treaty, and for whom this knowledge may have been a key factor in their decision to invest, but also\u2014 automatically and by operation of law\u2014to those investors who had initiated their investment without such knowledge and whose investments were therefore clearly made irrespective of the availability of any protections at the international level. [REDACTED]\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, contrary to the terms of Article 1(1), and the formulation \"invested by\", the verb \"made\" in Article 12 is used in the perfective aspect and in the past tense in the Russian and Ukrainian texts. This usage is essential to give Article 12 its temporal dimension. Given the reference in Article 12 to the making of investments \"on or after January 1, 1992,\" this provision would make neither grammatical nor logical sense if the imperfective form of the verb were used. The contrast between the verb usage in Article 12 and in Article 1(1) reinforces the conclusion that the latter provision does not expressly or impliedly require a temporal nexus between the time of making of the investment and its making in a particular territory. Where a temporal meaning is intended, the perfective aspect of the verb is used (Article 12). Where no such temporal meaning is intended, the imperfective aspect is used (Article 1(1)). Accordingly, the Tribunal would expect that if a temporal meaning were intended in Article 1(1) the perfective aspect would have been used, in application of the normal rules of Russian and Ukrainian grammar.\n\n227.\n\nThe Treaty\u2019s coverage of pre-existing investments is mirrored by the terms, common to investment treaties, of Article 14(3), which provides that \"[w]ith respect to investments made before the termination of this Agreement and covered by it, the provisions of all other Articles of this Agreement shall remain in force for the next ten years after that date.\" As with Article 12, the evident intention behind Article 14(3) is to ensure to investors the protections of the Treaty for a settled period notwithstanding the termination of the Treaty. Once again, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this provision eschews formalism in the temporal application of the Treaty in favour of affording investors the protection of the Treaty.\n\n228.\n\nMore telling is the definition of the term \"investor of a Contracting Party\" in Article 1(2) of the Treaty which, both as regards natural persons having the citizenship of the state of a Contracting Party and as regards legal entities constituted in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory of a Contracting Party, contains no temporal requirement at all, such as would require an investor to be a citizen of a given Contracting Party, or an entity constituted in accordance with the laws of a given Contracting Party, at the point at which the initial investment was made. If there is no such requirement as regards an \"investor of a Contracting Party\", it is difficult to see a sustainable rationale for reading such a requirement as regards the definition of the term \"investment\" in Article 1(1).\n\n229.\n\nFinally, this assessment draws further support, in the Tribunal\u2019s estimation, from the concluding sentence of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which expressly contemplates the possibility of an \"alteration of the type of investments\" over time, providing that this \"shall not affect their nature as investments.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, insofar as the Treaty provides for the continuing protections of the Treaty notwithstanding an alteration of the type of investment, this supports the conclusion that the protections of the Treaty cannot be taken to lapse in consequence of some other alteration in the character of the investment, as long as the investment in question is in the territory of the Contracting Party whose responsibility under the Treaty is invoked, at the point at which that responsibility is said to have arisen, and provided that the claimant can satisfy the other requirements of the Treaty for a claim to be brought.229\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a similarly-worded provision in the US-Ecuador BIT has also been taken as evidence of those States\u2019 intention to provide broad coverage in time to investments, and thus as reason not to read further temporal limitations into the definition of investments under that treaty. *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. 2007-2, UNCITRAL, Interim Award of 1 December 2008, paras. 181-183.\n\n230.\n\nIn sum, the context of the Treaty as a whole discloses an overall intention to cover all qualifying investments, without regard to when or how such investments may have become qualifying investments under the Treaty. Simply put, given that the Treaty explicitly provides for the coverage of investments, notwithstanding that they (i) pre-date the conclusion or entry into force of the Treaty, (ii) have changed in their basic characteristics and form over time, and (iii) are held by investors whose nationality or capacity to invest has changed over time, the Tribunal does not consider that there could properly be read in to Article 1(1) language that would create an exception to such coverage on the basis of where an investment was initially made.\n\n231.\n\nThis observation takes the Tribunal to a consideration of the object and purpose of the Treaty. The object and purpose of a BIT will typically be two-fold: to provide protections to foreign investors and to attract foreign investment into the host State. This dual object and purpose is reflected in the title of the Treaty, which gives equal emphasis to the \"protection\" and \"encouragement\" of investments. It is also reflected in the Treaty\u2019s preamble, which states that the Contracting Parties sought, on the one hand, to \"create and maintain favorable conditions for mutual investments\" and, on the other hand, to \"create favorable conditions for the expansion of economic cooperation between the Parties.\"230\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n232.\n\nIn the case at hand, a finding by the Tribunal that Ukrainian investments made in the Crimean Peninsula before 21 March 2014 benefit from the protections of the Treaty is consistent with the investor protection objective of the Treaty. While care must be taken to avoid unduly elevating the objective of investor protection when construing the terms of an investment treaty,231 the Tribunal considers that a finding that Ukrainian investments made in the Crimean Peninsula before 21 March 2014 are covered by the Treaty would be in keeping with the Treaty\u2019s dual object and purpose. As noted above, Article 12 clearly demonstrates that the Contracting Parties intended that investments that were made prior to the entry into force of the Treaty would nonetheless benefit from its protections.\n\n*European American Investment Bank AG (EURAM)* v. *Slovak Republic,* PCA Case No. 2010-17, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction of 22 October 2012, para. 326 (\"... the object and purpose of the BIT is not such that it requires provisions which confer protection upon investors to be given the broadest possible interpretation in order to further the goal of investment protection. In particular, the Tribunal considers that it would not be justified in departing from the ordinary meaning of the terms of a definition provision on the basis that a more expansive definition of 'investment\u2019 would further what is only one of the objects of the BIT.\").\n\n233.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal finds nothing in the context or object and purpose of the Treaty that would militate in favour of a narrower interpretation of Article 1(1). In fact, the Tribunal considers that if a temporal limitation\u2014the requirement of a nexus between the investment and the Contracting Party whose responsibility is invoked under the Treaty at the time the investment was originally made\u2014were read into Article 1(1), it would serve to exclude only investments in cases such as the present one involving territorial changes. The Tribunal can find no evidence in the Treaty or otherwise to suggest that the Contracting Parties intended to exclude such investments. Rather, as already detailed above, the context and object and purpose of the Treaty contain numerous indicia which contradict such an intention.\n\n234.\n\nThe preceding analysis turns on questions of treaty interpretation, *i.e.,* is focused on the interpretation of the terms of the particular treaty here in issue. The conclusion reached above is that there is nothing in either Article 1(1) or Article 9(1) of the Treaty that imposes a requirement that the investments that are the subject of the claims must, at the point of their initial investment, have been made in the Russian Federation. The same analysis leads the Tribunal to conclude that nothing in the Treaty suggests that investments which began as domestic investments and later became international investments should be denied coverage for this reason alone.\n\n235.\n\nAlthough the present case is *sui generis,* the Tribunal draws support for the preceding analysis and conclusions from a wider review of investment treaty jurisprudence. In *OKO Pankki Oyj and others* v. *Estonia,232* for example, a threshold jurisdictional issue was whether investments made by Finnish and German investors between 1988 and 1990 in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, *i.e.,* in Estonian territory then comprising part of the USSR, qualified as investments in Estonia following its independence in 1991 for purposes of the 1992 Estonia-Finland BIT and the 1997 Estonia-German BIT. The tribunal in that case concluded that there was an investment in Estonia for purposes of the BITs in question.233 While the circumstances of the present case are different from those of *OKO Pankki Oyj,* the latter award lends support to the conclusion that the character or sovereign status of the territory in which an investment was initially made will not be controlling for purposes of deciding whether the investment is a qualifying investment under a BIT that subsequently affords investor protection rights to investors in that territory.234\n\n*OKO Pankki Ovj and Others* v. *The Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6, Award of 19 November 2007.\n\n*OKO Pankki Oyj and Others* v. *The Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6, Award of 19 November 2007, paras. 182-183; also paras. 184-187.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal notes here the award in the case of *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG* v. *Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award of 18 June 2010, in which the tribunal drew a distinction between the question of the legality of an investment at the point of the initiation of the investment and legality during the performance of the investment. While this distinction was clearly material to the issue to be assessed in that case, *i.e.,* the question of whether the claimed investment was in compliance with the host State\u2019s legislation in the face of an allegation of fraud in the making of the investment, the present Tribunal does not find this distinction, or the tribunal\u2019s analysis in the *Hamester* case, to be germane for present purposes. The principal issue with which this Tribunal is faced is not the point in time at which an allegation of fraud is to be assessed but rather the question of whether the claimed investment can be a qualifying investment in circumstances in which it was initially made in the Crimean Peninsula prior to the date on which the Russian Federation assumed responsibility for the Crimean Peninsula\u2019s international relations. In addition, the Tribunal notes that the decision in *Hamester* turned on the interpretation of specific English-language wording in the BIT in question.\n\n236.\n\nAlso affording some analogy, even if only indirect, is the case of *Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *El Salvador,* in which one of the preliminary issues was whether a claimant had to have the requisite nationality under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) at the point at which the investment was made or if such nationality could be acquired thereafter.235 The tribunal concluded that it \"does not find in the text, object or purpose of CAFTA any indication that, in order to qualify for protection under the treaty, CAFTA requires an investor to have a Party\u2019s nationality prior to making its investment.\"236 In other words, the treaty \"does not require any precise chronological order in the fulfillment of its requirements to quali[f]y an 'investor of a Party.\u2019\"237 Unless otherwise established, the earliest date for purposes of the *ratione temporis* application of the treaty is the date at which the alleged violation occurred.238\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections of 1 June 2012, para. 3.31.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, para. 3.32.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, para. 3.33.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, para. 3.34.\n\n237.\n\nWhile the analogy is imperfect, the Tribunal takes this decision as support for the proposition that, absent indication to the contrary, the relevant dates for purposes of assessing whether the factual predicates of a claim qualify for purposes of a BIT are the date of the alleged breach and the date on which the claim is brought. The date of the initial investment, assuming the investment to have been made within the temporal ambit of the treaty, will not be controlling. Ultimately, this case is an illustration of the principle governing the critical date for the assessment of a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction already set forth above.239\n\n*See* paragraph 151 above.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal notes further that when arbitral tribunals have interpreted provisions of investment treaties defining the notion of \"investment\" to include temporal limitations, they have generally relied on the specific wording of those investment treaties.240 In that sense, the Tribunal adheres to the proposition\u2014often repeated in respect of other controversial issues regarding the interpretation of investment treaties\u2014that the interpretation of a treaty is specific to the treaty being interpreted, and that attention must be paid to the particular terms used and the meaning given by the Contracting States to that specific treaty\u2019s provisions.241 This is the approach that the Tribunal has adopted with respect to the present Treaty. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, an analysis of the terms of the Treaty in its two authentic languages reveals no intention to imply a temporal constraint into the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(1) that is not expressed in that provision. The Treaty does not require that, to qualify as an investment under the Treaty, the investment have been originally made as a Ukrainian investment in the territory of the Russian Federation. It suffices that a Ukrainian investment remain in the Crimean Peninsula after 21 March 2014 for it to be protected by the Treaty vis-a-vis the Russian Federation.\n\n*See e.g.* *Gustav F W Homester GmbH & Co KG* v. *Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award of 18 June 2010, paras. 126-127 (where the tribunal considered Article 10 of the Germany-Ghana BIT: \"This Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to [the treaty\u2019s] entry into force by nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent with the latter\u2019s legislation.\").\n\nSee for example in relation to whether most-favoured-nation provisions apply to the dispute settlement provisions of investment treaties, *Renta 4 S.V.S.A. et al.* v. *Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award on Preliminary Objections of 20 March 2009, para. 90 (\"It is undoubtedly fair to compare BITs for the purpose of assessing compliance with promises of MFN treatment given their congruent objective: the promotion and protection of investments. Yet such a general statement is insufficient to decide any particular case. It is a matter of the wording of the relevant instruments. This is one of the reasons awards under BITs are of variable relevance and value in subsequent cases.\"); *Daimler Financial Services AG* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award of 22 August 2012, paras. 161-167; Study Group on the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, Final Report, Annex to the Report of the International Law Commission, 70 UNGAOR Supp. No. 10, UN DOC. A/70/10 (14 August 2015), p. 182, paras. 162-163 (\"The point is essentially one of party autonomy; the parties to a BIT can, if they wish, include the conditions for access to dispute settlement within the scope of coverage of an MFN provision. The question in each case is whether they have done so. In this sense, the question is truly one of treaty interpretation that can be answered only in respect of each particular case.\").\n\n239.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal considers that its jurisdiction falls to be assessed on the date on which proceedings were instituted, having regard, as appropriate, to the circumstances in place on the date on which the violation is alleged to have occurred. The Tribunal does not see any explicit temporal limitation in Article 1(1) of the Treaty, and finds neither reason nor basis to read into that provision any such limitation by reference to the text, context or object and purpose of the Treaty. Nor does the Tribunal find support for such a limitation in investment-treaty jurisprudence or practice. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Treaty does not exclude from its protections investments that were made by Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula before the Russian Federation assumed responsibility for the international relations of the Crimean Peninsula and, thus, that PrivatBank\u2019s investments are not excluded from the scope of the Treaty\u2019s protections on the basis that there were initially made before 21 March 2014.\n\n**3. Whether the Claimants have complied with any notice or negotiation requirement of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nPursuant to Article 9(1) of the Treaty, investor-State disputes are \"subject to a written notice, accompanied by detailed comment,\" which the investor \"shall send\" to the host State, after which the parties to the dispute \"shall endeavor to settle the dispute through negotiations if possible.\" Article 9(2) further provides that, \"[i]f the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner within six months after the date of the written notice,\" it may be referred to arbitration.\n\n241.\n\nThe Treaty thus envisages that the dispute resolution process will begin with a formal written notification of the dispute by the investor to the host State followed by a period of six months dedicated to the attempt of reaching a negotiated solution, before arbitral proceedings can be commenced.\n\n242.\n\nThe purpose of the six-month period is to foster the conditions for amicable settlement.242 It is not, however, to prevent an arbitration from proceeding where attempts at negotiation have been unsuccessful.\n\n*See e.g.* *Ronald S. Lauder* v. *Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Award of 3 September 2001, paras. 185, 187 (\"... the purpose of the waiting period,... is to allow the parties to enter into good-faith negotiations before initiating arbitration.\"); *Burlington Resources Inc* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 June 2010, para. 315 (\"... by imposing upon investors an obligation to voice their disagreement at least six months prior to the submission of an investment dispute to arbitration, the Treaty effectively accords host States the right to be informed about the dispute at least six months before it is submitted to arbitration. The purpose of this right is to grant the host State an opportunity to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration.\").\n\n243.\n\n[REDACTED] That letter, which is summarized at paragraph 210 above, contained all the necessary elements to inform the Respondent of the existence of the dispute, its subject-matter and PrivatBank\u2019s intention to pursue the claims in arbitration if a negotiated solution could not be achieved.\n\n244.\n\n[REDACTED] Tribunal finds that the Claimants respected the six-month period provided by the Treaty for negotiations.\n\n245.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants made a good faith attempt to enter into negotiations with the Respondent. [REDACTED]\n\n246.\n\nHowever, having received this invitation to negotiate from the Claimants, the Respondent did not take any step to engage with them. [REDACTED] the Tribunal sees no reason to doubt that this was the case, as this attitude of the Respondent was borne out by its non-participation in the present proceedings.\n\n247.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.\n\n**D.** **Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe threshold issue presented by this case is whether the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine affords rights opposable to the Russian Federation as regards Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula and, if so, from what date. Following on from the analysis above, it is the conclusion of the Tribunal that the Treaty is indeed opposable to the Russian Federation as regards Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula as of 21 March 2014.\n\n249.\n\nNeither the geographic scope of application of the Treaty nor its juridical space changed with the events of February-March 2014 in the Crimean Peninsula. Neither Contracting Party to the Treaty took or has since taken any step to disavow, denounce, suspend or terminate the Treaty as a whole or as regards the Crimean Peninsula. The Treaty remains in force and continues to apply to investments in the Crimean Peninsula. Given these considerations, a conclusion that the Treaty no longer applies to conduct occurring in the Crimean Peninsula would be to denude the Treaty of effect and relieve the Contracting Parties of their obligation to perform the Treaty in good faith, contrary to the cardinal principle of *pacta sunt servanda.* It would be to create a legal void, a bubble, in the application of the Treaty in respect of the Crimean Peninsula that was never contemplated and should not be countenanced.\n\n250.\n\nWhile there is no concordance of views between the Contracting Parties about the status of the Crimean Peninsula as a matter of international law, there is an intersection of the positions of the Contracting Parties as regards the Russian Federation\u2019s jurisdiction and settled, long-term control over the Crimean Peninsula. This translates into the responsibility of the Russian Federation for the international relations of the Crimean Peninsula. This intersection of positions emerges, on the side of the Russian Federation, from the constitutional steps it took, as a matter of Russian law, to incorporate the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation and, on the side of Ukraine, from its legislation and its Non-Disputing Party Submission in these proceedings. The critical consideration is the emergence of settled, long-term control by the Russian Federation over the Crimean Peninsula which crystallised on 21 March 2014 when the Russian law incorporating the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation was enacted.\n\n251.\n\nAfter concluding that since 21 March 2014 the Russian Federation\u2019s Treaty obligations toward Ukrainian investors extend to the territory of the Crimean Peninsula, the Tribunal also considered in this Interim Award whether the Treaty\u2019s requirements for jurisdiction and admissibility have been met in the present case, such as to allow the Claimants to avail themselves of the Treaty\u2019s protection. The Tribunal found that: (i) there exists a dispute between the Parties arising in connection with the Claimants\u2019 claimed investments; (ii) PrivatBank\u2019s investments are not excluded from the scope of the Treaty\u2019s protections on the basis that they were initially made before 21 March 2014; and (iii) the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.\n\n252.\n\nAny and all other issues of jurisdiction and admissibility that may warrant consideration and decision are joined to the merits of the proceedings. In particular, the Tribunal defers to the next phase consideration of the issues of whether: (i) the Claimants are \"investors\" for the purposes of Article 1 of the Treaty, including in the light of PrivatBank\u2019s nationalization by Ukraine; (ii) the Claimants\u2019 \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1); and (iii) the dispute between the Parties arose \"in connection with\" those investments.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n[253].\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n1. the Russian Federation has assumed obligations under the Treaty in respect of Ukrainian investors and their investments in the Crimean Peninsula as of 21 March 2014;\n\n2. there is a dispute between the Parties arising in connection with what the Claimants allege to constitute \"investments\" under the Treaty; and\n\n3. the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.\n\n[254].\n\nThe Tribunal joins the consideration of all other issues of jurisdiction or admissibility to the merits of the proceedings and defers any decision on the costs of arbitration to the next phase of the arbitration.\n\n**Place of arbitration;** The Hague, the Netherlands\n\n**Date: 27 March 2017**"}, {"Title": "Partial Award", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2019-02-04T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Partial Award\n-------------\n\nGlossary of Defined Terms and Abbreviations\n-------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution (or 21 April 2014 Resolution)** | Resolution of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation No. PH-33-1 \"On Terminating the Activities of Standalone Business Units of the Public Joint Stock Company PrivatBank Commercial Bank of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine on the territory of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, a City of Federal Significance,\" 21 April 2014 |\n| **21 April 2014 Court Decision (or 21 April 2014 Decision)** | Decision issued by the Simferopol Central District Court on 21 April 2014 |\n| ***Belbek*** **Arbitration** | An arbitration before a tribunal constituted in accordance with the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules between Aeroport Belbek LLC and Mr. Igor Valerievich Kolomoisky as claimants and the Russian Federation (PCA Case No. 2015-07) |\n| **Belbek LLC** | Aeroport Belbek LLC |\n| **BIT** | Bilateral investment treaty |\n| **Claimants** | PrivatBank and Finilon |\n| [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Crimea** | The region known as the \"Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" under the Ukrainian Constitution and the \"Republic of Crimea\" under the Russian Constitution |\n| **Crimean Banking Law** | Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 37-FZ \"On the Special Features of the Functioning of the Financial System of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Federal Significance of Sevastopol during the Transition Period,\" 2 April 2014 |\n| **Crimean Peninsula** | Crimea and the city of Sevastopol |\n| ***Everest*** | PCA Case No. 2015-36, *Everest Estate LLC, et al. v.

In answering this question the Parties are in particular invited to consider the following cases: *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft* v. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, para. 141 (\"it is not so much the term 'investment\u2019 in the ICSID Convention than the term 'investment\u2019 per se that is often considered as having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a BIT\") and *Romak S.A. v*. *The Republic of Uzbekistan,* Award, \u00a7 207 (9 November 2009)(\"The term 'investment\u2019 has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT. [...] The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term 'investments\u2019 under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk .... By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT\u2019s non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of 'investment\u2019, the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an 'investment\u2019.\"). The Parties are also invited to address whether the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments in the present case meet such an objective definition. In particular, the Parties are invited to address whether PrivatBank\u2019s investments had a sufficient duration, given Resolution No. 260 and the fact that the Respondent established a deadline by which Ukrainian banks had to obtain licenses from the Russian Central Bank to continue their operations.\n\n7. The Parties are invited to elaborate on the question of whether the Claimants\u2019 investments were \"invested ... in accordance with ... legislation [of the other Contracting Party]\" as required by Article 1(1) of the Treaty, including by discussing:\n\n(i) the time at which compliance with this requirement should be assessed in this case;\n\n(ii) whether the Claimants\u2019 investments had to comply with the legislation of the Russian Federation or Ukraine;\n\n(iii) whether, if compliance with Russian legislation was required, there was a requirement for the Russian Federation to admit the Claimants\u2019 investments as foreign investments in the Russian Federation; and\n\n(iv) the relationship between this requirement in Article 1(1) and Article 2(1) of the Treaty, which provides that a Contracting Party \"shall allow. .. investments in so far as it is in conformity with its respective laws\".\n\n8. At the hearing (Tr., 13 July 2016 at 255-256), Professor Skvortsov stated that, to be properly characterized as \"investments\" in the Russian Federation, the Claimants\u2019 assets should have been taken out of and \"reinvested\" in the Crimean Peninsula. The Parties are invited to address this statement.\n\n9. [REDACTED] and how it relates to the definition of \"investments\" in Article 1(1) of the Treaty. The Claimants are also invited to indicate under which law the transactions were effectuated.\n\n10. The Parties are invited to address the relevance (if any) of the following arbitral awards to the remaining issues of jurisdiction in this arbitration:\n\n(i) Decision on Jurisdiction dated 20 March 2017 in *PCA Case No. 2015-36. Everest Estate LLC et al. v*. *The Russian Federation**;*\n\n(ii) Award on Jurisdiction dated 26 June 2017 in *PCA Case No. 2015-34, PJSC Ukrnafta v. The Russian Federation**',* and\n\n(iii) Award on Jurisdiction dated 26 June 2017 in *PCA Case No. 2015-35, Stabil LLC et al. v. The Russian Federation**.*\n\n11. [REDACTED] In this connection, the Parties are invited to comment on the relevance of Article 21 of the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 395-1 \"On banks and banking activities\" dated 2 December 1990.\n\n12. The Parties are requested to submit a copy of the decision of the Crimean Court of Appeals referred to in paragraph 49 of the Claimants\u2019 Statement of Claim.\n\n13. [REDACTED]\n\n14. The Parties are invited to submit copies of the court documents pertaining to the criminal proceedings against Mr. Kolomoisky [REDACTED] The Parties are also invited to comment on whether the reasons cited for these criminal proceedings provide a justification for the Respondent\u2019s alleged measures against the Claimants\u2019 investments in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n15. The Parties are invited to provide copies of, and comment on, the relevance to the Claimants\u2019 case of any Russian legislation setting out the role and function of the Russian Depositor Protection Fund mentioned, *inter alia,* at paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim.\n\n38.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent did not submit any responses to the Tribunal\u2019s questions by the 15 August 2017 deadline. Nor did it indicate within the applicable time period the witnesses it wished to examine at the hearing on the merits.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter from the PCA dated 31 August 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to instruct its Russian law expert, Professor Skvortsov, to prepare an additional report [REDACTED] and invited the Parties to comment on a draft Addendum to the Expert Terms of Reference of Professor Skvortsov. The Parties did not submit any comments on the draft Addendum.\n\n41.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n42.\n\nBy letter from the PCA dated 8 September 2017, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a copy of the signed Addendum to Professor Skvortsov\u2019s Terms of Reference.\n\n43.\n\nOn 16 October 2017, Professor Skvortsov submitted his second expert report, in Russian, to the Tribunal (the **\"Second Skvortsov Report\").** The Tribunal communicated the Russian version of the report to the Parties on 17 October 2017 and its English translation on 18 October 2017.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**G.** **Hearing in the Second Phase and Post-Hearing Events**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nA hearing on the remaining issues of admissibility and jurisdiction, as well as on liability (the **\"merits hearing\"),** was held from 1-3 November 2017 at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants were represented at the hearing by party representatives and by counsel. The Russian Federation did not attend or otherwise participate in the hearing.\n\n47.\n\nThe following persons were present:\n\n**Tribunal:**\n\nProfessor Pierre-Marie Dupuy (presiding)  \nSir Daniel Bethlehem QC  \nDr. Vaclav Mikulka\n\n**Tribunal-appointed Expert:**\n\nProfessor Oleg Skvortsov\n\n**PCA:**\n\nMr. Martin Doe  \nMs. Evgeniya Goriatcheva  \nMs. Maria Kiskachi  \nMr. Fortunat Nadima Nadima\n\n**Claimants:**\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*PrivatBank*\n\nMr. John M.

Larson\n\n**Interpreters:**\n\nMr. Sergei Mikheyev  \nMr. Yuri Somov\n\n48.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal-appointed expert on Russian law, Professor Skvortsov, also appeared at the hearing. Questions were put to him by counsel for the Claimants and by the Tribunal.\n\n50.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal posed several questions to the Claimants\u2019 counsel during the hearing, including the following:\n\n1. Could the Claimants (i) elaborate on this statement; and (ii) provide any case law on the interpretation of the UNCITRAL Rules and the Dutch Code in this respect?\n\n2. [REDACTED]\n\n3. [REDACTED] Could the Claimants please explain on what basis the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Finilon in view of this statement?\n\n4. The Claimants are invited to provide copies of any written reports (including by e-mail) [REDACTED] may have received from his colleagues in Crimea concerning:\n\no the events of February-March 2014;\n\no the seizure, on 19 April 2014, of all the cash stored in the main vault of the Crimean Division by \"the Crimean 'authorities,\u2019 with assistance from the Paramilitary Forces and the Russian Federal Security Service ('FSB\u2019)\" [REDACTED] and\n\no the seizure of many of PrivatBank\u2019s branches in Crimea by the Russian authorities and the Paramilitary Forces [REDACTED]\n\n5. The Claimants are invited to provide a copy, if available, of the court decision dismissing the PrivatBank\u2019s appeal of the 21 April 2014 court order which transferred assets to the FZV, [REDACTED]\n\n6. [REDACTED]\n\n7. The Claimants are invited to explain how the Crimean and Sevastopol Divisions were structured within PrivatBank. In this connection, the Claimants are invited to address that each of these Divisions had its own balance sheet [REDACTED]\n\n8. What was the law applicable to PrivatBank\u2019s loan contracts with its clients? Was there a forum selection clause? Were there standard terms and conditions in this regard, and if so, could the Claimants submit a copy of these?\n\n9. [REDACTED]\n\n10. The Claimants are invited to clarify whether the Russian Depositor Protection Fund has compensated any of PrivatBank\u2019s depositors.\n\n11. The Claimants\u2019 witnesses have referred to the closure of PrivatBank\u2019s branches and the seizure of the contents of the PrivatBank vault as the act of a group that includes State and non-State actors. Could the Claimants address the issue of attribution of responsibility to the Russian Federation for these acts?\n\n12. How much cash in what currencies was in the vault at the time of the seizure of its contents on 19 April?\n\n13. Was PrivatBank\u2019s cash shortage limited to foreign currency or did it extend to local currency?\n\n14. Did the NBU hold foreign cash in its vaults in Crimea? If not, how was the NBU supposed to assist PrivatBank with its foreign cash shortage?\n\n15. Does the Canada-USSR BIT apply to Crimea? Is this necessary in order to invoke the MFN clause in relation to that BIT?\n\n16. If the Canada-USSR BIT were not to apply to Crimea, would Canadian investors receive \"more favourable\" treatment than Ukrainian investors for the purpose of the Claimants\u2019 claim under the MFN clause in Article 3 for breach of fair and equitable treatment?\n\n17. Do the Claimants make a national treatment claim under Article 3 of the Treaty?\n\n18. [REDACTED] The Claimants are invited to clarify whether they are simply saying that the Tribunal need not decide their claims under Articles 2 and 3 or whether they are advancing an affirmative proposition that the Tribunal should not decide these claims in the event that it finds a breach of Article 5.\n\n19. Does the use of the verb \"made\" in Article 5 of the Treaty impose any temporal or other limitation on the scope of application of that Article?\n\n20. The Claimants are invited to address the question of the presence or lack of a public interest as an element of the illegality of the expropriation under Article 5. In particular, the basis for the various decisions of the Simferopol District Court appears to be PrivatBank\u2019s failure to fulfil its obligations to depositors. Could the Claimants comment on this justification for the measures taken by the court and its relevance to their case on expropriation?\n\n21. [REDACTED]\n\n22. In addition to answering the specific questions that follow below, the Claimants are invited generally to expand upon their case on expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty, addressing each of the following elements of their claim with a degree of granularity and at the level of individual interests in different kinds of property:\n\na) What investment interest (e.g., cash, debts, movable property, immovable property, etc.) was expropriated?\n\nb) On what specific date was that investment interest expropriated?\n\nc) By what specific act and actor (e.g., an identified executive agent, a court, etc.) did the expropriation occur?\n\nd) How was each individual taking contrary to each of the elements of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, i.e.:\n\no was not \"taken in the public interest\";\n\no was not taken \"under due process of law\";\n\no was \"discriminatory\";\n\no was not \"accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation\"?\n\ne) How is \"expropriation\" defined for purposes of these responses?\n\n23. The Claimants are invited to explain why a date prior to 21 March 2014 should not be considered as the date of expropriation, [REDACTED]\n\n**24.**  [REDACTED]\n\n**25.**  [REDACTED]\n\n26. Would you agree that the decisions of the Simferopol District Court of 21 April and 4 June 2014 (CE-62 and CE-275), being decisions for interim measures, were temporary in nature and became permanent only with the decision of 16 September 2014 (CE-89)? If the Tribunal were to so find, then would 16 September 2014 be properly considered, on your case, as the date of direct expropriation under Article 5 of the Ukraine-Russia BIT?\n\n27. Do the Claimants argue that the amendments of 3 September and 9 October 2014 to the 30 April 2014 decree of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea constituted an expropriation or other breach of the Treaty?\n\n28. The Claimants are invited to indicate with specificity their criticisms of the proceedings and decisions of the Simferopol Court?\n\n29. Did the Claimants have notice of each of the proceedings before the Simferopol Court? If not, how do the Claimants support their allegation of lack of notice in the face of statements to the contrary by the Simferopol Court?\n\n30. Given that the Claimants argue that the expropriation of PrivatBank and other Treaty breaches occurred, whether wholly or in part, through judicial decisions, the Claimants are invited to address whether the Claimants were required to exhaust, or at least reasonably pursue, local remedies in respect of judicial or administrative decisions. Do the Claimants argue that such local remedies are or were futile?\n\n31. With regard to the issue raised in the prior question, is it the Claimants\u2019 position that there has been a denial of justice?\n\n32. Could the Claimants comment on the relevance of Resolution No. 260 of the National Bank of Ukraine, which on 5 May 2014 prohibited Ukrainian banks from pursuing banking operations in the Crimean Peninsula, for the assessment of causation between the alleged Treaty breaches and the Claimants\u2019 alleged damages? In particular, if PrivatBank were to have been allowed to recommence its operations, how did PrivatBank intend to get around the restrictions imposed by Resolution 260?\n\n33. If PrivatBank were to have been allowed to recommence its operations, how did PrivatBank intend to get around other restrictions imposed by Ukrainian law, such as those mentioned by [REDACTED]\n\n34. In relation to the above questions, and insofar as relevant, the Claimants are invited to address the original languages of the Treaty.\n\n51.\n\nOn 7 November 2017, the Tribunal convened a joint procedural conference for both this arbitration and the *Belbek* Arbitration in order to discuss next steps. The procedural conference was attended by the same counsel for the Claimants as the merits hearing. It was not attended by the Respondent. [REDACTED]\n\n52.\n\nA transcript of the hearing was delivered electronically to the Parties at the end of each hearing day. On 17 November 2017, hard and electronic copies of the complete transcript of the hearing were circulated to the Parties, with an invitation to propose corrections. [REDACTED] The Respondent made no comments on the hearing transcript.\n\n53.\n\nAs stated by the Tribunal at the close of the hearing, and confirmed by subsequent letter of 17 November 2017, the Parties were invited to submit post-hearing briefs addressing the questions posed by the Tribunal to counsel during the hearing, as well as other matters arising from the hearing.\n\n54.\n\n[REDACTED] **The** Respondent did not make any post-hearing submissions.\n\n55.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated 5 July 2018, noting the absence of comment from the Respondent, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit a copy of the merits award in the *Everest* arbitration into the record and indicated that it would also find it useful to have access to an appellate decision of the Moscow City Court dated 22 September 2014, relating to the Tribunal\u2019s question No. 14 of 11 July 2017 (reproduced at paragraph 37 above).\n\n57.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal indicated that the address of the Department of International Law and Cooperation of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation would be added to the distribution list for all future correspondence in this matter.\n\n59.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n60.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n61.\n\nBy letter from the PCA dated 6 August 2018, the Tribunal took notice of the 24 July 2018 judgment of the English High Court in *PJSC Commercial Bank Privatbank v Igor Valeryevich Kolomoisky, Gennadiy Borisovich Bogolyubov, Teamtrend Limited, Trade Point Agro Limited, Collyer Limited, Rossyn Investing Corp, Milbert Ventures Inc and ZAO Ukrtransitservice Limited* [2018] EWHC 1910, which concerned proceedings by PrivatBank against, *inter alios,* its former shareholder Mr. Kolomoisky. The Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the relevance, if any, of the English proceedings and judgment for these proceedings. The Tribunal also invited the Claimants to confirm that counsel named above at paragraph 1 continued to represent the Claimants in these proceedings.\n\n62.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n63.\n\nBy letter from the PCA dated 3 December 2018, the Tribunal requested the Parties to introduce into the record of these proceedings a copy of Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 86-FZ \"On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia),\" 10 July 2002, and at the same time invited the Parties to comment on the currency and relevance of this law regarding the status and functions of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. [REDACTED] The Respondent did not make any submissions in this regard.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal sets out in outline the facts giving rise to this arbitration. Where relevant to this Award, the facts are discussed in greater detail in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis below.\n\n65.\n\nAs in the Interim Award, in this Award **\"Crimea\"** refers to the region known as the \"Autonomous Republic of Crimea\" under the Ukrainian Constitution and the \"Republic of Crimea\" under the Russian Constitution. **\"Sevastopol\"** or the **\"city of Sevastopol\"** refers to the city known as the \"city of special status Sevastopol\" under the Ukrainian Constitution and the \"city of federal significance Sevastopol\" under the Russian Constitution. Crimea and Sevastopol together are referred to as the **\"Crimean Peninsula.\"** Save where otherwise indicated, the Tribunal uses the translations of original Russian and Ukrainian documents provided by the Claimants. The Tribunal\u2019s use of the Claimants\u2019 translations should not be taken as an acceptance of the correctness of these translations, even if the Tribunal has raised a number of material issues arising from these translations in the course of the proceedings and addressed them as necessary in both the Interim Award and this Partial Award.\n\n**A.** **The Claimants and their Business in the Crimean Peninsula**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 1 above, the first claimant, PrivatBank, is a commercial banking institution registered in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine.6 [REDACTED]\n\nExtract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations of Ukraine, 1 April 2016 (CE-187).\n\n67.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n68.\n\nThe second claimant, Finilon, was registered as a company on 1 October 2013 and as a financial institution (other than a bank) on 24 October 2013.11 [REDACTED]\n\nExtract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations of Ukraine, 1 April 2016 (CE-188); Finilon Extract from the Financial Institutions Register [REDACTED]\n\n**B.** **The Crimean Events of February-March** **2014**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThese proceedings arise, in the first instance, out of the events in the Crimean Peninsula of February-March 2014.

Responding to questions from Crimean residents, President Putin stated:\n\nHere is an interesting question about the Crimean economy and banking system. The first part of the question concerns certain difficulties, including economic issues. The second part is as follows: \"I hired a car on lease from Privatbank. It will take me only two years to repay the loan. The car officially belongs to Avtoprivat Group in Kiev. Privatbank no longer operates in Crimea. What am I supposed to do?\"\n\nPlease use the car and don\u2019t worry. If Mr Kolomoisky and Mr Finkelstein don't want your money, it\u2019s their problem.\n\nBut another and more important question concerns private bank accounts, which is very serious. I would like to note that we have a database of Privatbank and Oschadbank depositors. We will of course act according to the data we have.

Chernevich filed with the court a claim, which included as a third party the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and was in defense of the interests of the general public, against the Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company, which has a National Bank of Ukraine license valid as of March 16, 2014, and performs banking in the territories of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, concerning the termination of unlawful acts involving the failure to fulfill obligations arising from bank deposit agreements, concerning the fulfillment of obligations arising from the bank deposit agreements entered into.\n\nAt the same time, the prosecutor filed with the court an application to grant injunctive relief as follows: compel the Commercial Bank Privatbank PAO, represented by the Crimea regional branch, to transfer the property complex consisting of movable and immovable property belonging to the Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company by right of ownership, as well as other rights arising from agreements (such as leasing agreements and other rights [including rights of claim]), to a trust office (based on a list of bank divisions) that operates until the conditions underlying the failure to fulfill the obligations of the bank to the depositors (creditors) no longer exist; name as trust manager of the property of the Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol (based on a list of bank divisions) the ANO [Autonomous Non-Profit Organization] Depositor Protection Fund (295000, Simferopol, 44-a Ul. Rubtsova), which operates pursuant to [the FZV Law].\n\nThe court, after reviewing that application, feels that it should be allowed.\n\nIn accordance with Article 23 of [the Incorporation Law], the legislative and other regulatory acts of the Russian Federation are operative in the territories of the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol as of the date of admission to the Russian Federation of the Republic of Crimea and the formation as part of the Russian Federation of the new entities, unless otherwise specified by this federal constitutional law.\n\nUnderstood as injunctive relief is the aggregate of measures guaranteeing the implementation of the court\u2019s decision in the event that the stated claims are satisfied, that is, the purpose of the measures is to protect the rights of the claimant in the event that the respondent acts in bad faith or that the failure to impose such measures could hinder or render impossible the execution of the court\u2019s decision, that is, the purpose is to prevent potential difficulties that could rise in connection with the execution of the decision.\n\nIn justification of the requested measures, the applicant cites that the Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company, which has been operating in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol for a long time, is failing to fulfill its obligations arising from bank deposit agreements entered into, and the refusal of the bank to fulfill its obligations provides grounds to assume that it could act in bad faith, primarily by means of alienating the property complex consisting of movable and immovable property belonging to the Bank by right of ownership, as well as rights arising from agreements and other rights (including rights of claim).\n\nIn addition, the applicant feels that if the court hands down a decision to allow the claim the applicant has filed, compliance by the Respondent with such a decision without the imposition of protective measures will be problematic.\n\nIn accordance with Article 139 of the RF Code of Civil Procedure, upon the statement of claim by parties participating in the case, the judge or the court may grant injunctive relief. Injunctive relief is allowed at any juncture if the failure to grant injunctive relief measures could hinder or render impossible execution of the decision of the court. [...]\n\nBased on the above, guided by Article 23 of [the Incorporation Law], as well as articles 139, 140, and 141 of the RF Code of Civil Procedure, the court\n\nRULES:\n\nThe application filed by Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Crimea S.B. Chernevich for injunctive relief is satisfied. The Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company (49094, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Dnepropetrovsk, 50 Ul. Naberezhnaya Pobedy), represented by the Crimea regional branch (295000, Simferopol, 1 Ul. Geroyev Adzhimushkaya), shall (1) transfer the property complex consisting of movable and immovable property belonging to the Commercial Bank Privatbank Public Joint-Stock Company by right of ownership, as well as other rights arising from agreements (such as leasing agreements and other rights, including rights of claim), to a trust office (based on a list of bank divisions) that operates until the conditions underlying the failure to fulfill the obligations of the bank to the depositors (creditors) no longer exist.\n\nThe ANO Depositor Protection Fund (295000, Simferopol, 44-a Ul.

The Respondent\u2019s Letters are reproduced in full at paragraphs 12-13 above.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent has made no submissions on the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims. The Tribunal\u2019s approach, having regard to the Respondent\u2019s failure to participate, is addressed at paragraphs 173-181 below.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONSIDERATIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\nA. Preliminary Considerations\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n169.\n\nThis Partial Award follows the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award of 24 February 2017, in which it decided that:\n\n1. the Russian Federation has assumed obligations under the Treaty in respect of the Claimants and their claimed investments in the Crimean Peninsula as of 21 March 2014;\n\n2. there is a dispute between the Parties arising in connection with what the Claimants allege to constitute \"investments\" under the Treaty; and\n\n3. the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal joined the consideration of all other issues of jurisdiction and admissibility to the second phase of the proceedings. Those issues are addressed in this Partial Award alongside the alleged breaches of the Treaty. The assessment of compensation due for these breaches has been deferred to a further phase of the arbitration.\n\n171.\n\nAs it noted in its Interim Award, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize once again that its mandate is defined and circumscribed by the Treaty. Although the issues in dispute in this case are in many instances linked to broader questions of public international law and inter-State relations, particularly those between the two Contracting Parties to the Treaty, the Tribunal is not called upon to decide such broader questions except insofar as authorized to do so by Article 9 of the Treaty and as may be necessary in order to decide the concrete claim that the Treaty has been breached by the Respondent entitling the Claimants to relief. The Tribunal notes therefore that this Partial Award does not reach any view on the legality or illegality under international law of the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula by the Russian Federation or on the sovereignty claims of Ukraine and the Russian Federation in respect of the Crimean Peninsula. None of the findings contained in this Partial Award or the Interim Award that has preceded it are intended to take any position on such matters.\n\n**2. Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n172.\n\nAs also noted in the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award, the Treaty is the primary source of law that the Tribunal is called upon to apply. As the Treaty contains no express provisions on applicable law or its own interpretation and application, the Tribunal is called upon to interpret the Treaty in accordance with the general rules of treaty interpretation set out in Articles 31-33 of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* (the **\"VCLT\"****),** to which both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are party and which in any event, so far as is material for present purposes, reflect customary international law. The Tribunal must also have regard to general international law, other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties, and any relevant and applicable national law insofar as the provisions of the Treaty direct the Tribunal to do so or where this is necessary to decide the dispute before the Tribunal.\n\n**3. The Respondent\u2019s non-participation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent has continued not to participate in these proceedings in this second phase of the arbitration. [REDACTED]\n\n174.\n\nArticle 28 of the UNCITRAL Rules addresses some of the consequences of non-participation by a party. Article 28(1) provides that \"[i]f, within the period of time fixed by the arbitral tribunal, the respondent has failed to communicate his statement of defence without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal shall order that the proceedings continue.\" Article 28(2) provides that, \"[i]f one of the parties, duly notified under these Rules, fails to appear at a hearing, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration.\" Pursuant to these provisions, after affording the Parties an opportunity to present their views, the Tribunal ordered that these proceedings continue, notwithstanding the Respondent\u2019s failure to file a statement of defence within the relevant time period, and proceeded with the arbitration despite the Respondent\u2019s failure to participate in the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility. The Tribunal thereafter proceeded to render its Interim Award.\n\n175.\n\nIn its Interim Award, the Tribunal noted that it remained open to the Russian Federation to participate in the second phase of these proceedings. The Respondent has not done so. The Tribunal has therefore proceeded with the arbitration despite the Respondent\u2019s failure to participate in the arbitration, including in either of the hearings held by the Tribunal.\n\n176.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal has continued to give the Russian Federation every opportunity to participate in these proceedings, and taken every measure to safeguard the Russian Federation\u2019s procedural rights notwithstanding its non-participation. As with the first phase of the arbitration, the Tribunal has, *inter alia,* in this phase of the proceedings:\n\n(i) ensured that all communications and materials submitted in the proceedings have been promptly delivered, both electronically and physically, to the Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the Netherlands in The Hague [REDACTED] also to the Department of International Law and Cooperation of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation;\n\n(ii) afforded the Russian Federation, as with the Claimants, an opportunity to express its views on each proposed procedural step throughout the proceedings;\n\n(iii) granted the Russian Federation equal and sufficient time to submit responses to the written pleadings and other communications from the Claimants;\n\n(iv) invited the Russian Federation, as with the Claimants, to comment on the proposed candidates and terms of reference for the independent experts on Russian and Ukrainian law subsequently appointed by the Tribunal;\n\n(v) provided the Russian Federation adequate notice of the hearings it has held;\n\n(vi) provided the Russian Federation, in a timely manner, with the transcripts and all other documents submitted in the course of these hearings; and\n\n(vii) provided an opportunity for, and invited, the Russian Federation to comment on anything said during these hearings.\n\n177.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the issues engaged in these proceedings, the Tribunal regrets that the Russian Federation has chosen not to participate in the proceedings to this point. Participation in the proceedings would have afforded the Russian Federation an opportunity to advance such arguments as it considered appropriate for consideration and evaluation by the Tribunal. Particularly having regard to the challenges that the Russian Federation has brought to set aside the awards of various other tribunals considering claims made by Ukrainian investors against the Russian Federation under the same Treaty, non-participation by the Russian Federation in these proceedings warrants particular note.\n\n**4. Burden of proof**\n----------------------\n\n178.\n\nArticle 28(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that, \"[i]f one of the parties, duly invited to produce documentary evidence, fails to do so within the established period of time, without showing sufficient cause for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence before it.\" According to Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\" Article 25(6) of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of the evidence offered.\" The combined effect of these provisions is that, as opposed to many national systems of law, the Tribunal may not simply accept a party\u2019s case by default, even where the opposing party does not participate in the proceedings, as has been the case here. As already expressed in its Interim Award, the Tribunal must rigorously examine and decide the claims before it in the light of all the available information, regardless of the non-participation of any party. A claimant cannot therefore prevail without meeting a minimum standard of proof, even if the burden shifts to the respondent at some point to establish that its conduct was permitted under the treaty or under international law more generally. In respect of the remaining questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal likewise reiterates that it must satisfy itself of its own competence to decide the claims put before it. As already decided in its Interim Award, the Tribunal considers that it is required to determine its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims, *proprio motu* if necessary, whether or not objections have been raised by the Respondent.219\n\n*See* *United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran (United States of America v. Iran),* Judgment of 24 May 1980, 1980 ICJ Reports 3, para. 33 (\"... in accordance with its settled jurisprudence, the Court, in applying Article 53 of its Statute, must first take up, *proprio motu,* any preliminary question, whether of admissibility or of jurisdiction, that appears from the information before it to arise in the case and the decision of which might constitute a bar to any further examination of the merits of the Applicant\u2019s case.\"); *South China Sea Arbitration (Philippines v*. *China),* PCA Case No. 2013-19, Award on Jurisdiction of 29 October 2015, para. 123 (\"... the Tribunal also stated that it would not confine itself to addressing only those issues raised in China\u2019s Position Paper and that, in line with its duty to satisfy itself of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal would consider other issues that might potentially pose an obstacle to the continuation of these proceedings.\"); *Spence International Investments et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award of 25 October 2016, para. 225. *See also* Military\u2019 and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America*),* Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, 1986 ICJ Reports 14, para. 29; *ICS Inspection and Control Services v*. *Argentine Republic,* PCA Case No. 2010-09, Award on Jurisdiction of 10 February 2012, para. 280; *Daimler Financial Services AG v*. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award of 22 August 2012, para. 175.\n\n179.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal must also take care to avoid prejudice to the Claimants from the non-participation of the Respondent. While the non-participation of the Respondent unavoidably gives rise to evidential and related issues for the proceedings, the Tribunal must in the first instance proceed on the basis that, absent a reason to doubt this, the Claimants\u2019 evidence is presented in good faith and that, subject to enquiry and scrutiny by the Tribunal going to admissibility, relevance and materiality, it can properly be accorded appropriate weight.\n\n180.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that it has not simply accepted without more the allegations, arguments and evidence of the Claimants. On the contrary, it has taken every available opportunity and measure to test the Claimants\u2019 case and to ensure that it has the information necessary to reach the findings contained in this Partial Award. These have included:\n\n(i) putting a series of 25 written questions to the Parties in advance of the jurisdictional and admissibility hearing on matters of both fact and law that the Tribunal considered not to have been sufficiently canvassed in the Claimants\u2019 submissions;\n\n(ii) the appointment of independent experts to report on issues of Ukrainian and Russian law, which had previously been addressed only by experts appointed by the Claimants;\n\n(iii) putting numerous questions to the Claimants\u2019 counsel as well as to the Claimants\u2019 and the Tribunal-appointed experts during the jurisdictional and admissibility hearing;\n\n(iv) inviting both Parties to address questions arising from the jurisdictional and admissibility hearing in post-hearing briefs;\n\n(v) deferring a decision on certain issues of jurisdiction and admissibility for further consideration in the second phase of the arbitration;\n\n(vi) further bifurcating the proceedings between a phase in which it would address the remaining questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as questions of liability, and, in the event that liability is established, a phase in which it would address questions of quantum of damages;\n\n(vii) putting a series of 15 further written questions to the Parties in advance of the merits hearing on matters of both fact and law that the Tribunal considered not to have been sufficiently canvassed in the Claimants\u2019 submissions;\n\n(viii) expanding upon the terms of reference of the Tribunal\u2019s independent expert to report on further issues of Russian law;\n\n(ix) putting numerous questions to the Claimants\u2019 counsel, to the Claimants\u2019 and the Tribunal-appointed experts on Russian law, and to the three witnesses of fact during the merits hearing (including 34 written questions to counsel);\n\n(x) inviting both Parties to address questions arising from the merits hearing in post-hearing briefs; and\n\n(xi) requesting copies of further documents discovered to be potentially relevant in the course of deliberations.\n\n181.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal has made broad use of its procedural powers under Articles 15, 17(2), 21(4), 22, 24(3) and 27 of the UNCITRAL Rules in order to scrutinize the Claimants\u2019 case, while at the same time providing the Claimants with a proper opportunity to meet their burden of proof. Having tested the evidence presented by the Claimants, the Tribunal is in a position to decide the extent to which such evidence may be relied upon and the weight to be accorded to it.\n\n**B.** **Outstanding Issues of Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nArticle 9(1) of the Treaty defines the scope of the disputes that may be submitted to an arbitral tribunal constituted under its terms, namely those \"between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party arising in connection with investments.\" In order to fall within the ambit of that phrase, the Claimants are required to establish three predicates to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction that the Tribunal joined to the merits in its Interim Award: (i) that the Claimants\u2019 \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1) of the Treaty; (ii) that the Claimants are \"investors of a Contracting Party\" within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Treaty; and (iii) that the dispute between the Parties arose \"in connection with\" those investments.220\n\nInterim Award, paras. 142, 207-208.\n\n**1. Whether the Claimants\u2019 \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1) of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThree conditions for the application of the Treaty arise from Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which is reproduced at paragraph 103 above. First, the \"investments\" from which the dispute arises must constitute tangible or intangible assets such as those categories of investments expressly enumerated in the sub-paragraphs to Article 1(1). Second, those \"investments\" must be \"invested ... in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\" Third, they must be investments \"in accordance with [the other Contracting Party\u2019s] legislation.\" These requirements are taken by the Tribunal in turn.\n\n**(a) Nature of the investment**\n--------------------------------\n\n184.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n185.\n\n[REDACTED] the Tribunal agrees, that each of the abovementioned items is covered under the categories set forth in the sub-paragraphs of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. PrivatBank\u2019s fixed assets fall within Article 1 (1)(a) as \"movable and immovable property, as well as any other related property rights.\" PrivatBank\u2019s financial assets fall within Article 1(1)(b) as \"monetary funds, as well as securities, commitments, stock and other forms of participation.\" Finally, PrivatBank\u2019s banking licence falls within Article 1(l)(d) as a \"right to engage in commercial activity.\" The Tribunal thus concludes that PrivatBank holds investments falling within the kinds of assets covered by Article 1 (1)(a)s \"investments\".\n\n186.\n\n[REDACTED] Unless the necessary in order to uphold its jurisdiction to decide the claims of PrivatBank, [REDACTED] Finilon\u2019s investments, if any, are purely derivative of PrivatBank\u2019s.\n\n187.\n\n[**REDACTED] As** the Tribunal concludes below, the Russian Federation had indeed expropriated PrivatBank\u2019s investment by the time [REDACTED] Accordingly, PrivatBank\u2019s investment had already been taken [REDACTED] Therefore, Finilon\u2019s claims fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. As a result, the remainder of this Award analyses only PrivatBank\u2019s investments under the Treaty and the breaches which are alleged to have affected those investments.\n\n**(b) Situs of the investment**\n-------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nEven if the nature of PrivatBank\u2019s investments is clearly encompassed by Article 1(1), it is not necessarily evident that all of those investments can be considered to have been \"invested ... in the territory of the [Russian Federation].\" PrivatBank\u2019s fixed assets are physically located in the Crimean Peninsula, and its banking license is given effect in the Crimean Peninsula through the combined operation of Russian and Ukrainian laws. However, determining the situs of PrivatBank\u2019s financial assets is more complex.\n\n189.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n190.\n\nWhile, in its Interim Award, the Tribunal found that, as of 21 March 2014, the Crimean Peninsula \"is to be treated for purposes of the application of the provisions of the Treaty as part of 'the territory of the Russian Federation,\u2019\"227 there remains a question as to whether PrivatBank\u2019s loans should be considered to be located in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nInterim Award, para. 195.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal raised this issue with the Claimants at the merits hearing:\n\n[W]hen we look at the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(1), if there was a loan due to PrivatBank in Crimea to a branch in Crimea, why was\u2014after the 21st of March, why was that a loan due to PrivatBank in Crimea rather than PrivatBank wherever?\n\n[...]\n\n[W]hen a loan was taken out, Individual X goes into a branch in Crimea and takes out a loan for the purchase of a car, why is that loan a\u2014if I can put it in these terms\u2014a Crimean loan rather than a Ukrainian loan which still rests with PrivatBank? In other words, it goes to the language of Article 1(1), \"invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\" Why is it a Crimean loan?228\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n192.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n193.\n\n[REDACTED]230 *Abaclat.* however, concerned sovereign bonds rather than retail banking loans. Given this, the Tribunal considers that the *Abaclat* reasoning is inapposite for purposes of its present analysis.231\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nAlthough the Tribunal is aware of another case involving private loans, *British Caribbean Bank Limited (Turks & Caicos) v. The Government of Belize,* the parties to that case appear to have both accepted the *Abaclat* majority\u2019s approach to locating the *situs* of the investment, but simply disagreed on its application to their case. *British Caribbean* *Bank Limited (Turks & Caicos) v*. *The Government of Belize,* PCA Case No. 2010-18, Award of 19 December 2014, para. 206.\n\n194.\n\nThe critical consideration in this case is that the evidence of personal or corporate residence or the location of collateral for PrivatBank\u2019s loans provides a clear and sufficient connection to the territory of the Crimean Peninsula. The astonishingly high level of default on the loans by Crimean borrowers after 21 April 2014, and PrivatBank\u2019s inability to collect on the loans, is further evidence of the situs of the loans.232 The Tribunal accordingly concludes that PrivatBank\u2019s loans, along with its other investments, constitute investments \"in the territory of\u2019 the Crimean Peninsula under Article 1(1) of the Treaty.\n\n*See paragraph 89* above. [REDACTED] Reuters, *Crimean savers ask: Where\u2019s our money?,* 20 November 2014 (CE-100).\n\n195.\n\nAlthough this is not a matter that requires decision in this Partial Award, a question that arises from the preceding analysis is how, if at all, this impacts upon the situs of PrivatBank\u2019s *deposits.* This issue will be relevant to the assessment in the next phase of the proceedings of the quantum of compensation due to the Claimants.\n\n**(c) Legality of the investment**\n----------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nPart of the definition under Article 1(1) of the Treaty is that \"investments\" are \"any kind of tangible and intangible assets invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting in accordance with its legislation.\"233\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal understands this \"in accordance with ... legislation\" or \"legality\" clause as requiring compliance with the law of the host State at the time when the investment is made. This reading is consistent with the view taken of this clause of the Treaty by the *Ukrnafta* and *Stabil* tribunal,234 as well as with the interpretation consistently given to such clauses in investment treaty jurisprudence (noting however that each interpretation is necessarily conditioned on the specific phrasing of the legality clause at hand).235\n\n*Ukrnafta,* Award on Jurisdiction of 26 June 2017, para. 218; *Stabil,* Award on Jurisdiction of 26 June 2017, para. 214.\n\n*See e.g.* *Gustav F W Homester GmbH & Co KG v*. *Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award of 18 June 2010, paras. 123-124; *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v*. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)04/6, Award of 16 January 2013, para. 167; *ECE Projektmanagement Int\u2019l GmbH v*. *Czech Republic,* PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award of 19 September 2013, paras. 3.165-3.166; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v*. *Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB 10/3, Award of 4 October 2013, paras. 185-193; *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v*. *Republic of the Philippines (II),* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/12, Award of 10 December 2014, para. 331; *Bernhard von Pezold and others v*. *Republic of Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award of 28 July 2015, para. 420; *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v*. *Republic of Ecuador,* PCA Case No. 2012-2, Award of 15 March 2016, paras. 5.54-5.56; *Vladislav Kim and others v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 March 2017, paras. 17, 373-377.\n\n198.\n\nIn its Interim Award, the Tribunal found that the Treaty became opposable to the Russian Federation as regards Ukrainian investors in the Crimean Peninsula on 21 March 2014 and that, as of that date, the Crimean Peninsula is to be treated for purposes of the application of the provisions of the Treaty as part of the \"territory of the Russian Federation.\"236 Accordingly, for purposes of Article 1(1), PrivatBank\u2019s investments are deemed to have been made in the territory of the Russian Federation as of 21 March 2014, such that the question for determination by the Tribunal with respect to the legality requirement is whether PrivatBank\u2019s investments were in accordance with Russian law as at that date.237\n\nInterim Award, para. 195.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s approach is consistent with that adopted in *Ukrnafta,* Award on Jurisdiction of 26 June 2017, para. 222; *Stabil,* Award on Jurisdiction of 26 June 2017, para. 218.\n\n199.\n\nFrom the perspective of Russian law, on 21 March 2014, PrivatBank\u2019s Crimean investments were situated on Russian territory and were therefore subject to the entire body of Russian law.238 At the same time, in the very same federal constitutional law by which it incorporated the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation (the Incorporation Law), the Russian Federation made specific provision for the integration of the new constituent entities into the Russian Federation.\n\n*See also* Federal Constitutional Law of the Russian Federation No. 6-FKZ, \"On Accepting the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and Establishing New Constituent Entities in the Russian Federation: the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol,\" 21 March 2014, Art. 23 (CE-230).\n\n200.\n\nFor present purposes, Articles 6, 10, 12 and 17 of the Incorporation Law are of particular relevance:\n\n**Article 6. Transition period**\n\nAs of the day the Republic of Crimea is accepted into the Russian Federation and new constituent entities are established in the Russian Federation and through January 1, 2015, a transitional period shall be in effect, during which issues shall be resolved regarding the integration of the new constituent entities of the Russian Federation into the economic, financial, credit and legal systems of the Russian Federation and into the system of state agencies of the Russian Federation.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 10. Functioning of State and Local Agencies, Enterprises and Organizations in the Republic of Crimea and the Federal city of Sevastopol**\n\nState and local agencies, enterprises and organizations functioning in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol as of the day the Republic of Crimea is accepted into the Russian Federation and new constituent entities are established in the Russian Federation shall continue to operate without changes to their previous form of incorporation until their legal status is decided under Russian Federation legislation.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 12. Validity of Documents Issued by State and other Official Agencies of Ukraine and by State and other Official Agencies of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol**\n\nDocuments issued by state and other official agencies of Ukraine, state and other official agencies of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, and state and other official agencies of the city of Sevastopol shall remain valid in the Republic of Crimea and federal city of Sevastopol, including documents confirming civil status, education, title, right of use, right to receive pensions, benefits, compensation and other forms of social payments, right to obtain medical care, and permit documents (licenses, except licenses to perform banking transactions and licenses (permits) for the operation of non-credit financial organizations). There is no limitation on the period of validity of such documents and no confirmation by state agencies of the Russian Federation, state agencies of the Republic of Crimea, or state agencies of the federal city of Sevastopol is required, unless otherwise required by the documents in question or the nature of the relationship.239\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 17. Organization of Banking in the Republic of Crimea and the Federal city of Sevastopol**\n\n1. As of the day the Republic of Crimea is accepted into the Russian Federation and new constituent entities are established in the Russian Federation, banking transactions in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol shall be performed by banks holding licenses from the Bank of Russia, except for the instance provided for in Part 2 of this Article.\n\n2. Prior to January 1, 2015, banks registered and/or engaging in banking activity in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol with licenses issued by the National Bank of Ukraine that were valid as of March 16, 2014 may perform banking transactions with consideration for specific issues established by Russian Federation legislation. Such banks may, prior to January 1, 2015, obtain Bank of Russia licenses using the procedure and on the terms established in Russian Federation legislation.\n\n[...]\n\nFederal Constitutional Law of the Russian Federation No. 6-FKZ, \"On Accepting the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation and Establishing New Constituent Entities in the Russian Federation: the Republic of Crimea and the Federal City of Sevastopol,\" 21 March 2014 (CE-230). While this law was repeatedly amended after 21 March 2014, its initial version is quoted here, being the only version relevant to a consideration of the legality requirement under Article 1(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal also notes that the Claimants have provided two translations of the Incorporation Law (CE-47 and CE-230), but does not consider the differences between the translations to be material for this case.\n\n201.\n\nThese provisions show an intention on the part of the Russian Federation explicitly to regularize the situation of Ukrainian entities and rights-holders under Ukrainian law, at least until the expiration of the transition period or until further legislation by the Russian Federation. The Incorporation Law thus appears to have been intended to avoid the potential for a \"legal vacuum\" in the period following 21 March 2014.\n\n202.\n\nMost significantly, Article 17(2) of the Incorporation Law provided for the continuing operation of banks in the Crimean Peninsula under licenses issued by the National Bank of Ukraine until 1 January 2015.240\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n203.\n\nMoreover, Article 12 of the Incorporation Law confirmed the validity under Russian law of documents issued by Ukrainian and Crimean authorities before the incorporation of the Crimean Peninsula into the Russian Federation \"confirming ... title, [and] right of use.\"241 Accordingly, it does not appear that the Incorporation Law required PrivatBank to take any action to secure or confirm its title or lease rights to fixed assets in the Crimean Peninsula.242 Professor Skvortsov and [REDACTED] the experts on Russian law respectively appointed by the Tribunal and by the Claimants, also indicated that contracts (such as loan agreements) validly entered into under Ukrainian law before the events of February-March 2014 remained valid in the Crimean Peninsula under Russian conflict of laws rules.243\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the exceptions to Article 12 set out in that provision are not applicable here.\n\n[REDACTED] The Tribunal notes the of contracts concluded in the Crimean Peninsula before its incorporation into the Russian Federation was eventually explicitly confirmed by Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 258-FZ \"On the Making of Amendments to Article 222 of the first part of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and to the Federal Law on Putting the First Part of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation into Effect,\" 13 July 2015, Art. 21(1) (CE-239).\n\n204.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Tribunal concludes that PrivatBank\u2019s investment, including fixed and monetary assets as well as its banking license, was in accordance with Russian law as at 21 March 2014, subject to two conditions. First, PrivatBank\u2019s rights to its investment must have been acquired in accordance with Ukrainian law. Second, these rights must not have been subject on that date to any limitation prevailing over the Incorporation Law and Russian conflict of laws rules.\n\n205.\n\nWith respect to the first condition, the Tribunal notes that [REDACTED] and Dr. Tsirat, the experts on Ukrainian law respectively appointed by the Claimants and by the Tribunal, expressly confirmed that PrivatBank\u2019s rights to its investment, including its banking licence, loan agreements and fixed assets, were validly acquired and held under Ukrainian law.244\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n206.\n\nAs for the second condition, the Tribunal is unaware of any limitation on PrivatBank\u2019s rights to its investments under Russian law as at 21 March 2014 that would have prevailed over the Incorporation Law and Russian conflict of laws rules.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal asked its Russian law expert, Professor Skvortsov, to analyse \"the status under Russian law of investments by Ukrainian nationals in Crimea and/or the Russian Federation in the period February 1, 2014 to April 15, 2015.\"245 In response, Professor Skvortsov raised two issues, which are addressed in turn below.\n\nProfessor Skvortsov\u2019s Expert Terms of Reference, 23 May 2016, para. 3.1.1.\n\n208.\n\nFirst, Professor Skvortsov opined that PrivatBank could not exercise its rights to its investment as of 1 January 2015, as the Crimean Banking Law of 2 April 2014 required that, to continue with their activities, Ukrainian banks register and obtain banking licences in Russia by 1 January 2015.246 The Tribunal notes that, according to Professor Skvortsov himself, these requirements entered into force only on 1 January 2015. Accordingly, just as any requirement of Russian law that arose after PrivatBank\u2019s investments are deemed to have been made in the Russian Federation on 21 March 2014, it is irrelevant to an assessment of legality under Article 1(1) of the Treaty. In any event, as will be seen below, 1 January 2015 is subsequent to the events invoked by the Claimants as the basis of their claim for expropriation.\n\nFirst Skvortsov Report, paras. 137-152; Second Skvortsov Report, pp. 6-8.[REDACTED]\n\n209.\n\nSecond, in his first report, Professor Skvortsov opined that:\n\nIn order for [assets invested in the Crimean Peninsula by Ukrainian investors before 1 February 2014] to be qualified as \"investments\" in the meaning of the [Treaty] and the [Russian Foreign Investment Law], they have to be reinvested (taken out the Russian Federation\u2019s economy and jurisdiction) and newly invested into the Russian Federation\u2019s economy subject to completing the admittance procedures established by the Russian law.247\n\nFirst Skvortsov Report, para. 133.\n\n210.\n\nAt the jurisdictional hearing, Professor Skvortsov further explained that, to be properly characterized as \"investments\" in the Russian Federation, PrivatBank\u2019s assets should have been taken out of and \"reinvested\" in the Crimean Peninsula, because \"investments is something that we put into\" through a \"fresh investment of money.\"248\n\nHearing Tr., 13 July 2016 at 255-256 (cross-examination of Professor Skvortsov).\n\n211.\n\nTo the extent that Professor Skvortsov\u2019s comment was informed by a view of the meaning of \"investments\" under the Treaty, it does not address a question of Russian law and can have no impact on the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of whether PrivatBank\u2019s investments were \"in accordance with ... legislation\" of the Russian Federation under Article 1(1) of the Treaty. Moreover, it would conflict with the findings already made by the Tribunal in its Interim Award regarding the proper interpretation of the Treaty under the VCLT.\n\n212.\n\nAs for Russian law, during the jurisdictional hearing, when questioned by the Claimants\u2019 counsel, Professor Skvortsov was unable to refer to any provision of Russian law in support of such a requirement.249 At the merits hearing, Professor Skvortsov explained that there was no mandatory requirement under Russian law for PrivatBank to \"re-invest\" its assets in the Russian Federation.250 He clarified that the re-investment was mentioned in previous testimony not as a requirement for compliance with Russian law but as one of the options open to PrivatBank to transform itself into a foreign investor \"in legal terms\"; that is, to give it the legal status of foreign investor under the Foreign Investment Law.251\n\nHearing Tr., 13 July 2016 at 252-253 (cross-examination of Professor Skvortsov). *See also* Hearing Tr., 2 November 2017 at 268:11-12 (examination of Professor Skvortsov) (\"This imperative requirement is not contained in the Russian legislation.\").\n\nHearing Tr., 2 November 2017 at 268:11-21. *See also* Second Skvortsov Report, p. 9, [REDACTED]\n\nHearing Tr., 2 November 2017 at 269:2-7, 270:4-15. See *also* Hearing Tr., 13 July 2016 at 277 (cross-examination of Professor Skvortsov).\n\n213.\n\nAs the Claimants in the present proceedings have neither made any claim under the Foreign Investment Law nor otherwise relied on that law, the Tribunal considers it irrelevant whether or not PrivatBank qualifies as a foreign investor under that law. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Professor Skvortsov\u2019s comment regarding the need for \"re-investment\" of PrivatBank\u2019s assets in the Crimean Peninsula has no bearing on its determination of whether PrivatBank\u2019s investments were in accordance with Russian law as at 21 March 2014.\n\n214.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal finds that PrivatBank\u2019s investments were \"in accordance with ... legislation\" of the Russian Federation as at 21 March 2014 and thus met the legality requirement set forth in Article 1(1) of the Treaty.\n\n**2. Whether PrivatBank is an \"investor of a Contracting Party\" within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the Treaty, reproduced in full at paragraph 103 above, sets out the Treaty\u2019s definition of the phrase \"investor of a Contracting Party.\" As noted in the Interim Award, the questions for the Tribunal pursuant to this provision are whether Privatbank is (i) a \"legal entity constituted in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory of [Ukraine]\"; and (ii) \"competent in accordance with the legislation of [Ukraine], to make investments in the territory of the [Russian Federation].\"252\n\nInterim Award, para. 198.\n\n216.\n\nHaving reviewed the documents submitted by the Claimants and the evidence of the experts on Ukrainian law, [REDACTED] and Dr. Tsirat, the Tribunal is satisfied that PrivatBank is a legal entity constituted in accordance with Ukrainian law. The Claimants have shown that PrivatBank has been registered in Ukraine\u2019s Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations since 27 January 2005.253 The Tribunal notes that, according to the Ukrainian law experts, all records introduced in this register may be treated as reliable.254 The Claimants have also shown that PrivatBank was registered in Ukraine\u2019s State Register of Banks, in addition to holding a banking license issued by the National Bank of Ukraine.255\n\nExtract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities, Sole Proprietorships and Civic Organizations, 1 April 2016 (CE-187). [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nNational Bank of Ukraine, Banking License No. 22 issued on 19 March 1992, later re-issued on 5 October 2011 (CE-16); Extract from the State Register of Banks [REDACTED]\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that PrivatBank\u2019s nationalisation by Ukraine in 2016, and its recent reorganization, have no impact on its status as an \"investor\" under the Treaty, as these events took place after both the Treaty breaches (as will be seen below) and the commencement of these proceedings.\n\n218.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal considers, as also supported by jurisprudence,256 that, even if PrivatBank had been a State-owned entity at any of the times relevant to a jurisdictional assessment, this circumstance would not have affected the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, as there is nothing in the Treaty that would deprive State-owned enterprises acting in their commercial capacity of access to investor-State arbitration under Article 9 of the Treaty. On the contrary, as held by the Paris Court of Appeal in review of an award in favour of a State-owned claimant under the same Treaty at issue in these proceedings, \"[i]t results neither from [Article 31 of the VCLT], nor from any principles of interpretation, that it is appropriate to make a distinction where the text does not; therefore, there is no basis to add to Article 1.2 of the [Treaty] a requirement, which this provision does not contain, regarding the 'private\u2019 character of the investor.\"257 The Tribunal accepts this analysis. After its nationalisation, PrivatBank remained a Ukrainian legal entity and its charter, approved by the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, stated that it was a \"commercial bank\" and a \"legal entity under private law, formed in accordance with the laws of Ukraine.\"258\n\nSee *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999, para. 17; *The State of Ukraine v*. *OAO Tatneft,* Paris Court of Appeal, Case No. 14/17964 (joined with Case No. 14/20245), Judgment of 29 November 2016, paras. 15-17.\n\n*The State of Ukraine v. OAO Tatneft,* Paris Court of Appeal, Case No. 14/17964 (joined with Case No. 14/20245), Judgment of 29 November 2016, para. 15.\n\nCharter of PrivatBank, 19 April 2017, as approved by Order of the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine No. 409 dated 3 April 2017, title and Art. 2.1 (CE-327).\n\n219.\n\nAs for the requirement under Article 1(2) of the Treaty that PrivatBank be \"competent in accordance with the legislation of [its] Contracting Party, to make investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\" the Tribunal found in its Interim Award that it is a requirement of capacity to enter into certain legal relations, which PrivatBank has met at all relevant times.259\n\nInterim Award, para. 201.\n\n220.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal observed that its understanding of the \"competency\" requirement is based on the revised translation of the Treaty provided by the Claimants, while their first translation, which refers to investors being \"legally authorized\", rather than \"competent\", to make investments, might suggest that, beyond the question of capacity, the Tribunal should also investigate whether any restrictions applied under Ukrainian law to the making of investments by PrivatBank in the Crimean Peninsula. In the Interim Award, some aspects of this question were deferred to the next stage of the proceedings.260 Having now fully considered this question, the Tribunal is in a position to conclude that PrivatBank was legally authorized to make investments in the Crimean Peninsula at all relevant times.\n\nInterim Award, para. 202.\n\n221.\n\nSimilarly to its finding in the Interim Award in respect of Finilon, the Tribunal accepts the expert evidence that Ukrainian law did not contain any prohibition on PrivatBank making or maintaining investments in the Crimean Peninsula.261 Further, having considered the experts\u2019 evidence concerning two specific resolutions of the National Bank of Ukraine (Resolution No. 699 dated 3 November 2014 and Resolution No. 260 dated 6 May 2014),262 the Tribunal finds that neither of these resolutions deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over PrivatBank.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nResolution of the National Bank of Ukraine No. 699 \"On Application of Certain Rules of Currency Legislation during Temporary Occupation in the Territory of the Free Economic Zone 'Crimea\u2019,\" 3 November 2014 [REDACTED] National Bank of Ukraine Regulation No. 260 \"On Revocation and Cancellation of Banking Licenses and General Licenses for Conducting Operations with Foreign Currency of Certain Banks and Termination of Branches Located in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and City of Sevastopol,\" 6 May 2014 [REDACTED]\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found in its Interim Award, on the basis of expert evidence, that Resolution No. 699 \"should be understood as prohibiting only monetary transfers to the Crimean Peninsula and only those made after the Resolution came into force.263\" It is therefore plain that PrivatBank was not in breach of this resolution, as its investments in the Crimean Peninsula (monetary or otherwise) were all made (and, as will be seen below, expropriated) before the resolution came into force.\n\nInterim Award, para. 203.\n\n223.\n\nSimilarly, Resolution No. 260, which mandated Ukrainian banks to terminate the operations of their Crimean branches within a month of its entry into force on 6 May 2014,264 is irrelevant to a determination of PrivatBank\u2019s status as an \"investor.\" As will be seen below, Resolution No. 260 also came into force only after the expropriation of PrivatBank\u2019s investments and the resulting cessation of its banking operations in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nNational Bank of Ukraine Regulation No. 260 \"On Revocation and Cancellation of Banking Licenses and General Licenses for Conducting Operations with Foreign Currency of Certain Banks and Termination of Branches Located in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and City of Sevastopol,\" 6 May 2014 [REDACTED] para. 5.\n\n224.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that PrivatBank is an \"investor of a Contracting Party\" within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the Treaty.\n\n**3. Whether the dispute between the Parties arose \"in connection with\" PrivatBank\u2019s investments**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nIn its Interim Award, the Tribunal found that there exists a dispute between the Parties within the meaning of Article 9 of the Treaty, arising in connection with what the Claimants consider to be their protected investments under the Treaty.265 [REDACTED]\n\nInterim Award, para. 210.\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal has now also found that PrivatBank\u2019s claimed \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1). It follows that there exists a dispute between the Parties within the meaning of Article 9 of the Treaty, arising in connection with PrivatBank\u2019s investments.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n227.\n\nIn its Interim Award, the Tribunal found that: (i) the Russian Federation has assumed obligations under the Treaty in respect of Ukrainian investors and their investments in the Crimean Peninsula as of 21 March 2014; (ii) there is a dispute between the Parties arising in connection with what the Claimants allege to constitute \"investments\" under the Treaty; and (iii) the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.268\n\nInterim Award, p. 75.\n\n228.\n\nIn the preceding sections of this Award, the Tribunal, while finding that Finilon\u2019s claims fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, has further concluded that: (i) PrivatBank\u2019s \"investments\" fall within the definition of that term in Article 1(1); (ii) PrivatBank is an \"investor of a Contracting Party\" for the purposes of Article 1(2) of the Treaty; and (iii) the dispute between the Parties arose \"in connection with\" PrivatBank\u2019s investments.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious that some investment treaty tribunals have considered that, in order to qualify as protected investments, invested assets must also meet criteria arising from an inherent or objective meaning of the term \"investment\", such as risk, duration and an allocation of resources to the host State.269 The definition of \"investment\" under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, addressed above, leaves little room for a conclusion that any further conditions for the application of the Treaty were intended by the Contracting Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that, to the extent that any such criteria are relevant under the Treaty, the Tribunal finds that they are fully met by PrivatBank\u2019s investment.\n\nRegarding the inherent meaning of the term \"investment\" in a non-ICSID case see, for example, *Romak S.A. v*. *The Republic of Uzbekistan,* PCA Case No. 2007-07, Award of 26 November 2009, para. 207.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there remains a residual jurisdictional issue that arises in connection with PrivatBank\u2019s resort to local remedies. The Tribunal addresses that issue at paragraphs 299-300 below. In the light of the preceding analysis, and subject to its further conclusion on that particular issue below, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over all of PrivatBank\u2019s claims and that all of PrivatBank\u2019s claims are admissible.\n\n**C.** **Alleged Breaches of the** **BIT**\n------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the merits of PrivatBank\u2019s claims under the Treaty. [REDACTED] In view of this submission, the Tribunal addresses the Article 5 claim first, before turning to the claims under Articles 2 and 3.\n\n**1. Article 5 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nArticle 5 of the Treaty, reproduced in full at paragraph 104 above, prohibits the expropriation of investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except in compliance with the conditions enumerated in that article.\n\n233.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that it considers PrivatBank\u2019s investments in the Crimean Peninsula, as identified at paragraph 184 above, to constitute, as of 21 March 2014, \"investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\" within the meaning of Article 5 of the Treaty. The Tribunal has queried whether the specific phrasing of this article imposes an additional temporal requirement for its application beyond those already canvassed under Article l.271 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it does not. In its Interim Award, the Tribunal has already held that \"the context of the Treaty as a whole discloses an overall intention to cover all qualifying investments, without regard to when or how such investments may have become qualifying investments under the Treaty.\"272 In these circumstances, it would be highly unusual for Article 5 to protect only a subset of the investments covered by the Treaty as a whole. Having found that PrivatBank and its investments fall within the scope of the application of the Treaty under Article 1 thereof, it follows, in the view of the Tribunal, that PrivatBank is entitled to the Treaty\u2019s protections in respect of its Crimean investments, including under Article 5.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nInterim Award, para. 230.\n\n234.\n\nIn order to determine whether there has been a breach of Article 5 in respect of PrivatBank\u2019s investments, the Tribunal must determine whether these investments were expropriated and, if they were expropriated, whether the expropriation complied with the conditions set out in Article 5. Before addressing these questions in turn below, the Tribunal will also consider whether the alleged expropriatory measures were attributable to the Russian Federation. Finally, if the answer to these three questions is in the affirmative, the Tribunal will consider the question of local remedies.\n\n**(a) Whether the alleged expropriatory conduct is attributable to the Russian Federation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\n[REDACTED] The Tribunal examines the character of the individuals who seized PrivatBank\u2019s offices and cash vaults (referred to in item (i) above) in detail below, as this requires some elaboration. First, however, the Tribunal addresses the conduct of the actors under items (ii), (iii) and (iv).\n\n236.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the conduct of each of the actors listed under items (ii), (iii) and (iv) in the immediately preceding paragraph is undeniably attributable to the Russian Federation. Under customary international law, as reflected in Article 4 of the ILC Articles, \"[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\" Moreover, \"[a]n organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\"\n\n237.\n\nThe Central Bank of the Russian Federation qualifies without a doubt as a State organ under this definition. It is the highest authority in the Russian Federation on monetary regulation, carries out Russian monetary policy, supervises the commercial banking and national payment systems, and channels 75 percent of its profit into the Russian budget.273 Accordingly, its conduct in issuing the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution is attributable to the Russian Federation.\n\nConstitution of the Russian Federation, Art. 75, as reprinted in Peter B. Maggs, Olga Schwartz, and William Bumham, \"Constitution\" in Law and Legal System of the Russian Federation (6th ed. 2015) (CE-107); Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 86-FZ \"On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia),\" 10 July 2002, Arts. 4, 26 (CE-379).\n\n238.\n\nAs regards the Crimean authorities\u2014*i.e.,* the Simferopol Central District Court and the State Council of the Republic of Crimea\u2014they became State organs of the Russian Federation at the latest on 21 March 2014, when the Russian Federation enacted the Incorporation Law providing for the admittance into the Russian Federation of two new constituent entities\u2014the Republic of Crimea and the federal city Sevastopol.274 With respect to State agencies and courts in the new constituent entities, the Incorporation Law (as amended on 27 May 2014 and in force during the remainder of 20 1 4)275 provided:\n\n**Article 7. Creation of state agencies of the Republic of Crimea and the federal city Sevastopol.**\n\n1. Elections to the State Council of the Republic of Crimea (the parliament of the Republic of Crimea) and the Legislative Assembly of the city of Sevastopol shall be held on the second Sunday in September 2014. [...]\n\n2. Prior to the election of state agencies in the Republic of Crimea and in the federal city of Sevastopol, such functions shall be performed, respectively, by the State Council of the Republic of Crimea (parliament of the Republic of Crimea), the Council Of Ministers of the Republic of Crimea, and the Legislative Assembly of the city of Sevastopol.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 9. Establishment of Russian Federation Courts in the Republic of Crimea and the Federal city of Sevastopol. Administration of Justice during the Transition Period**\n\n1. During the transition period, Russian Federation courts (federal courts) shall be established in accordance with Russian Federation court system legislation in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, with regard for the administrative and territorial division established by the legislative (representative) state authority of the Republic of Crimea and the legislative (representative) state authority of the federal city of Sevastopol, respectively.\n\n[...]\n\n5. Prior to the creation of Russian Federation courts in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol, justice shall be administered in these regions on behalf of the Russian Federation by the courts in existence on the day the Republic of Crimea is accepted into the Russian Federation and new constituent entities are established in the Russian Federation.\n\n[...]\n\nIncorporation Law, Arts. 1, 2 (CE-253).\n\nBetween 21 March and 21 May 2014, the only difference with the provision quoted here was that Article 7(1) provided: \"Elections to the governing bodies of the Republic of Crimea and the governing bodies of the federal city of Sevastopol shall be held on the second Sunday of September 2015.\"\n\n239.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal has no difficulty concluding that the conduct of the Simferopol Central District Court in issuing the 21 April 2014 Court Decision and of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea in issuing the amendments of 3 September and 9 October 2014 to the Nationalisation Decree is attributable to the Russian Federation.\n\n240.\n\nAs regards item (i) in paragraph 235 above, the question of whether the conduct of the individuals who seized PrivatBank\u2019s offices and cash vaults in Sevastopol and Simferopol on 18 and 19 April 2014 is less straightforward. [REDACTED]\n\n241.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the conduct in question is attributable to the Russian Federation under the customary international law tests reflected in Articles 5 and 11 of the ILC Articles. Article 5 of the ILC Articles provides:\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\n\n242.\n\nArticle 5 sets two conditions for attribution\u2014that the person or entity at issue be \"empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority\" and be \"acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\" The commentary to Article 5 mentions \"police powers\" as an \"element of governmental authority.\"278\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, included in the Report of the International Law Commission to the General Assembly, Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), pp. 42-43.\n\n243.\n\nAlthough the individuals carrying out the seizures of 18 and 19 April 2014 did not introduce themselves or specifically state on whose authority they were acting, the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient evidence, as described below, to conclude that these individuals were empowered by Russian law to exercise elements of the governmental authority and were acting in that capacity in these particular instances.\n\n244.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n245.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the seizures of the offices and vaults are also telling. The seizures began on the very day when the oversight committee of the Russian Central Bank took the internal decision (which prompted the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution) to prohibit any further operations in the Crimean Peninsula by PrivatBank.284 Moreover, on 21 April 2014, the mid-management employees of PrivatBank were asked to gather at the main office in Simferopol, which had been sealed off on 18 April, to meet with representatives of the FZV, a fund created pursuant to a federal law of the Russian Federation (the FZV Law) principally to acquire the rights of, and pay compensation to, depositors of Crimean banks the operations of which were terminated by the Russian Central Bank.285 [REDACTED] The RNKB, a Russian State-owned bank, is one of the two banks (the other being Genbank) which eventually began operating from PrivatBank\u2019s branch offices in the Crimean Peninsula.287\n\nResolution of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation No. PH-33-1 \"On Terminating the Activities of Standalone Business Units of the Public Joint Stock Company PrivatBank Commercial Bank of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine on the territory of the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol, a City of Federal Significance,\" 21 April 2014(CE-60).\n\nFederal Law of the Russian Federation No. 39-FZ \"On the Protection of the Interests of Natural Persons Having Deposits in Banks and Bank Standalone Business Units Registered and (or) Operating in the Republic of Crimea and in the Federal City of Sevastopol,\" 2 April 2014, Arts. 4, 6-8 (CE-258).\n\n[REDACTED] Annual Report Of The Autonomous Non-Profit Organization (Depositor Protection Fund), 2014, p. 12 (CE-251 (expanded)) (showing that the FZV leased former PrivatBank branches to the RNKB); European Council for Foreign Relations, *In the ashes of empire: Life in Crimea since the annexation,* 15 January 2016 (CE-367) (\"The creation of RNKB is perhaps the most striking example of a hybrid Ukrainian-Russian enterprise. Most of its departments were expropriated from PrivatBank and reformatted under new corporate standards. Many branches retained the same design and only the signs were replaced. PrivatBank cash machines became RNKB cash machines (if not the technical equipment itself, then at least the location). The new state bank even took over the same financial functions as PrivatBank (paying out salaries and benefits, processing invoices for state departments, etc.)\"). From 1 April to 1 July 2014, RNKB\u2019s reported assets increased from 1.9 billion rubles to 19.2 billion rubles.

As noted by the Claimants, on 11 March 2014, the Crimean Supreme Council issued an order regarding the \"People\u2019s Militia of Crimea\" (the Militia Order), which it defined as:\n\na volunteer public formation of inhabitants of Crimea that was created to assist law-enforcement authorities, other authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and local government authorities in the protection of law and order, public safety and the rights and legitimate interests of citizens in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.288\n\nSupreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Order No. 1734-6/14 \"Statute on the People\u2019s Militia of Crimea,\" 11 March 2014, Section I, Art. 1 (CE-257).\n\n247.\n\nThe Militia Order further provided that the People\u2019s Militia would, \"jointly with officers of law-enforcement authorities,\" perform, *inter alia,* the following functions:\n\nparticipate in protecting public law and order and in preventing and stopping violations of the law;\n\nparticipate in actions to ensure that the property of citizens and legal entities is kept secure;\n\nparticipate in maintaining traffic and pedestrian safety and in preventing traffic accidents;\n\n[...]\n\nparticipate in maintaining public order during natural disasters and other emergencies;\n\n[...]\n\nparticipate in other actions related to protecting public order and public safety.\n\n[...]\n\nparticipating in patrols and setting up posts on streets, squares, in parks and other public places, and conducting raids to uncover and stop violations of the law;\n\n[...]\n\ndelivering offenders to internal-affairs authorities.289\n\nSupreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Order No. 1734-6/14 \"Statute on the People\u2019s Militia of Crimea,\" 11 March 2014, Section II, Arts. 2-3 (CE-257).\n\n248.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was in charge of financing and oversight in respect of the People\u2019s Militia.290\n\nSupreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Order No. 1734-6/14 \"Statute on the People\u2019s Militia of Crimea,\" 11 March 2014, Section IV and V (CE-257).\n\n249.\n\nThe above circumstances suffice for the Tribunal to conclude that the individuals carrying out the seizures of 18 and 19 April 2014 were empowered by Russian law to exercise elements of the governmental authority and were acting in that capacity in these particular instances, as required by Article 5 of the ILC Articles.\n\n250.\n\nMoreover, under the test reflected in Article 11 of the ILC Articles, \"[c]onduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.\" In the present case, the Tribunal considers that the Russian Federation has acknowledged and adopted as its own the acts of the individuals who seized PrivatBank\u2019s offices and vaults on 18 and 19 April 2014 when: (i) the FZV took physical control of PrivatBank\u2019s premises (as described at paragraph 245 above); and (ii) the Simferopol Central District Court (through its decisions of 21 April, 4 June and 16 September 2014) ordered the transfer of all of PrivatBank\u2019s assets to the FZV (as described at paragraphs 88, 94 and 97 above and 262-263 below).291 Thus, to the extent that there may be any doubt remaining as to the identity and role of these individuals under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Tribunal concludes that their conduct remains attributable to the Russian Federation under Article 11 of the ILC Articles.\n\nDecision of the Simferopol Central District Court, 21 April 2014 (CE-62); Decision of the Simferopol Central District Court, Case No. 2-311/14, 4 June 2014 (CE-275); Decision of the Simferopol Central District Court, Case No. 2-311/14, 3 July 2014 (CE-281).\n\n**(b) Whether PrivatBank\u2019s investments in the Crimean Peninsula were expropriated**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Treaty provides that investments of foreign investors \"shall not be expropriated, nationalized or subject to other measures equivalent in effect to expropriation.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this language encompasses both the deprivation of title to property and any other measures having an effect equivalent to deprivation of title, such as those which render title useless or deprive the owner of the benefit and economic use of the property. This conclusion follows from the plain language of Article 5 and is consistent with long-settled jurisprudence addressing the question of expropriation, ranging from *Starrett Housing292* to *Santa Elena293* and more recent investment treaty jurisprudence.\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc. and Starrett Housing International, Inc. v*. *The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bank Markazi Iran, Bank Omran and Bank Mellat,* IUSCT Case No. 24, Interlocutory Award of 19 December 1983.\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000.\n\n252.\n\nThus, in a frequently cited passage from *Starrett Housing,* the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal held that\n\nit is recognised in international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.294\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc. and Starrett Housing International. Inc. v*. *The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Bank Markazi Iran, Bank Omran and Bank Mellat,* IUSCT Case No. 24, Interlocutory Award of 19 December 1983, pp. 19-20 (emphasis added).\n\n253.\n\nIn similar fashion, the tribunal in *Santa Elena* stated that \"a property has been expropriated when the effect of the measures taken by the state has been to deprive the owner of title, possession or access to the benefit and economic use of his property.\"295\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v*. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000, para. 77.\n\n254.\n\nTribunals in subsequent investment treaty arbitrations, while using slightly different formulations from case to case, have also consistently held that an expropriation arises, even if the owner is not deprived of title, when the interference with the investment is such as \"substantially to deprive the investor of the economic value, use or enjoyment of its investment.\"296 These have included cases interpreting and applying provisions of investment treaties containing definitions of expropriation similar (if not identical) to the definition found in Article 5(1) of the Treaty. For example, some of these tribunals interpreted and applied Article 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which refers to \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation,\"297 while others interpreted and applied Article 1110 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which refers to \"measures tantamount to nationalization or expropriation,\"298 with the word \"tantamount\" having been consistently understood to have the same meaning as \"equivalent\".299\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications A.S. v.

Under international law, the owner is also deprived of property where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted or interfered with to a similar extent, even where legal ownership over the assets in question is not affected, and so long as the deprivation is not temporary.

Without the ability to manage its Crimean business, which was lost upon the seizure of its main offices in Sevastopol and Simferopol on 18-19 April 2014, and without the right to pursue its activities in the Crimean Peninsula, of which it was deprived by the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution, PrivatBank was, in the words of the *Santa Elena* tribunal, substantially deprived of \"access to the benefit and economic use\"310 of its entire investment. As of the issuance of the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution, although PrivatBank may have nominally retained title to real estate and contractual rights under its loan agreements, this property had little residual value to it.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v*. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award of 17 February 2000, para. 77.\n\n261.\n\n[REDACTED] The 21 April 2014 Court Decision (reproduced in relevant part in paragraph 88 above), transferred \"the property complex consisting of movable and immovable property belonging to [Privatbank] by right of ownership, as well as other rights arising from agreements (such as leasing agreements and other rights, including rights of claim)\" to the FZV as a \"trust manager\".311\n\nDecision of the Simferopol Central District Court, 21 April 2014 (CE-62).\n\n262.\n\nOn its face, the 21 April 2014 Court Decision granted \"injunctive relief\u2019, which it explained is available when \"the failure to impose such measures could hinder or render impossible the execution of the court\u2019s decision, that is, the purpose is to prevent potential difficulties that could rise in connection with the execution of the decision.\"312 The Tribunal\u2019s expert on Russian law opined that such decisions \"do not decide a case on the merits\" and are \"always of a temporary nature,\" as they \"cease upon completion of the legal proceedings.\"313 Nevertheless, the Tribunal observes that, in the present case: (i) the 21 April 2014 Court Decision stated that the injunctive relief would continue \"until the conditions underlying the failure to fulfill the obligations of the bank to the depositors (creditors) no longer exist,\" thus apparently prejudging the outcome of the case;314 (ii) the final decision on the merits rendered in this case on 16 September 2014,315 did not either terminate the injunctive relief or transform it into a permanent order,316 and (iii) no assets were in fact returned to PrivatBank. The FZV\u2019s annual report for 2014 thus stated that it continued to \"manage\" the property complex of PrivatBank, from which, as at 1 January 2015, it leased to other banks: (i) 36 items of real property; (ii) personal property at 131 branches; (iii) 28 vehicles; (iv) 481 ATMs; and (v) 769 self-service terminals.317 For these reasons, the 21 April 2014 Court Decision could indeed be seen as an expropriatory measure with respect to PrivatBank\u2019s \"property complex\", as identified in that decision. However, as the Tribunal has concluded that PrivatBank\u2019s entire business was already expropriated through the combined effect of the physical seizures of PrivatBank\u2019s main offices and the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution, the Tribunal need not finally resolve whether the 21 April 2014 Court Decision constituted an expropriation under the Treaty.\n\nDecision of the Simferopol Central District Court, 21 April 2014 (CE-62).\n\nSecond Skvortsov Report, pp. 21-22.\n\nDecision of the Simferopol Central District Court, 21 April 2014 (CE-62).\n\nThe only copy of the 21 April 2014 Decision made available to the Tribunal does not identify the reference number of the case. It can be inferred, however, that the 21 April 2014 Decision and the decision of 16 September 2014 pertained to the same matter, as they were rendered by the same judge, and as another decision, of 4 June 2014, also by the same judge, provides the missing link. The case reference number of the decisions of 4 June and 16 September 2014 is clearly stated as \"2-311/2014\", and the decision of 4 June 2014 states that it grants an application for the replacement of interim measures under \"a ruling dated 04/21/2014 in Case No. 2-311/2014\"\u2014 a clear reference to the 21 April 2014 Decision.\n\nDecision of the Simferopol Central District Court, Case No. 2-311/14, 16 September 2014 (CE-89).\n\nFZV Annual Report 2014, pp. 11-13 (CE-251 (expanded)).\n\n263.\n\nOther subsequent measures taken by the Russian Federation also did little more than confirm an expropriation that had already occurred. Insofar as the amendments to the Nationalisation Decree of 3 September and 9 October 2014 specifically provided that a number of immovable properties belonging to PrivatBank \"shall be considered the property of the Republic of Crimea,\" these acts built on measures equivalent in effect to expropriation that had already taken place in the period of 18-21 April 2014.318 The same is true of the 16 December 2014 decision of the Simferopol Central District Court, to the extent that it rendered permanent a taking that had been only provisional pursuant to its 21 April 2014 Decision.\n\nNationalisation Decree and Amendments dated 3 September 2015 to 27 February 2015 (CE-88); Statement of Claim, Annex A.\n\n**(c) Whether the expropriation complied with the conditions set forth in Article 5**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nPursuant to Article 5(1) of the Treaty, expropriation is unlawful \"except in cases where such [expropriatory] measures are taken in the public interest under due process of law, are not discriminatory and are accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\" As is apparent from its phrasing, the conditions set out in this article are cumulative, such that, for an expropriation to be considered lawful, it must meet each of the enumerated conditions.319\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with investment treaty jurisprudence. *See e.g.* Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic (Vivendi II), ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award of 20 August 2007, para. 7.5.21 (\"If we conclude that the challenged measures are expropriatory, there will be violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, even if the measures might be for a public purpose and non-discriminatory, because no compensation has been paid.\"); *Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter and others v.

As reported in the 3 September 2014 press release of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea:\n\nA resolution was passed at an extraordinary session of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea, concerning questions of managing of the republic\u2019s property. While presenting the document to the deputies, acting Head of the Republic of Crimea, Chairman of the Crimean Government, Sergey Aksenov noted that the owner of PrivatBank, Igor Kolomoysky, has not fulfilled his obligations to the Crimeans in terms of returning funds from personal accounts and deposits. \"We promised Crimeans that all debts that cannot be paid off through the depositors\u2019 protection fund, we will pay off at the expense of the property of the founders of PrivatBank, in particular, Mr. Kolomoisky,\" S. Aksenov stressed, adding that I. Kolomoisky is one of the initiators and financiers of the ATO [Anti-Terror Operation] measures in the South-East of Ukraine, where our fellow citizens are being killed. \"I believe that it is our moral right and our moral duty to carry out such nationalization,\" said the Head of the Republic.\u2014 After that, the property belonging to Mr. Kolomoisky will be sold, and these funds will go towards repaying the accounts of \"PrivatBank\" depositors exceeding 700 thousand rubles, which do not fall under the law \"On the return of deposits of the Russian Federation.\"337\n\nState Council of the Republic of Crimea Press Release, *Property Belonging to the Ukrainian Oligarch Kolomoisky will be Nationalized in Crimea,* 3 September 2014 (CE-334). The allegations regarding Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s activities in Eastern Ukraine were described in detail in a decision of the Moscow City Court, ordering the seizure of a building associated with Mr. Kolomoisky because \"the profit derived from leasing the spaces in this building can be used by I.V.

Kolomoisky, whose fighters were involved in the murder of Russian journalists in Ukraine.\" Moscow City Court Decision No. 10-13158/2014, 22 September 2014 (CE-376).\n\n274.\n\nThese statements were consistent with views expressed by President Putin in the 17 April 2014 interview referred to by the Claimants:\n\nBut another and more important question concerns private bank accounts, which is very serious. I would like to note that we have a database of Privatbank and Oschadbank depositors. We will of course act according to the data we have. But the decision is almost made, so if people lose any money they have in their accounts we will repay them up to 700,000 roubles in line with Russian laws.338\n\nOfficial Website of the President of the Russian Federation, *Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.* 17 April 2014 (CE-58).\n\n275.\n\nThe materials cited above point to two potential public interests: (i) to hinder Mr. Kolomoisky\u2019s alleged aggressive activities in Eastern Ukraine; and (ii) to protect and compensate depositors towards whom PrivatBank allegedly failed to fulfil its obligations.\n\n276.\n\nOverall, what is clear from the evidentiary record is that the Respondent and the administering authorities and agencies had an animus toward Mr. Kolomoisky. That animus evidently affected the Respondent\u2019s attitude toward PrivatBank and, perhaps, although this is ultimately a matter of speculation, led to the expropriation of PrivatBank\u2019s investment. This said, the Tribunal is not in a position to reach such a conclusion\u2014that is, that such animus led to the expropriation of PrivatBank\u2019s investment\u2014on the evidence before it. The evidence of animus on the record is therefore insufficient to sustain a conclusion that the expropriation was not in the public interest or discriminatory.\n\n277.\n\n[REDACTED]341 have made a case regarding differential treatment, they have not made submissions to show, let alone demonstrated, that PrivatBank and the non-Ukrainian banks were similarly placed, other than to assert that all of these banks operated in the Crimean Peninsula. This, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is insufficient. As noted above, the justification invoked for the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution was that PrivatBank had failed to honour its obligations toward depositors. [REDACTED]342\u00a0Accordingly, on the the record, the Tribunal is unable to make a finding that the Russian Federation treated PrivatBank less favourably than Russian and third State banks operating in the Crimean Peninsula. The Tribunal is aware that there is other material in the public domain that suggests that there was generalized discrimination against Ukrainian nationals, and in particular banks, in the Crimean Peninsula after the events of February-March 2014. As, however, this material is not on the record in these proceedings, and has not been addressed by the Parties, the Tribunal has not had regard to any such information for purposes of its analysis of this issue in these proceedings.\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. v. The Czech Republic,*\u00a0PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, para. 313.\n\nThe sum total of the evidence that the Tribunal has been able to identify is found in Exhibit CE-269, an online report stating that Raiffeisen Bank \"branches in Crimea ceased operation on April 15,\" and that depositors can only withdraw funds on deposit at branches in mainland Ukraine or \"by means of a written request from the depositor for the funds to be transferred to the depositor\u2019s account opened at another bank.\" There is absolutely no evidence that the Tribunal has been able to identify regarding the situation of Russian banks in the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n278.\n\nTurning to the remaining requirements of Article 5(1), namely due process of law and the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation, it is again useful to consider these issues together.\n\n279.\n\nIt is indisputable in this case that prompt, adequate and effective compensation was not paid. Furthermore, even if the Tribunal were to countenance that the Respondent might have implicitly invoked a set off of PrivatBank\u2019s liabilities towards its depositors taken up by the FZV against any compensation due for PrivatBank\u2019s assets, the failure of the Respondent to make any offer of compensation or even provide an accounting of such set off is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, sufficient to establish a violation of the requirement to provide compensation.343\n\nTo the extent that the Tribunal has seen any evidence of PrivatBank\u2019s liabilities towards its depositors in Crimea, in the Arbitrazh Court of Crimea\u2019s judgment of 29 October 2015 or in Mr. Croft\u2019s expert report on quantum on behalf of the Claimants, their amount is inferior to the face value of the outstanding loans issued by PrivatBank\u2019s branches in the Crimean Peninsula. *See* Decision of the Arbitrazh Court of the Republic of Crimea, Case No. A83-16/2015, 30 October 2015 (CE-363); Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, p. 42, n.162; Croft Report, p. 17, Figure 4.\n\n280.\n\nBeyond this, however, for the reasons that follow, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent also falls at the hurdle of due process of law for the reason, *inter alia,* that whether assessed by reference to international law or Russian law,344 the Respondent failed to provide any meaningful avenue through which PrivatBank could be heard or pursue a claim in respect of its dispossessed investment. These developments are elaborated in the following paragraphs. It follows from this analysis that the expropriation of PrivatBank\u2019s investment was in breach of due process of law, and accordingly, in breach of this requirement in Article 1(1) of the Treaty.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that there is a difference between the two translations of the Treaty submitted by the Claimants in these proceedings in respect of this requirement for a lawful expropriation. In the first translation (CE-1), the requirement is that expropriatory measures be taken \"according to the procedures established by law,\" while the second translation refers to measures taken \"under due process of law\" (CA-137). These differing translations raise the possibility that what is required is not only compliance with internationally recognized norms of due process, but also specific compliance with the procedures established under the law of the host State. While noting that the two translations of the Treaty are open to different interpretations, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to resolve this difference here, given its view that, in the present case, the Russian Federation failed to afford the Claimants due process under both international and Russian law.\n\n281.\n\nThe requirement of due process under international law is aptly summarized in *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v*. *Republic of Hungary:*\n\n\"[D]ue process of law\", in the expropriation context, demands an actual and substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it. Some basic legal mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased and impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute, are expected to be readily available and accessible to the investor to make such legal procedure meaningful. In general, the legal procedure must be of a nature to grant an affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard.345\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of 2 October 2006, para. 435.\n\n282.\n\nIn the present case, given the manner in which the seizure of PrivatBank\u2019s offices and vaults on 18 and 19 April 2014 was carried out, there was no question of due process. The individuals carrying out the seizures did not so much as identify themselves, let alone put forward a legal basis for their actions or how PrivatBank might challenge them. Notably, the seizures preceded both the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution and the 21 April 2014 Court Decision, and hence cannot have been justified on their basis.\n\n283.\n\nIn any event, the Russian Federation did not recognize that the effect of the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution would be to expropriate PrivatBank, giving rise to a right to compensation. Notably, under the general federal legislation regulating banks in the Russian Federation, \"[d]ecisions and actions (inaction) of the Bank of Russia or its officials may be appealed by a credit institution in a court of law or a court of arbitration in compliance with the procedures established by federal laws.\"346 However, in respect of Ukrainian banks operating in the Crimean Peninsula, special legislation was enacted on 2 April 2014 (the Crimean Banking Law),347 which empowered the Russian Central Bank to terminate immediately the operations of any bank in the Crimean Peninsula which did not meet its obligations to its depositors for a single day and formed the basis of the 21 April 2014 Resolution. In contrast to the general banking legislation, the Crimean Banking Law did not provide any mechanism for challenging the decision of the Central Bank.348 Moreover, PrivatBank did not receive advance notice of the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution349 and was therefore not given any opportunity to either demonstrate that it was in compliance with the Crimean Banking Law or to bring itself in compliance with relevant requirements.\n\nFederal Law of the Russian Federation No. 395-1, \"On Banks and Banking Activities,\" 2 December 1990, Art. 21 (CE-246).\n\nFederal Law of the Russian Federation No. 37-FZ, \"On special features of functioning of the financial system in the Republic of Crimea and the federal city of Sevastopol during the transition period,\" 2 April 2014 (CE-52); [REDACTED]Second Skvortsov Report, p. 10.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n284.\n\nThe 21 April 2014 Court Decision also did not remedy any of the lacuna of earlier acts. PrivatBank was not given notice of the proceedings that led to the 21 April 2014 Court Decision, only learning of them \"through private channels.\"350 When PrivatBank appealed the 21 April 2014 Court Decision, it was neither given an opportunity to be heard,351 nor even formally notified of the outcome of its appeal.352\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED] For subsequent hearings in the same case (reference number 2-311/2014), summons to attend were sent to the Dnipropetrovsk headquarters of PrivatBank, but in two out of four cases, they were received only after the date of the hearing. Judicial Summons to Respondent in Civil Case 2-311/2014 (received by PrivatBank on 27 June 2014, as per the stamp on the document); Judicial Summons to Respondent in Civil Case 2-311/14 (received by PrivatBank on 20 August 2014 as per the stamp on the document).\n\n285.\n\nIn expropriating the Claimants, the Russian Federation also failed to follow the procedures established under Russian law. As confirmed by both Russian law experts, Russian law authorizes the State to take private property in two general circumstances: (i) to sanction the property owner for violating a legal obligation, in which case a court order authorizing the taking is required, or (ii) to fulfil another public need, in which case payment of compensation to the owner is required.353\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n286.\n\nThus, Article 35(3) of the Russian Constitution provides:\n\nNo one may be deprived of his property except pursuant to a judicial decision. Property can be forcibly taken for state needs only on condition of prior and equal compensation.354\n\nConstitution of the Russian Federation, Art. 35, as reprinted in Peter B. Maggs, Olga Schwartz, and William Burnham, \"Constitution\" in Law and Legal System of the Russian Federation (6th ed. 2015) (CE-107).\n\n287.\n\nArticles 235-243 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation list nine specific circumstances in which an ownership right may be terminated, in each case requiring either a court order or the payment of compensation.355\n\nCivil Code of the Russian Federation, Arts. 235-243, as reprinted in Peter B. Maggs and Alexei Zhiltsov, CIVIL Code of the Russian Federation, First Part (2nd ed. 2010) (Expanded CE-15).\n\n288.\n\nThe seizure of PrivatBank\u2019s offices of 18 and 19 April 2014 violated the prohibition under Russian law against uncompensated and extrajudicial deprivation of property, as did the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution. Although the 21 April 2014 Court Decision was a court order, in the opinion of the Russian law experts, it itself violated Russian law. Thus, Professor Skvortsov opined that \"a judicial error was made,\" as under Russian law assets cannot be turned over into \"trust administration\" by court decision.356 While on 4 June 2014 the interim measures were replaced, in Professor Skvortsov\u2019s view, in order to correct the previous error, the court again ordered interim measures of an unprecedented nature.357\n\nSecond Skvortsov Report, pp. 12-19.\n\nSecond Skvortsov Report, p. 17.\n\n289.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the Russian Federation failed to comply with the due process requirement under Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n290.\n\nAs the Article 5 requirements are cumulative, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the Russian Federation neither afforded PrivatBank due process of law nor compensate it for the taking suffices to support a finding that the Russian Federation\u2019s expropriation of PrivatBank\u2019s investments in the Crimean Peninsula was unlawful.\n\n**(d) Local remedies**\n----------------------\n\n291.\n\nTwo further issues arise from the particular circumstances of this case in connection with PrivatBank\u2019s resort to local remedies.\n\n292.\n\nFirst, at the merits hearing, the Claimants were invited to address whether they were required to exhaust, or at least reasonably pursue, local remedies in respect of the impugned judicial or administrative decisions through which they claim that an indirect expropriation was carried out. [REDACTED] Nor did they challenge the 21 April 2014 Central Bank Resolution suspending their Crimean operations.\n\n293.\n\n[REDACTED] This is undoubtedly true.360 Nor do they claim a denial of justice, for which there would be a clear requirement of exhaustion of local remedies as a substantive element of the claim.\n\nMartin Dietrich Brauch, USD Best Practices Series, *Exhaustion of Local Remedies in International Investment Law,* January 2017, p. 17; *Mytilineos Holdings SA v*. *(1) The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro (2) Republic of Serbia,* PCA Case No. 2005-06, Partial Award on Jurisdiction of 8 September 2006, paras. 197-225.\n\n294.\n\nAt the same time, some tribunals have considered that there is an implied substantive requirement of resort to local remedies for claims of indirect expropriation, even where no claim of denial of justice is made. Thus, in *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine,* with respect to one alleged act of indirect expropriation (through the Kyiv City State Administration\u2019s failure to \"produce revised land lease agreements with valid site drawings\"), which allegedly created an \"insurmountable obstacle\" for the claimant\u2019s construction project,361 the tribunal suggested that the claimant\u2019s failure to attempt to overturn this administrative omission before local courts could constitute an act of negligence barring its right to compensation. The tribunal stated:\n\nThe fact that an investment has become worthless obviously does not mean that there was an act of expropriation; investment always entails risk. Nor is it sufficient for the disappointed investor to point to some governmental initiative, or inaction, which might have contributed to his ill fortune. Yet again, it is not enough for an investor to seize upon an act of maladministration, no matter how low the level of the relevant governmental authority; to abandon his investment without any effort at overturning the administrative fault; and thus to claim an international delict on the theory that there had been an uncompensated virtual expropriation. In such instances, an international tribunal may deem that the failure to seek redress from national authorities disqualifies the international claim, not because there is a requirement of *exhaustion* of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the absence of a *reas**onable**\u2014*not necessarily exhaustive\u2014effort by the investor to obtain correction.362\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v*. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003, paras. 20.1, 20.6.\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v*. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003, para. 20.30 (emphasis added).\n\n295.\n\nOn this basis, the tribunal found that the Kyiv City State Administration\u2019s administrative fault, which was unchallenged before domestic courts, did not amount to an expropriation.363\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003, paras. 20.32-20.38.\n\n296.\n\nThe *Generation Ukraine* tribunal endorsed the finding in *Feldman v*. *Mexico* that the claimant\u2019s failure to seek \"formal, binding rulings\" on an administrative action it deemed unlawful precluded such action from being considered tantamount to an expropriation.364 Subsequently, the tribunal in *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* held that an unchallenged ministerial decision to downgrade the claimant\u2019s hotel did not constitute a breach of the Egypt-Denmark BIT as \"[i]t needs more to become an international delict... .\"365\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v*. *Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award of 16 September 2003, para. 20.35, referring to *Marvin Feldman v*. *Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l, Award of 16 December 2002.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v*. *The Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award of 3 July 2008, para. 148.\n\n297.\n\nThis jurisprudence shows that, even where a strict requirement of exhaustion of local remedies does not apply, local remedies may still be relevant where the factual matrix of a case is such that the failure of resort to local remedies breaks the chain of causation, making the failure to resort to local remedies the proximate cause of the investor\u2019s loss.366\n\n*See* Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. The Republic Ecuador*,* PCA Case No. 2007-02, Partial Award on the Merits of 30 March 2010, paras. 326, 330-332 (\"While reiterating its view that strict exhaustion of local remedies is not necessary, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that a claimant is required to make use of all remedies that are available and might have rectified the wrong complained of... .\").\n\n298.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that to be case here. Given that the measures in question did not purport to be expropriatory in nature, and did not recognize a right to compensation, it was not for PrivatBank to establish that nature before local courts in order to be able to claim before this Tribunal. [REDACTED] In any event, the Tribunal finds that PrivatBank did protest and pursue reasonable challenges, in particular by way of the appeal of the 21 April 2014 Court Decision described at paragraph 90 above. Its failure to pursue further local recourse against the Respondent\u2019s measures is not, in the circumstances, the proximate cause of its loss and, thus, does not bar its claim for indirect expropriation.\n\n299.\n\nSecond, a closely related issue arises from the foregoing discussion of local remedies. [REDACTED] Given the appeal that PrivatBank filed against the 21 April 2014 Court Decision, this begs the question of whether PrivatBank has triggered this purported fork-in-the-road clause and thereby lost its right to pursue arbitration under Article 9. As this raises a question of jurisdiction, for the reasons already set forth at paragraph 178 above, the Tribunal must satisfy itself that this issue does not deprive it of competence to decide the claims put before it.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it does not. The Tribunal notes that the text of Article 9(2) is unclear on the issue of whether it established a fork-in-the-road. The Tribunal does not need to resolve this question, however, as a fork-in-the-road clause would not in any event have been triggered. While the Claimants described the process in terms that suggest that the Simferopol Central District Court was seized of their appeal and then \"summarily dismissed\" it, [REDACTED] Further, and in any event, the Tribunal reiterates that the injunction proceedings before the Simferopol Central District Court did not purport to be expropriatory in nature and did not recognize a right to compensation. As such, they self-evidently did not concern the same question as is at issue in this arbitration, namely the compensation due to PrivatBank on account of the unlawful and permanent taking of its investment.\n\n**2. Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty**\n-------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n302.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding above that PrivatBank\u2019s entire investment was expropriated in the period of 18-21 April 2014, and the corollary that PrivatBank is therefore entitled to full compensation for its investment, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to make a determination on the Claimants\u2019 claims under Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty.\n\n**D.** **Compensation**\n-----------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that it bifurcated the proceedings in Procedural Order No. 3, wherein it postponed the assessment of any damages to a further phase of the arbitration. The Tribunal has concluded that PrivatBank\u2019s investment was expropriated through a series of physical and regulatory measures in the period of 18-21 April 2014. In the next phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal will address the issue of compensation due in the light of this finding of liability.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n[304].\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n1. the Tribunal has jurisdiction over PrivatBank\u2019s claims under the Treaty;\n\n2. PrivatBank\u2019s claims are admissible; and\n\n3. the Russian Federation has breached Article 5 of the Treaty in respect of PrivatBank\u2019s investments.\n\nThe issue of compensation due in the light of this finding of liability and any decision on the costs of arbitration are deferred to the next phase of the arbitration.\n\n**Place of arbitration:** The Hague, the Netherlands\n\n**Date:** 4 February 2019"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 5", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2019-05-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 5\n----------------------\n\n**1.

Absent any reasoned application by Finilon to continue to participate in the proceedings as a party having a direct interest in the proceedings, or on some other basis, which the Tribunal is required to address, the Tribunal accordingly concludes that Finilon may no longer participate in the proceedings going forward.\n\n**Date:** 3 May 2019\n\n**Place of Arbitration:** The Hague, the Netherlands"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 7", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2019-09-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 7\n----------------------\n\n**1.

The hearing transcript was delivered to the Parties, and they were granted leave to address questions raised by the Tribunal in the hearing, as well as other matters arising out of the hearing, in post-hearing submissions to be filed by 14 October 2016.\n\n1.15.\n\n[REDACTED] The Respondent did not file any post-hearing submissions.\n\n1.16.\n\nOn 24 February 2017, the Tribunal issued its unanimous Interim Award, in which it addressed certain issues of jurisdiction and admissibility and joined the consideration of all other issues of jurisdiction or admissibility to the merits of the proceedings (the **\"Interim Award\").**\n\n1.17.\n\nThe operative part of the Interim Award reads as follows:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n1. the Russian Federation has assumed obligations under the Treaty in respect of Ukrainian investors and their investments in the Crimean Peninsula as of 21 March 2014;\n\n2. there is a dispute between the Parties arising in connection with what the Claimants allege to constitute \"investments\" under the Treaty; and\n\n3. the Claimants have satisfied the notice and negotiation requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.\n\nThe Tribunal joins the consideration of all other issues of jurisdiction or admissibility to the merits of the proceedings and defers any decision on the costs of arbitration to the next phase of the arbitration.\n\n1.18.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the Tribunal re-issued the Interim Award, correcting four typographical errors.\n\n1.19.\n\nOn 11 July 2017, having sought the views of the Parties, but having received no reply from the Respondent, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it: (i) decided to bifurcate the proceedings between a phase in which it would address the remaining questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as questions of liability, and, in the event that liability is established, a phase in which it would address questions of quantum of damages; (ii) established a procedural calendar for the first of these two phases, in which the Tribunal would put questions to the Parties in advance of a hearing that would take place from 1 to 4 November 2017.\n\n1.20.\n\nOn the same day, 11 July 2017, in accordance with the timetable established in Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal addressed 15 questions to the Parties\u20144 questions to the Claimants and 11 questions to both Parties\u2014regarding issues of liability and remaining issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. [REDACTED]. The Respondent did not submit any responses.\n\n1.21.\n\nOn 8 September 2017, having sought the views of the Parties, but having received no comments from the Respondent, the Tribunal instructed the expert in Russian law whom it had appointed in the earlier phase of the proceedings to produce a report on additional specific issues arising from the Claimants\u2019 submissions. The expert\u2019s written report was communicated to the Parties for their comments on 18 October 2017. [REDACTED]. The Respondent did not provide any comments.\n\n1.22.\n\nA hearing on the remaining issues of admissibility and jurisdiction, as well as on liability, was held in The Hague from 1 to 3 November 2017. Although invited, the Russian Federation did not attend the hearing or otherwise participate. In the course of the hearing, the Tribunal examined three fact witnesses, one expert in Russian law and one valuation expert, all presented by the Claimants. The Tribunal-appointed expert on Russian law also appeared for examination. The hearing transcript was delivered to the Parties, and the Parties were further granted leave to address questions raised by the Tribunal in the hearing, as well as other matters arising out of the hearing, in post-hearing submissions.\n\n1.23.\n\n[REDACTED]. The Russian Federation did not file any post-hearing submissions.\n\n1.24.\n\nBy letters dated 5 July and 3 December 2018, the Tribunal requested certain additional documents from the Parties, [REDACTED].\n\n1.25.\n\nOn 4 February **2019,** having deliberated, the Tribunal issued a unanimous Partial Award addressing the Respondent\u2019s liability in respect of the Claimants\u2019 claims under the Treaty, as well as all outstanding issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (the **\"Partial Award\"** and, together with the Interim Award, the **\"Awards\").**\n\n1.26.\n\nThe operative part of the Partial Award reads as follows:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that:\n\n1. the Tribunal has jurisdiction over PrivatBank\u2019s claims under the Treaty;\n\n2. PrivatBank\u2019s claims are admissible; and\n\n3. the Russian Federation has breached Article 5 of the Treaty in respect of PrivatBank\u2019s investment.\n\nThe issue of compensation due in the light of this finding of liability and any decision on the costs of arbitration are deferred to the next phase of the arbitration.\n\n1.27.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.28.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, having sought the views of the Respondent, but having received no reply, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, confirming the change of PrivatBank\u2019s counsel in these proceedings.\n\n1.29.\n\nBy letter of the same date, 22 March 2019, the Tribunal recalled the finding made at paragraph 187 of its Partial Award that \"Finilon\u2019s claims fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\" The Tribunal consequently invited PrivatBank and Finilon to indicate what continuing status or role, if any, Finilon held or was envisaged to have in these proceedings. By letter dated 1 April 2019, the Tribunal also invited the Respondent to comment on this issue.\n\n1.30.\n\nOn 3 May 2019, having considered PrivatBank\u2019s and Finilon\u2019s responses and having received no comments from the Respondent, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which it determined that, absent any reasoned application by Finilon to continue to participate in the proceedings as a party having a direct interest in the proceedings, or on some other basis, which the Tribunal is required to address, Finilon may no longer participate in the proceedings going forward.\n\n1.31.\n\nBy letter dated 8 May 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it considered that it would be useful for the Claimant to make further submissions on damages that take into account the Tribunal\u2019s findings in its Partial Award and invited the Claimant to make these revised submissions by 19 June 2019. The Tribunal also invited the Respondent to indicate, by 3 July 2019, whether it wished to submit a reply to the Claimant\u2019s revised submissions on damages.\n\n1.32.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.33.\n\nBy letter dated 14 May 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant\u2019s extension request by 21 May 2019.\n\n1.34.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.35.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.36.\n\n[REDACTED]:\n\n(i) [REDACTED]\n\n(iii) [REDACTED]\n\n1.37.\n\nBy letter dated 25 June 2019, the Tribunal recalled that the Respondent had thus far failed to pay its share of the deposits requested by the Tribunal to cover its fees and expenses, which share was therefore paid by the Claimant, and requested that the Respondent pay its outstanding share of the deposits, in the total amount of EUR 500,000, by 26 July 2019.\n\n1.38.\n\nBy letter dated 4 July 2019, at the request of the Respondent, the Tribunal confirmed that the schedule set forth in its letter of 8 May 2019 is no longer applicable.\n\n1.39.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.40.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.41.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.42.\n\nBy letter dated 26 July 2019, the Tribunal indicated that it would shortly issue its decision on the application set out in the Respondent\u2019s letters dated 21 May and 18 June 2019.\n\n1.43.\n\nBy letter dated 21 August 2019, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to provide a copy of its writ of summons in the Set Aside Proceedings, and invited both Parties to provide an update regarding any relevant developments in those Proceedings.\n\n1.44.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.45.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1.46.\n\nAs noted in the covering letter to this Order, the Tribunal considers that it has been sufficiently informed by the Parties\u2019 numerous submissions on this issue to date, as well as by the Respondent\u2019s Set Aside and Revocation Writs. The Tribunal is accordingly in a position to issue the present Order.\n\n**2. The Tribunal\u2019s Ruling and Directions**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*(i) The Respondent\u2019s Request to Make Submissions on Jurisdiction*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.2.\n\nTo properly assess the Respondent\u2019s request for permission to make written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, it is necessary to consider it in the context of the entire proceedings. As described above, the Tribunal has already conducted two phases of these proceedings in which both Parties have been given a full opportunity to make written and oral submissions, including during two hearings, in respect of issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (as well as issues of liability). The Tribunal has also already issued two Awards addressing issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. In particular, in its Partial Award, the Tribunal decided all issues of jurisdiction and admissibility that remained outstanding after its Interim Award and found that \"it has jurisdiction over PrivatBank\u2019s claims under the Treaty\" and that \"PrivatBank\u2019s claims are admissible.\"1\n\nPartial Award, p. 100, Decision.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Awards are final and binding on the Parties. Pursuant to Article 9(3) of the Treaty, from which the Tribunal derives its jurisdiction, the \"arbitral award shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute.\" Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which apply by virtue of Article 9(2)(c) of the Treaty, similarly provides that arbitral awards \"shall be final and binding on the parties.\" [REDACTED]\n\n2.4.\n\nIt follows that the question for the Tribunal is not simply whether to allow the Respondent to make submissions on issues of jurisdiction, but whether to reopen the proceedings in respect of those issues with a view to potentially reconsidering the final and binding jurisdictional decisions set out in its Awards. Regardless of whether the Tribunal has the power to do so, be it under Dutch law, the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal\u2019s inherent powers or otherwise, the Tribunal considers that the present circumstances do not warrant reopening the decisions already made by the Tribunal in its Awards.\n\n2.5.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken seriously its obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction despite the non-participation of the Respondent in the proceedings, having tested the Claimants\u2019 evidence and argument over the last two phases of the proceedings, in particular by putting numerous questions to the Parties (see paragraphs 1.9 to 1.10 and 1.20 above) and appointing independent experts on Ukrainian and Russian law (see paragraphs 1.11 to 1.14 and 1.21 to 1.22 above), before examining and deciding upon these issues in detail in its Awards.\n\n2.7.\n\nMoreover, in the more than four years since the commencement of these proceedings, the Tribunal considers that it has given the Respondent an equal and full opportunity to participate and make submissions on issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (as well as issues of liability). Thus, Tribunal has (i) afforded the Respondent, as with the Claimant, an opportunity to express its views on each proposed procedural step throughout the proceedings, including by inviting its comments on drafts of procedural timetables; (ii) granted the Respondent equal and sufficient time to file a Statement of Defence and any Objection to Jurisdiction and/or Admissibility; (iii) granted the Respondent equal and sufficient time to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s written questions on substantive issues, including with respect to issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (as well as issues of liability); (iv) granted the Respondent equal and sufficient time to submit responses to the written pleadings and other communications from the Claimant, including with respect to issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (as well as issues of liability); (v) invited the Respondent, as with the Claimant, to comment on the proposed candidacy, terms of reference and reports of the independent experts on Russian and Ukrainian law appointed by the Tribunal, notably to address questions relevant to jurisdiction and admissibility; (vi) provided the Respondent adequate notice of the two hearings it has held, both of which addressed issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (while the second hearing also addressed issues of liability); (vii) provided the Respondent, in a timely manner, with the transcripts and all other documents submitted in the course of the hearings; and (vii) provided an opportunity for, and invited, the Respondent to comment on anything said during the hearings.4 The Respondent did not avail itself of any of these opportunities to participate in the proceedings and make submissions on issues of jurisdiction and admissibility (or issues of liability).\n\n*See* Interim Award, para. 154; Partial Award, para. 176.\n\n2.8.\n\nHaving failed to abide by any of the deadlines set by the Tribunal or otherwise make its views known upon any of the dozens of invitations extended by the Tribunal prior to the issuance of its Awards, the Tribunal is unable to see any compelling reason why the Respondent should now be allowed to make submissions on issues that have already been decided by the Tribunal in those Awards. [REDACTED]\n\n2.9.\n\nThe Tribunal is also mindful of the Claimant\u2019s interest in the finality of the Awards and the Tribunal\u2019s duty to conduct the proceedings in an efficient and proportionate manner. Substantial delay would inevitably result if the Respondent\u2019s request to reopen the Tribunal\u2019s decisions on jurisdiction were granted. Moreover, now that the Dutch courts are seised of the Set Aside Proceedings and will have the final word as the courts of the legal seat of this arbitration, a re-examination by the Tribunal of issues which it has already considered and decided in detail in its Awards is neither necessary nor likely to materially assist the Dutch courts in discharging their supervisory jurisdiction.\n\n2.10.\n\nIn contrast, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent will not suffer prejudice if the Tribunal denies its request to reopen the entire proceedings on jurisdiction before this Tribunal, as it will have the opportunity to make all of its jurisdictional arguments before the Hague Court of Appeal in the Set Aside Proceedings. [REDACTED]5\n\nSet Aside Writ, para. 83.\n\n2.11.\n\n[REDACTED] the Tribunal considers that its Awards address both the threshold jurisdictional issue of the application of the Treaty between the Russian Federation and Ukraine in respect of the Crimean Peninsula in the period from February 2014 onwards, and all other applicable jurisdictional and admissibility requirements under the Treaty.\n\n2.12.\n\n[REDACTED] Although the Respondent could have raised this issue at an earlier stage of these proceedings, the Tribunal considers that, in view of the substantial new evidence now adduced by the Respondent, as well as the serious nature of its allegations, it would be appropriate to allow the Respondent to make submissions on its Illegality Objection, should it wish to do so. In order to minimize any delay resulting from such submissions and given that the Respondent\u2019s arguments and evidence in respect of the Illegality Objection will likely also be relevant to the damages issues in these proceedings, the Tribunal considers that any such submissions should be made in the Respondent\u2019s submissions on compensation (as to which, see paragraph 2.24 below).\n\n2.13.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly denies the Respondent\u2019s request for permission to make written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, save that in its submissions on compensation (as to which, see paragraph 2.24 below) the Respondent may make submissions in respect of its Illegality Objection.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Request for a Stay of Proceedings*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.14.\n\nIn the alternative to its request for permission to make submissions on jurisdiction, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the Set Aside Proceedings.\n\n2.15.\n\nThe Respondent does not cite, and the Tribunal is not aware of, any provision of the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules or Dutch law, or any other applicable rule of international law, that would require the Tribunal to stay the proceedings. The question is thus whether the Tribunal should, in the exercise of its discretion to conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, stay its proceedings pending the outcome of the Set Aside Proceedings.\n\n2.16.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is for the Respondent to establish that a stay is justified by the circumstances. Article 1036(3) of the DCCP requires the Tribunal to \"guard against unreasonable delay in the proceedings.\" Yet, substantial delay is likely to result from a stay of these proceedings pending the outcome of the Set Aside Proceedings, particularly if a decision of the Hague Court of Appeal is thereafter appealed to the Hoge Raad (Dutch Supreme Court). The Respondent must therefore demonstrate that this delay is reasonable and justified by the circumstances.\n\n2.17.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n2.18.\n\nThe issue of the likelihood of the Respondent\u2019s success in the Set Aside Proceedings is not a matter for this Tribunal, but for the Hague Court of Appeal, as the authority duly charged with deciding the Respondent\u2019s set aside application under Dutch law. The Tribunal accordingly considers that deference requires it to forebear from any comment on its appreciation of the issues engaged in the Set Aside Proceedings. Yet, the Tribunal, in common with any tribunal of law and aside from the consideration of questions that will properly be addressed by the Hague Court of Appeal, ought nevertheless to consider whether a stay of its proceedings may properly be warranted in the interests of the administration of justice.\n\n2.19.\n\nHaving regard to its Awards, the issues that remain to be addressed in these proceedings, and the jurisdictional objections summarized in the Respondent\u2019s recent correspondence and the Respondent\u2019s Set Aside and Revocation Writs, the Tribunal concludes that a stay of its proceedings is not warranted in the interests of the administration of justice. The continuation of the proceedings will not prejudice the proper conduct of the Set Aside Proceedings. Nor will the failure to stay impede the Tribunal\u2019s ability to fully and properly examine and decide the remaining issues before it.\n\n2.20.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly denies the Respondent\u2019s request to stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the Set Aside Proceedings.\n\n*(iii) The Respondent\u2019s Request for Permission to Raise Objections in relation to the Claim on the Merits and Quantum*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.21.\n\nHaving denied the Respondent\u2019s request to make submissions on jurisdiction and declined to stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the Set Aside Proceedings, the Tribunal must address the Respondent\u2019s request for permission to raise objections in relation to the Claimants\u2019 claim on the merits and quantum, including by way of an evidentiary hearing.\n\n2.22.\n\nIn its Partial Award, the Tribunal held that \"the Russian Federation has breached Article 5 of the Treaty in respect of PrivatBank\u2019s investments.\"7 Insofar as the Respondent is now requesting that the Tribunal reconsider that finding of liability, the Tribunal considers that such a reopening of proceedings is unwarranted in the present circumstances for all of the reasons set out at paragraphs 2.2-2.9 above in respect of the Respondent\u2019s similar request to make submissions on jurisdiction. As with jurisdiction, the Respondent has had an equal and full opportunity to make submissions regarding issues of liability. As with jurisdiction, the Respondent missed the numerous deadlines set by the Tribunal for its submissions on issues of liability, and has not cited any compelling reason why it should now be allowed to make submissions long after those deadlines have expired. Here too, the Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants\u2019 interest in the finality of the Awards and of the delay that would inevitably result if the Respondent\u2019s request were granted.\n\nPartial Award, p. 100, Decision.\n\n2.23.\n\nThe situation is different with respect to the part of the Respondent\u2019s request that concerns the issue of compensation due in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal bifurcated the proceedings between a phase in which it would address the remaining questions of jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as questions of liability, and, in the event that liability is established, a phase in which it would address questions of quantum of damages. In its Partial Award, the Tribunal accordingly deferred the issue of compensation due in the light of its finding of liability to a subsequent phase of the proceedings.8 The Tribunal has since invited the Claimant to make further submissions on damages that take into account the Tribunal\u2019s findings in its Partial Award.\n\nPartial Award, p. 100, Decision.\n\n2.24.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it would be appropriate to allow the Respondent a full opportunity to respond to the Claimant\u2019s forthcoming revised submission on damages, in accordance with Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Indeed, the Claimant accepts that the Respondent is entitled to participate in the quantum phase of the proceedings.\n\n2.25.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly denies the Respondent\u2019s request to raise objections in relation to the Claimant\u2019s claim on the merits and quantum insofar as it is seeks a reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s finding in its Partial Award that the Respondent has breached Article 5 of the Treaty, and grants the Respondent\u2019s request insofar as it seeks an opportunity to make submissions on the issues of compensation due in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding of liability. Each Party\u2019s submission on compensation may be accompanied by any exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements or expert reports that the Party wishes to rely on in support of its submission. In view of the Tribunal\u2019s decision at paragraph 2.13 above, the Parties\u2019 submissions on compensation may also address the Respondent\u2019s Illegality Objection. In due course, a hearing may be held to allow each Party to make oral submissions and cross-examine the other Party\u2019s fact and expert witnesses, if any.\n\n2.26.\n\nThe Tribunal invites the Parties to revert to it by **Monday, 23 September 2019**with their respective proposals for the procedural calendar to be established for the damages phase of the proceedings, including time limits to be set for the filing of the Claimant\u2019s revised submission on damages and the Respondent\u2019s reply thereto.\n\n2.27.\n\nThe Tribunal further reminds the Respondent that its share of the deposits requested by the Tribunal in these proceedings, in the total amount of EUR 500,000, remains outstanding. The Respondent is requested to make these deposits in fulfilment of its obligations under the UNCITRAL Rules and the Rules of Procedure. The Tribunal further observes that this deposit is necessary in the light of the Tribunal\u2019s above decision to allow the Respondent to make submissions on its Illegality Objection at a late stage of the proceedings and to meet the costs of the damages phase of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal invites the Respondent to provide an update on the status of this payment as soon as possible and by no later than **Monday, 23 September 2019****.**\n\n**Date:** 12 September 2019\n\n**Place of Arbitration:** The Hague, the Netherlands"}]}
