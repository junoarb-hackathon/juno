BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE FACTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn September 22, 2008, the Republic of Guinea and Getma International concluded an agreement for the Concession of the container terminal of the port of Conakry, its extension and the building of a rail extension (the Concession Agreement) (Exhibit C - 11). Under this agreement, the Republic of Guinea granted to Getma International a Concession to the public service of managing and operating the Conakry container terminal (the Concession).\n\n14.\n\nPursuant to Article 7 of the Concession Agreement, Getma International was to create a company under Guinean law for the operation of the Concession. Pursuant to this provision, the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Terminal \u00e0 Conteneurs de Conakry SA* (the Conakry container terminal company) (the STCC) was created on November 20, 2008 (Exhibit C - 13). 95% of the STCC is owned by Getma International Investissements, created on November 12, 2008, 51% by Getma International in its turn, and 49% by NCT Necotrans (Counter-Memorial no.2 \u00a7 219, Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 69).\n\n15.\n\nOn November 7, 2009, the Republic and Getma International concluded Additional Clause no. 1 to the Concession Agreement in order to specify the conditions for suspending and calculating the terms and deadlines contained in the Concession Agreement, the number of members in the monitoring committee, the nature of the activities granted, the share in the parking costs and fees (Additional Clause no. 1) (Exhibit C - 12).\n\n16.\n\nThrough its French subsidiary NCT Infrastructure & Logistique, Getma International launched an international call for bids, closed in February 2011, for the construction of a new dock and the building of a new area of 120,000m2 (Counter-Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 219, Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 70).\n\n17.\n\nOn March 8, 2011, the President of the Republic adopted a Decree pursuant to which the Concession Agreement and its Additional Clause *were terminated for failures to meet the Concessionary's obligations* [...] *effective immediately and without indemnification, at the expense and risk and based on the faults of the Getma International SAS companies* [sic] (the Termination Decree) (Exhibit C - 19).\n\n18.\n\nOn March 9, 2011, the President of the Republic adopted a second Decree pursuant to which *the Guinean State has decided to requisition, for a period of 60 days or more, beginning on the date of the signing of this Decree, the personnel, equipment, installations, real property and assets it deems necessary, belonging to the Getma International SAS company and to the Conakry container terminal company, which are located in the Conakry container terminal or elsewhere on the national territory of the Republic of Guinea* (the Requisition Decree) (Exhibit C - 21).\n\n19.\n\nOn May 10, 2011, Getma International submitted a request for arbitration to the common court of justice and arbitration (the CCJA) of the *Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Affaires* (the O.H.A.D.A.) (Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa) against the Guinean state, pursuant to the Arbitration Clause stipulated in Article 31 of the Concession Agreement (the Arbitration Clause).\n\n20.\n\nPursuant to its request for arbitration of May 10, 2011, Getma International requested of the Tribunal created as a result of this request and composed of Messrs. Eric Teynier, Juan Antonio Cremades and Ibrahim Fadlallah (referred to hereinafter as the CCJA Tribunal) to:\n\n*State and rule that the termination of the Concession Agreement pursuant to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Guinea is null and void;*\n\n*Establish that, due to the new Concession Agreement granted on March 11, 2011 to BAL, or to any other company in the Bollor\u00e9 group, a return to the statu quo ante bellum is henceforth impossible;*\n\n*Sentence the Respondent to indemnify the Concessionary for the prejudice sustained due to the termination of the Concession Agreement, and comprising* *among other things* *and subject to adjustment (i) the all-inclusive termination indemnity, (ii) the termination indemnity, (iii) the unamortized amount of the entry ticket, (iv) the severance pay and (v) the additional prejudice, in addition to interest accruing at the legal rate from the date of the preliminary notice of a change of law;*\n\n*To leave it up to the Respondent to pay all the costs, expenses and fees borne by the Claimant* (Exhibit R-9).\n\n21.\n\nThe CCJA procedure is currently underway.\n\n22.\n\nOn September 29, 2011, the Claimants filed a request pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention as well as order no.00/PRG/87 of January 3, 1987, amended by law no..L/95/029/CTRN of June 30, 1995 pertaining to the Investment Code of the Republic of Guinea.\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to their arbitration request of September 29, 2011, the Claimants requested of the ICSID Tribunal (the Tribunal composed as mentioned in chapter 2 above, also referred to as the Arbitral Tribunal):\n\n*a) to declare that the state of Guinea violated its investment laws and/or International law, in particular that it expropriated in a discriminatory manner the Claimants' investment, without prompt, just adequate compensation, in breach of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Investment Code and/or in breach of customary International law;*\n\n*c) to order Guinea to indemnify the Claimant due to the breach of its investment laws and/or International law in an amount to be determined at the appropriate time in this procedure, in a freely convertible currency accepted by the Claimants, plus interest accruing at a reasonable commercial rate for the currency at issue from the date of the expropriation until full payment of the amount has been made;*\n\n*d) To award all other compensation which the Tribunal considers appropriate, and;*\n\n*e) to order the state of Guinea to pay all the costs of this arbitration procedure, including, without limitation, the fees and costs of the Tribunal, the fees and costs of the ICSID, the fees and costs pertaining to the Claimant's legal presentation and the costs and fees of any expert appointed by the Claimant or the Tribunal, plus the interest owed.*\n\n**V. BACKGROUND OF THE PROCEDURE**\n----------------------------------\n\n**a. Beginning of the procedure**\n---------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn September 29, 2011, Getma International, NCT Necotrans, Getma International Investissements and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique (referred to hereinafter as the Claimants) filed a request for arbitration (the request) with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) against the Republic of Guinea.\n\n25.\n\nThe basis of the request is the convention for the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states (the Convention or the ICSID Convention) as well as order no.00/PRG/87 of January 3, 1987, amended by law no. L/95/029/CTRN of June 30, 1995 governing the Investment Code of the Republic of Guinea.\n\n26.\n\nOn October 19, 2011, the ICSID Secretariat, in order to pursue the examination of the request, asked the Claimants to clarify the requesting parties' respective roles in the Concession and to explain the investment made by Getma International Investissements and NCT infrastructure & Logistique. According to the information submitted by the Claimants on October 28, 2011:\n\n- NCT Necotrans is the group's leading holding company owning directly or indirectly 100% of the three other Claimants, and financed the investment in Guinea;\n\n- Getma International was the Concessionary of the container terminal;\n\n- Getma International Investissements is an intermediary holding company controlled by Getma International and controlling the Guinean Company STCC which is the company which operates the terminal;\n\n- NCT infrastructure & Logistique is NCT Necotrans' technical subsidiary responsible for the work of extending the terminal.\n\n27.\n\nIn accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID's Secretary General registered the request on November 3, 2011.\n\n28.\n\nIn a letter of November 14, 2011, the Claimants proposed that the dispute be settled by the Tribunal composed of three members, one arbitrator appointed by each of the parties and the third appointed by common agreement. In this same letter, the Claimants confirmed the appointment as arbitrator of Mr. Bernardo Cremades, of Spanish nationality, whom they had already announced in the request.\n\n29.\n\nIn a letter of December 12, 2011, the Respondent accepted the Claimants' proposal concerning the method of appointing the Arbitral Tribunal and appointed Professor Pierre Tercier of Swiss nationality as arbitrator.\n\n30.\n\nIn a letter of December 20, 2011, the Centre's Secretariat informed the parties that Mr. Bernardo Cremades and Professor Pierre Tercier had accepted their appointments, and communicated to them the acceptance and independence statements signed respectively by the two arbitrators, in accordance with Article 6 (2) of the procedural regulations governing the ICSID's arbitration proceedings (the Arbitration Regulations).\n\n31.\n\nOn January 20, 2012, the parties appointed jointly Mrs. Vera Van Houtte of Belgian nationality, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Mrs. Van Houtte accepted her appointment on February 2, 2012. On the same day, the Centre's Secretary General informed the parties that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that in accordance with Article 6 (1) of the Arbitration Regulations, the Tribunal was considered was created and the proceedings commenced on such date, namely February 2, 2012. A copy of the statement signed by Mrs. Van Houtte was also communicated to the parties on the same day.\n\n32.\n\nMrs. Mair\u00e9e Uran Bidegain was also appointed as the Tribunal's Secretary on same date.\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with Article 13 of the Arbitration Regulations, the Arbitral Tribunal's first session was held in Paris with the parties on March 30, 2012. During this session, the Arbitral Tribunal established the specific rules for the procedure. A record of this session was approved by the parties as stated below.\n\n**b. Request for recusal**\n--------------------------\n\n34.\n\nOn April 16, 2012, the Respondent submitted a request for recusal against Mr. Bernardo Cremades (the request for recusal) pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n35.\n\nIn a letter of April 18, 2012, the ICSID Secretariat informed the parties that in accordance with Article 9(6) of the Arbitration Regulations, the proceedings were considered as suspended on the date of the filing of the request, namely on April 16, 2012. The secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal communicated to them a draft record of the first session held on March 30, 2012, with the indication that the parties would be asked to confirm their agreement to various points on the agenda upon resumption of the proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nAfter an exchange of memorials between the parties regarding the request for recusal and the filing of the observations of Mr. Bernardo Cremades, Mrs. Vera Van Houtte and Professor Pierre Tercier considered the request for recusal and put it to an immediate vote without the presence of Mr. Bernardo Cremades. Following a tie of the votes of the two arbitrators, the Chairman of the Administrative Council made the decision on June 28, 2012 regarding the request for recusal, in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID convention. According to the decision of the Chairman of the Administrative Council:\n\n*1. The request for recusal made by the Republic of Guinea on April 16, 2012 against Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades is rejected.*\n\n*2. The costs incurred by the parties and the members of the Tribunal in examining this request for recusal will be the object of a subsequent decision by the Tribunal.*\n\n*3. In accordance with Article 9(6) of the Arbitration Regulations, these proceedings are considered as having resumed on the date of this decision.*\n\n**c. Bifurcation of the procedure**\n-----------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nDuring its first session, the Arbitral Tribunal - after having noted that the Respondent intended to contest the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and that the parties agreed on the bifurcation of the procedure - established the procedural calendar on the issue of jurisdiction as follows:\n\n\u2022 June 22, 2012: Respondent's Memorial on jurisdiction\n\n\u2022 July 13, 2012: the Claimants' Counter Memorial on jurisdiction\n\n\u2022 August 3, 2012: the Respondent's Replication\n\n\u2022 September 7, 2012: the Claimants' rejoinder\n\n\u2022 September 28, 2012: Hearing\n\n38.\n\nOn June 7, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal proposed that the parties not suspend the calendar of the procedure and maintain the dates established during the first session, notwithstanding the suspension of the procedure following the Respondent's request for recusal. The parties marked their agreement on June 8, 2012.\n\n39.\n\nOn June 22, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Memorial no. 1 on jurisdiction by email (Memorial no. 1).\n\n40.\n\nOn June 28, 2012, the parties were asked to confirm their agreement regarding the draft record of the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Claimants and the Respondent mark their agreement regarding the record respectively on July 4 and 12th 2012. On this occasion, the parties also stated that they were not opposed to the ICSID's publication of the decision of the Chairman of the administrative council regarding the request for recusal.\n\n41.\n\nOn July 13, 2012, the Claimants submitted their Counter Memorial no. 1 on jurisdiction by email (Counter Memorial no. 1).\n\n42.\n\nOn July 30, 2012, the Respondent requested, pursuant to Article 26(2) of the ICSID regulations, a three-day extension to present its Memorial no. 2 on jurisdiction. Given the Claimants' agreement, the Arbitral Tribunal granted the requested extension. On August 6, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Memorial no. 2 on jurisdiction by email (Memorial no. 2).\n\n43.\n\nOn September 7, 2012, the Claimants submitted their Counter Memorial no.2 on jurisdiction by email (Counter Memorial no.2).\n\n44.\n\nOn September 28, 2012, a hearing on the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal was held in Paris, the record of which was submitted to the Parties and the arbitrators in draft form on the same day, and in its final form subject to possible corrections by the Parties or the arbitrators, on October 2, 2012.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS REGARDING JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn its Memorial no. 1 on jurisdiction of June 22, 2012 and its Memorial no.2 on jurisdiction of August 6, 2012, the Respondent requested that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n*- declare that it entertains jurisdiction;*\n\n*- sentence the Claimants to pay all of the arbitration costs including the costs and fees incurred by the Respondent for the purposes of its defense in the framework of this arbitration, the amount of which will be determined at the end of the procedure.*\n\n**b. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn their Counter Memorial no.1 on jurisdiction of July 13, 2012 and their Counter Memorial no.2 on jurisdiction of September 7, 2012, the Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n*- declare that it entertains jurisdiction;*\n\n*- sentence the Republic of Guinea to pay all the costs incurred up until the present day, including the costs of arbitration pertaining to the objection to jurisdiction and the costs and fees of the Claimants' attorneys.*\n\n**VII. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's argument**\n--------------------------------\n\n*i) The Arbitration Clause as a contrary agreement*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent contests the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal, on the basis of Article 23 of the ICSID Convention. It contends that the parties did not grant their consent in writing to submit their dispute to the ICSID.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the ICSID arbitration proposal contained in the Investment Code is limited. Indeed, Article 28 of the Investment Code stipulates that *Disputes between the Guinean state and foreign nationals concerning the application or interpretation of this code are,* ***unless otherwise agreed by the parties involved,*** *definitively settled by arbitration* [ICSID]... (The Respondent's underlying) (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 14).\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent considers that Article 28 of the Investment Code must be interpreted objectively. It agrees to seek out the parties' common intent. According to the Respondent, Article 28 means that the ICSID entertained jurisdiction only failing the parties' choice of another court. The *contrary agreement* at issue must be a contractual agreement between the Guinean State and the foreign investor which has a result which is contrary to that of the appointment of the ICSID as the arbitration institution with authority to rule on their investment dispute. Such an agreement could be in the form of an exclusion clause or clause for the selection of the forum (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 18-24).\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the parties concluded such a contrary agreement when they inserted the Arbitration Clause designating the CCJA in their Concession Agreement. According to the Respondent, this Arbitration Clause encompasses all grievances and litigations resulting from the Concession Agreement regardless of their nature or legal grounds (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 31).\n\n51.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' affirmations, the Respondent considers that the *\"contrary agreement* must not explicitly govern litigations concerning the interpretation and the application of the Investment Code. It affirms that the restrictive interpretation rule invoked by the Claimants is based on no rule or case law (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 34-37). Assuming even that a specific contrary agreement were required, the Respondent specifies that Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement clearly incorporates the protection afforded investors under the Investment Code. Indeed, this Article refers to the *amendment of the Guinean Investment Code and of the laws in force* [...], namely acts of the State acting as legislator and not as a party to the Concession Agreement (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 38-40).\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Parties' choice to grant jurisdiction to the CCJA is irrevocable. It is based on the use of the term *irrevocable* in the arbitration clause. The Respondent claims that Article 28 of the Investment Code is identical to the so-called *fork in the road* clauses. Thus, like the *fork in the road* clauses, Article 28 proposes an exclusive choice between the ICSID or another court and the choice once made - is irrevocable (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 47-51).\n\n53.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent alleges that the Parties' choice of the CCJA was confirmed by (i) the filing of Getma International's arbitration request before the CCJA on May 10, 2011 and (ii) the signing of the minutes of the meeting of the CCJA Tribunal on March 12, 2012 which constitutes a valid Arbitration Clause (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 54-55).\n\n*ii) Scope of the Concession Agreement and the Arbitration Clause*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the requests made by the Claimants before the ICSID resulted directly from the Concession Agreement and are covered by the Arbitration Clause given that (i) the Concession Agreement constitutes the exclusive basis for the investment on which the Claimants are relying, (ii) the termination of the Concession Agreement constitutes the foundation for the Claimants' requests, and (iii) the prejudice for which the Claimants are requesting damages relies on the stipulations of the Concession Agreement (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 35-37).\n\n55.\n\nRegarding the investment, the Respondent alleges that according to the terms of the Claimants' arbitration request, the Concession Agreement is the exclusive basis thereof. The Claimants indeed affirmed that *we are confronting a true investment* [...]. *Indeed, (i) the execution of the public service Concession contract implied a financial investment to be made by the Concessionary (investor)* (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 35).\n\n56.\n\nConcerning the basis of the request, the Respondent quotes the Claimants' arbitration request according to which *the termination of the contract represents* [...] *an act of the Public Authorities and not only a simple execution of the clause of the contract, thereby constituting a measure with an effect equivalent to expropriation.* The Respondent specifies that Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement governs explicitly litigations concerning acts of the Public Authorities contravening the investor's rights (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 39-41, Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 23). If the expropriation is explicitly governed by the Concession Agreement, the Respondent considers that any litigation concerning an expropriation is a result of the Concession Agreement and falls into the scope of the Arbitration Clause. The Arbitration Clause and Article 32 moreover are contained in the same chapter in the Concession Agreement (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 25-26).\n\n57.\n\nConcerning the prejudice, the Respondent argues that the extra-contractual prejudice claimed by Getma International to warrant the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal (namely the *lucrum cessans)* is in fact the direct result of the termination of the Concession Agreement. According to the Respondent, the *just, adequate compensation* stipulated in the Investment Code can only be that which was agreed upon by the parties in the Concession Agreement. Indeed, the application of the *usual rules and practices of International law* to which the Investment Code refers leads to the application of the Concession Agreement via the *pacta sunt servanda* principle. The prejudice claimed by Getma International therefore indeed results from the Concession Agreement (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 98-110).\n\niii) *Parties to the Arbitration Clause*\n----------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent specifies that the *contrary agreement* binds all the Claimants to this arbitration procedure. The Respondent bases its argument on the theory of groups of companies (established by the Paris Court of Appeal in the *Dow Chemical* case) to extend the effects of the Arbitration Clause to NCT Necotrans, Getma International Investissements and NCT infrastructure & Logistique. The Respondent considers that the groups of companies theory applies in the case at issue because, pursuant to a material rule of the international law of arbitration acknowledged in the uniform act on the OHADA arbitration laws, the existence and effectiveness of an Arbitration Clause is appreciated on the basis of the parties' will, independently of any reference to a state law (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 87-91).\n\n59.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants - belonging to the same group of companies -due to their participation in the conclusion and execution of the Concession Agreement and Additional Clause no.1, manifested their wish to be bound by the Arbitration Clause. Indeed (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 58 74):\n\na) the Claimants all belong to the same group of companies (the Necotrans group) and share executives who are also officers in NCT Necotrans;\n\nb) the Claimants (with the exception of Getma International Investissements) participated and were personally represented during the negotiations of the Concession Agreement, which was signed by Mr. Talbot in his capacity as *president of the NCT Necotrans* *group;*\n\nc) NCT Necotrans was in charge of obtaining the financing necessary for making the investments stipulated in the Concession Agreement. Getma International Investissements was created as the holding company vehicle for the Necotrans group's participation in the STCC and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique launched a call for bids for the construction of the new dock stipulated in the Concession Agreement for the account of Getma International;\n\nd) Additional Clause no. 1 to the Concession Agreement - which explicitly targets the Getma International Investissements company - was signed by the president of the Necotrans group and by the president of the STCC and of NCT Infrastructure & Logistique;\n\ne) The CCJA arbitration was initiated and pursued at the initiative and under the control of NCT Necotrans.\n\n*iv) Identity between litigation brought before the CCJA Tribunal and the ICSID Tribunal.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the CCJA Tribunal's record shows that the litigations and requests brought before the CCJA Tribunal and the ICSID Tribunal are identical and that the Arbitral Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the investment litigations. On the one hand, Getma International's presentation of the dispute quoted in the minutes of the meeting of the CCJA Tribunal of March 12, 2012 is identical *verbatim* to the presentation made by the Claimants in their request for ICSID arbitration and, on the other hand, all the Claimants' requests were brought before the CCJA Tribunal, including those governed by the legislation on investments (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 77).\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent specifies that the litigation brought before the CCJA concerns not only the contract but also the investment. The Respondent refers to an opening brief introduced by Getma International in the context of the CCJA procedure which states that:\n\na) The suit is based on International principles for the protection of investments. Getma International invokes the rules and principles of International law, the notion of a *State Contract,* the general principles which apply to investments (such as good faith, legitimate expectations or just and equitable treatment) as well as doctrine in the domain of International investment law and ICSID case law (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 80-84, Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 54).\n\nb) The litigation concerns the Termination Decree and the Requisition Decree which are acts of the Public Authorities. Getma International therefore acknowledges that the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal is not limited solely to contractual aspects but encompasses all aspects linked to the illegal actions of the Public Authorities (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 89, Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 49).\n\nc) The litigation concerns an expropriation. Getma International utilizes terms specific to this type of measure such as *requisitioning* [...] *using the armed forces* or *\"manu military* and is requesting indemnification for this expropriation. The Respondent specifies that the CCJA entertains jurisdiction to rule on all of requests concerning the alleged expropriation, including the violation of investment laws (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 92-97).\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent refutes the Claimants' allegation that Getma International's requests before the CCJA Tribunal do not cover their entire prejudice.\n\n63.\n\nAs concerns the requisition of goods, the Respondent emphasizes that the indemnity claimed before the CCJA Tribunal corresponds to the value of the goods. This indemnity covers therefore all the consequences of the requisition Decree and not only the consequences of the Republic's failure to meet its contractual obligation to minimize the prejudice sustained by Getma International in its capacity as Concessionary (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 46-48).\n\n64.\n\nAs far as the loss of profit *(lucrum cessans*) is concerned, the Respondent contends that this item is included in the all-inclusive termination indemnity stipulated in Article 32 three of the Concession Agreement which is claimed by Getma International before the CCJA Tribunal. Indeed, the all-inclusive indemnity is aimed at compensating the loss of activity and is based on revenue (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 51-53).\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that Getma International brought the case before the CCJA freely with full knowledge of the facts. It was due to the CCJA's guarantees of independence and jurisdiction that Getma International allegedly accepted and confirmed the jurisdiction of this arbitration organization. On the other hand, the ICSID procedure stems from a *\"forum shopping* strategy on the Claimants' part (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 64-65).\n\n*v) Capacity as investor and the carrying out of the investment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that neither NCT Necotrans nor Getma International Investissements, nor NCT Infrastructure & Logistique refers to any dispute presenting a direct connection with an investment. These companies do not specify the nature of their investment, the violations of the Investment Code or the facts they intend to invoke and do not prove their capacity as investor or the actual prejudice they allege they sustained. According to the Respondent, alleging a *treaty claim* does not suffice to warrant the jurisdiction of the ICSID. The Respondent quotes in this respect the court's decisions in the SGS *versus the Philippines* and *Impregilo versus Pakistan* cases, according to which it is necessary - at the jurisdiction stage - to determine whether the alleged facts are *prima facie* such that they constitute a violation of investment laws. It therefore requests that the Arbitral Tribunal establish that the *treaty claims* invoked by the NCT Necotrans, Getma International Investissements and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique companies are nonexistent (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 113 and 122).\n\n67.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that NCT Necotrans does not have the capacity of investor because it has made no investment in the Republic of Guinea as per the Investment Code. Indeed, only direct contributions to a company established in Guinea in exchange for company stock are considered as investments under Article 3.2 of the Investment Code, to the exclusion of indirect holdings. And according to the Respondent, NCT Necotrans is participating in this arbitration due solely to the fact of its control over Getma International (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 129-131)\n\n**b. The Claimants' argument**\n------------------------------\n\n*i) Arbitration Clause as a contrary agreement*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants contest the existence of a *contrary agreement* between the parties, as per Article 28 of the Investment Code, which would exclude the ICSID's jurisdiction for settling litigations concerning the interpretation and application of said code. According to the Claimants, only one agreement exists between one of them and the Respondent as concerns the method for settling contractual litigation (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 149).\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants contend that in order to rule out the ICSID's jurisdiction pursuant to Article 28 of the Investment Code, the contrary agreement must be concluded by the Republic itself and all the investors concerned and must concern the same litigation, the same requests and the application of the same legal standards (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a717-18). The Claimants consider that this is not the case here.\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Arbitration Clause and Article 28 of the Investment Code do not have the same *ratione materiae* scope of application. According to the Claimants, Article 28 covers solely disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Investment Code, while the Arbitration Clause covers disputes resulting from the Concession Agreement and its Additional Clauses (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 25-27).\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the simple fact that an Arbitration Clause exists in the Concession Agreement is not sufficient for ruling out the existence of another arbitral agreement concerning the interpretation and application of the Investment Code (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 35). The Claimants referred to the case law of the Arbitral Tribunal according to which the method for settling litigations stipulated in a bilateral investment treaty cannot be excluded following the simple confirmation of an alternative forum in a contract. The Claimants quote in this respect the *Aguasdel Tunari versus Bolivia* and *Vivendi versus Argentina* cases (ad hoc committee) (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 33-39).\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants consider indeed that it is exceptional that a contractual clause for settling litigations encompass also investment litigations. If such were the parties wish, the Claimants considered that it was necessary to express it in a clear unequivocal manner. And yet the Concession Agreement makes no reference to litigations concerning the interpretation and application of the Investment Code, to the parties wish to eliminate ICSID arbitration or to the fact that the Arbitration Clause is the *contrary agreement* as per the Investment Code. The scope of the application of the Arbitration Clause is narrow moreover in that it applies solely to disputes or litigations *resulting from this agreement or its Additional Clauses.* (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 23-27).\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants add that under Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement, the parties stipulated explicitly the obligation to maintain the provisions of the Investment Code. In light of this explicit obligation, the Claimants consider that it is not reasonable to claim that the Parties wanted to implicitly exclude some of the most important clauses of the Investment Code (such as those pertaining to the limits on expropriations or to the method for settling disputes) (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 31).\n\n74.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the parties' conduct also shows that no *contrary agreement* exists. Thus, up until March 15, 2012, the Republic expressed no objection to the Claimant's letter of May 24, 2011 containing the acceptance of the ICSID arbitration proposal (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 41-42).\n\n75.\n\nEven if one considered that a contrary agreement exists, the Claimants deem that it has not been proven that this agreement grants exclusive jurisdiction to the CCJA Tribunal to deal with investment litigations as opposed to a jurisdiction which is alternative to that of the ICSID. The Claimants establish an analogy with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention which stipulates that *unless otherwise agreed,* consent to the ICSID's arbitration implies a waiver of the right to exercise any other recourse. In the case of the departure from the rule of the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICSID, the other four have a jurisdiction which is alternative to that of the ICSID which is nonetheless not excluded (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 48-56). The Claimants reject the Respondent's argument concerning the *irrevocable* nature of the choice of the CCJA arbitration or the analogy with the *fork in the road* clauses. The Claimants consider that the adjective *irrevocable* refers to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal and not to the parties' choice of the CCJA Tribunal. The Claimants note moreover that it is always possible for the parties to amend an Arbitration Clause later on, so that the choice of the CCJA arbitration is never irrevocable. As concerns the *fork in the road* clauses, the Claimants allege that Article 28 of the Investment Code does not offer a choice between several Tribunals but requires that the litigations concerning its interpretation or application be settled exclusively by an ICSID Tribunal (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 87-92 and 96-99).\n\n76.\n\nAs an explicit, unequivocal *contrary agreement* does not exist between the Parties, the Claimants consider that the Investment Code must be interpreted in a manner which protects the investors and, more specifically, which favors the jurisdiction of the ICSID (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 12-13).\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants argue that at the jurisdiction stage, the Arbitral Tribunal must determine solely, *prima facie,* whether the facts alleged by the Claimants (in the event that they were to prove founded) are apt to constitute a breach of the Investment Code. The Claimants refer in this respect to the *AMCO versus Indonesia, Impregilo versus Pakistan* and *SGS versus Pakistan* cases. The Claimants recall that this latter case also concerned a contractual termination and that the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged its jurisdiction, despite the fact that the contractual Arbitration Clause was broader than the Arbitration Clause in the case at issue (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 132-141 and \u00a7\u00a7 90-94, 122 and 213).\n\n*ii) Scope of the Concession Agreement and the Arbitration Clause*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's allegation, the Claimants object that the expropriations scheme is not governed by the Concession Agreement and that the requests concerning expropriations do not fall into the scope of the Arbitration Clause. The Concession Agreement indeed stipulates that an act of expropriation can lead to the termination thereof and to the payment of a contractual indemnification. But, according to the Claimants, this does not imply that the expropriation - as an act of the Public Authorities - cannot also constitute a breach of the Investment Code (which was not abrogated), as acknowledged by the court in the *SPP versus Egypt, Azurix versus Argentina* or *Impregilo versus Pakistan* cases (Counter-Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 65-73).\n\n79.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Concession Agreement was not aimed at replacing the Investment Code. The reference to the expropriation was aimed solely at prohibiting the Republic from modifying in its legal order in order to permit, for example, that contractual terminations following expropriations not call for indemnification. According to the Claimants, the reference to the Investment Code proves that for Getma International the fact of maintaining the clauses of the Investment Code continued to constitute a useful guarantee (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 95-99).\n\n80.\n\nAs concerns specifically the indemnity, the Claimants object that the just and adequate compensation referred to in Article 5 of the Investment Code, is not defined by Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement. According to them, a distinction exists between indemnification (due to the contractual termination) stipulated in the Concession Agreement and calculated according to the rules of stipulated in the contract on the one hand, and the compensation (due to the expropriation) stipulated in the Investment Code and calculated according to the usual rules and practices of international law, on the other hand. They add that the Investment Code does not permit the parties to depart from the evaluation criteria stipulated in Article 5 of the Investment Code and that the Concession Agreement makes no reference to Article 5 of the Investment Code (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 110-114). To illustrate the difference between contractual compensation for termination and legal compensation for expropriation, the Claimants contend that in the event of a partial expropriation not entailing the termination of the Concession Agreement, only the legal indemnification would be owed (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 146-149).\n\n*iii) Parties to the Arbitration Clause*\n----------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants contend that only Getma International is party to the Arbitration Clause. They consider that the theory of the group of companies does not apply in the case at issue and in all events would not lead to the elimination of the ICSID arbitration (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 155).\n\n82.\n\nOn the one hand, the Claimants allege that the group of companies theory is far from being established and was even rejected in several countries. In all events, they consider that the crucial factor for applying the group of companies theory - namely the parties' common intention to bind non-signatories - has not been proven by the Respondent. They emphasize that the Respondent merely establishes that the Claimants are part of the same group of companies and alleges (without proving it) that they participated in the negotiation, conclusion or execution of the Concession Agreement. And yet, the *negotiation, conclusion and execution* can, according to the Claimants, merely indicate the parties' common intent. In the case at issue, the Claimants denied that it was their wish to be bound under the Arbitration Clause and, in particular, under an implicit contrary agreement liable to obviate an ICSID arbitration. The Claimants specify that Mr. Talbot's signing of the Concession Agreement is not relevant, inasmuch as this was necessary for Getma International's valid commitment (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 157-181, 190-197).\n\n83.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants allege that the group of companies theory was never utilized in case law to eliminate an investor's right to resort to ICSID arbitration. The effect of this argument on the contrary, is to extend the rights of the creditors or members of the group of companies by involving non-signatories in the arbitration. As for the argument of the *piercing of the corporate veil,* the Claimants consider that it can apply only if it is proven that the corporate veil is utilized for illegal purposes. However, the Claimants affirm that Getma International's signing of the Concession Agreement is not the result of an attempt to commit fraud or to derive undue benefit from any right whatsoever (Counter-Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 201-211).\n\n*iv) Identity between the litigation brought before the CCJA Tribunal and before the ICSID Tribunal*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the CCJA arbitration and the ICS IT arbitration are distinct, as they are dealing with different litigations, different requests and different grounds. Only the facts are the same (Counter Memorial no. 2\u00a7\u00a7 114-115); the Claimants allege that the Respondent acknowledged moreover the existence of a contractual litigation and an investment litigation in paragraph 79 of its Memorial. They emphasize in this respect that contrary to that which the Respondent alleges, the investment litigation has not been brought before the CCJA. This interpretation would seem to stem from a poor reading of the Memorial filed by Getma International in the CCJA procedure (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7117 and 130). In all events, the CCJA Tribunal could always decline its jurisdiction if requests concerning the application of the investment legislation were effectively brought before it (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 125).\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants recall that international arbitral case law admits that the same series of facts can constitute simultaneously a breach of a contract and of a bilateral investment treaty (or *mutatis mutandis* of national legislation for the protection of foreign investments). The Claimants quote the decisions pronounced in the *Vivendi versus Argentina* case (award canceling the *ad hoc* committee), the *Bayindir versus Pakistan, Impregilo versus Pakistan,* *Vivendi versus Argentina* cases (Vivendi II) and the *Biwater versus Tanzania* case (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 57-67).\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants contend that in the case at issue, the Termination Decree is an act of the Public Authorities which - incidentally - also resulted in a breach of the Concession Agreement (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 68-70). The Claimants emphasize that the Respondent itself acknowledges that the Termination and Requisition Decrees are acts of the Public Authorities and not merely acts on the part of a party to a contract (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 73).\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the litigation brought before the ICSID Tribunal concerns precisely the extra-contractual effect of the act of the Public Authorities constituting an expropriation measure as per the Investment Code. The CCJA Tribunal for its part has been asked to rule on the contractual effects of this Termination Decree which constitutes an act *which impedes the proper functioning of the activities of the concession* as per article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 48-49, 78-80, Counter-Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 82-87).\n\n88.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants allege that the grounds for the requests and the indemnification claimed before the CCJA Tribunal and the ICSID Tribunal are distinct. In this regard, the Claimants quote the opening brief submitted by Getma International in the CCJA procedure, in which the requests are based on the Republic's violation of its contractual obligation to minimize the effects of any change of law and acts of the Public Authorities which impede the proper functioning of the activities in the concession. In this same brief, Getma International also indicates that the damages claimed in its capacity as Concessionary correspond to *the portion of its prejudice which was contractualized in the Concession Agreement* but that *\"the indemnification stipulated in article 32.3, paragraph 5, as well as that resulting from the breach of article 32.5, paragraph 3, of the Concession Agreement (cf. Section 5.5) is not such that it will indemnify Getma International for the entire prejudice it sustained in its capacity as an investor evicted as the result of an illegal act on the part of the Public Authorities amounting to an expropriation* (Counter-Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 105-107, Counter-Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 125-130).\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants add that they intend to request of the ICSID Tribunal a decision which places them in the economic and financial position in which they would have been had the Concession Agreement been pursued for the total 25-year period *(lucrum cessans).* This amount will be considerably higher than the amount requested, in the strictly contractual terms, by Getma International, and the CCJA arbitration (Counter Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 72-76, 109, 141-142).\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants specify finally that the independence of the CCJA and ICSID Tribunals, emphasized by the Respondent, is not called into question and is not relevant for resolving the issue of jurisdiction (Counter-Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 38).\n\n*v) Capacity as investor and the making of an investment*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn a preliminary capacity, the Claimants note that the Republic acknowledges that Getma International and the Concession Agreement constitute respectively an investor and an investment. Concerning the other members of the group, the Claimants refer to their letter of October 28, 2011 to the ICSID's Secretariat, and contend that the investments they made respectively are the result of: (i) the signing of the Concession Agreement and Getma International's direct shareholding in the STCC Company, (ii) STCC's activity as operator, (iii) NCT Infrastructure Logistique's performance of the work of extending the container terminal, (iv) the shares owned directly or indirectly in the aforementioned companies by NCT Necotrans and Getma International Investissements (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 216-222).\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants specify that the Investment Code does not restrict the scope of its application to certain types of investments. The Investment Code indeed does not stipulate that the litigations subject to the ICSID's arbitration must pertain to investments and does not contain a definition of the notion of investment (article 3.2 concerns only the *investment of capital from abroad).* According to the Claimants, under article 28 of the Investment Code, it suffices that the Claimant be a foreign investor and that the litigation pertain to the application and interpretation of said code, which is the case here (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 230-240).\n\n93.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that each of them sustained a personal prejudice in direct conjunction with the Republic's actions, in their respective capacities as contracting parties to the Concession Agreement, a shareholder in the group's companies, financer of the investments, Concessionary, first ranking investor, STCC's money-lender and assistant project manager. They point out however that the grounds of the alleged counts of prejudice must be examined at the merits stage (Counter Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 248-265).\n\n**VIII. DISCUSSION**\n--------------------\n\n**a. Introduction - Bifurcation**\n---------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nDuring the first procedural meeting of March 30, 2012, as the Respondent had announced that it intended to contest the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, the parties agreed on the bifurcation of the procedure and a procedural calendar which implemented this bifurcation.\n\n95.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is therefore called upon at this stage to rule exclusively on its jurisdiction, without ruling on the merits of the litigation. However, as shall be discussed below, questions regarding the merits are or may be raised at this stage, during the analysis of the issue of determining whether the Claimants, and in particular the second, third and fourth Claimants, are investors or have made investments as per the Investment Code, and the issue of the relation between the material clauses of the Concession Agreement and those of the Investment Code, issues which inevitably arise in the analysis of the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n96.\n\nThe arbitrators consider however that this decision regarding their jurisdiction can and must be made regardless of the possible ties with the merits of the litigation. Given the parties' agreement on the bifurcation, the Arbitral Tribunal is also of the opinion that its decision regarding jurisdiction is to be made independently of any issue regarding the merits. The Arbitral Tribunal is therefore adopting the following decision regarding its jurisdiction, without prejudice to possible issues pertaining to the merits on which it will be called upon as the case may be to dwell at a later stage.\n\n**b. The arbitration clause as a contrary agreement.**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal (if it exists) relies on Article 28, para. 2, of the Investment Code quoted above in para. 12. This provision however reserves for the parties involved the right to conclude contrary agreements. Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal would not entertain jurisdiction if it turned out that the Parties had concluded such a contrary agreement.\n\n98.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that the expression contrary agreement:\n\na) allows for a parallel jurisdiction: to exclude the ICSID's arbitration, it does not suffice to grant jurisdiction to another forum for the same litigations;\n\nb) implies the expression of a clear intent on the parties' part;\n\nc) places the burden of proof on the party who intends to claim such a contrary agreement.\n\n99.\n\nIt must then be determined whether Article 31 of the Concession Agreement, on which the Respondent bases its plea of lack of jurisdiction, constitutes a contrary agreement of the parties involved as per article 28 of the Investment Code.\n\n100.\n\nArticle 31 is the first article of section 4 of the Concession Agreement which covers *the settlement of disputes and litigations, termination and indemnification.* It stipulates that:\n\n*this clause will survive the termination of the agreement.*\n\n*The OHADA treaty and its subsequent uniform act will apply to this agreement.*\n\n*Any dispute or litigation resulting from this agreement or its Additional Clauses will be settled amicably.*\n\n*Failing an amicable settlement within 3 (three) months following the protest, the parties may resort to arbitration in the manner stipulated below:*\n\n*The grievance, dispute or litigation will be settled definitively and irrevocably following an arbitration procedure governed by the arbitration regulations of the OHADA Common Court of Justice and Arbitration (the CCJA Arbitration Regulations).*\n\n*The arbitral commission will be composed of 3 (three) arbitrators, one appointed by the Grantor, the second by the Concessionary, and the third by joint agreement of the two arbitrators. If one party fails to appoint an arbitrator within a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of a request to this effect from the other party, or the two arbitrators failed to agree on the choice of the third arbitrator within a period of thirty (30) days (beginning on the date of the appointment of the second arbitrator), the Common Court of Justice and Arbitration will replace the parties in accordance with the CCJA Arbitration Regulations.*\n\n*Each of the parties will bear the cost of the arbitrator it has appointed. The other costs generated by the arbitration will be shared equally between the parties.*\n\n*The arbitration will be conducted in the French language in Abidjan, the Republic of the Ivory Coast.*\n\n*The granting authority explicitly waves its right to claim for itself or for its assets any sovereign immunity in order to defeat the execution of an award rendered by an arbitral commission made up in accordance with this clause.* (Referred to hereinafter as the arbitration clause).\n\n101.\n\nThe contrary agreement must be concluded between the parties involved. It is not contested that the Concession Agreement was concluded between the signatory parties, namely the Guinean state and the first Claimant, Getma International. The Arbitral Tribunal will if necessary focus on the issue of determining whether the three other Claimants are also parties thereto, after having decided whether article 33 constitutes a contrary agreement concluded between the Guinean state and Getma International.\n\n102.\n\nThe arbitration clause establishes recourse to an Arbitral Tribunal according to the OHADA regulations (the CCJA Tribunal) for:\n\na) any dispute or litigation (art. 31, para. 3), or the grievance, dispute or litigation (art. 31, para. 5), a formula which appears broad and certainly broader than the disputes which are the object of article 28. of the Investment Code;\n\nb) resulting from this Agreement and its Additional Clauses.\n\n103.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a contrary agreement between the parties must lead to a result contrary to that of the designation of the ICSID as the arbitration institution with jurisdiction to rule on their investment litigation2 (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 23). It considers that the arbitration clause designates irrevocably the CCJA Tribunal for all disputes resulting from the agreement and excludes the jurisdiction of the ICSID3 (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7 29).\n\nOur underlining.\n\nOur underlining.\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent's reasoning. For there to be a contrary agreement, the Arbitration Clause contained in Article 31 of the Concession Agreement must grant jurisdiction to a CCJA Tribunal to settle all the claims which Getma International might infer from the Investment Code, thereby depriving the ICSID Tribunal of all the jurisdiction it would otherwise have to rule on this issue.\n\n105.\n\nAnd yet the arbitration clause, by granting jurisdiction to the CCJA Tribunal (i) did not specify that this jurisdiction replaces that of the ICSID, nor did it explicitly exclude the ICSID's jurisdiction; and (ii) did not specifically attribute jurisdiction to the CCJA court to settle disputes pertaining to the application and interpretation of the Investment Code. And the disputes resulting from this agreement are not *a priori* necessarily the same as those pertaining to the application and interpretation of the Investment Code\n\n106.\n\nContrary to that which the Respondent claims, the fact that all the litigations arising from the agreement must be brought before a CCJA Tribunal, regardless of their nature or the legal grounds invoked by the parties (memorandum no. 1 \u00a7 31), does not prove that the arbitration clause applies also to (or to all the) disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the Investment Code and excludes the jurisdiction of the ICSID. The Respondent is thereby attempting to lump together4 the *contract claims* and the *treaty claims* (the different nature and grounds of which are nonetheless generally acknowledged by arbitral case law5) and denies the fact that a same given act can constitute both a breach of a contractual obligation and a violation of the Investment Code, and, as the case may be the subject to two different courts.\n\nAlthough it recognizes the distinction, given that, in its Memorial no 2 it supposes that the Arbitratin Clause includes not only the *contract claims,* but also the *treaty claims* (\u00a7\u00a7 17 and the following).\n\n*whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law (...) (*Vivendi versus Argentina, annulment decision*,* Case ARB/97/3, \u00a7 96); *\"treaty claims are juridically [sic] distinct from claims for breach of contract, even where they arise out of the same facts (**Bayindir versus Pakistan,* decision on jurisdiction, Case. ARB/03/29, \u00a7 148); *\"The fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not mean that it cannot also - and separately - give rise to a treaty claim. Even if the two perfectly coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries. (**Impregilo versus Pakistan,* decision on jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, Case. ARB/03/3, \u00a7 258).\n\n107.\n\nA literal reading of Article 28.2 of the Investment Code which mentions only the litigations arising from the Concession Agreement, in no manner constitutes a restrictive interpretation such as the Respondent claims (Memorial,\" 2 \u00a7\u00a7 35-37).\n\n108.\n\nInasmuch as the jurisdiction of the ICSID Tribunal was not excluded, this Tribunal in theory entertains jurisdiction to settle disputes pertaining to the application and interpretation of the Investment Code. Inasmuch as an act of the state would constitute both a breach of the contract and a violation of the Investment Code, there would then be the parallel jurisdiction of the two Tribunals. However, it would not be competitive, given that the focus of the jurisdiction of each Tribunal would depend on the respective legal grounds of each request, the rights violated, the parties injured, the prejudice sustained and the entitlement to respective compensation under the Concession Agreement, or the Investment Code. The fact that the parallel jurisdictions can lead to a double collection of damages, does not mean that each court will not be called upon to exercise its own jurisdiction. It is in the handling of the merits and in particular at the time of the verification of the evidence of the prejudice, that the double collection of compensation shall be avoided.\n\n109.\n\nSubject to that which is stated in subsection D below, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's argument that Getma International chose irrevocably the CCJA Tribunal as the only Tribunal with jurisdiction by coming before it in the first place. Contrary to that which the Respondent claims (Memorial no. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 44), the use of the term irrevocable in article 33 of the Concession Agreement does not mean that the choice of CCJA arbitration excludes all other judicial or arbitral channels. It is clear upon reading the article that the terms irrevocably and definitively pertain to the manner in which the dispute arising from the agreement will be settled by the CCJA Tribunal, namely without any possibility of appeal. The fact that the two terms are undoubtedly pleonasms does not permit one to interpret one of them as pertaining to anything other than the Tribunal's decision. The irrevocable nature of the choice between the two courts would imply moreover that the jurisdiction of the two (OHADA and ICSID) Tribunals is mutually exclusive. And yet it has not yet been proven that the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal excludes that of the ICSID Tribunal for disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the Investment Code.\n\n110.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent's argument according to which article 28 two of the Investment Code is comparable to a *fork in the road* clause. This comparison stems, according to the Respondent, from the nature of the exclusive choice the Code offers the parties (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 46 53, and in particular \u00a7 52). And yet up until now the analysis of the arguments proffered by the Respondent does not allow one to conclude that the arbitration clause excluded the ICSID's jurisdiction.\n\n**c. Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent also invokes article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement in support of its argument that the CCJA arbitration agreement covers not only the *contract claims* but also the *treaty claims* and therefore excludes the ICSID's jurisdiction for the *treaty claims.*\n\n112.\n\nArticle 32.5 is part of the same section 4 *(settlement of disputes and litigations, termination and indemnification)* as article 31. The Arbitral Tribunal recognizes that this circumstance could be relevant for interpreting the arbitration clause. This article stipulates:\n\n*32.5 Changes of law and acts of the Public Authorities impeding the proper functioning of the activities in the concession*\n\n*Any act, decision or absence of an act or decision, springing from the state, the dismemberment of the state or of the granting authority of a constitutional, legislative, regulatory or other nature, the direct or indirect effect of which is to prevent the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations (a change of law and acts of the Public Authorities impeding the smooth functioning of the activities granted in the concession), and in particular:*\n\n*(i) Any unwarranted withdrawal, nonrenewal or non-issuing of any permit, license or other form of authorization necessary for the execution of the agreement, for the operation or management of the activities granted in the concession.*\n\n*(ii) Expropriation, nationalization, gradual expropriation and gradual nationalization.*\n\n*(iii) Amendment of the Investment Code and of the laws in force.*\n\n*(iv) Direct and indirect measures, the result of which is to discriminate against the Concessionary in favor of possible competitor(s) of the Concessionary, or to favor them to the Concessionary's detriment, in the port of Conakry.*\n\n*The Concessionary will send to the Grantor a preliminary notice of change of law within fifteen (15) days following the change of law, (or within forty-eight (48) hours following the becoming aware of the Change of Law if the Concessionary could not reasonably have become aware thereof beforehand.)*\n\n*The Grantor will do its utmost to minimize the effects of any change of law or acts of the Public Authorities which impede the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession.*\n\n*If, at the expiry of a period of sixty (60) days, the consequences of the change of law and acts of the Public Authorities impeding the smooth functioning of the activities granted in the concession have not been satisfactorily remedied for the Concessionary, it may serve final notice of change of law upon the Grantor and the Monitoring Committee.*\n\n*In the event of a termination following a change of law and acts of the Public Authorities impeding the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession, the Concessionary will receive the indemnification stipulated in article 32.3 of the agreement.*\n\n113.\n\nThis article therefore contains several provisions aimed at acts which constitute violations of the Investment Code such as:\n\n- the withdrawal etc.... of any authorization whatsoever which is not warranted;\n\n- expropriation and nationalization (even gradual) (art. 5 of the Investment Code);\n\n- measures discriminating against the Concessionary in favor of its possible competitors or favoring these competitors to the detriment of the Concessionary (art. 6 of the Investment Code).\n\n113.\n\nOn the other hand, the act referred to in subparagraph (iii) consisting in amending the Investment Code, does not necessarily constitute a violation of this code. This is the case in particular when the guarantees benefiting the investor pursuant to the first book of the Code are not restricted by said amendment. Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement for its part is aimed at the amendment of the Investment Code only inasmuch as its direct or indirect direct effect is to prevent the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations.\n\n114.\n\nFurthermore, the other provisions of article 32.5 do not concern as is such violations of the Investment Code, but are aimed at them exclusively inasmuch as they prevent the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations. The article is aimed above all at the Concessionary's obligations and not its rights. If a change of law or an act of the Public Authorities prevents the Concessionary from meeting its obligations properly, article 32.5 confers upon the Concessionary the right to terminate the agreement after the mailing of two notices and the observance of a waiting period. Regarding this point, article 32.5 clearly departs from the Investment Code, which is aimed at maintaining the Concessionary's rights as an investor.\n\n116.\n\nArticle 32.5 also uses the term impeding the smooth functioning of the activities granted in the Concession. The activities granted in the Concession however are operational activities, defined objectively (article 2, as well as article 6 of the Concession Agreement) and do not directly concern the conditions in which the Concessionary must execute them (subjective element in the operator's count). This confirms that article 32.5 is hardly preoccupied with the Concessionary's situation, except that it authorizes it to terminate the Concession Agreement with the financial consequences stipulated in another article (article 32.3) and identical to those which prevail in the case of a termination due to the Grantor's fault. Article 32.5 indeed does not establish a strict correlation between the change of law/act of the Public Authorities and the termination of the agreement. Even if this is not explicitly stipulated, it ensues from the preliminary and final notice procedure stipulated in article 32.5 that the decision to terminate the agreement following a change of law/act of the Public Authorities belongs to the Concessionary. Only this decision creates the right for the Concessionary to the indemnities stipulated in article 32.3 (which are identical to those stipulated in the case of termination due to the Grantor's fault).\n\n117.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, (i) article 32.5 introduces the expropriation dispute into the scope of the contract and (ii) the combination of this provision and of article 316 (which submits any litigation resulting from the Concession Agreement to the CCJA Tribunal) constitute an agreement contrary to the jurisdiction of the ICSID (Memorial no. 2, \u00a7 17). As expropriations are explicitly governed by article 32.5 and as this clause is in the same section 4 as the arbitration clause, the Respondent considers that *this confirms that the parties intended to place expropriation disputes in the scope of the CCJA arbitration agreement.* (memorial no. 2 \u00a7 26).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent acknowledges here implicitly that Article 31 alone does not suffice to conclude that the ICSID's jurisdiction is excluded by Article 31, conclusion of sub-section b. above.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that *the expropriation and its consequences are expressly governed by article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement. They therefore fall into the scope of the CCJA arbitration agreement* (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 31). However, this is true only inasmuch as the expropriation becomes the cause of the agreement's termination and therefore of a litigation as a result of the agreement. Article 32.5, like article 31, therefore covers only one particular aspect of expropriation, which is the termination resulting therefrom. It does not govern expropriation *per se.* This distinction was perfectly illustrated by the example of a partial expropriation given by the Claimants7: in the event that the State were to expropriate two cranes in the port of Conakry belonging to Getma International, without however impeding the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations or the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession, both article 5 and article 28.2 of the Investment Code would continue to apply.\n\nCounter-Memorial n\u00b0 2 \u00a7\u00a7 147-149.\n\n119.\n\nThus, the Tribunal cannot follow the Respondent when it infers from the observation quoted at the beginning of paragraph 117 above, that the parties *chose explicitly to grant jurisdiction to the CCJA for litigations concerning the Guinean Investment Code* and that they *intended to withdraw this litigation from the jurisdiction of the ICSID* (Memorial no. 2\u00a7 41). The jurisdiction granted to the CCJA Tribunal concerns litigations resulting from the agreement, including those pertaining to the termination of the agreement following a change of law or an act of the Public Authorities which prevents the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligation or impedes the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession. However, it covers nothing else.\n\n120.\n\nArticle 32.5 of the agreement establishes a particular termination scheme following a change of law or other act on the part of the Public Authorities which applies subject to the respect of certain conditions of substance (impeding the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession and/or8 the direct or indirect effect of which is to prevent the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations) and of form (two notices and two waiting periods). This particular scheme differs from the scheme which applies to termination as a result of the Grantor's fault (covered by article 32.3 of the agreement) due to:\n\n- a double notice (preliminary notice of change of law and final notice of change of law), although in the case of a purely contractual fault, a single written notice specifying the list of the grievances put forth suffices;\n\n- a fixed 60 day correction period, while in the case of a purely contractual fault the period can be established by the Concessionary itself, although it cannot be under 60 days;\n\n- the 15 day period beginning on the date of the change of law (or 48 hours following the becoming aware of the change of law) for mailing the preliminary notice, while no time limit is imposed in the case of a purely contractual fault;\n\n- The intervention of the Monitoring Committee which must also receive the final notice of change of law.\n\nIt is an issue pertaining to the merits which must not be resolved at this stage, to determine whether to impede the smooth functioning of the Activities granted under the concession is the same condition as, or an additional condition to, or only an alternative condition compared to, the condition of having as direct or indirect effect of impeding the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations.\n\n121.\n\nOn the other hand, the indemnity owed under the contract in the event of termination following a change of law or an act of the Public Authorities and that which is owed in the case of termination due to the Grantor's fault, are identical. This scheme is not illogical: by signing the agreement, the state acknowledges that any change of law or act on the part of the Public Authorities, without even being faulty or unwarranted, authorized the Concessionary to terminate the agreement and entitled it to an indemnity which was identical to that owed in the event of the Grantor's fault, if, and only if, the change of law or act on the part of the Public Authorities impeded the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession/or impeded, directly or indirectly, the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations.\n\n122.\n\nLitigations concerning the application of article 32.5, like those pertaining to the other articles of the agreement, obviously fall within the sole jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal.\n\n123.\n\nThe fact that the parties have specifically determined the impact which a change of law or act of the Public Authorities could have on their contract, does not in itself constitute a basis for contending that this contractual scheme replaces the legal scheme set forth in the Investment Code. Article 32.5 has its own specific contractual objective which cannot replace a general legal scheme. The reference, in article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement, to *any act* [...] *on the part of the state* cannot replace the Investment Code. As stated above, such acts are taken into account - and will be covered - by the agreement only if their *direct or indirect effect is to prevent the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations* or if they impede *the smooth functioning of the activities granted under the concession.* The agreement governs the consequences of these acts on the agreement. Inasmuch as termination follows an act on the part of the Public Authorities, article 32.5 contractualizes the *treaty claims* which must, as a consequence, be brought before the CCJA Tribunal in accordance with article 31 of the agreement.\n\n124.\n\nThe question which remains then is to determine whether the agreement governs exhaustively the consequences of the acts fulfilling the conditions of article 32.5. The answer to this question would determine concretely whether the Concessionary, acting in its capacity as investor or otherwise, can - in the case of an expropriation leading to the termination of the agreement - claim other indemnities or indemnities higher than those stipulated in article 32.3, and before what court. This is an issue pertaining to the merits which must be solved by the court before which the requests concerning these additional indemnitees are brought.\n\n125.\n\nThis Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that there is a contrary agreement pursuant to which the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal replaces that of the ICSID, but the scope of the application of which is strictly circumscribed by the terms of article 32.5. There is therefore no jurisdiction which competes with the CCJA Tribunal and the ICSID Tribunal for requests based on the termination of the agreement as a result of an act by the Public Authorities, but at the very most this Tribunal's additional jurisdiction if the Concessionary deems that an act of the Public Authorities constitutes a violation of the Investment Code and has entailed damaging consequences other than (those of) the termination of the agreement.\n\n**d. Getma International's request in the CCJA arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Getma International's filing of the request for arbitration before the CCJA of May 10, 2011 and the signing of the minutes of the meeting of the CCJA Tribunal of March 12, 2012 confirm the parties' agreement to totally exclude the ICSID's jurisdiction for disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the Investment Code pursuant to the arbitration clause (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 54 and the following).\n\n127.\n\nIt is therefore fitting to determine whether the first Claimant's conduct (i) proves its agreement to replace the ICSID's jurisdiction in its entirety (and not only for the act of the Public Authorities which causes the termination of the agreement) by that of the CCJA Tribunal, (ii) can constitute a waiver of the ICSID's jurisdiction or (iii) constitutes an obstacle (or estoppel) to its now denying that it accepted the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal for the *treaty claims* which result from the agreement.\n\n128.\n\nReferral to the CCJA Tribunal does not in itself prove Getma International's waiver of the ICSID s jurisdiction. In the case of parallel jurisdictions, each Tribunal exercises its own jurisdiction and the prior referral of a case to one of them does not deprive the other of its jurisdiction. Indeed, the *fork in the road* doctrine applies only in the case of competing jurisdictions.\n\n129.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact of submitting to one court requests which fall within the specific jurisdiction of another court could possibly constitute a waiver. In this regard, the Claimants statement of the requests made by Getma International before the CCJA Tribunal (Memorial no. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 54-97 and Memorial no. 2 \u00a7\u00a7 44-56) is interesting. Indeed, it appears that the request for arbitration filed on May 10, 2011 by Getma International before the CCJA Tribunal did not concern solely the contractual requests such as defined in article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement. Getma International requested in particular that the CCJA Tribunal sentence the Respondent to pay not only the contractual prejudice (para. 3.3.1) comprising the four indemnitees mentioned in article 32.3, but also the additional prejudice, comprising, in addition to an indemnification for undermining its reputation, *an indemnity equal to the loss of profit it, could legitimately have expected for the entire duration of the Concession Agreement* (para. 3.3.2) (exhibit R-9). The Tribunal notes that Getma International bases this request on article 104, para. 2 of the public contracts code of the Republic of Guinea.\n\n130.\n\nIt is remarkable that, notwithstanding this very clear language, the Claimants allege categorically, in their Counter Memorial no. 1, that *in the CCJA - contractual- arbitration, Getma did not request compensation for the* lucrum cessans *which is unquestionably part of the prejudice sustained by the expropriated investors* [...] (\u00a7 109).\n\n131.\n\nThe requests made in the request for CCJA arbitration were subsequently broadened, in particular in the minutes of the parties' meeting with the CCJA Tribunal on March 12, 2012 (also called *CCJA arbitration agreement).* At this stage, Getma International intended to see the Respondent sentenced to pay the following, duly quantified, indemnities:\n\n*- 20,894,966 \u20ac as an all-inclusive termination indemnity;*\n\n*- \u20ac2,508,214 as a termination indemnity;*\n\n*- \u20ac14,201,096 as an indemnity equal to the unamortized amount of the entry ticket;*\n\n*-* *\u20ac13,606,721 as the indemnity owed for the requisitioned goods9*\n\n*- \u20ac1,361,305 for the indemnity owed for initial capital expenditures and formation expenses;*\n\n*- \u20ac110,557 as the indemnity owed for the current contracts;*\n\n*- \u20ac806,959 as the indemnity owed for the non collection of the current assets;*\n\n*- \u20ac87,124 as the indemnity owed for the costs of repatriating personnel;*\n\n*- \u20ac279,863 as an indemnity owed for expenditures linked to crisis management;*\n\n*- an indemnity to be quantified for the* *additional prejudice10* *referred to in \u00a7 33.2 of the arbitration request;*\n\n*- the interest accruing at the legal rate on all the preceding sums from the date of the preliminary notice of change of law* (exhibit R-10, p. 16).\n\nOur underlining.\n\nOur underlining.\n\n132.\n\nOf the items on this list, only the first three items clearly pertain to the contractual indemnities stipulated in article 32.3 of the agreement; the sixth and eight items could represent the fourth contractual count of prejudice stipulated in article 32.3, namely *the amount of the possible severance indemnities which the Concessionary might owe to its personnel.* The additional prejudice is again claimed therein, but once more, without being quantified. Among the other new items, one draws particular attention: the amount of \u20ac13,606,721 claimed as an *indemnity owed for the goods requisitioned.*\n\n133.\n\nEven if all the other new items, like the additional prejudice, could be considered as contractual counts of prejudice (notwithstanding the fact that they are not included in the all-inclusive indemnities established in article 32.3 of the agreement), the indemnity for the requisitioned goods is, for its part, clearly outside the scope of the application of the contract and constitutes without a doubt an investor's request based on the guarantees contained in article 5 the Investment Code.11\n\nArticle 5 of the Investment Code: *The Guinean State takes no measures of expropriation or nationalization impacting the investments made by persons or companies, subject to the cases of public utility established on the conditions stipulated by law. In the event of public utility, the expropriation measures must not be discriminatory and must provide just, adequate compensation the amount of which will be determined according to the usual rules and practices of international law.*\n\n134.\n\nGetma International's initial conduct could therefore cause one to conclude that it recognized or accepted the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal, even for the treaty claims which are not explicitly referred to in article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement or, alternatively, waived the jurisdiction of the ICSID to rule on these claims. The Claimants however contest this conclusion\n\n135.\n\nFirst of all, they place the accent on a letter sent by Getma International to the Guinean President on May 24th 2011 to confirm its consent to submit the disputes existing between the state concerning the application and interpretation of the Investment Code to the arbitration of the ICSID, and to accept the offer of arbitration made by the State in article 28 of the Investment Code (exhibit C-6). The Tribunal considers, along with the Respondent, that the simple acceptance of the offer, without formulating the slightest request and without even referring to the expropriation (although it occurred on March 8, 2011 and was notified formally to Getma on March 18, 2012) cannot be considered as a referral of the case to the ICSID. The Claimants acknowledged this moreover implicitly when they asserted that: *Document number C 6 is a very standard document. Its purpose is to no longer permit the Republic of Guinea to withdraw its offer which is in the Investment Code* (record of the hearing on ICSID's jurisdiction, p. 54, lines 24-26). The Tribunal considers moreover that given that the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal for treaty claims is limited to those which fall into the scope of article 32.5, thereby leaving additional jurisdiction to the ICSID, the Respondent had no reason to protest to the acceptance of the principle of the ICSID arbitration proposal.\n\n136.\n\nSecondly, in their Counter Memorial no. 2, the Claimants distanced themselves from their requests for indemnification for the additional prejudice and the goods requisitioned. They have not responded to the argument developed by the Respondent in its Memorial no. 2 (\u00a7\u00a7 44-56) according to which Getma International submitted it treaty claims to the CCJA Tribunal in its request for CCJA arbitration and in the CCJA arbitration agreement. The Claimants deny having called upon the CCJA Tribunal regarding the *lucrum cessans* and the indemnification for the requisition, not only by their silence regarding that which the request for CCJA arbitration and the CCJA arbitration agreement say, but also by the fact that the deny explicitly having presented a *treaty claim: First of all, it is important to recall that, even if Getma International had presented a treaty claim to the CCJA Arbitral Tribunal -* *which is not the case - this would not mean that the CCJA Tribunal necessarily entertains jurisdiction to rule on this same claim* (\u00a7 125). They rely exclusively on the Memorial presented by Getma International in the framework of the CCJA arbitration (Exhibit R-6) and charge the Respondent with not having referred to this Memorial in its statements on jurisdiction filed in the framework of this ICSID arbitration. They refer (\u00a7 129) in particular to paragraph 571 of the CCJA Memorial according to which *despite its contractual obligation, the Guinean State not only did not believe it was its duty to minimize the prejudice it was deliberately causing Getma International. Worse even, it preferred to requisition all of Getma International's assets, goods and employees using the armed forces.* They conclude (in \u00a7 130) that the legal basis for this request for indemnification is the breach of Art. 32.5 of the Concession Agreement, which stipulates that *the Grantor shall take all useful measures for minimizing the effects of any Change of Law and Acts of the Public Authorities which impede the smooth functioning of the Activities granted in the Concession.*\n\n137.\n\nIn order to grasp the Claimants' change of position, which they are attempting to deny -wrongly according to this Tribunal -, it is important to recall the chronology of the pertinent facts and acts of the procedure:\n\n- March 8, 2011: Termination Decree of which Getma became aware from television (and communicated formally on March 18, 2011)\n\n- March 9, 2011: Preliminary Notice from Getma, with reference to Article 32.5, of a change of Law\n\n- March 9, 2011: requisition Decree\n\n- March 9 2011: Getma's final notice\n\n- May 10 2011: Getma's request for CCJA arbitration, based on article 32.5 of the agreement and targeting, in addition to the contractual prejudice, also the additional prejudice (comprising the *lucrum cessans)* (exhibit R-9);\n\n- May 24 2011: letter accepting the offer of ICSID arbitration in article 28.2 of the Investment Code (exhibit C-6).\n\n- June 22, 2011: Decree lifting the requisition of Getma's assets (exhibit C-26)\n\n- September 29 2011. request for ICSID arbitration and just, adequate indemnification-which is not quantified for the breach of articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Investment Codes.\n\n- March 12, 2012: (report) CCJA arbitration agreement, comprising \u20ac13.6 million for the assets requisitioned and an unquantified indemnity for the additional prejudice (R-10)\n\n- March 30, 2012: minutes of the first session of this ICSID Tribunal\n\n- June 15, 2012: CCJA Memorial presenting the (highly reduced) indemnity for the goods requisitioned as an indemnity for the breach of a contractual duty and no longer claiming the *lucrum cessans* (exhibit R-6)\n\n- June 22, 2012: the Claimants' opening brief on jurisdiction in the ICSID arbitration\n\n- July 13, 2012: the Claimants' first Counter Memorial on jurisdiction in the ICSID arbitration\n\n138.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that it is only after the first session of this Tribunal that the Claimants removed from their request before the CCJA Tribunal the indemnities for the *lucrum cessans* and for the requisitioned goods.\n\n139.\n\nIndeed, page 119 of the CCJA Memorial contains, in conclusion the request to sentence the Respondent to pay a total amount of \u20ac42,245,208 for the following items (exhibit R-6):\n\n*- All-inclusive termination indemnity \u20ac20,884,966*\n\n*- termination indemnity \u20ac4,189,140*\n\n*- indemnity for the entry ticket \u20ac14,201,096*\n\n*- indemnity linked to repatriated personnel \u20ac172,874*\n\n*- indemnity pertaining to invoices to be issued \u20ac589,418*\n\n*- indemnity pertaining to restituted goods \u20ac1,974,885*\n\n*- indemnity pertaining to non-terminated contracts* \u20ac187,995\n\n*- indemnity pertaining to crisis management costs \u20ac258,834*\n\n140.\n\nOn first site, these counts of request are similar to those appearing in the CCJA arbitration13 agreement, (even if there are several differences, not only in the amounts, but also in their wording). However, the total amount of the requests is no longer \u20ac53,856,805 (as in the CCJA arbitration agreement), but is reduced to \u20ac42,459,208. There is no longer a request for an additional indemnity *(lucrum cessans).* Moreover, the list no longer contains *the indemnity owed for the assets requisitioned for the amount of \u20ac13,606,721, but rather and indemnity for the requisitioned* goods for an amount of \u20ac1,974,885. In paragraphs 568 - 572, it presents this request for indemnity pertaining to the requisitioned assets as based on a violation of the Respondent's contractual duty to minimize, after receipt of a preliminary notice, the effects of any change of law and acts of the Public Authorities. In paragraphs 592 to 623 of the same CCJA Memorial, Getma International explains then that following the requisition Decree of March 9, 2011, its operating equipment and stocks were made unavailable and *were returned only later* pursuant to a new Decree of June 22, 2011, for the purposes of lifting the requisition of these assets14. The costs entered into accounts concern the repatriation and repair of the equipment.\n\nSee \u00a7 131 above.\n\nThis Decree lifting the requisition is also mentioned on page 12 of the ICSID arbitration request.\n\n141.\n\nThis new presentation of the facts and request leads us to the realization that, at least in the CCJA Memorial, there are no longer, currently, any requests which could be considered as treaty claims.\n\n142.\n\nDuring this Tribunal's hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, on September 28, 2012, one of the Claimants' attorneys specified that *in the* [CCJA] *Memorial* [...] *Exhibit R-6* [...]*, The counts of prejudice are specified and quantified this time; it's paragraph 645.* *In all of these counts of prejudice, not one concerns the loss of future income15**... On the other hand, in the request for arbitration before your Tribunal, the issue, which preceded the opening brief before the CCJA, is extremely precise. Even if the quantification has not been done at this stage,* [...]. (Record of hearing on ICSID jurisdiction, p. 58, line 26-p. 59, line 3).\n\nOur underlining.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal then sought confirmation of Getma International's change of position in the CCJA arbitration:\n\n***Professor P. Tercier.-*** [...] *In the current state of the CCJA procedure, you have no more requests based on the violation of the... Investment Code?*\n\n***Mr. C. Fischer.-*** *That is totally true. With one overtone; it's not that there are no more requests,* *there are none16. In my opinion there never were any explicit clear requests.*\n\n***Professor P. Tercier.-***[...] *At the end there was a reference to number 332 regarding which we understood* [...] *that it was o prejudice which resulted this time from the breach of article 5, of articles 6 and of article 7 of the [mining] code.*\n\n*Is this a change in your position?*\n\n***Mr. C. Fischer*** *- My reference to articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Investment Code was indeed in the request for ICSID arbitration.*\n\n***Professor P. Tercier,-*** *Alright. My question is obviously: at the CCJA, you no longer have any justified requests?*\n\n***Mr. C. Fischer-****No, there are no more.*\n\n***Professor P. Tercier.-*** *There are no more, to answer your question, because there were some, if I may say in the initial stage; is that true?*\n\n***Mr. C. Fischer.-*** *No, that is not our understanding of things.* (Record of hearing on ICSID jurisdiction, p. 60, line 8-26).\n\nOur underlining.\n\n144.\n\nLater on, another of the Claimants' attorneys made a similar statement:\n\n**Mr. J.M. Judice.-** [...] *My strongest conviction is to the effect that we used explicitly the criteria of article 32.3 and no other criteria.* *We did not request lucrum cessans19.* (Record of the hearing on the ICSID's jurisdiction, p. 62, lines 25 - 27).\n\nOur underlining.\n\n145.\n\nThe question pertaining to that which the Tribunal could only consider as a change of Getma International's position but which its attorneys were reluctant to acknowledge-was nonetheless brought back to the table in conjunction with the indemnity of \u20ac13.6 million owed for the requisitioned goods requested in the CCJA arbitration agreement, but no longer in the CCJA Memorial of June 15, 2012. At that moment, the Claimants acknowledged the change in the request and explained it as follows:\n\n**Mr. C. Fischer.-** [...] *Second point, why did we slip, evolve as you said? That is perfectly true, because the question we were confronting was to determine whether the all-inclusive indemnity stipulated under the Concession Agreement was necessarily limited, in the contractual context, and could we request a higher sum or not? In other words, could we under the Concession Agreement, consider that the compensation stipulated in the contract exhausted all the prejudice for which we could request indemnification under the Concession Agreement?* (record of hearing on ICSID jurisdiction, p. 69, lines 20-27).\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it cannot settle for this answer. It is clear that Getma International indeed envisaged at the outset bringing all its requests resulting from the termination and the requisition, including that for indemnification for its *lucrum cessans* and for a substantial indemnification for the requisitioned goods before the CCJA Tribunal. The idea of basing certain requests on the Investment Code and of claiming them before an ICSID Tribunal was a second reflex. However, it was not implemented in a substantial manner:\n\n(i) the request for ICSID arbitration of September 29, 2011 brought before this Tribunal is-with the exception of (i) the description of the facts, which is practically identical to that of the request for CCJA arbitration and (ii) the legal grounds20 - very vague and in no manner quantifies the prejudice but plans to determine it at the appropriate time in this procedure (p.22, b) thereby allowing a doubt to remain regarding that which is requested in each of the two procedures and;\n\n(ii) even after the filing of the request for the ICSID arbitration, on March 12, 2012, Getma International again signed a report/CCJA arbitration agreement which covers explicitly a request for indemnification for its *lucrum cessans* and for the requisitioned assets. It is only in its CCJA Memorial of June 15, 2012, six weeks after the first session of this ICSID Tribunal, that Getma International appears21 to have reduced its request to the counts of request which is considers to be contractual.\n\nWhich, in short, consist in stating that the termination of the contract was discriminatory, produce effects comparable to those of an expropriation (p. 14) and represent an act of the Public Authorities and not only a simple contractual execution or breach (p. 5 and 16).\n\nIts being understood that this Tribunal is not required to rule on the nature of the requests before the CCJA Tribunal and furthermore it does not have the means to do so.\n\n147.\n\nThe evolution in the Claimants' procedural strategy however does not prevent the fact that this Tribunal must determine the parties' common intent at the time of the conclusion of the Concession Agreement and that this intent, if it was not explained, can also be inferred from the parties' execution of the contract. And the fact that Getma International included, in its request for CCJA arbitration, requests which were not strictly contractual in the sense that they exceeded that which article 32.3 stipulated, but some of which (the indemnities for the *lucrum cessans* prejudice, for undermining its reputation and for the goods requisitioned) could, depending on their grounds, be contractual or based on the Investment Code, then became relevant.\n\n148.\n\nIf the *lucrum cessans* request no longer appears in the CCJA Memorial of June 15, 2012, the question arises as to whether it still falls within the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal. According to the Respondent's attorney, the arbitration agreement defines the perimeter of the CCJA Tribunal's mission and it matters little that Getma modified its position in its Memorial (record of hearing on ICSID jurisdiction, p. 63, lines 6 - 12). This Tribunal considers that the issue is one for the CCJA Tribunal, the only Tribunal with jurisdiction to determine the scope of the referral, particularly as the Respondent did not accept Getma International's rejection or waiver of the CCJA's jurisdiction for *lucrum cessans* and the requisition of the goods. This Tribunal must therefore accept as fact the initial referral of the case to the CCJA Tribunal for the *lucrum cessans* and requisition indemnities.\n\n149.\n\nThis Tribunal attempted during its hearing on jurisdiction on September 28, 2012, to clarify the parties' respective positions. It specifically questioned the Claimants regarding the legal interpretation to give to the limitation on their requests in the CCJA Memorial and in particular whether the requests which no longer appear therein had been abandoned before the CCJA Tribunal and if this waiver was then explicit and final (record of hearing on ICSID jurisdiction, p. 68, lines 24-31).\n\n150.\n\nIn response, the Claimants acknowledged that *our analysis* [...] *has evolved and we considered that under the Concession Agreement a prejudice existed which had been contractualized and that, on the basis of the Concession Agreement, we do not have the grounds for requesting future profits for the loss of the contract* [...]. *Today things are very clear, although they were not clear previously, before the CCJA: we are no, and are no longer, requesting future profits, if it can be considered that we made such a request* [...]. *It was considered contractually that the prejudice for the loss of the contract* [...] *should not be assessed as a number of years of results, but should be lumped together in one year of revenue* (record of hearing on IC jurisdiction, p. 69, line 28, - p. 70, line 20\u00b0;\n\n151.\n\nIt is then fitting to determine what the Claimants are requesting of this Tribunal. An analysis of the request brought before this Tribunal reveals that the Claimants consider that:\n\ni. Having acted in a unilateral manner, the Guinean state violated the standards binding it through the Investment Code, in particular in the domain of expropriation, i.e. the most consolidated rules of customary international law (p. 13, 3rd para.);\n\nii. the decision to terminate the contract, in the terms in which it was carried out, was discriminatory inasmuch as it could not be applied to a Guinean investor (p. 14, 1st para.);\n\niii. Termination produced effects comparable to those of an expropriation (p. 14, 4th para.);\n\niv. The termination of the contract by the President represents an act of the Public Authorities (p.15, 4th para.) and exceeds the framework of the execution of the contract because:\n\n1. the state is represented in the contract by the Transport Minister;\n\n2. the preliminary formalities for a contractual termination based on the Concessionary's fault, such for example as a formal notice and a 60 day correction period, were not carried out (p. 17);\n\nv. the requisition also produced effects equivalent to those of an expropriation, because no type of indemnification is provided for (p. 17);\n\nvi. the two Decrees constitute *jus imperiiet* acts, not merely acts carried out pursuant to a contract in force (p. 17, last para.).\n\n152.\n\n*Prima facie* this Tribunal entertains jurisdiction for requests formulated in this manner, subject to the requests which the parties to the Concession Agreement had excluded from the ICSID's jurisdiction in their contrary agreement, in accordance with article 28.2 of the Investment Code. The scope of the application of this Tribunal's jurisdiction therefore does not include litigations resulting from the Concession Agreement, including its termination, even following an act of the Public Authorities. Indeed, Articles 32.5 and 31 of the Concession Agreement are also binding upon this Tribunal. However, it will not be until the time of the analysis of the Claimants' precise requests, their legal grounds, their factual causes and the damages, that this Tribunal can determine if and to what extent its jurisdiction, supplementary to that of the CCJA Tribunal, can be effectively implemented to rule on a supplementary indemnity for a supplementary prejudice, which exceeds the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal.\n\n**e. The contrary agreement of the second, third and fourth Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThis Tribunal must then determine what parties are bound by the arbitration clause. To do so, it is not enough to observe that the second, third and fourth Claimants all belong to the same group of companies and that they have shared executives. To appreciate whether these other three Claimants indeed intended to be bound by the arbitration clause, it is fitting to examine their respective roles during the negotiation, conclusion and execution of the Concession Agreement. This is what this Tribunal will do in an initial stage.\n\n*(i) NCT Necotrans' signing of the Concession Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nIt is not contested that only Getma International signed the Concession Agreement. According to the introduction and the signature page (p. 27) of the Concession Agreement, Getma International was represented at the time of the conclusion of the agreement by its President, the NCT Necotrans company, represented in its turn by Mr. Richard Talbot in his capacity as chairman of NCT Necotrans' Board of Directors. The fact that Getma International was represented by its President appears normal22 and does not permit one to infer a desire on NCT Necotrans' part to be involved in the Concession Agreement in its own name. Even if article 15 of Getma International's Articles of Association stipulates that *the president* [i.e. NCT Necotrans] *is vested in all circumstances with all the powers necessary for representing and managing the company,* this power is merely a power of representation and management *as regards third parties23* and does not permit one to conclude that the two companies are identical or one in the same.\n\nAccording to Article 12 of the Articles of Association: *the company is represented, managed and administered by a president, who can be a legal entity or natural person, of French or foreign nationality, a company shareholder or not. The president, if it is a legal entity, is represented by its corporate officers or by a representative appointed specifically for this purpose.* (Exhibit R-12)  \nAccording to the excerpt from the Trade and Companies Register of September 12, 2011 for Getma International, Getma International's president was NCT Necotrans (Exhibit C-1).  \nThe Tribunal notes that, according to the entry in the Trade and Companies Register of May 13, 2011 for NCT Necotrans, Mr. Richard Talbot was chairman of the Supervisory Board at the time, while the chairman of the Executive Board was Mr. Gregory Qu\u00e9rel (Exhibit C-2). However this does not enable one to conclude that on September 22, 2008, the title utilized by Mr. Talbot was not correct (which neither party has raised for that matter). In all events, both of them were corporate officers of NCT Necotrans, which appears to suffice under article 12 of Getma's Articles of Association\n\nThe Respondent omitted to quote these important words in \u00a7 60 of its Memorial n\u00b0 2.\n\n155.\n\nIf Mr. Talbot's signature implies the agreement of NCT Necotrans (of which he was a corporate officer) with the conclusion of the contract by its subsidiary Getma International, this still does not mean that NCT Necotrans, although a Getma International shareholder, is itself bound under the contract (as the Respondent claims in its Memorialo 2, \u00a7 66).\n\n156.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that it be the chairman of NCT Necotrans' Executive Board, Mr. Qu\u00e9rel, who signed it for NCT Necotrans acting in the capacity of Getma International's chairman, the special power of attorney granted to the Fischer and Judice firms to represent Getma International in the CCJA arbitration (exhibit R - 14), in no manner means that this power of attorney was granted by NCT Necotrans, and even less that it thereby became a party to the contract, or even to the procedure. There is no doubt that NCT Necotrans acted, in all of these instruments, as Getma International's president.\n\n157.\n\nIt appears that the NCT Necotrans company is the chairman of the Board of Directors, not only of the Getma International (exhibit C - one), but also of Getma International Investissements (Exhibit C-3). The signature of the president of NCT Necotrans can therefore, depending on the case, bind this company or one of its subsidiaries of which NCT Necotrans is the legal representative. It is therefore fitting to check each time in what capacity NCT Necotrans has affixed its signature. It is not proven that NCT Necotrans affixed its signature in a capacity other than as Getma International's president.\n\n*(ii) joint address*\n--------------------\n\n158.\n\nWe note furthermore that NCT Necotrans, Getma International, Getma International Investissements and NCT infrastructure & logistique all four had their respective registered offices at the same address (66, rue Pierre shower all, 75008 Paris).\n\n159.\n\nThis same address, like the double functions, are apt to create a certain confusion between the various companies. However, they do not mean that the distinct identities of these various legal entities can be disregarded and that the rights and obligations of some with those of the others are lumped together. Third parties are required to recognize each company's specific identity, unless the companies themselves fail to respect it and create confusion in this regard.\n\n*(iii) The role of NCT Necotrans' legal director in the CCJA arbitration*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent also invokes the direct participation of Mr. Sean Danielle Littler legal director of NCT Necotrans, in the CCJA arbitration, and in particular his presence at the hearing of March 12, 2012, as well as his signing of the CCJA arbitration agreement (Memorial no. 2 \u00a7 74).\n\n161.\n\nMr. Littler was indeed present, but it was clearly in his capacity as Legal Director of NCT Necotrans (exhibit R - 10, last page). The mere presence of the legal director of a group's holding company does not allow one to conclude that he represented one or several companies not party to the procedure at this hearing. It is common practice that a parent company provide services (i.e. legal services) to its subsidiaries24. Nowhere in the record is it stated that Mr. Littler was present in any capacity other than that of the group's (and therefore also Getma International's) legal director, for example as legal representative of NCT Necotrans. Mr. Littler also signed the record of the hearing (Exhibit R-10), but it was clearly specified on page 1 of the record that he was (present as) Legal Director NTC [sic] Necotrans.\n\nCfr. Also the presence of Mr. Littler at the hearing of this Tribunal of March 30, 2012.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the mere signing of the record by Mr. Littler does not bind NCT Necotrans anymore than his presence at the hearing.\n\n*(iv) Mr. Abdel Aziz Thiam's signature*\n---------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe position as president of NCT Infrastructure & Logistique of Mr. Abdel Aziz Thiam, who is also Vice-Chairman of NCT Necotrans' supervisory board (Exhibit C-4), does not suffice either in itself to conclude that these two companies are bound under contracts concluded by Getma International.\n\n164.\n\nMr. Abdel Aziz Thiam cosigned (along with Mr. Richard Talbot) Additional Clause no. 1 to the Concession Agreement. As he is both chairman of the Board of Directors of the STCC operating company and president of the Board of Directors of NCT Infrastructure & Logistique, it is nonetheless clear that he signed this Additional Clause in his capacity as STCC's corporate officer: his signature proves that the operating company read and approved (as stated above his signature) Additional Clause no. 1 to which only Getma International and the Guinean State were parties. The preamble to Additional Clause no. 1 recalls that the operating company was (in accordance with the Concession Agreement) the Concessionary's representative. It was in the capacity of contractual representative that it was present at the signing of the Additional Clause, as was the Conakry port authority which was there as the Grantor's representative. None of these representatives however was party to Additional Clause no. 1.\n\n*(v) The negotiators of the Concession Agreement*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe respondent also derives an argument from the fact that Mr. Abdel Aziz Thiam also directed Getma International's negotiation team, as confirmed by Getma International in its opening brief before the CCJA (exhibit R6- \u00a7 161). Getma International specified however that this same Mr. Aziz Thiam subsequently became Chairman of the Board of Directors of the operating company (STCC) which was to be created in accordance with the obligations resulting from article 7.1 of the Concession Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is entirely normal that the person selected for managing the operating company, who has the technical knowledge pertaining to the concession operations, be a member, even the manager, of the negotiation team. One cannot infer solely from his presence on the team that the future operating company or NCT Necotrans was planning to be bound by the contract.\n\n166.\n\nIt is the same for the legal director and the assistant legal director of the NCT Necotrans group who were also part of the contract negotiation team. If NCT Necotrans delegates the negotiation to its legal directors, this does not necessarily imply that they represent their employer in these negotiations. As already noted above, these persons participated in negotiations as the group's legal experts whose legal services can be provided to all the companies in the group on the basis of intergroup service agreements. In such a case, these of services concern purely intellectual contributions and cannot be confused with a mandate to represent their employer.\n\n167.\n\nMr. Michel Kerambrun, port expert intervening for the account of the subsidiary and NCT infrastructure & Logistique and Mr. Jean de Montmarin, project chief at NCT Infrastructure & Logistique (opening brief before the CCJA Tribunal \u00a7 162 and Exhibit C-11 p. 38) also participated in the negotiations. This observation alone however does not permit one to conclude that NCT infrastructure & Logistique became a party to the Concession Agreement. Indeed, according to the letter of October 28, 2012 from the Claimants to ICSID's Secretariat, NCT infrastructure & Logistique was a technical subsidiary of NCT Necotrans responsible as assistant project manager for the work of extending the container terminal. Under these circumstances, this company's mere delegation of its technical experts to the negotiations was not abnormal and did not necessarily mean that NCT Infrastructure & Logistique was becoming or had the intention of becoming party to the Concession Agreement itself.\n\n168.\n\nIt is in the same capacity that NCT Infrastructure & Logistique was able to execute a portion of the obligations resulting from the Concession Agreement, among others by launching, for the account of Getma International, the call for bids for the construction of the new dock stipulated under the Concession Agreement (ICSID arbitration request, p. 11). The position as assistant project manager can constitute the legal basis on which NCT Infrastructure & Logistique executed certain obligations under the Concession Agreement for Getma International, a basis which was therefore distinct from the contract binding Getma International to the Guinean state.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, taken in an isolated manner, each of the interventions of the second, third and fourth Claimants in the negotiation, the signing and execution of the Concession Agreement - inasmuch as they are proven - is legally and/or factually warranted by and based on specific mandates. In themselves these interventions in no manner prove that they are due to the neglect of, or confusion between, the companies belonging to a given economic group, acting in breach of their legal identities and respective roles. The mandate and specific role of each company in the group, such as they appear in the file, prove that the second, third and fourth Claimants did not agree to be bound directly under the Concession Agreement. Subject to that which follows, the Tribunal notes that the respondent has not proven that the involvement of the aforementioned Claimants in the negotiation, the signing or execution of the agreement proves such an intent on their account.\n\n*(vi) The Claimants' joint, concerted action*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal deems however that it is necessary to consider the Claimants' different interventions in this negotiation, signing and execution, not only separately, but also globally and in their context. An entirely different impression then emerges.\n\n171.\n\nFirst of all, we note that the Claimants acknowledge that the investment which constitutes their basis for making their requests in this ICSID arbitration, is exclusively the product of each of their contributions to the execution of the Concession Agreement (Claimants' letter to ICSID's Secretariat of October 28, 2011). In their request for ICSID arbitration, the Claimants acknowledged that *the execution of the public service concession contract implied a financial investment to be made by the Concessionary (investor)* (ICSID arbitration request, p. 21). Therefore, this financial obligation of the contract was in fact not executed, or certainly not exclusively by the Concessionary, Getma International, but by NCT Necotrans, via the Concessionary Getma International, and by the intermediary holding company Getma International Investissements which was created specifically for the purpose of owning 95% of the STCC operating company. This Tribunal considers that Concession's financial structure proves that NCT Necotrans' intervention in the execution of the Concession Agreement (and in particular its financial obligations) had been envisaged from the outset when Getma submitted its bid. This appears to be confirmed by the title of exhibit C 15 in the index of the attachments to the ICSID arbitration request: *excerpt from the NCT NECOTRANS group's financial proposal,* [blank] *GETMA INTERNATIONAL/TRANSAFRICA S.A., containing the summary of the investments made during the first two years of the Concession.* NCT Necotrans' argument that it was not bound by the Concession Agreement can therefore not be followed.\n\n172.\n\nThe situation is comparable for NCT Infrastructure & Logistique which apparently had the necessary technical knowledge to meet other obligations of the Concession Agreement and in particular to become the assistant project manager appointed by Getma International for the extension of the terminal.\n\n173.\n\nThis being said, the participation of the representatives of NCT Necotrans and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique (even if individually they can also be considered as the representatives or legal or technical advisors of Getma International as stated above in subsection (v)) takes on a particular meaning: if they are viewed as a group, they are the representatives of the companies which planned from the outset of the negotiations (or even since the filing of the bid) to execute the Concession Agreement together. In fact, the list of the parties participating in the negotiation of the Agreement (attached thereto as appendix 10) makes no mention of any person representing the Concessionary, Getma International, alone. It is therefore fitting to consider Getma International, NCT Necotrans and NCT infrastructure & Logistique as an association or group whose members have undertaken jointly to execute the obligations of the Concession Agreement together.\n\n174.\n\nEven if this joint and several commitment was not made in writing vis-a-vis the Respondent (regarding which the two Claimants could however not have ignored that they would derive assurances of the presence of the representatives of the various companies in the negotiations and the close ties between them25), this Tribunal concludes that the participation in the negotiations on the part of natural persons with double roles, but representing in fact also companies who are clearly participating in the execution of the Agreement - which was effectively confirmed later on - warrants that these companies which did not sign the agreement be bound by the Agreement, if not jointly and severally, at least each for its part, and also by the Arbitration Clause.\n\nThis could be a confusion created on the count of a third party, which is discussed in \u00a7 158 above.\n\n175.\n\nFurthermore, without wanting to prejudge the capacity as investors of the second and third Claimant (NCT Necotrans and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique), the Tribunal considers that their affirmation, in their letter of October 28, 2011 to the ICS IDs Secretariat, that they are both investors (exhibit C-44) confirms that they were just as committed as Getma International, and on the same conditions, including the arbitration clause.\n\n176.\n\nInasmuch as the investment(s) made in Guinea constitute the execution of the Concession Agreement, this Tribunal cannot admit that the Claimants base their argument on their respective investment, i.e. their joint and several investment, while denying that they are bound under the agreement. It is inadmissible that they infer a right from the Investment Code on the basis of the same acts which constitute the execution of contractual obligations which they claim they did not take on. The duty of this Tribunal however is not to rule on the execution of the Concession Agreement, but only on the contrary agreement which eliminated the jurisdiction of this ICSID Tribunal for the consequences of the termination of the agreement which ensues from an act on the part of the Public Authorities.\n\n177.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Tribunal considers that NCT Necotrans and NCT Infrastructure & Logistique are bound by the arbitration clause in article 31 of the agreement.\n\n**(vii) Getma International Investissements**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nAs concerns Getma International Investissements, the Tribunal noted that it was not created until November 12, 2008, as an intermediate holding company, in order to channel the investment which Getma International had undertaken to make in a Guinean operating company, itself created on November 20, 2008. This implies therefore that, contrary to the other Claimants, Getma International Investissements was not able to participate in the negotiations of the Concession Agreement or to express any wishes whatsoever regarding the Arbitration Clause. However, this does not suffice to maintain that this intermediate holding company is not bound by this Arbitration Clause.\n\n179.\n\nPrecisely because Getma International is merely an instrument created specifically for the purposes of fulfilling Getma's obligation to create an operating company (article 9 of the agreement) and constituted merely a pass-through for the capitalization of STCC by Getma International and NCT Necotrans, there is no reason to exclude it from the application of the Arbitration Clause which binds its two shareholders. The fact that the Arbitration Clause can be applied to it is confirmed by its shareholders meeting which decided on May 9, 2011, as did (i) NCT Infrastructure & Logistique's shareholders meeting, (ii) NCT Necotrans' executive board and (iii) Getma International's sole shareholder26:\n\n*to initiate all judicial or arbitral procedures designed to obtain compensation for the prejudice sustained by the company following the termination of the Conakry container terminal Concession Agreement and the expropriation of which it was the victim, and in particular in the framework of arbitrations before the CCJA and the ICSID against the Guinean State as well as against the Bollor\u00e9 group.27*\n\nDocuments n\u00b0 1, n\u00b0 2, n\u00b0 3 and n\u00b0 4, attached to the Claimants' letter to the ICSID Secretariat.\n\nOur underlining.\n\n**(viii) Conclusion**\n---------------------\n\n180.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, as well as for the acknowledgment implicit in the decisions of their respective competent bodies of May 9, 2011, the wording of which, identical for each Claimant, is mentioned in paragraph 179 above, this Tribunal concludes that its jurisdiction to rule on disputes pertaining to the interpretation and application of the Investment Code is limited, with respect to the four Claimants, by the arbitration clause in article 31 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. This Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the termination of the Concession Agreement as concerns the four Claimants.\n\n2. This Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the requisition and other alleged breaches of the Investment Code which do not fall into the framework of the Concession Agreement with respect to the four Claimants.\n\n3.

This annulment was based on the CCJA's disagreement with\u00a0the amounts of the Tribunal's fees, which the Tribunal had agreed upon with the parties. The\u00a0CCJA considered that they did not comply with the price scale provided under article 10.1 of\u00a0its arbitration regulations.\n6. \u00a0The Claimants allege that:\" with the annulment of the CCJA award, Getma's contract claims\u00a0ceased to exist\", and emphasized that \"this is important even in the perspective of this\u00a0Tribunal, which is that contract claims can coexist with treaty claims\"2. For the Claimants\u00a0\"any hesitation (...) no longer needs to exist regarding the fact of determining whether\u00a0Getma's presentation in the CCJA arbitration recordf...) of requests concerning \"the indemnity\u00a0owed for the assets requisitioned\" and the \"additional prejudice\" prevented the Claimants\u00a0from requesting indemnification in these capacities in this arbitration, on the basis of\u00a0violations of the Investment Code\"3.\n7. \u00a0Also, according to the Claimants, the fact that the CCJA Tribunal refused to rule on the issues\u00a0concerning the loss of profit and requisition in order to avoid ruling ultra petita is of no\u00a0importance, given that said award has been annulled.\n8. \u00a0The Claimants emphasize the fact that only this arbitral procedure can permit a\u00a0determination of whether the expropriation of the Claimants' investments by means of the\u00a0Termination and Requisition Decrees, violated the Investment Code. In the event that a\u00a0violation were established in this respect, the indemnifications stipulated would compensate\u00a0for the entire amount of the damnum emergens and the lucrum cessans, which are the\u00a0consequences of said Decrees.\n9. \u00a0According to the Claimants, Guinea relied on the CCJA award as grounds for its allegations\u00a0concerning the principle of estoppel, waiver and res judicata. However, the total annulment\u00a0of the award by the CCJA defeats this argument. The Claimants point out moreover that the\u00a0CCJA could have chosen to maintain the procedural acts carried out in the framework of the\u00a0CCJA procedure in accordance with article 29.5 of its regulations, but this option was not\u00a0retained. According to the Claimants, it is therefore clear that the CCJA considered that all\u00a0procedural acts carried out before the CCJA Tribunal were invalid, as per Guinea's request for\u00a0that matter4.\n10. Concerning the arguments regarding the denial of justice, the Respondent, in its post-hearing\u00a0Memorial, insists on the fact that the Claimants did not even evoke the CCJA annulment\u00a0decision at the hearing while, according to the Respondent, they were aware thereof. As\u00a0grounds for its affirmation that the Claimants were aware of the annulment, the Respondent\u00a0quoted the following statement by the Claimants during the hearing: \"the CCJA system which\u00a0is already proven to be not at all impartial, can have the award annulled on any pretext\u00a0whatsoever, while an ICSID decision for its part is final\"5. The respondent concludes finally\u00a0that the Claimants chose deliberately to send a post-hearing letter to the Arbitral Tribunal for\u00a0purely self-serving purposes so that it would declare that it entertained jurisdiction. The\n2 ldem,\u00a7 83.\n3 Idem, \u00a7 84\n4 Idem, \u00a7\u00a7 92-93.\n5 Respondent's post-hearing Memorial, \u00a7 84.\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 172 of 173\nRespondent also affirms that the Claimants have the possibility of initiating a new arbitration procedure before the CCJA, which would exclude denial of justice.6\n11. In light of the foregoing, it appears that the circumstances of the case, following the\u00a0annulment of the CCJA award, impose the application of the rebus sic stanibus principal,\u00a0which moderates the potential effects of the res judicata principle in the instance of the\u00a0decision on jurisdiction, and this inasmuch as the just decision on jurisdiction is based on the\u00a0premise that the arbitral procedure concerning the contract claims respected a series of\u00a0guarantees. One premise which was not confirmed in the facts. Consequently, if one takes\u00a0account: of the letter from the Claimants to the Arbitral Tribunal following the annulment of\u00a0the CCJA award, in which the Claimants announce the denial of justice that such a situation\u00a0implied for them, as well as the possible exclusive responsibility of the members of the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal concerning the amount of the fees and the total annulment of the CCJA award to\u00a0the sole prejudice of the parties, it is not possible to conclude, simply, that the Claimants can\u00a0initiate another arbitration before an institution which no longer enjoys the parties' trust as\u00a0regards their fundamental procedural guarantees. Contrary to that which was asserted by\u00a0the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal, the consideration of a possible denial of justice alleged\u00a0by the Claimants concerns this Arbitral Tribunal.\n12. It is necessary also to add that the Arbitral Tribunal has a duty of procedural fairness to the\u00a0parties. And yet, it was with total awareness of the situation of a possible denial of justice at\u00a0the beginning of its deliberations, that it did not convene the parties on this point, nor did it\u00a0require of the parties that they tackle the issue in a more detailed manner in their posthearing Memorials. No reference is made to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal on the\u00a0basis of the decision on jurisdiction made at the time. And yet, the Tribunal was able to give\u00a0a very different impression to the parties in light of its attitude when, for example, after the\u00a0hearing of November 2015, it permitted Mr. Ouaniche to correct his expert report \"in\u00a0relation to the value and the quantification of the investments established in his reports\" and\u00a0requested access to PwC's simulation template.7\n13. This Arbitral Tribunal has a duty to the parties to protect the proper conduct of the\u00a0arbitration, involving the respect of the equitable standards of these proceedings. As\u00a0guarantor of the right to a fair trial and the right to effective access to justice, it cannot\u00a0remain silent regarding such fundamental issues until its final award, as was unfortunately\u00a0the case in this procedure.\n14. Indeed, the Tribunal, in its final deliberation, made an excessively restrictive interpretation of\u00a0its Decision on jurisdiction. The distinction made between termination and requisition\u00a0leading to such a restrictive exclusion of the direct and indirect consequences of the\u00a0termination does not correspond to that which the parties were entitled to expect. In light of\u00a0the conduct of the arbitral procedure and its unfolding, one could have expected that these\u00a0contractual claims would be considered as claims in light of the breach of the Investment\u00a0Code.\n15. The Tribunal should have at least convened the parties before ruling on the alleged situation\u00a0of injustice.\n6 Idem \u00a7\u00a7 85-93.\n7 Procedural order n\u00b0 10 of Nov. 26, 2015, para 2.2\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 173 of 173\n16. In light of all the foregoing, I am convinced that the possible effectiveness of the res judicata\u00a0of the decision on jurisdiction must be appreciated in light of the rebus sic stantibus principle\u00a0and not in a categorical manner without taking account of the circumstances surrounding\u00a0this decision, or of those which occurred subsequently to the decision on jurisdiction.\n[signature]\nBernardo M.

L/95/029/CTRN of June 30,1995 containing the Investment Code\u00a0of the Republic of Guinea.\n  \n  \nCase 1.19-CV-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 9 of 173\n11 Pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID's Secretary General registered the Request on November 3, 2011.\n12. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal is composed of Mrs. Vera Van Houtte, of Belgian nationality, President, appointed\u00a0by agreement of the Parties, Mr. Bernardo Cremades, of Spanish nationality, appointed by the\u00a0Claimant, and Professor Pierre Tercier, of Swiss nationality, appointed by the Respondent.\n13. \u00a0\u00a0On February 2, 2012, the Secretary-General notified the Parties, in accordance with Article 6(1)\u00a0of the Rules of procedure governing ICSID Arbitration Proceedings (referred to hereinafter as\u00a0the \"Arbitration Rules\"), that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments, that the\u00a0Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings brought on that date.\u00a0The Parties were also informed that Mrs. Mair\u00e9e Uran-Bidegain, Legal Advisor at the ICSID,\u00a0was the Tribunal's Secretary (referred to hereinafter as the \"Secretary\").\n14. \u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal held its first session with the Parties on March 30, 2012. The Parties confirmed\u00a0the regularity of the Tribunal's constitution and stated that they had no objections concerning\u00a0its members' statements. It was also agreed that the Arbitration Rules which would apply\u00a0would be those in force since April 2006, that the place of the proceedings would be Paris and\u00a0that the proceedings would be conducted in French. The Parties' agreement was recorded in\u00a0the minutes of the first session.\nB. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Request for recusal\n15. On April 16, 2012, the Defendant submitted a request for recusal against Mr. Bernardo\u00a0Cremades (referred to hereinafter as the \"Recusal Request\"), pursuant to Article 57 of the\u00a0ICSID Convention. Following a tie of the votes of Mrs. Vera Van Houtte and Professor Pierre\u00a0Tercier, the Administrative Council ruled, on June 28, 2012, on the Recusal Request in\u00a0accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. He rejected the Recusal Request and\u00a0decided that the costs incurred by the Parties and the Arbitrators following the Recusal\u00a0Request would be the subject matter of a subsequent decision by the Tribunal.\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jurisdiction\n16. In accordance with the procedural calendar established in point 13 of the Minutes of the first\u00a0session, the Parties submitted the following entries concerning the plea of lack of jurisdiction\u00a0raised by the Respondent due to the arbitration initiated simultaneously by the Claimant,\u00a0Getma International, on the basis of a contractual clause granting jurisdiction, in accordance\u00a0with the Arbitration Rules of the OHADA Court of Justice and Arbitration (referred to\u00a0hereinafter as the \"CCJA arbitration\" and \"the CCJA Tribunal\"):\na) On June 22, 2012: Respondent's Memorial no. 1 on jurisdiction (referred to hereinafter as\u00a0\"Memorial no. 1\");\nb) On July 13, 2012: Claimants' Counter-Memorial no. 1 on jurisdiction (referred to hereinafter as\u00a0\"Counter-Memorial no. 1);\nc)\n  \nd)\n  \nOn August 6, 2012: Respondent's Memorial no. 2 on jurisdiction (referred to hereinafter as \"Memorial no. 2)\n/\u00bfV1 / \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0E rr\nOn September 7, 2012: Claimants' Counter-Memorial no. 2 (referred to hereinafte < \"Counter-Memorial no. 2\").\nI I\u00a0I\nI\nI\nI I\nI\nI\n  \nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 10 of 173\n17. \u00a0\u00a0On September 28, 2012: a hearing on the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction took place in Paris, the\u00a0record of which was submitted to the Parties and to the arbitrators in draft form, the same\u00a0day, and in the final version, subject to possible corrections by the Parties or the arbitrators,\u00a0on October 2, 2012.\n18. \u00a0\u00a0On December 29, 2012, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, the enacting terms of\u00a0which were the following:\n\"1. This Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the termination of the Concession Agreement with respect to the four Claimants.\n2. \u00a0\u00a0This Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the requisition and other\u00a0alleged breaches of the Investment Code which do not fall into the context of the\u00a0Concession Agreement with respect to the four Claimants.\n3. \u00a0\u00a0The costs incurred by the parties and the members of the Tribunal up until now, including\u00a0the costs of arbitration pertaining to the contestation of jurisdiction will be the object of a\u00a0subsequent decision by the Tribunal.\"\n19. \u00a0\u00a0This Decision on Jurisdiction is an integral part of this award by the Tribunal and is\u00a0incorporated therein in its entirety. It appears in Appendix A to this Award.\nD. Suspension of the proceedings\n20. \u00a0\u00a0In a letter of January 10, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the Parties \"as soon as they have\u00a0been informed of the Arbitral Tribunal's Decision regarding Jurisdiction [...] to consult each\u00a0other in order to reach an agreement if possible as to the follow-up on the proceedings, in\u00a0particular if they intend to request that it be suspended\". In a letter of January 31, 2013, the\u00a0Parties presented their respective positions regarding the follow-up on the procedure and in\u00a0particular regarding its possible suspension. The Plaintiffs requested of the Arbitral Tribunal in\u00a0particular that it \"suspend the ICSID arbitration procedure until the CCJA Decision in the\u00a0arbitration procedure\", while the Defendant explained that it could not take a stand regarding\u00a0a possible suspension until the Plaintiffs had specified what requests they intend to pursue\u00a0before this Arbitral Tribunal.\n21. \u00a0\u00a0On February 12, 2013, following the Defendant's non-payment of the second advance, the\u00a0Tribunal suspended the hearing, then resumed it on August 22, 2013 after the ICSID had\u00a0received the payment from the Plaintiffs (who had replaced the Defendant).\n22. On October 1st, 2013, after the Parties had recalled their respective positions regarding\u00a0suspension, the Tribunal rendered Procedural Order no. 1 which stated the following:\na.\n  \nb.\n  \nThe parties are required to inform the Arbitral Tribunal without delay of the approximate date on which the CCJA Tribunal's award is expected and, as the case may be, of any delay of which\u00a0they may be aware;\nThe Plaintiffs shall notify the Arbitral Tribunal as soon as the decision Tribunal has been rendered;\n  \nCase 1.-19-CV-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 11 of 173\nc. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties shall, in any event, inform the Arbitral Tribunal by November 1st, 2013 at the latest,\u00a0of the status of the procedure before the CCJA Tribunal at that time;\nd. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These proceedings are suspended until December Is, 2013, for all useful purposes, subject to\u00a0the receipt of information mentioned in aforementioned points (a) to (c);\ne. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal my reconsider this decision, at any time, in light of the relevant\u00a0circumstances reported to it and will do so in any event propria motu prior to December 1st,\u00a02013.\n23. \u00a0\u00a0On November 28, 2013, the Tribunal rendered Procedural Order no. 2 stating that:\na. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties shall inform this Arbitral Tribunal as soon as the decision or award of the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal is rendered, and, in any event, inform the Arbitral Tribunal by January 6, 2014 at the\u00a0latest of the status of the procedure before the CCJA Tribunal at that time;\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suspension of these proceedings has been extended until Monday, January 13, 2014, for all\u00a0useful purposes, subject to the receipt of information mentioned in point (a) above.\n24. \u00a0\u00a0On January 13,2014, the Tribunal rendered Procedural Order no. 3 stating that:\na. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties shall inform this Arbitral Tribunal as soon as the decision or award of the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal has been rendered, and in any event, inform the Arbitral Tribunal by Monday, April 8,\u00a02014 at the latest, of the status of the procedure before the CCJA Tribunal at that time.\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suspension of these proceedings has been extended until Monday, April 21, 2014, for all\u00a0useful purposes, subject to the receipt of information mentioned in point (a) above.\n25. \u00a0\u00a0On April 16, 2014, the Tribunal rendered Procedural Order no. 4 stating that:\na) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties shall inform this Arbitral Tribunal as soon as the decision or award of the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal is rendered, and, in any event, inform the Arbitral Tribunal by Tuesday June 10, 2014\u00a0at the latest of the status of the procedure before the CCJA Tribunal at that time;\nb) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suspension of these proceedings has been extended until Monday, June 23, 2014, for all\u00a0useful purposes, subject to the receipt of information mentioned in point (a) above.\n26. \u00a0\u00a0On June 10, 2014, the Plaintiffs informed the Tribunal that the CCJA Tribunal had rendered its\u00a0award on April 29, 2014 and, on June 17, 2014, the Tribunal decided to lift the suspension and\u00a0resume the proceedings on this date.\nE.

THE FACTS\n38. \u00a0\u00a0This summary of the facts does not claim to be exhaustive. If needed, other facts will be taken\u00a0into account in the following chapters inasmuch as they are relevant for the decisions to be\u00a0made.\n39. \u00a0\u00a0This litigation concerns an investment made in the Container Terminal (referred to hereinafter\u00a0as the \"CT\") in the Port of Conakry in the Republic of Guinea.\n40. \u00a0\u00a0In March 2008, the Transport Ministry and the Autonomous Port of Conakry (referred to\u00a0hereinafter as the \"APC\") issued a call for expression of interest in an extension and the\u00a0granting of a concession to the Port of Conakry Container Terminal.1 The announcement\u00a0indicated that the project comprised two facets:\n\"The extension of the Container Terminal by creating a second 300-meter long, 13-meter deep, berth in front of the dock and 12 hectares of additional quayside surfaces with a v/evy to\u00a0/k\n\u2014\nEri(\n  \n1 Annonces L\u00e9gales, Jeune Afrique magazine, issue no. 2461 (C-102).\n  \n. . . . ..\n> Av de l>:pcrsi\n64200\n06 14 16 54\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 14 of 173\nincreasing the berthing capacity by at least three hundred thousand (300,000) twenty foot equivalent (TFE) container units per year\"; and\n\"the refurbishment work on the existing Container Terminal, the modernizing of the handling equipment and the building of a platform on the rail connection level which will be annexed to\u00a0the CT\".\nThe call specified that it \"was directed exclusively to candidates with extensive, sound experience in the design, financing, realization, operation and maintenance of Container Terminals\".\n41. \u00a0\u00a0On March 10, 2008, Getma International responded to the call for expression of interest,\u00a0enclosing a brochure introducing the Necotrans group, and various letters from its commercial\u00a0partners.2\n42. \u00a0\u00a0on April 7, 2008, the APC's Director General sent a letter to Transafrica Guinea, representing\u00a0Getma International, informing them that it had been preselected and \"granted permission to\u00a0submit bids for the granting of the concession and the extension\" of the APC CT?\n43. \u00a0\u00a0The tender documents included the specifications and draft agreement, as well as the Bidding\u00a0Regulations?\n44. \u00a0\u00a0In July 2008, Getma International submitted a technical file5 covering the technical aspects of\u00a0its bid and presenting as its contractual partner, Europe Terminal, a subsidiary of the\u00a0worldwide ship-owner Mediterranean Shipping Company SA (referred to hereinafter as\u00a0\"MSC\") and simultaneously, but in a separate envelope, its financial proposal.6\n45. \u00a0\u00a0In August 2008, an evaluation report was drafted by the National Public Contracts Committee\u00a0(referred to hereinafter as the \"Committee\")7. Getma International's technical proposal\u00a0obtained the highest grade of the four bidders, all of whom obtained at least the minimum of\u00a070 points, so that their financial proposals could also be opened. Following their evaluation,\u00a0these bids were classified and Getma International was again in the first place. Thus, the\u00a0National Public Contracts Committee decided, on August 22, 2008, to award the contract\u00a0provisionally to Getma International.\n46. \u00a0\u00a0In a letter of August 27, 2008, the Transport Minister informed Getma International of this\u00a0provisional award by the Committee. In the letter, it asked Getma International to travel to\u00a0Conakry on September 2, 2008 to commence negotiations regarding the Concession\u00a0Agreement8.\n47. \u00a0\u00a0The negotiations of the Concession Agreement subsequently took place. The parties disagree\u00a0as to the duration and degree of intensity thereof. One of the Claimants' witnesses, Mrs.\u00a0Mangiante, states that \"the negotiations took place at the end of the month of August and\u00a0during the month of September 2008\" and that they \"were conducted article by article\". She\n2 Getma International's expression of interest to the PAC (C-03 and C-16).\n3 Letter of April 7, 2008 from the PAC DG to Getma International (C-105).\n4 Bidding Regulations (C-108).\n5 Technical Proposal (C-174).\n6 Financial Proposal (C-179).\n7 Bid Evaluation Report (C-lll).\n8 Letter of Aug. 27, 2008 from the Minister of Transport to Getma International (C-10).\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 15 of 173\nadded that \"the negotiations were particularly difficult, and Necotrans team was [sic] compelled to make major concessions regarding the initial draft\" (Julie Mangiante's affidavit).\n48 On September 11, 2008, FFA Ernst & Young sent a legal opinion to the APC regarding the draft agreement (apparently in the context of a service contract concluded between these two\u00a0parties, strangely on the same date of September 11, 2008).9 The analysis concerns, among\u00a0other things, the project's tax and customs schemes and concludes that \"this situation does\u00a0[...] not appear advantageous for the Grantor\".\n49. \u00a0\u00a0In a technical note was drafted on which the recipient is not specified, which appears to be\u00a0dated September 15 and 16, 2008, issued by a APC representative. It is specified that a longer\u00a0negotiation period could have been retained and regretted the fact that the discussions were\u00a0conducted by the proposal Contracts Commission10 rather than by the APC itself11.\n50. \u00a0On September 22, 2008, the Respondent and Getma International signed the Agreement for\u00a0the Concession of the Container Terminal of the Autonomous Port of Conakry, its extension\u00a0and the building of a rail connection area (referred to hereinafter as the \"Concession\u00a0Agreement\" or \"agreement\").12\n51. \u00a0\u00a0On October 2, 2008, the Guinean Treasury Department cashed a check - already issued on\u00a0September 15, 2008 - on Getma International for the amount of \u20ac7,500,000, corresponding to\u00a0the first half of the entry ticket.13 Article 15.2 of the agreement stipulated that the second half\u00a0was owed within six months of the date of the signing of the agreement.\n52. \u00a0\u00a0On October 31, 2008, Getma International and NCT Necotrans created a joint subsidiary in\u00a0Paris, Getma International Investissements, registered on November 13, 2008.14\n53. \u00a0\u00a0On November 14, 2008, a \"Report - critical study of the sale agreement [s/'c] of the Container\u00a0Terminal of the port of Conakry\" was sent to the Prime Minister by various entities, namely the\u00a0shipping agents and warehousemen, Guinean executives evolving in the Port Sector, corporate\n9 E & Y Legal opinion (C-119): the transmission letter of Sept. 11, 2008, and p. 1 of the opinion note that: \u201cthis\u00a0legal opinion is being sent to you in accordance with the terms of the service contract of September 11, 2008...\".\n10 After verification, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that this Committee is the same as the National Public\u00a0Markets Committee: article 2 of the Bidding Regulations (see-108) states that the receipt and opening of the\u00a0bids will be performed by \"a Committee appointed for this purpose.\" And that the analysis and evaluation are\u00a0performed by \"the Committee\"; article 19, stipulates that \"the Committee, which counts and evaluates the\u00a0blds\" will grant the concession provisionally; and the witnesses at the hearing spoke of the \"Contracts\u00a0Commission\". One can therefore presume that the name \"national public contract Committee\" which appears\u00a0on the Committee evaluation report (C-lll) is the official name of the Contracts Commission, particularly as\u00a0the list of the Committee's members also comprises the name of the two witnesses, as well as those of the\u00a0persons to whom they referred.\n11 Technical note (C-120).\n12 Concession Agreement (C-ll and C-48)\n13 Check on a Getma International account to the order of the Guinean Treasury Department (C-121).

According to Mem. \u00a7205, Getma International\u00a0Investissements was \"created on October 31, 2008, between Getma International who owned 51% and\u00a0therefore controlled it as per articles L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code and the Uniform,AcFc\u00f4ric\u00ebrning\u00a0the law of Commercial Companies and Economic Interest Groups and in the respect of Artic e-7.2 of the\u00a0Concession Agreement, and NCT Necotrans, which owned 49% thereof\". According to Merm \u00a7 56, it was\u00a0decided that Getma International Investissements would be created as an intermediate structure \"which would\u00a0therefore have direct access to the financing of the holding of the Necotrans group\".\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 16 of 173\nunions and Companies operating the APC, the Bureau of Importers of Secondhand Vehicles, the National Union of Road Transporters of Guinea, the Employers Federation of Customs and\u00a0Forwarding Agents of Guinea, and the Bureau of the Informal Sector Importers15.

The Additional Clause also stipulated that the\u00a0balance on the entry ticket, i.e. \u20ac 7,500,000, would be paid in two installments, the first within\u00a090 days of the date of the Additional Clause and the second within 180 days.\n79. \u00a0\u00a0The Parties disagree as to the scope of the work performed by the Claimants between\u00a0Additional Clause no. 1 and the Termination Decree, as well as on the impact on the execution\u00a0of the work for making available the rail connection platform to the Concessionary, which did\u00a0not take place, according to the Claimants, until March 23, 2010.\n80. \u00a0\u00a0On April 30, 2010, Getma International sent a check of \u20ac3,750,000 to the APC41, corresponding\u00a0to the third fourth of the entry ticket.42\n81. \u00a0\u00a0On May 28th 2010, the APC signed a \"receipt\" confirming the receipt of a transfer made by\u00a0Getma International for the amount of \u20ac3,750,000 corresponding to the last fourth of the\u00a0entry ticket.43\n82. \u00a0On December 3, 2010, the Supreme Court of Guinea confirmed the election in November 2010\u00a0of the new President Alpha Cond\u00e9.44\n83. \u00a0\u00a0On January 4, 2011, the new Transport Minister sent a letter to Getma International inviting it\u00a0to a meeting in order to \"review the agreement\".45 The meeting was held on January 14, 2011.\u00a0The parties disagree regarding the very purpose of the meeting and regarding the issue of\u00a0whether the discussion of the financial aspects of the project was on the agenda.

According to\u00a0the witness'18, Mr. Cond\u00e9 had a \"stern\" expression and \"did not want to broach the subject\"\u00a0and the discussion with Mr. Curtis produced no results.\n85. \u00a0\u00a0On January 25, 2011, the National Merchant Marine Administration informed Getma\u00a0International that it had noted, \"with great satisfaction The quality of the presentation of the\u00a0work carried out and the work which is scheduled\", asking it for a chronological forecast of the\u00a0execution of phase 2 of the work.49\n86. \u00a0\u00a0On February 1, 2011, the Technical Services Director (probably of the APC) handed in a\u00a0\"technical opinion of February 9, 2011 on the Concession Agreement\".50 The document states\u00a0that \"if the acquisition of the equipment permitted Getma International to load and unload\u00a0the containers suitably in the port of Conakry during this financial year, on the other hand the\u00a0forecast of the work to be performed in [s/c] has sustained [s/c] a delay in the project.\" The\u00a0document concludes that \"it is necessary to terminate the Concession Agreement and to\u00a0entrust the paternity of the file to the [APC]\".51\n87. \u00a0\u00a0On February 8, 2011, the APC's Audit Committee convened for the purpose of examining the\u00a0Concession Agreement. It noted that \"one of the major weaknesses\" of the Concession\u00a0Agreement is that it \"purely and simply ignores the principal, if not cardinal, role of the APC\"\u00a0and \"decides to act,\" in particular, by putting together a technical file to \"review the\u00a0agreement and the renegotiation thereof, with emphasis on the central role of the APC\" or by\u00a0\"termination with the APC's instruction to find another partner\".52\n88. \u00a0\u00a0On February 11, 2011, the APC's Board of Directors convened in an extraordinary meeting, the\u00a0heading on the minutes of which reads \"Cancellation of the Container Terminal Concession\u00a0Agreement\".53. The document contains criticism of the legal, technical, financial and operating\u00a0aspects of the Concession Agreement and \"requests the pure and simple cancellation thereof\u00a0by the country's highest authorities\". On the same day, the chairman of the APC's Board of\u00a0Directors informed the minister of state of the Board's recommendation that the Concession\u00a0Agreement of September 22, 2008, be terminated.54\n89. \u00a0\u00a0On March 8, 2011, the President of the Republic of Guinea issued Decree D/2011071, in which\u00a0the Concession Agreement and Additional Clause no. 1 were \"cancelled due to the\n46 Mr. Sory Camara's affidavit of March 22, 2013 produced in the CCJR arbitration (R-31).\n47 Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Wiltzer's affidavit (C-185 and C-186).\n48 The defendant waived cross examination of the witness\n49 Letter of January 25, 2011, from the National Merchant Marine director (Transport Ministry) to Getma\u00a0International (C-18).\n50 Technical opinion of February 9, 2011 (C-175).\n51 Technical opinion of February 9, 2011 (C-175).\n52 Minutes of the meeting of the audit committee of February 2011 (C-195).\n53 Extraordinary meeting of the PAC's Board of Directors of February 11, 2011, (C-196), Minutes of the\u00a0extraordinary meeting of the PACs Board of Directors of February 11, 2011 (C-197).\n54 Letter of February 11, 2011, from the chairman of the PACs Board of Directors to th minister of state (C\u00a0198).\n\\%A 64200 BIAS'-: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/,;'/\n13\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 21 of 173\nConcessionary's failure to meet its obligations [...Jwith immediate effect and without indemnification, at the expense, risk and based on the fault of the companies [sic] Getma\u00a0International SAS,\" (referred to hereinafter as \"the Termination Decree\").55\n90. \u00a0\u00a0On March 9, 2011, the President of the Republic of Guinea issued Decree D/2011 074 \"for the\u00a0requisition of the personnel, facilities, real property and assets on the territory of the Republic\u00a0of Guinea of the Getma International SAS and Conakry Container Terminal companies\" for a\u00a0period of 60 days (referred to hereinafter as \"the requisition Decree\").56\n91. \u00a0\u00a0On March 9, 2011 also, Getma International and STCC had a bailiff's report drawn up in which\u00a0they declared that the police had \"turned up\" on March 8, 2011 in front of their offices and\u00a0had \"instructed them to vacate and lock the premises, prohibiting them from reopening\u00a0them\". The report confirms the Bailiff's ascertainment on the premises, \"of the effective\u00a0closing of the doors giving access to the Claimant's various offices\".57\n92. \u00a0\u00a0Again on March 9, 2011, Getma International sent to the Transport Ministry a letter containing\u00a0\"preliminary notice of change of law\" in which it stated that the termination constituted \"a\u00a0Change of Law and Acts of the Public Authorities, impeding the proper functioning of the\u00a0activities granted in the concession as per article 32.5, paragraph 1 of the Concession\u00a0Agreement\". The letter also stated that this notice initiated a 60 day period to remedy the\u00a0consequences thereof and requested, in the event that this period were not respected,\u00a0payment of the indemnities stipulated in Article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement, without\u00a0prejudice to full indemnification of the prejudice.58\n93. \u00a0\u00a0On March 10, 2011, the APC signed a technical assistance agreement with SDV Guinea, a joint\u00a0stock company under Guinean law, for a duration of 21 days, the purpose of which was the\u00a0management of the Conakry Container Terminal warehousing activities59. The Claimants\u00a0contend that no call for bids was issued prior to this agreement.\n94. \u00a0\u00a0On March 11, 2011, the APC signed a \"Concession Agreement for the Container Terminal, its\u00a0extension and the conventional building in the port of Conakry of a storage platform and a\u00a0drydock in Kagbelen\".60 The Claimants contend that no call for bids was issued prior to this\u00a0agreement. The Bollor\u00e9 company, Necotrans' competitor, had also submitted a bid for the\u00a0concession in 2008, which had been classified second.\n95. \u00a0\u00a0In March 2011, the INECOR company produced an audit of the Conakry Container Terminal\u00a0Concession Agreement, comparing the new agreement concluded with the Bollor\u00e9 company,\u00a0to that of 2008 concluded with the Claimants.61 Regarding the Bollor\u00e9 Agreement, the report\u00a0notes that \"in no African or European port, is total exclusivity granted to a given private\u00a0operator covering all port operations involving all types of freight [...] and covering the entire\n55 Termination Decree (C-19).\n56 Requisition Decree (C-21).\n57 Bailiff's report of March 8, 2011 (C-23).\n58 Letter of March 9, 2011, from Getma International to the Transport Minister (C-25).\n59 Technical assistance agreement (C-204).\n60 Concession Agreement between the PAC and the Bollor\u00e9 company (C-205).\n61 Audit by the INECOR Company of March 2011 (C-207).\n14\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 22 of 173\nscope of the port. It concludes that, \"due to its insufficient negotiation period, the Concession Agreement is excessively advantageous to the private Concessionary, to the detriment of\u00a0Guinea's interests\" and recommends several amendments.\n96. \u00a0\u00a0On March 22, 2011, Getma International notified to the Minister of State responsible for public\u00a0works and transports, by bailiff, a protest against the measures concerning termination and\u00a0the requisition, as well as a formal notice requesting that it minimized the effects of the\u00a0change of law and of the acts of the Public Authorities which impeded the smooth functioning\u00a0of the activities granted in the concession and a the indemnifications stipulated in the\u00a0Concession Agreement.62\n97. \u00a0\u00a0On April 26, 2011, any Additional Clause to the agreement mentioned in paragraph 94 was\u00a0signed between the APC and Conakry terminal company (which had replaced the Bollor\u00e9\u00a0company)63 \"in order to (...)

In each chapter, it shall first summarize the parties'\u00a0respective positions such as they were presented in their successive briefs and memorials,\u00a0namely the Claimants' brief, the Respondent's counter-memorial, the Claimants' rejoinder, as\u00a0well as the memorials submitted after the hearing. The Arbitral Tribunal specifies that the\u00a0discretionary portion of each of these chapters takes into consideration all of the arguments\u00a0put forth by the parties in their written and oral submissions, including those which are not\u00a0explicitly mentioned in the description of the parties' positions preceding the observations of\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal.\nIV. \u00a0\u00a0THE PARTIES' REQUESTS\nA. \u00a0\u00a0The Claimants\n104. \u00a0In their request for arbitration of September 29, 2011, the Claimants requested the following\u00a0of this Tribunal (reserving the right to modify its requests):\na) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that it declare that the state of Guinea violated its investment legislation and/or international\u00a0law, and in particular that it dispossessed the Claimants, in a discriminatory manner, of their\u00a0investment, without prompt, fair, adequate indemnification, in breach of articles 5, 6 and 7 of\u00a0the Investment Code and/or in breach of customary international law;\nb) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that it order Guinea to indemnify the Claimant, due to the violation of its investment legislation\u00a0and/or international law by an amount to be determined at the appropriate time in this\u00a0procedure, in a freely convertible currency accepted by the Claimants, plus interest, calculated\u00a0at a commercially reasonable rate for the currency at issue, accruing from the date of the\u00a0expropriation until the date of the full payment of the amount;\nc) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that it award any other compensation that the Tribunal considers appropriate, and\nd) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that it order the State of Guinea to pay all the costs of this arbitration procedure, including,\u00a0without limitation, the Tribunal's fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of the ICSID, the\u00a0fees and expenses of the Claimant's legal representation, and the costs and fees of any expert,\u00a0appointed by the Claimant, or by the Tribunal, plus the interest owed.\n105. \u00a0In its brief, the Claimant asked this Arbitral Tribunal:\nIn a principal capacity:\n\u2022 \u00a0that it state that, by issuing the termination and requisition Decrees, Guinea violated article\n5 of the Investment Code;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/\n\u2022 \u00a0that it state that, by issuing the termination and requisition Decrees, Guinea violated article\n6 (1) of the Investment Code;\n16\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 24 of 173\nOr, in a subsidiary capacity:\n\u2022 \u00a0that it state that, by issuing the termination and requisition Decree is, Guinea violated the\u00a0minimum standard of treatment which it was required to provide to the Claimants under\u00a0customary international law.\nAnd consequently:\n\u00bb that it order Guinea to pay to the Claimants the sum of \u20ac103,031,250, corresponding to the net value of the cash flow updated for the period of the concession of which the Claimants\u00a0were deprived due to their expropriation;\n\u2022 \u00a0that it order Guinea to pay to the Claimants the sum of \u20ac1,950,996 corresponding to the\u00a0prejudice resulting from the requisition;\n\u00bb that it order Guinea to pay to the Claimants the sum of \u20ac1,058,502 corresponding to the additional prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree; that it order the payment of\u00a0interest to the Claimants, calculated at the rate of 8.7%, capitalized annually, on the sums\u00a0indicated above, beginning on March 8, 2011 and up until the date of the payment thereof;\n\u2022 \u00a0that it order Guinea to pay to the Claimants.

These requests were not modified in the Respondent's subsequent memorials.\nV. JURISDICTION AND THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE REQUESTS\nA. The Respondent's position\n(1) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae due to the illegality of the investment and the acts of corruption\n110. The Respondent first recalls an uninterrupted line of arbitral precedents establishing that the\u00a0ICSID system can protect only legal investments carried out in good faith, and not those\u00a0obtained by fraud69. The decisions quoted to this effect are those of the Phoenix Action\u00a0versus/ Czech Republic70, Inceysa versus/ the Republic of Salvador71, Fraport versus/ Philippes72,\u00a0and Metal-Tech versus/ Uzbekistan cases.73\n111. Applying this principle, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal must declare its lack of\u00a0jurisdiction because (i) the Investment Code specifies that it applies only to investments made\u00a0in the respect of the laws and regulations of Guinea and (ii) passive corruption, active\u00a0corruption and influence peddling are prohibited under the Guinean Criminal Code.74\n112. The Respondent contends that sufficient proof and evidence exist to consider that the\u00a0Concession Agreement was obtained in breach of Guinean law. Thus, the agreement was\u00a0allegedly awarded to the Claimants illegally, by fraud committed on the level of the bid files\u00a0and by corruption, in breach of Guinean law on both the criminal (art. 191 to 195 for the\u00a0offense of corruption and art. 430 for the offense of swindling) and the civil (art. 649 and the\u00a0following of the Civil Code, for fraudulent tactics) levels.75 Under these conditions, the\u00a0Respondent claims that \"the Claimants' investment was carried out in breach of the laws of\u00a0the Republic of Guinea, and furthermore, more broadly, in breach of international public\u00a0policy,\"76 entailing the violation of article 2.1 of the Investment Code which states that\n69 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 215-229.\n70 Phoenix Action Ltd.

It can therefore not constitute an 'investment' protected under the Investment Code.78 The\u00a0According to the Respondent, the Tribunal should therefore declare that it lacks jurisdiction\u00a0ratione materiae or subsidiarily declare that the illegality of the investment resulting from the\u00a0alleged acts of corruption entailed the inadmissibility of the Claimants' requests (or the\u00a0rejection of the requests in an infinitely subsidiary capacity).79\n113. \u00a0Furthermore, in its Replication, the Respondent refutes the Claimants' argument that the\u00a0accusations of corruption are subject to a higher degree of proof. In response to the awards\u00a0quoted by the Claimants, it refers to Metal-Tech versus Uzbekistan80, Tokios Tokel\u00e8s versus\u00a0Ukraine82, Libananco Holdings versus Turkey82, and Rompetrol versus/Romania83, in order to\u00a0prove that no unanimous position exists which requires a stricter standard of proof and above\u00a0all to establish that several courts have applied the ordinary standard of proof and admitted\u00a0the evidence of corruption broadly.84 The Respondent also bases its argument on several\u00a0doctrinal comments and decisions to conclude that corruption can be proven by indirect\u00a0evidence or clues, inasmuch as corruption is characterized by secrecy and the scarcity of\u00a0evidence and that it is often difficult to establish.85\n114. \u00a0The Respondent also contends that it is invoking both indirect and direct evidence in support\u00a0of its allegations of corruption. As direct evidence, it has produced three affidavits by\u00a0witnesses:86\n- \u00a0The affidavit of Stephen Fox of the Veracity company concerning (i) US$1,000,000 paid to\u00a0the Transport Minister at the time, who signed the Concession Agreement, (ii) US$200,000\u00a0paid to the finance minister at the time, who signed the Concession Agreement, (iii)\u00a0US$100,000 paid to (each of) various members of the national evaluation committee,\u00a0namely Mr. Ansoumane Camara, Mr. Demba Kourouma, Mr. Ibrahima Lamizana Conde, Mr.\u00a0Saifoulaye Barry, Mr. Mohamed Fofana and Mr. Mamadou Diallo. In response to the\u00a0Claimants' criticism, the Respondent contends that, even if Mr. Fox did not witness the\u00a0event directly, he has been a professional in the anticorruption campaign in Guinea since\u00a02005 and that his inquiry was based on his privileged access to sources of information -which were confidential indeed - but reliable, direct and not based on personal interests.\u00a0The Respondent states also that the minor inaccuracies underlined by the Claimants (such\u00a0as the amounts effectively distributed at the end of the chain and an error regarding a\u00a0name) are irrelevant or explainable.87\n- \u00a0the affidavit of Mr. Demba Kourouma concerning the sum of \u20ac35,000 received following\u00a0the signature of the Concession Agreement by Mr. Mamadou Diallo, an officer at the\n77 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 217-220, 226.\n78 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 240-241\n79 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 245-254; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 225-240.\n80 Metal-Tech Ltd Versus/the Republic of Uzbekistan, ICSID ARB/10/3, Award, Oct. 4,2013 (R-54).\n81 Tokios Tokeles versus/Ukraine, ICSID ARB/02/18, Award, July 26, 2007 (R-109).\n82 Libananco Holdings Co. versus the Republic of Turkey, ICSID ARB/06/8, Award, Sept. 2, 2011 (R-lll).\n83 The Rompetrol Group N.V. versus/Romania, ICSID ARB\u00a706/3, Award, May 6, 2013 (R-112).\n84 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 56-67.\n85 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 68-81 referring in particular to the Case of the Straits of Corfu (merits), CCJA, decision of April 9,\u00a01949 R-117); Rumeli Telekom A.S. versus/the Republic of Kazakhstan, ICSID ARB/05/16, Award, July 29,2008 (C-270).\n86 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 83-97\n87 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 85-94.\n20\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 28 of 173\nTransport Ministry and member of the Evaluation Commission, on behalf of Getma International.\nthe affidavit of Mr. Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9 concerning the sum of \u20ac20,000 received during the negotiations of the Concession Agreement from Mr. Mamadou Diallo on behalf\u00a0of Getma International.\n115. \u00a0Regarding the last two affidavits, which the Respondent was not authorized to produce in the\u00a0CCJA arbitration, the Respondent considers (i) that the differences between the amounts\u00a0quoted in these affidavits and those mentioned by Mr. Fox can be explained by an\u00a0intermediate use in the chain of corruption as seen above, (ii) that the link between Mr. Diallo,\u00a0who handed over the funds, and Getma International is established, because he was in direct\u00a0contact with two representatives of Getma International, and (\u00a1ii) that the absence of\u00a0sanctions against these civil servants does not contradict the veracity of the facts contained in\u00a0their affidavits.88\n116. \u00a0Regarding the indirect evidence, the Respondent bases its argument on a \"body of evidence\"\u00a0to confirm the existence of corruption, namely:\na. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the \"endemic\" nature of corruption in Guinea89,\nb. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the \"guilty\" passivity of the members of the commission who did not, according to the\u00a0Respondent, note the weaknesses of the Claimants' bid, namely:\n- the Claimants' lies regarding their true experience in the design, financing and operation of Container Terminals, because they appropriated as references the projects of the MSC\u00a0group, the second-largest ship owner in the world, with which the Claimants claim to have\u00a0concluded a partnership.90 In its Replication, the Respondent contends that the technical\u00a0partnership agreement of March 6, 2008, presented by the Claimants as proof of the close\u00a0commercial ties they entertained with MSC had been concluded solely for the purpose of\u00a0responding to the call for bids and ended with the signing of the Concession Agreement.91-The Respondent also emphasizes that Getma International was the only company to\u00a0respond to the call for expression of interest, to the exclusion of its \"joint and several\u00a0partner\" (which implied, according to the regulations of the call for bids, that it could not\u00a0submit a joint bid with its partner, either) and notes that Mr. Qu\u00e9rel provided contradictory\u00a0explanations in the absence of a joint bid.92. The Respondent contends moreover that MSC\u00a0did not play the slightest role in the execution of the Concession Agreement, contrary to\u00a0the joint execution which Getma International's bid presented as a (technical and financial)\u00a0asset93. The Respondent concludes on this point that the cooperation between the\u00a0N\u00e9cotrans group and MSC was false, pointing out (i) that the precise analysis of the alleged\u00a0technical partnership contract reveals that in fact it had been concluded only to support the\u00a0Claimants' bid and that it contained no commitment on MSC's part for the execution, given\u00a0that the agreement covered only the period of the call for bids and expired at the end\u00a0thereof, (ii) the total absence of MSC's intervention in the execution of the concession, as\u00a0MSC and N\u00e9cotrans in fact entertained only limited commercial relations in 2005 and 2006,\n88 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 94-104.\n89 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 107-123: Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 107-108\n90 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 107-123\n91 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 109-112.\n92 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 113-120.\n\"Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 121-131.\n21\nCase 1.-19-CV-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 29 of 173\nI I\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n  \nand (iii) the simple share in Getma International's capital which did not make MSC a partner for the execution of the Concession Agreement, a share which ended up being sold by\u00a0MSC.94\u00a0the absence of a certificate of financial capacity which was a condition of the admissibility\u00a0of the bid and, in any event, an essential criterion for evaluating the file; instead, the\u00a0Claimants presented documents describing their good relations with their banks, but not\u00a0their real financial or borrowing capacities.95\nfalse financial information in their business plan, over-estimating the project's profitability and the fees it could pay to Guinea.96\nc. Getma International's failure to make the investments stipulated in the Concession\u00a0Agreement, which would confirm that the Claimants did not have the financial capacities to\u00a0perform the contract and that only corruption can explain the fact that they were the\u00a0successful bidders.97\n117. This issue of the Claimants' failure to perform the contract (due in particular to their lack of\u00a0auto-financing capacity) is presented in conjunction with several points:\n- \u00a0The execution deadlines, even taking into account the postponement under Additional\u00a0Clause no. 1, had not been respected on the date of the Termination Decree.98 Thus, phase\u00a02 of the project concerning the new CT represented 97% of the total amount of the\u00a0investments and was the object of no progress on the part of the Claimants.99 And yet, the\u00a0investments were to be made during the first two years of the concession.100 In its\u00a0Replication, the Respondent responds to the Claimants' argument that the work could not\u00a0begin until the warehousing platform was available (which occurred on March 23, 2010); it\u00a0states (i) that Additional Clause no. 1 contained the new status of the calculation of the\u00a0time frames without the availability of the platform having any influence, and (ii) that the\u00a0availability of the platform was in any event not necessary for the Claimants to begin their\u00a0work, primarily for the construction of the new CT.101\n- On January 14, 2011, during a meeting with representatives of the Transport Ministry and the\u00a0APC, Getma International was unable to say whether it was able to finance the work.102.\n- The Respondent considers that the Claimants concealed their financial incapacity to meet the\u00a0necessary investments, for example, during the negotiations of Additional Clause no. 1 and\u00a0during the period preceding the termination of the Concession Agreement, and even lied to\u00a0Guinea, by stating on several occasions that they had the necessary financing although that\u00a0was not the case.103 . This incapacity was obvious however. In particular, the total investment\u00a0program represented \u20ac92.7 million; the Claimants had executed \u20ac15 million and \u20ac77.7 million\n94 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 132-158.\n95 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 124-138.\n96 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 139-144.\n97 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 145-214; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 159-160.\n98 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 152-158.\n99 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 149-151.\n100 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 152; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 161-166.\n101 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 167-180.\n102 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 159-164.

In response to the\u00a0affidavit filed by Mr. Gr\u00e9gory Qu\u00e9rel for the Claimants, the Respondent also emphasizes the\u00a0following: (i) no dedicated funding existed despite the six requests made by the Claimants,\u00a0because the Claimants, over-indebted, could provide no guarantee to the banks (Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0184 189); (ii) the loan agreement advanced by the Claimants was aimed solely at\u00a0refinancing the debt of the N\u00e9cotrans group and could not be used to finance the Conakry\u00a0investments as stipulated in the contract (Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 190-195); (iii) the cash balance and short\u00a0term lines of credit, in addition to the fact that it is very unusual to use this type of\u00a0financing for long-term investments, were in fact negative at the end of 2010, and all future\u00a0cash flow was purely hypothetical (Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 196-200); (iv); similarly, and lastly, a\u00a0participation in the financing of the concession by shareholders or third party partners,\u00a0such as MSC or Maersk, was entirely speculative, given that MSC never participated in the\u00a0investments and that Maersk's participation was hypothetical (Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 201-204);\n118. The Respondent contends that Getma International's investment is vitiated not only by\u00a0corruption, but also by fraud due to the all statements made by Getma International regarding\u00a0the essential elements of its bid, either by providing misleading information regarding its\u00a0technical and financial capacity, by invoking an alleged partnership with the MSC group, and by\u00a0producing a fictive affidavit of financial capacity.105 According to the Respondent, Getma\u00a0International's lie concerning its partnership with MSC permitted it first of all to get through\u00a0the preselection stage without having the required experience, as Mr. Qu\u00e9rel acknowledged\u00a0for that matter during his examination.106 The deceit regarding the purported partnership\u00a0continued until the moment of the bid, which contained MSC's references and the financial\u00a0statements of Europe Terminal, which implied that Getma was acting in a partnership with\u00a0MSC, while subsequently the nonexistence of this partnership was in fact apparent in MSC's\u00a0failure to intervene in the execution of the Concession Agreement.107 The consequence of the\u00a0fraudulent obtaining of the concession was Getma International's failure to finance the\u00a0investments which it had undertaken to finance under the contract.108 These fraudulent tactics\u00a0are contrary to the Guinean laws governing fraud, the general principles governing public\u00a0contracts and the obligation to invest in the respect of Guinean laws.109\n119. \u00a0In a subsidiary capacity, the Respondent is requesting that, if the Arbitral Tribunal were to\u00a0declare that it entertained jurisdiction, it rule that the requests are inadmissible due to the\u00a0illegality of the investment.110\n120. \u00a0Lastly, in an infinitely subsidiary capacity, the Respondent asks that the Arbitral Tribunal reject\u00a0the Claimants' request, because resorting to illicit acts in order to obtain the agreement\u00a0warrants the early termination thereof, without indemnification, as the Tribunal did in the\u00a0Azinian versus Mexico case, in which the investors were denied indemnification for the\n104 C-Mem.\u00a7\u00a7 171-213; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 161,165.\n105 Mem.

The Respondent contends that the Arbitral Tribunal made a clear distinction between the\u00a0effects of the termination of the agreement, and the effects of the requisition of the worksite\u00a0equipment. The Tribunal declared that it entertained jurisdiction only regarding the effects of\u00a0the requisition of the worksite equipment, and the other violations of the Code, to the\u00a0exclusion of the effects of the termination of the Concession Agreement. It adds that the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal alone entertained jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the termination of the\u00a0agreement.113\n123. Consequently, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to\u00a0indemnify the Claimants for:\n- \u00a0Prejudice for loss of profit, which is the result solely of the termination of the Concession\u00a0Agreement, because it corresponds to the profit which one party would have made had the\u00a0contract been performed to term, established at the amount of 103,031,250 euros by the\u00a0Claimants.114\n- \u00a0The additional prejudice resulting from the termination of the agreement, as acknowledged\u00a0on several occasions by the Claimants, for an amount estimated at \u20ac1,058,202, concerning\u00a0the costs of repatriating the requisition equipment, the crisis management costs and the\u00a0wages of two persons for a given period of time.115\n124 In its Replication, the Respondent contends that the distinction between the contractual and extra-contractual effects of termination, such as argued by the Claimants, is pure fiction and\u00a0was never made by the Tribunal in the decision regarding jurisdiction. It also considers that\u00a0such a distinction has no meaning in this case because the alleged violations of the Investment\u00a0Code resulting from termination were contractualized under article 32.5 of the Concession\u00a0Agreement.116\n125. It also contends that the loss of profit is a damaging consequence of termination for which\u00a0indemnification is explicitly stipulated under article 32.5 which refers to the indemnity of\u00a0article 32.3, including that for loss of activity, which therefore falls into the framework of the\u00a0agreement, and not into the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Respondent adds finally that \"the\n111 Dupl. \u00a7 2324-240 and in particular Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen BACA versus the United States\u00a0of Mexico, ICSID ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, Nov. 1st, 1999 (R-133).\n112 Dupl. \u00a7 51 ; Mem.AAR \u00a7\u00a7 19 and the following\n113 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 258-262.\n114 C-Mem.\u00a7\u00a7 263-273.\n115 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 274-290\n116 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 3-9, 37-41.\n24\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 32 of 173\nissue of determining whether the Claimants could request indemnification for loss of profit for an amount exceeding that of the all-inclusive indemnity for termination is an issue pertaining\u00a0to the application of article 32.5, which falls into the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction of the\u00a0CCJA Tribunal as emphasized by the Tribunal\".117\n(3) Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement constitutes a contrary agreement, such as\u00a0acknowledged in a decision on jurisdiction, and the Claimants' position regarding its nonapplicability comes up against the principal of estoppel\n126. \u00a0According to the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal has already acknowledged in its decision\u00a0regarding jurisdiction that Article. 32.5 of the Concession Agreement constitutes an agreement\u00a0which is contrary (as per article 28.2 of the Investment Code) to the jurisdiction of an ICSID\u00a0Tribunal (in favor of CCJA Arbitral Tribunal) and that this provision concerns the consequences\u00a0of termination, as caused by an act of the Public Authorities (such as defined under the\u00a0agreement)118. In its Replication, the Respondent refutes the Claimants' allegations regarding\u00a0the alleged non-applicability of such a contrary agreement in the case at issue, and specifies\u00a0that the Tribunal necessarily applied the contrary agreement contained in the Concession\u00a0Agreement when it declared that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the effects of termination119.\u00a0Consequently, the Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on a substantial portion of\u00a0the requests presented again at this stage by the Claimants.\n127. \u00a0Furthermore, from the very outset of the litigation, the Claimants always contended that the\u00a0termination of the agreement was based on article 32.5 and that it carried entitlement for the\u00a0Concessionary to the indemnities stipulated in article 32.3120. Furthermore, Getma\u00a0International sent the two notices referred to in article 32.5 to the Grantor to avail itself of the\u00a0termination procedure stipulated in this article. The Claimants based their argument\u00a0exclusively on this same provision in the CCJA arbitration, asserting that the indemnifications\u00a0referred to in article 32.3 were due independently of the issue of determining whether\u00a0termination had occurred due to the Grantor.121 Also their requests were always based on\u00a0article 32.5, in both the CCJA arbitration122, and in this arbitration123, and it was only in their\u00a0first brief of November 17, 2014 that the Claimants, based on a non-decisive rationale for the\u00a0decision on Jurisdiction, proffered for the first time the argument that the litigation cannot fall\u00a0within the scope of Article 32.5, which the Respondent considers as a \"flagrant case of\u00a0estoppel\" characterized by poor faith.124\n128. Thus, the Respondent contends that the principal of estoppel prevents the Claimants from\u00a0contending at this stage that article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement would not apply. Once\u00a0the acceptance in international law, and in ICSID case law of the principal of estoppel has been\u00a0recalled, the Respondent contends that the conditions for estoppel have been met: (i) : the\u00a0Claimants defend a thesis, which is in contradiction with the position they defended before the\u00a0CCJA Tribunal and (ii) the theses are aimed at procuring a benefit for the Claimants to the\n117 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 42-52.\n118 C-Mem.\u00a7\u00a7293-300; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 25-26.\n  \n119 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 10-19, 21.\n120 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 299-316; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 22, 24.\n121 C-Mem, \u00a7\u00a7 306-316; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 22-23; Mem.AAR \u00a7\u00a7 45-52.\n122 Mem.AAR \u00a7\u00a7 53-54 and \u00a7\u00a7 56-62.\n123 Mem.AAR\u00a755.\n124 Mem.

The Respondent specifies also that, inasmuch as the Claimants never contended before the\u00a0CCJA that article 32.5 could be implemented only in the case of termination, at the\u00a0Concessionary's initiative (and not by of the Grantor) and that they succeeded regarding this\u00a0point, during the CCJA arbitration, and received an indemnification based on this article, the\u00a0parties agree on the fact that article 32.5 applies to a termination of the Concession\u00a0Agreement, even if it is caused by the Grantor. This also leads to granting exclusive jurisdiction\u00a0to these CCJA Tribunal to rule on the effects of such termination.126\n(4) Waiver and res judicata\n130. \u00a0The Respondent considers that the requests concerning (i) loss of profit, (ii) the prejudice\u00a0caused by the requisition and (iii) the additional prejudice resulting from the Termination\u00a0Decree, are inadmissible because they have already been brought before the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0which ruled on them in its award of April 29, 2014.127\n131. \u00a0The request concerning the prejudice \"resulting [from] the loss of the future income of the\u00a0concession\" was granted by the CCJA Tribunal for the amount of \u20ac20,884,966. According to the\u00a0Respondent, this indemnification is \"designed to compensate for the loss of activity\" such as\u00a0referred to in article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement, \"in other words, the loss of profit, and\u00a0covers the entire amount of the indemnification owed in the event of expropriation, as the\u00a0parties limited the amount thereof under the contract\".128\n132. The Respondent also specifies the following:\no the request concerning the \"cost of repairing the requisitioned operational equipment\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term \"cost of repair\". Whereas, Getma did not\u00a0produce proof of the causal link between the damage ascertained and the requisition, the\u00a0CCJA Tribunal rejected this request.\no The request concerning the \"prejudice corresponding to stocks not restituted\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term \"stocks\". The CCJA Tribunal acceded to this\u00a0request.\no The request concerning the \"prejudice pertaining to the land services performed prior to the requisition, but not invoiced\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term \"indemnity\u00a0for invoices not yet issued.\" The Tribunal rejected this request on the grounds that the\u00a0prejudice was not established.\no The request concerning the \"costs of repatriating the requisitioned operational equipment\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term \"repatriation costs\". Whereas these\u00a0costs are the consequence of termination and not of the requisition, and whereas they were\u00a0therefore included in the indemnification of article 32.3 already granted to Getma, the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal rejected this request.\n\u00ab The request concerning \"crisis management costs\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term \"indemnification for expenditures linked to crisis management\" Whereas\n125 C-Mem.\u00a7\u00a7 321-332\n126 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 317; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 27-35.\n127 C-Mem.\u00a7\u00a7 379-384.\n128 C-Mem. \u00a7 380.\n26\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 34 of 173\nthese costs were inducted in the indemnification of article 32.3 already granted to Getma, the CCJA Tribunal rejected this request.\n\u00bb The request concerning the \"wages of two employees during the period of inactivity which followed the Termination Decree\" was submitted to the CCJA Tribunal under the term\u00a0\"indemnification corresponding to repatriated personnel\". The Tribunal rejected this request\u00a0on the grounds that the prejudice was too indirect to warrant indemnification.129\n133. \u00a0Consequently, the principal of res judicata would warrant, according to the Respondent, this\u00a0Tribunal's rejection of the complaints concerning the loss of profit, as well as the additional\u00a0prejudice resulting from both termination and requisition.\n134. \u00a0The Respondent recalls the debate concerning the legal conditions of the principle of res\u00a0judicata in arbitration (identity of parties, identity of the litigation, identity of the purpose of\u00a0the requests, identity of cause, identity of the damaging events) and asserts that they have all\u00a0been met in the case at issue.130\n135. \u00a0As regards the identity of the parties, it emphasizes that Getma International was party to the\u00a0two arbitrations, so that even if, inasmuch as the other Claimants were not formally party to\u00a0the CCJA arbitration, \"the very close ties they entertained with Getma International permit one\u00a0to ascertain without difficulty the parties' identity also as far as they are concerned.\"131\n136. Concerning identity of purpose, Guinea considers that the Claimants are presenting \"to two\u00a0Tribunals requests concerning the same events and the same damages, modifying only the\u00a0label\". It adds that \"all of these requests, presented to the CCJA Tribunal, then to the ICSID\u00a0Tribunal, are based on the same events: termination and requisition\" and that \"only the formal\u00a0counts of prejudice (contractual indemnification/indemnification for expropriation) were\u00a0modified\". 132 In support of a comparative chart, the Respondent asserts that both the\u00a0amounts claimed and the counts of prejudice are strictly identical before the two Arbitral\u00a0Tribunals.133\n137. \u00a0In its Replication on the issue of loss of profit, in particular, the Respondent contends that the\u00a0artificial withdrawal of this argument before the CCJA Tribunal had no impact; it indeed uses\u00a0article 32.3 to grant it damages, as said article grants damages precisely for the prejudice of\u00a0loss of profit.134 Regarding the prejudice linked to the requisition (presented by the Claimants\u00a0as unrelated to termination and the CCJA procedure), the Respondent emphasizes that even\u00a0before the CCJA Tribunal, the Claimants submitted requests for indemnification divided into\u00a0several counts of prejudice the generating the event of which was not termination, but rather\u00a0requisition (repair, redemption of stocks, repayment of invoices not yet issued).135Therefore,\u00a0according to it, identity of purpose indeed exists.\n138. \u00a0Concerning the identity of the damaging events, it explains that the requests presented are in\u00a0any event chargeable to the same damaging events, namely termination and requisition.136\n129 C-Mem. \u00a7 383.\n130 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 390-394.\n131 C-Mem. \u00a7 396.\n132 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7418-420.\n133 C-Mem. \u00a7 422.\n134 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 312-319.\n135 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7320-325\n136 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 423-435.\n27\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 35 of 173\nI\n139. The criterion of identity of cause calls for further developments on the Respondent's part. It\u00a0contends that identity of cause is not necessary for res judicata, as long as there is identity of\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0purpose and identity of parties and quotes several arbitral awards to this effect.137\nFurthermore, in support of numerous doctrinal comments and international awards, it considers that, if one party modifies the basis or \"instrumentum\" of a given action artificially,\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or requalifies its requests, the principle of res judicata must apply to avoid that the same case\nbe tried twice.138\n140. In the case at issue, the Respondent contends that the Claimants simply and artificially\u00a0modified the cause of their action (contractual basis before the CCJA Tribunal, legal basis with\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the Investment Code before this Tribunal) in order to have the same events retried and obtain\ndamages for the same prejudice139: (i) for a certain period of time at least, the Claimants had presented all of their requests (including those concerning expropriation) before the CCJA\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tribunal, then withdrew them after having begun the ICSID procedure, (ii) and they then\nbrought the same requests before this Tribunal (on the effects of termination and the requisition) by simply changing the legal basis (Investment Code and no longer the Concession\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreement). This leads the Respondent to conclude that the Claimants waived certain\nrequests when they were withdrawn from the CCJA action. More specifically, it concluded that, if the Claimants considered that the all-inclusive indemnification of Article 32.3 of the\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreement covered only a portion of the prejudice, it was indeed in the CCJA arbitration\nproceedings that the request for full damages should have been made on the basis of the Agreement. By failing to do so, the Claimants waived the right to do so.\n141. The Respondent reiterates on several occasions that the distinction between treaty\u00a0claims/contract claims repeated by the Claimants is not relevant here because it does not\u00a0permit damages for the same prejudice twice and does not prevent the application of the\u00a0principle of res judicata, and this even if the first award is the subject matter of action for\u00a0annulment140. The artificial changing of the basis for the requests before the CCJA Tribunal,\u00a0precisely to be able to argue artificially that the ICSID entertains jurisdiction, changes nothing\u00a0regarding the fact that the underlying counts of prejudice have already been indemnified.141. It\u00a0alleges that, when \"two Tribunals have been called upon to examine the same damaging event\u00a0and when indemnification has already been awarded by the first Tribunal, the principal of res\u00a0judicata prohibits a request for a second indemnification for the same deeds, regardless of the\u00a0legal basis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction\".142 Thus, the Tribunal must give emphasis to the\u00a0merits rather than the form.143\nIn concluding the Concession Agreement, the parties knowingly contractualized treaty claims -via Article 32.5 -when termination is consecutive to expropriation...\n137 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 438-443.\n138 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 444-457\n139 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 458-487 ; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 337-347.\n140 Dupl; \u00a7\u00a7 329 (by reference to the Rachel S.

In the end, the mechanism of article 32.5 of the\u00a0Agreement functions, so to speak, as a reversed umbrella clause.1\u2018,',\n142. Lastly, the Respondent adds that, as long as the procedure for the annulment of the CCJA\u00a0award which it initiated is pending, the CCJA award retains authority of res judicata and it is\u00a0therefore not contradictory to request the application of the principle of res judicata to the\u00a0case at issue.1''5\n(5) The alleged denial of justice following the annulment of the award\n143. The Respondent did not have the opportunity to react to the arguments derived by the\u00a0Claimants in their Post-Hearing Memorial from the annulment of the CCJA award (see chapter\u00a0V.B (5) below). However, it broached the topic following the letter of December 21, 2015 in\u00a0which the Claimants called into question the independence and impartiality of the CCJA whose\u00a0annulment decision they qualify as \"an unequivocal reminder that this [ICSID] Tribunal\u00a0constitutes the last bastion separating the Claimants from denial of justice\". The Respondent\u00a0highlights the fact that the Claimants did not raise the topic of the decision, at the hearing in\u00a0this arbitration of November 23-25, 2015 and defends the procedure and the CCJA decision. It\u00a0denies any denial of justice, given that Getma International retains the possibility of filing a\u00a0new procedure under the aegis of the CCJA.146\nB \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Claimants' position\n(1) The Tribunal entertains jurisdiction ratione materiae because the investment is legal\n144. The Claimants consider that the Concession Agreement was obtained in a due manner, as the\u00a0alleged fraud does not exist and has not been proven by the Respondent, who bears the\u00a0burden of proof.147 Given that there was neither corruption nor fraud in the obtaining or\u00a0maintaining of the Claimants' investment, this investment is legal (contrary to the investment\u00a0in the Inceysa case) and the requests are admissible. They consider that these proceedings\u00a0were already settled during the phase concerning jurisdiction and that the decision of\u00a0December 29, 2012 in which this Tribunal declared its jurisdiction implies that this procedure is\u00a0henceforth at the \"merits\" stage, as the Respondent had ample opportunity during the\u00a0preceding jurisdiction phase to plead this Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.148 They specify\u00a0moreover that the allegations of corruption were analyzed and rejected by the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal.149\n145. \u00a0Concerning more specifically the allegations of corruption, the Claimants contend, in the first\u00a0place, that the burden of proof of corruption is borne by the party invoking it, and that\u00a0allegations of corruption require a particularly high level of proof.150 Thus, the Respondent\u00a0cannot merely present a body of evidence to prove corruption. The Claimants base their\n144 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 334-335.\n145 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 302-305.\n146 Mem.AAR \u00a7\u00a783-93\n147 Repl.\u00a7\u00a7 8-308.\n148 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 309-329\n149 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 36-38, 91-99 and 326.\n150 Repl.\u00a7\u00a7 18-55\n29\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 37 of 173\nargument in this respect on the Siag and Vecchi versus Egypt151, Saba Fakes versus Turkey152, Fraport versus the Philippines153, Africa Holding versus DRC154, TSA versus Argentina155, SPP\u00a0versus Egypt156, EDF versus Romania157, International Thunderbird Gaming versus Mexico158,\u00a0Wena Hotels versus Egypt159 cases to maintain that any allegation of corruption, given its\u00a0seriousness, requires a high standard of proof.160 And yet, the Respondent has not produced\u00a0the slightest concrete, objective evidence. The Claimants add that \"Guinea not only did not\u00a0take any measures against the persons whose passive corruption it is alleging, but it also\u00a0promoted (as we shall see further down) some of the most important players, according to its\u00a0statements, in the alleged implementation of the corruption\".161\n146. The Claimants then review the three affidavits presented by the Respondent (those of Messrs.\u00a0Steven Fox, Demba Kourouma and Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9) to contest the value thereof as\u00a0evidence.162 . They consider first of all that the information presented by Mr. Fox is indirect\u00a0and is based on no verifiable document or testimony.163 They also question Mr. Fox's\u00a0credibility, referring to his testimony in the CCJA case and certain affirmations he made which\u00a0they consider to be false, for example those regarding the sums paid to the Guinean civil\u00a0servants which are allegedly in contradiction with the sums mentioned in the testimony of\u00a0Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9.164\n147. The Claimants then deem that the affidavits of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9 in which they\u00a0\"incriminate themselves,\" are not accompanied by evidence, were drafted following the\u00a0lapsing of the period of limitation, and that they were made by persons who have never been\u00a0the subject matter of sanctions in Guinea (Mr. Kourouma was even promoted on a later date).\u00a0These persons supposedly received funds from Mr. Mamadou Diallo, who never worked for\u00a0one of the Claimants; they therefore cast doubt on the fact that these persons effectively\u00a0committed acts of passive corruption. The Claimants also emphasize that the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0decided, in December 2013 and in January 2014, not to extend the debates to permit Guinea\u00a0to present new evidence of corruption and, in its award, that the proposed affidavits, like Mr.\u00a0Steven Fox's affidavit, did not permit one \"to attribute the slightest relevance to the\u00a0particularly serious grievance of corruption\".16 \u2019\n151 Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorida Vecchi versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/05/15, Award,\u00a0June 1st, 2009 (C-321).\n152 Saba Fakes versus the Republic of Turkey, ICSID ARB/07/20, Award, July 14, 2010 (C-322).\n153 Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide versus the Republic of the Philippines, ICSID ARB/11/12,\u00a0Award, December 10,2014 (C-323).\n154 African Holding Company of America, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Construction au Congo SARL versus the\u00a0Democratic Republic of Congo, ICSID ARB/05/21, Award, July 29, 2008 (C-324).\n155 TSA Spectrum de Argentina SA versus the Republic of Argentina, ICSID ARB/05/5, Award, Oct. 19, 2008 (C-325).\n156 Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/84/3, Award,\u00a0May 20,1992 (C-326).\n157 EDF (Services) Limited versus Romania, ICSID ARB/05/13, Award, Oct. 8, 2008 (C-327).\n158 International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation versus United States of Mexico, UNCITRAL, Award, Jan. 26,\u00a02006 (C-328 and C-329).\n159 Wena Hotels Limited versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/98/4, Award, Dec. 8, 2000 (C-253).\n160 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 18-55\n161 Repl. \u00a7\u00a751,72,88\n162 Repl.\u00a7\u00a7 57-90.\n163 Repl. \u00a7 60\n164 Repl.\u00a7\u00a761-74.\n165 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 75-90.\n30\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 38 of 173\n148. The Claimants then contend that the \"signs\" of corruption, such as presented by the\u00a0Respondent, have no value as evidence?66\n149. \u00a0The first sign is the generalized nature of corruption in Guinea, which, according to the\u00a0Claimants proves nothing in the case at issue. Furthermore, the political crisis of 2008 2010\u00a0mentioned by the Respondent did not truly begin until December 2008, with the death of\u00a0President Lansana Cont\u00e9, several months after the awarding of the Concession in August\u00a02008.167\n150. \u00a0In the second place, the Claimant analyzed the allegations that the Commission in charge of\u00a0selecting the Concessionary detected serious flaws and irregularities in Getma International,\u00a0but \"nonetheless allegedly deliberately overlooked them because of a bribe from the\u00a0Claimants\", thereby proving that only corruption could explain the choice of Getma\u00a0International as Concessionary?68\n151. Regarding the partnership between MSC and the Necotrans group169\n- \u00a0MSC and Necotrans entertained close partnership ties under a Technical Partnership\u00a0Agreement which represented what was almost an equal share in Getma International's\u00a0capital. From 2006 to 2010, NCT Necotrans owned only 50.02% of the capital of Getma\u00a0International; a company in the MSC group owned the remaining 49.98%.\n- \u00a0Pursuant to its real partnership with MSC and after ascertaining that only Getma\u00a0International had been allowed to submit a bid, the response to the call for bids was\u00a0officially filed by MSC alone, although it was a joint bid.\n- \u00a0Relinquishment of the idea of presenting a bid for the Concession as a joint and several\u00a0group changed nothing in terms of the partnership, which always existed and was not at all\u00a0limited to the technical partnership agreement. The only reason for which the\u00a0Memorandum of Understanding which is the basis of this general partnership, could not be\u00a0produced in this arbitration is the fact that MSC was opposed thereto, although MSC's\u00a0letters of March 5, 2008 and April 10, 2013 confirmed the existence thereof170.\n152. \u00a0Regarding the use of MSC's references:\n- \u00a0The Claimants contend that the response to the invitation for bids was of a quality on a par\u00a0with projects they had already carried out in other countries, and that the projects MSC had\u00a0carried out were clearly identified. Furthermore, the Evaluation Commission understood\u00a0well that certain references included in the bid belonged to other groups.171 One of Getma\u00a0International's witnesses, Mr. Sory Camara, confirmed before the CCJA Tribunal that the\n166 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 125-294.\n167 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 129-132.\n168 Repl. \u00a7134\n169 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 381-384, Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 152-181\n170 Mem.

The Claimants contend also that the execution of the Agreement was unfolding normally on\u00a0the date of termination: the construction work on the existing Container Terminal was almost\u00a0complete, as was the work on the rail connection, and the studies for the extension of the\u00a0Container Terminal were completed.177\n156. \u00a0After having refuted the allegations of corruption, the Claimants re-assert that the reasons for\u00a0which their proposal had been selected by the Commission was simply that it was the best\n- \u00a0Even before the National Commission entered into the game, the APC itself had preselected the Necotrans group and had allowed it to submit an adjudication file.179\n- \u00a0Experience and references from prior projects, as well as the financial capacity (presented\u00a0by the Respondent as the two major weaknesses of the Claimants' file) were only two\u00a0criteria, among others. In any event, the Claimants consider that they indeed satisfied these\u00a0two criteria224.\n- \u00a0Among the major criteria, the Claimants refer to the financial conditions (entry ticket and\u00a0fees) which were more advantageous for Guinea, than the terms of the Bollor\u00e9 group's\u00a0proposal.181\n157. \u00a0Lastly, the Claimants assert that Guinea's only witness in the CCJA procedure confirmed during\u00a0his deposition, \"not only... that the Concession Agreement had been terminated for the sole\u00a0purpose of granting it to Bollor\u00e9, without respecting the contractual procedure and notice\u00a0period, but also acknowledged that the Invitation for bids, following which Getma\u00a0International had been declared as the successful bidder was properly conducted.\"182\n(2) The Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the effects of termination, the loss of profit\u00a0and the additional prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree.\n158. The Claimants consider that termination amounts to expropriation under international law,\u00a0and that consequently, the Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on its entire prejudice\u00a0pursuant to the Code. They consider that the CCJA Tribunal granted indemnification only for\n175 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 399-411; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 226-254.\n176 Mem.

The Claimants contend the following:\nThere were two acts on the part of the Public Authorities (requisition and termination, even if the latter act is disguised as the simple termination of the contract for breach thereof),\u00a0which constitute a double violation of the Investment Code and of Customary International\u00a0Law. '84\n- \u00a0Like the requisition act, the termination act also \"entailed damaging consequences other\u00a0than (those of) the termination of the Agreement.185\n- \u00a0The contractual consequences of termination have already been appreciated by the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal. This Tribunal must therefore appreciate (regarding the termination act) the\u00a0\"other\" \"damaging consequences\" of Guinea's violations of the Investment Code and of\u00a0Customary International Law186.\n- \u00a0The loss of profit is not in casu a contractual consequence of the termination of the contract,\u00a0but a consequence of the breach of the Investment Code, resulting from an illegal\u00a0expropriation act taking on the appearance of the termination of a contract187.\n160. \u00a0The Claimants consider that, \"because the Termination Decree is not included in the provisions\u00a0of article 32.5 of the Agreement, \"and consequently is not \"contractualized\"), it can and must\u00a0be appreciated by this Tribunal which entertains jurisdiction in its turn to examine the effects\u00a0of the breach of the Investment Code and not to rule on the contractual effects of the\u00a0Termination Decree\".188\n(3) Article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement as a contrary agreement\n161. The Claimants consider that \"in the case at issue, the issue is to appreciate here the legal\u00a0consequences which an act terminating a contract, carried out not in the framework of\u00a0contractual relations, but in the exercise of public authority, implies in terms of\u00a0indemnification.189 And this Tribunal has already declared that it entertains jurisdiction to\u00a0perform such an analysis and to rule on the possible breaches of the Investment Code entailed\u00a0by the act of termination and the act of requisition.190\n162. Thus, the Claimants contend that there is no \"contrary agreement\" between the Parties aimed\u00a0at not applying the Investment Code, or the arbitration mechanism stipulated therein. They\u00a0consider that this Tribunal accepted to rule on the issue of lucrum cessans in the event that the\u00a0CCJA Tribunal did not consider that this issue could be brought before it, and they recall that\n183 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 330-397.\n184 Repl. \u00a7 335.\n185 Repl. \u00a7 336.\n186 Repl. \u00a7 337 ; Mem AAC \u00a7 21\n187 Repl. \u00a7 340.\n188 Mem.

And yet the Termination Decree immediately terminated\u00a0the Agreement, and there was no subsequent termination.194\n164. \u00a0Regarding the precise point of estoppel, the Claimants acknowledge that in their notices to\u00a0Guinea, they refer to article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement inasmuch as no other clause\u00a0more applicable to their situation existed, and for the sole purpose of protecting their rights195.\u00a0They consider that the damages which they claimed pursuant to article 32.5 correspond only\u00a0to a portion of the prejudice sustained (the contractual effect of termination) and that their\u00a0requests in this case are broader and concern the breach of the Investment Code and\u00a0International Law (the extra-contractual effect of termination).\n165. \u00a0According to the Claimants therefore, there is no cause to apply the principle of estoppel\u00a0because \"the breach of the Investment Code, based on expropriation, is not to be confused\u00a0with breach of contract, based on article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement\".\n166. The Claimants consider that by now acknowledging that Article 32.5 \"was not the most\u00a0suitable in the extraordinary legal circumstances\" and that \"the situation at issue was not\u00a0provided for in Article 32.5\", their resorting to the ICSID arbitration procedure does not violate\u00a0the principle of good faith or fall within the notion of estoppel, but constitutes the simple\u00a0respect of the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal.197\n191 Mem ; \u00a7 37 ; Repl. \u00a7 357; Mem.

They also contend that only the facts are the same, but that identity of facts does not mean\u00a0identity of disputes, if the parties, the purpose and the grounds of the two litigations differ.\u00a0The Claimants specify that \"the issue of the analysis of the termination act has already been\u00a0dealt with by the CCJA Tribunal, which decided that it had constituted a breach of the\u00a0Concession Agreement. In this procedure, the Claimants are requesting that the Tribunal\u00a0analyze and decide (which the Tribunal has already accepted to do) whether or not this same\u00a0act of termination, as well as the act of requisition, constituted an expropriation, violating the\u00a0Investment Code and customary international law.\"199\n170. \u00a0According to the Claimants, two litigations therefore exist because the Termination Decree\u00a0violated the contract (resulting in the contractual litigation before the CCJA Tribunal) and the\u00a0Investment Code (resulting in this case). Lastly, the Claimants consider that the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0never ruled on the loss of profit, or on the consequences of the requisition. Consequently, the\u00a0Respondent cannot contend the existence of res judicata, with respect to these requests.\n(5) \u00a0\u00a0The effects of the annulment of the CCJA award\n171. In their Post-Hearing Memorial, the Claimants developed a fifth and new argument200, based\u00a0on the annulment of the CCJA award by the decision of the CCJA of November 30, 2015. They\u00a0consider that following this annulment (i) Getma International's contract claims ceased to\u00a0exist, (ii) Getma International's request that the CCJA Tribunal grant indemnification for the\u00a0additional prejudice can no longer impede its request in this arbitration for indemnification for\u00a0the breaches of the Investment Code and (iii) the Respondent's arguments concerning\u00a0estoppel, waiver and res judicata ensue.201\nC. The Tribunal's Analysis\n172. The Arbitral Tribunal clearly decided, in a separate procedure, the extent to which it\u00a0considered that it entertained jurisdiction to rule on the requests which had been brought\u00a0before it by the Claimants. It is recalled that this decision is an integral part of this procedure.\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal does not intend, nor could it if it wanted to, to rescind this decision.\n198 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 398-400.\n199 Repl. \u00a7 416.\n200 M.AAC \u00a7\u00a7 77-93, Chapter II.B, p. 10 to 12, not-listed in the table of contents and no to be confused with a\u00a0second Chapter II.B, which is found on pages 12 to 14 and which does appear in the table of contents\n201 M.

Nonetheless, the parties subsequently returned to this issue, the Respondent in order to put forth two new objections\u00a0based on allegations of corruption and fraud, the Claimants in order to interpret the content of\u00a0the decision on jurisdiction. The Respondent's objections will be examined under chapter (1)\u00a0below, the Claimants' under chapters (2) to (5) below.\n(1) The Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione materiae\n174. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that only legal investments, carried out in\u00a0good faith, are to be protected by the ICSID arbitration, and that the Arbitral Tribunal must\u00a0decline jurisdiction, if it appears that the investment was made fraudulently or as a result of\u00a0corruption. Furthermore, this point is not contested by the Claimants.202\n175. The Claimants contest however the existence of fraud or corruption and consider that the\u00a0allegations of fraud and corruption warrant a particularly high level of proof. In any event, they\u00a0are of the opinion that the CCJA Tribunal has already analyzed and rejected the allegation of\u00a0corruption and that the Respondent can no longer invoke it, as this Arbitral Tribunal has\u00a0already declared that it entertained jurisdiction in its decision of December 29, 2012.\n176. \u00a0This Arbitral Tribunal considers that neither of these two grounds constitutes an obstacle to an\u00a0examination of the allegation of corruption.\n177. \u00a0First of all, concerning the decision of the CCJA Tribunal on the alleged corruption, the parties\u00a0disagree on the issue of determining whether the CCJA Tribunal ruled in this respect. The CCJA\u00a0award reveals that on November 4, 2013, after the hearing of May 27-29 2013, during which\u00a0the witnesses and experts were questioned and after the hearing for oral arguments held on\u00a0July 8, 2013, the Respondents informed the CCJA Tribunal that it had evidence pertaining to\u00a0corruption. It was not until November 14, 2013, that the Respondent produced in the CCJA\u00a0procedure Mr. Steven Fox's affidavit, designed to prove the alleged corruption. On December\u00a016, 2013, the CCJA Tribunal heard Mr. Steven Fox, whose allegations it found to be\u00a0unverifiable. Consequently, it denied a new extension of the procedural schedule, which\u00a0according to the Respondent would have permitted the production of new evidence on the\u00a0allegation of corruption, namely two additional affidavits by Messrs. Demba Kourouma and\u00a0Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9 acknowledging the deeds of corruption and dated December 13,\u00a02013. The Claimants consider that the requests for a four-month extension was purely a\u00a0delaying tactic and no new evidence could have been produced. They contend that even in this\u00a0case, the Respondent is still not able to produce evidence of corruption and they therefore do\u00a0not understand how the extension of the schedule of the CCJA case could have assisted them\u00a0in providing such proof.203\n178. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the affidavits of Messrs. Demba Kourouma and Ibrahima\u00a0Lamizana Cond\u00e9 of December 13, 2013, like a third exhibit (R-34, a complaint against named\u00a0persons on the counts of corruption and influence peddling, filed on December 13, 2013 by the\u00a0Guinean state), were neither produced nor analyzed in the CCJA arbitration. These exhibits\u00a0therefore constitute new exhibits which require that the issue of whether the investment was\u00a0the subject matter of corruption be reconsidered. International public policy requires that this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal express an opinion on the serious allegation of corruption, even if another\u00a0Tribunal has already considered the issue, when new evidence not analyzecTby the first\n202 Repl ; \u00a7311.\n203 C-Mem. \u00a776 and Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 96-124.\n37\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 45 of 173\nTribunal is produced. The obligation of this Arbitral Tribunal to verify the allegation of corruption prevails over its respect of the award of the CCJA Tribunal and even over the\u00a0possible res judicata effect of this award. This is the case a fortiori after the annulment of the\u00a0CCJA award (even if it was decided on grounds which have nothing to do with the decision of\u00a0the CCJA Tribunal on corruption).\n179. \u00a0Secondly, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Respondent in this procedure raised the defense\u00a0of lack of jurisdiction due to corruption and/or fraud only in its Counter Memorial of March 30,\u00a02015, and did not raise it at all in its two memorials on jurisdiction (dated June 22 and August\u00a06, 2012, respectively). Also, this Arbitral Tribunal rendered its decision on jurisdiction on\u00a0December 29, 2012, without having had to deal with this objection. Even if, according to the\u00a0Claimants, this rationale was \"explicitly understood\" from the outset of the CCJA procedure204\n- without the invalidity of the Concession Agreement, due to corruption being requested205 - it\u00a0was not until November 4, 2013 at the Respondent felt it could prove that. And it was not until\u00a0this ICSID arbitration was resumed after its suspension while awaiting the CCJA award, that the\u00a0Respondents put forth in this arbitration, the defense of corruption and produced the two\u00a0affidavits of December 13, 2013, as exhibits R-35 and R-36, attached to the Counter-Memorial\u00a0of March 30, 2015.\n180. \u00a0Even if all the grounds for lack of jurisdiction must be raised in limine litis and if this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal has already declared that it entertained jurisdiction in its Decision on jurisdiction of\u00a0December 29, 2012, it considers that, given the public policy nature of the grounds based on\u00a0corruption and fraud, it is its duty to now verify its jurisdiction from this standpoint also. In any\u00a0event, even if this Arbitral Tribunal were to consider that the debate regarding its jurisdiction\u00a0had been definitively closed by said decision, the allegations of corruption and fraud should be\u00a0investigated, because the Respondent bases its argument on the same allegations to request\u00a0in a subsidiary capacity that the requests be declared inadmissible due to the illegality of the\u00a0investment, or, in an infinitely subsidiary capacity, rejected for the same reason.\na. The degree of evidence of corruption\n181. \u00a0It is not contested that the Respondent has the burden of proof of corruption, but the parties\u00a0disagree regarding the level of this proof. Both of them have quoted decisions of other courts\u00a0in support of their respective positions. The Arbitral Tribunal not only verified the context in\u00a0which the apparently contradictory rules were formulated by these other courts, but also each\u00a0court's application of them to the facts and evidence submitted to them. This Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0therefore concludes that it cannot follow the Claimants according to whom proof of corruption\u00a0must be \"irrefutable\" in accordance with \"an uninterrupted line of precedents\".206\n182. The decisions on which the Claimants rely do not support their thesis:\n- \u00a0In the Siag and Vecchi versus Egypt case, the court specified (in the framework of its\u00a0verification into whether one of the plaintiffs had obtained his Lebanese nationality by\u00a0fraud) that the level of proof which applies for allegations of fraud ranges between the\u00a0traditional civil law standard, i.e. the balance of probabilities, and the criminal law standard\u00a0which requires that the allegation be beyond reasonable doubt. It concluded that the\n204 Mem ; \u00a7 372.\n205 CCJA award of May 26, 2014 (C-50) \u00a7 63\n206 Repl ; \u00a7 36.\n38\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 46 of 173\nevidence must be clear and convincing707. Also this court evaluated all of the alleged proof (including the clues mentioned) at its proper merit, and concluded that, in the case at issue,\u00a0fraud and falsification in conjunction with the plaintiffs nationality were not proven.208\nIn the Sabo Fakes case, the court had to rule on the authenticity of certain certificates regarding which the defendant had suggested that they had been post-dated for the\u00a0purposes of the arbitration, without nonetheless contending that they had been falsified.\u00a0The defendants presented only allegations based on presumptions derived from Indirect\u00a0proof discussed in other arbitration proceedings209. Having merely ascertained that \"the\u00a0burden of proof of any impropriety whatsoever is particularly heavy\", the court concluded\u00a0(without the slightest discussion or evaluation of the evidence produced) that this burden\u00a0had not been met and that the dates of the transfer of the certificates mentioned by the\u00a0plaintiff were correct. This Arbitral Tribunal understands the ascertainment quoted as\u00a0simple justification of the court's decision that the allegation was not proven. In the\u00a0absence of other specifications or clarifications, either of the principle adopted by the\u00a0court, or its application of this principle to the facts and proof at its disposal, this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal considers that this decision does not offer a criterion which is relevant for this\u00a0debate.\n- \u00a0In the Fraport versus Philippines case, the court considered, like the court in the first case\u00a0mentioned above, that proof of corruption should be clear and convincing so that one can\u00a0reasonably believe that the events occurred as alleged.210 In this case, the court confronted\u00a0an allegation that Fraport was aware of and had participated in the corruption when it had\u00a0made its initial investment. Later on in the procedure, the State alleged that the prima facie\u00a0evidence it had produced had shifted the burden of proof to Fraport and that payments to\u00a0civil servants must not be proven by direct evidence, but can be proven by \"circumstantial\"\u00a0evidence and clues. The court analyzed the evidence submitted in support of the\u00a0allegations of corruption during the periods preceding and following the investment, but\u00a0concluded that it did not prove that Fraport was aware of and was involved in the\u00a0corruption and fraud concerning the terminal 3 project at the time it was making its\u00a0investment.\n- \u00a0The same is true for the EDF versus Romania court, which demanded clear and convincing\u00a0evidence, and then reviewed the evidence submitted by the investor of a civil servant's\u00a0alleged request for a bribe. This evidence included the written and oral testimony of the\u00a0person to whom the request had allegedly been made, but which the court ruled, along\u00a0with the other evidence, was not clear and convincing.212\n- \u00a0In the TSA case, criminal investigations concerning the alleged corruption had been initiated\u00a0and pursued in Argentina but were not yet complete at the time the Tribunal was to render\u00a0its award. The Tribunal considered that corruption had not been proven by the material\u00a0presented; it was open to the possibility that it be proven by the criminal investigation\u00a0which was under way, but did not retain corruption as grounds for its lack of jurisdiction,\n207 Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/05/15, Award,\u00a0June 1st, 2009 (C-321) \u00a7 326.\n208 Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/05/15, Award,\u00a0June 1st, 2009 (C-321) \u00a7 3276.-359\n209 M.

This Tribunal however did not refer to a rule\u00a0concerning the level of proof required.\n- \u00a0The only international Tribunal which, according to the Claimants' records, required that\u00a0proof of corruption be irrefutable is the Tribunal which ruled in the case of Africa Holdings\u00a0versus the Democratic Republic of Congo. This Tribunal even specified that such irrefutable\u00a0proof would be \"such as that which might result from criminal prosecution in countries in\u00a0which corruption constitutes a criminal violation\". This expression gives the impression that\u00a0the Tribunal wanted to aim at the required level of proof in criminal cases, namely beyond\u00a0any doubt. In fact, however reference to this high level was gratuitous because the Tribunal\u00a0considered that corruption was not proven, given that the sole allegations were based\u00a0exclusively on general considerations concerning the Mobutu period and the related\u00a0political events.216\n183. This Arbitral Tribunal considers that, given that these Tribunals - to the exclusion of the latter\n- have described perfectly the standard of proof to be applied to corruption, even if, as the\u00a0Fraport Tribunal acknowledged, proof can be \"circumstantial\" given the difficulty of proving\u00a0corruption by direct proof217. Thus, understood correctly, the case law quoted by the Claimants\u00a0does not differ substantially from that on which the Respondent relies, even if, in most of the\u00a0cases quoted by the Respondent, the issue of corruption did not arise218, but rather other,\u00a0serious deeds alleged against a State or the Public Authorities. The Arbitral Tribunal however\u00a0considers that the issue of determining whether the nature of the allegation demands a higher\u00a0level of proof is the same for all serious allegations involving a State, whether they concern\u00a0corruption or another offense. This Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the case law\u00a0quoted by the Respondent is relevant:\n- \u00a0The Metal-Tech versus Uzbekistan Tribunal, which indeed concerned corruption, required\u00a0\"reasonable certainty\", while accepting, as did the Fraport Tribunal, that proof could be\u00a0circumstantial219. Even if, as the Claimants pointed out220, this Tribunal did not consider it\n213 TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. versus the Republic of Argentina, ICSID ARB/05/5, Award, Dec. 19, 2008 (C-325) \u00a7\u00a7 174-176.\n214 Repl. \u00a7 34.\n215 EDF (Services) Limited versus Romania ICSID ARB/05/13,Award, Oct. 8, 2009 (C-327) \u00a7 132.\n216 African Holding Company of America, INC. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Construction au Congo S.A.R.L. versus the\u00a0Democratic Republic of Congo ICSID ARB/05/21, Award on the denials of jurisdiction and admissibility, July 29,\u00a02008 (C-324) \u00a7 52\n217 Fraport G Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide versus the Republic of the Philippines, ICSID ARB/11/12,\u00a0Award, Dec. 10, 2014 (C-323) \u00a7 479: The Tribunal holds that considering the difficulty to prove corruption by\u00a0direct evidence, the same may be circumstantial.

This Arbitration Tribunal concludes that there are no valid precedents for contending, as the\u00a0Claimants do, that the level of proof required must be higher for corruption than for other\u00a0deeds. Therefore, it shall verify below whether the evidence submitted by the Respondent is\u00a0clear and convincing and if it can provide this Tribunal with a reasonable certainty that the\u00a0Concession Agreement was obtained by the active corruption of Getma International.\nb.

But the particular\u00a0circumstances would be determinative, and in the Tribunal's view defy codification.\n226 On November 30, 2015, the CCJA Court cancelled the CCJA award on the grounds that the \"Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0did not comply with its mission\" by deliberately ignoring the imperative provisions of the arbitration\u00a0regulations, which prohibit agreements between parties and arbitrators regarding the amount of their fees.\n41\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 49 of 173\n- \u00a0Mr. Steven Fox's affidavit (also produced in this arbitration as R-33), who was heard for that\u00a0matter as witness by the CCJA Tribunal227. As the Respondent did not deem it was\u00a0necessary to reintroduce Mr. Fox as a witness in this arbitration, this Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0considers that the opinion of the CCJA Tribunal regarding his testimony is conclusive. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal notes that the CCJA Tribunal ascertained that Mr. Steven Fox was not the\u00a0direct or indirect witness of the deeds of corruption he is reporting, that he refers to no\u00a0document, and that his allegations are non-verifiable, to conclude that his affidavit \"does\u00a0not permit [us] to attribute the slightest relevance to the particularly serious grievance of\u00a0corruption\".228\n- \u00a0The CCJA Tribunal added that \"the same is true of the last-minute affidavits proposed,\u00a0regarding which the Republic of Guinea acknowledges were prepared on December 13 for\u00a0the hearing of December 16, 2013\" ,229 However, as the CCJA Tribunal did not authorize the\u00a0production of these two affidavits, it was not able to examine them or to hear the parties\u00a0who wrote them. As the CCJA Tribunal did not motivate the reference quoted either, this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal does not feel it is bound by this reference and will attribute to these\u00a0affidavits and the testimony of the persons who wrote them the weight they merit.\n186. This Arbitral Tribunal will therefore concentrate on the affidavits of Messrs. Demba\u00a0Kouorouma and Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9 and the complaint filed on December 13, 2013 by\u00a0the Guinean Government on the counts of corruption and influence peddling (R-34). It will\u00a0also examine \"the body of evidence of corruption\" which, according to the Respondent,\u00a0corroborates the existence of corruption.\n(i) The affidavits of the \"witnesses\" - Exhibits (R-35 and 36)\n187. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that these two exhibits, entitled \"Affidavit\" (R-35) and \"Sworn\u00a0Statement\" (R-36), respectively, were not communicated, in this arbitration, by the\u00a0Respondent with its counter-memorial of March 30, 2015 in the form of written depositions of\u00a0witnesses, but were produced as simple exhibits among numerous others. Furthermore, the\u00a0Respondent did not request either that the Arbitral Tribunal hear Messrs. Kourouma and\u00a0Cond\u00e9 as witnesses and was therefore apparently prepared to do without the oral testimony\u00a0of these two persons whose role in principle was to bolster the credibility of the exhibits (R-35\u00a0and 36).\n188. \u00a0If the Arbitral Tribunal was nonetheless able to hear the authors of these exhibits, it was\u00a0following the Claimants' request of October 20, 2015 to have the opportunity to cross-examine\u00a0them at the hearing beginning on November 23, 2015. The Respondent began by protesting to\u00a0this request because it considered that it had been made late and asked that the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal grant to the exhibits (R-35 and 36) the evidentiary value of a written confession. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal rejected this request in its Procedural Order no. 8 of November 2, 2015,\u00a0deeming that it was up to it to appreciate this evidentiary valued when the time came, based\u00a0on all the evidence in the file known at the time.\nThis annulment does not prevent this Arbitral Tribunal from forming an opinion on the factual ascertainments of the CCJA Tribunal which have nothing to do with the grounds for annulment.\n227 CCJA Award \u00a7 73\n228 CCJA Award \u00a7 76\n229 CCJA Award \u00a7 76\n42\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 50 of 173\nI\n189 Notwithstanding the Respondent's initial opposition to the deposition of Messrs.

This Arbitral Tribunal finds it incomprehensible that Mr. Kourouma, when according to his own\u00a0words, he was corrupted for the first time in his life, did not ask himself any questions:\u00a0regarding the amount promised, regarding that which exactly was expected of him, regarding\u00a0the possible consequences of his acts, and that he no longer remembered what he had done\u00a0exactly in exchange for the money he was certain at the time he was going to receive, even if\u00a0he had no idea of the time or amount of his payment. It is even less comprehensible that,\u00a0again without asking about the possible consequences, he admitted, the first time he was\u00a0asked, his passive corruption, agreed to make this confession in writing and finally accepted to\u00a0come to Paris to testify to his corruption.255\n193. \u00a0His testimony therefore cannot be seriously retained, also because despite his admission of\u00a0passive corruption, he was not prosecuted.\n194. \u00a0Furthermore, Mr. Ibrahima Lamizana Conde's deposition revealed the following:\n- \u00a0He also was not asked until the Friday prior to the hearing in Paris, to come and testify256,\n- \u00a0His statements concerning the manner in which he had been contacted for the purpose of\u00a0preparing and signing the affidavit containing his \"confession\" are confusing257: one retains\u00a0therefrom that \"an attorney\" went to Mr. Conde's office, asked him to write the affidavit\u00a0and that Mr. Cond\u00e9 prepared \"a written draft\"258 and read it \"as he was writing it\", which\n247 TR III, p.47 :31-42 and p.48 ;21-22.\n248 TR III, p.50 :40-p.51:8.\n244 The response he gives several minutes later, and from which one can infer that he first received the amount of 20,000 euros and then the sum of 15,000 euros, is perhaps due to a misunderstanding. The Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0is therefore not holding it against the witness.\n250 TR III, p.50:34-37\n251 TR III, p.53 :39-p.54 :20.\n252 TR III, p.51:2-8;p. 51:25-p.52-20.\n253 TR III, p.53 :39-p.54 :21\n254 TR III, p.56 :20-28.\n255 T4R III, p.56 :30-39.\n256 TR III, p 58:17-22.\n257 TR III, p.58 :37-p.60 :21.\n258 TR III, p.60 :8\n44\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 52 of 173\npermitted the attorney to type the text on the premises (i.e. in Mr. Conde's office at the French National Directorate of Investment Programming)259;\n- Mr. Cond\u00e9 did not know what use would be made of his affidavit and he was surprised to find himself in Paris260;\n- \u00a0When he wrote his affidavit, Mr. Cond\u00e9 was aware that he could be prosecuted, but he\u00a0considered that it was more important to tell the truth as is commonplace in his ethnic\u00a0group261; however the attorney reassured him and indeed there were no problems.262\nLater on, when questioned, Mr. Cond\u00e9 stated that he had been threatened with legal action (without specifying whether the threat was aimed at making him admit passive corruption\u00a0or a possible subsequent denial of his initial confession) 263, he then refused categorically to\u00a0say whether he had effectively been prosecuted264.\n- \u00a0Notwithstanding his own insistence on the necessity of telling the truth265, Mr. Cond\u00e9\u00a0refused to answer the question of whether he had already been the subject matter of other\u00a0attempts at passive corruption266;\n- \u00a0Mr. Cond\u00e9 had no knowledge of the complaint filed against him and he was thereafter\u00a0never convened by the local or state police267. Subsequently, he answered however that he\u00a0had been informed of the complaint by the judicial officer268;\n- \u00a0Like Mr. Lourouma, Mr. Cond\u00e9 was expecting a \"reward\" because the President of the\u00a0Contracts Commission \"had told him to work, that we would be rewarded for good work in\u00a0any event\"269;\n- \u00a0Mr. Cond\u00e9 denies having received US$ 100,000 as claimed by Mr. Fox270 and affirms that he\u00a0received a manila envelope containing 20,000 euros in 50-euro bills271;\n- \u00a0Mr. Cond\u00e9 has failed to state clearly that the money he received came from Getma\u00a0International:\nMr. Fischer. - Unanimously. Do you conclude that everyone, unanimously, received money from Getma?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - No. I myself received money. From Getma, no.

According to Mr. Cond\u00e9's testimony, the Chairman of the Contracts Commission did not tell\u00a0him, prior to the evaluation, what bidder was to be voted for. The name of Mr. Challoub\u00a0(Getma International's representative in Conakry) was presented, but Mr. Cond\u00e9 did not know\u00a0him (and did not know either who he was or what he represented) and, according to his own\u00a0affirmations, it was not until negotiations were under way (therefore after the Contracts\u00a0Commission's decision) that the President spoke to him of Mr. Challoub.274 It therefore\u00a0appears that Mr. Cond\u00e9 did not know he was to favor Getma International, but that the\u00a0President had just asked him to vote as he did. In this case, he did not know either by whom\u00a0he was (on the verge) of being corrupted. Indeed, it was not until the negotiations of the\u00a0Agreement that it became clear for Mr. Cond\u00e9 who Mr. Challoub was and that he was a\u00a0member of the \"Getma group\"275; the simple awareness of the fact that Mr. Challoub had\u00a0approached the Chairman of the Commission did not suffice for Mr. Cond\u00e9 to surmise that it\u00a0was Getma International he was to vote for. At the end of his deposition, Mr. Cond\u00e9\u00a0attempted to establish the connection between Getma and Mr. Challoub:\nThe President. -It was therefore this Mr. Camara who made you understand that there would be a reward if Getma got the contract?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. -If Challoub got the contract - the term he used. We must see, now, whether Challoub with Getma or...Well...276\n196. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that Mr. Cond\u00e9 was not a particularly reliable witness; the\u00a0following excerpt illustrates the degree to which he avoided answering questions although\u00a0they were clear, and that despite his denial, he was aware that other persons had been called\u00a0upon to testify:\nPresident Tercier. - Mr. Cond\u00e9,...You yourself signed the sworn statement. This is the Statement you signed. You therefore did so in the presence of an attorney?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - Of course.\nPresident Tercier.- Do you know whether other persons were also called upon to make a statement of this type?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - No. We were convened individually.\nPresident Tercier. - Alright. But do you think there were other persons who were asked to sign a comparable statement?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - No. In short, the attorney told me that we were bound individually, the members of the Commission.277\n272 TR III, p. 69 :20-24\n273 TR III, p.70 :17-37\n274 TR III, p.71:22-44\u00a027sTR III, p.71:22-28\n276 TR III, p.76 :16-18\n277 TR III, p.72 :3-14.\n46\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 54 of 173\n197. \u00a0Mr. Cond\u00e9 did not reinforce the credibility of his testimony before the Arbitral Tribunal when\u00a0confronted with the contradiction between, on the one hand, his repeated testimony during\u00a0his deposition of November 25, 2015 that he had received the money \"after the signing of the\u00a0Agreement\"7\u20198 and, on the other hand, his written affidavit according to which \"during the\u00a0negotiations of the Concession Agreement, Mr. Mamadou Diallo...gave me an envelope\u00a0containing \u20ac20,000 in 50-euro bills\"279:\nThe President. - Thank you. Is it therefore true that there is a contradiction between what you wrote in your sworn statement, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, that which\u00a0you attested on three occasions this morning, here, before our Tribunal?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - Hum, hum.\nThe President: - I'm sorry, what does \"Hum, hum\" mean?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. -1 said yes, I didn't understand, that's what I meant to say. You tell me there's a contradiction?\nThe President. - Yes.\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - What did I say this morning that is not written there? This morning I said: after the signing of the agreement, Mr. Diallo called me to give me this money.\nThe President. - Yes, after the signing of the agreement, the money was given to you.\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - After our signature, we weren't the ones who signed the agreement. I clearly said: \"That, that's my signature. That, that's our signature\". We, we signed a document.\u00a0We sent. It was after that signature that we received that amount.\nThe President. - Yes, but here, it says in writing that the envelope was given to you - I quote: \"During the negotiations of the agreement\".\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - Exactly.\nThe President. - So, does the written statement correspond to the oral statement you made this morning?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - That's exactly what I wanted to say, it was at the time of the agreement that the money was given to us, because we were in the room. It was in the room that we left,\u00a0we signed the minutes, we were given the money, I was given the money. At the time, they\u00a0were, we were in the midst of negotiations.\nMrs. President, I repeated that ten times, but this morning I feel very tired. It's 8 a.m., I've been awake, sitting, I haven't gotten a minute of sleep.\nThe President: Therefore, your last statement is that it was at the time of the agreement. Mr. Cond\u00e9: Exactly\nThe President. - Without specifying whether it was the signing of the negotiations.\nMr. Cond\u00e9.- In any event, that's what I have written here, that's how it happened.280\n198. \u00a0For counsel for the Respondent, the contradictions are due to the fact that, when Mr. Cond\u00e9\u00a0spoke of \"signing\", he was referring to the signing of the Minutes of the negotiations.281 While\u00a0the Arbitral Tribunal is attentive to the risk of misunderstandings or even of small errors or\u00a0nuance in a testimony, it considers that the fact that Mr. Cond\u00e9 spoke explicitly, on three\u00a0occasions of \"the signing of the agreement\" cannot be nullified by a simple \"clarification\" that\u00a0he was referring to another signing. This is even truer in that Mr. Cond\u00e9 also contradicted\u00a0himself on another point: he first explained that, \"after the evaluation and signing of the\u00a0contract\", he wanted to go back to his own office, but that the Chairman of the Contracts\u00a0Commission told him not to leave because they were going to call him (which he did not\u00a0regret), and that \"two or three days later\", Mr. Diallo called him to give him the envelope\n278 TR III, p.66 :38-39; p. 70 :38; p.74 :38 and p.75 :25-26.\n279 Statement made by Mr. Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9 on December 13, 2013 (R-36).\n280 TR III, p.75 :17-p.76:5.\n281 Mem.AAR\u00a7126-128.\n47\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 55 of 173\nwith the money.\u201982 However, a little later in his deposition, he stated, just as firmly, that \"it was at the time of the agreement that the money was given to us, because we went into the\u00a0room. It was in the room that we went out, we signed the minutes, we were given the money.\u00a0At that time, they were, we were in the midst of negotiations\".283\n199. \u00a0Even with the understanding for a certain confusion on the witness' part because he felt \"very\u00a0tired\" and had \"not had a minute's sleep\"28'1, the Arbitral Tribunal has not retained of this\u00a0testimony a clear, precise idea of the manner in which the corruption occurred. Furthermore,\u00a0the facts reported do not prove clearly that the corruption was the doing of Getma\u00a0International.\n200. The Claimants insisted greatly in their Post-Hearing Memorial on the contradictions between\u00a0the testimony of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that\u00a0these contradictions alone do not suffice to cast doubt on the credibility of the testimony. On\u00a0the contrary, inasmuch as each witness speaks of his own passive corruption, it is normal that\u00a0their respective testimony not be concordant. On the other hand, a contradiction in the\u00a0testimony of a single witness, for example between his written affidavit and his own oral\u00a0statement, or between various oral statements, necessarily influences the Tribunal's opinion\u00a0regarding the credibility of the testimony, even if it makes allowance for misunderstandings\u00a0during the deposition or for any possible confusion, on the part of both the witness and the\u00a0examiner.285\n201. \u00a0It is remarkable that neither of the two witnesses referred to the alleged irregularity or\u00a0inadmissibility of Getma International's offer; even when questioned regarding the financial\u00a0aspects of the offer, the two witnesses remembered only the high price of the entry ticket286.\u00a0Neither of them confirmed that he had \"turned a blind eye\" to the irregularities - and neither\u00a0of them was able to describe them - while Guinea asserts today that they are so flagrant that\u00a0the admission of the offer can be explained only by the corruption of the members of the\u00a0Contracts Commission. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that, if the two witnesses had truly\u00a0been corrupt, they would have a more accurate recollection of the irregularities of the offer.\u00a0Until the end of his deposition, Mr. Cond\u00e9 was unable to provide a precise example of\u00a0favoritism toward Getma International.287 Details regarding these aspects are important\u00a0however in appreciating the evidence of the alleged corruption.\n282 TR III, p.70 38-71 2.\n283 TR III, p.75 38-41.\n284 TRIII, p.72 :44-45.\n28\u2019 See, for example TR III, p.64:23-35.\nMr. Fischer. - Who was physically present at this meeting? Given that you have told us that you received a letter, you therefore responded to the invitation you received. Who were the persons attending this meeting?\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - There was the judicial officer, the legal advisor to the President. There were two other Guinean attorneys, there was...I don't know There were at least some nine persons in the room.\nMr. Fischer. - And was there -1 am not asking you for the names of the attorneys, because you perhaps don't remember, unless..\nMr. Cond\u00e9. - No, I...For me, because we were convened individually, the entire Committee, but me practically, I was asked the question regarding my affidavit.\nMr. Fischer. -1 understand. Were there other members of the Committee during this...\nMr. Cond\u00e9 - No, during the interview, I was alone.\nThe contradiction between \"nine persons\" or \"alone\" is clear, but it's impossible o verify whether the witness is referring to the same meeting or summons to a meeting.\n286 Mr. Kourouma: TR III, p.51:39-p.52:12; Mr. Cond\u00e9: TR III, p.72 :34-p.73 :15\n287 TR III, p.77 41-P.78 37\n48\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 56 of 173\n202. \u00a0Both witnesses suffered memory lapses when it came to describing the details of the summons\u00a0they had received to attest that they had accepted bribes: they no longer remembered them\u00a0and emphasized that the facts went back seven years.288\n203. \u00a0In all cases, the deposition of these two witnesses revealed that - as both of them had been\u00a0convened by or pursuant to instructions from the Ministers of Justice successively in office,\u00a0first to attest that they had been corrupted and then to confirm it in Paris - neither their\u00a0confession, nor their testimony was spontaneous, even if both of them insisted greatly on the\u00a0fact that they themselves were the authors of their respective affidavits.\n204. \u00a0For the Arbitral Tribunal, the fact that the two affidavits had been requested by the Ministry of\u00a0Justice can explain the similarities in form and presentation, despite the fact that the two\u00a0affidavits were typed on two different computers in two different offices (Mr. Kourouma's in\u00a0the office of the Government judicial officer, Mr. Goureissy, who had it typed by his secretary,\u00a0and Mr. Cond\u00e9's in his office, typed by \u201cthe attorney\" whose name Mr. Cond\u00e9 no longer\u00a0recalls). Questioned in this respect, Mr. Cond\u00e9 tried to explain these similarities, stating that\u00a0all the typewriters were purchased together by the administration. Even if the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal accepted this explanation, it cannot explain why two different typists, acting\u00a0separately (see below) chose respectively on two typewriters (to be read as \"computers\" or\u00a0\"word processing programs\") - even if they are from the same manufacturer - the same font\u00a0and the same size letters, as well as an almost identical layout to type messages given to them\u00a0respectively in draft form by an author and read as he went along by another authors.\n205. \u00a0One can only admit that the date of the notice for writing and singing the affidavits, December\u00a013, 2013, is no coincidence either: the CCJA was on the verge of pronouncing its award and\u00a0Guinea succeeded in obtaining another hearing for Mr. Fox' deposition on December 165,\u00a02013. The affidavits appear to have been produced in conjunction with the course of the CCJA\u00a0procedure: indeed, they could have been obtained much earlier and the file contains no other\u00a0explanation for why the affidavits were requested on this date alone.\n206. \u00a0It was therefore the same Ministry, namely the Justice Ministry, which made possible the\u00a0defense in the corruption in this investment arbitration; it was it also which had the power to\u00a0decide on the follow-up to be given to the criminal complaint, but it did not follow-up on it\u00a0(see sub-chapter (ii) below).\n207. \u00a0If the invitations of the Ministry of Justice to the \"witnesses\" of the corruption were not in\u00a0themselves reprehensible, the question nonetheless arises as to who the two witnesses agreed\u00a0to \"self-incriminate\". The fact that this question cannot be answered does not add to the\u00a0witnesses' credibility.\n208. \u00a0Even if it does not dwell on the inherent contradictions and lacunae in the testimony of the\u00a0two witnesses, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot disregard the Respondent's reluctance to present\u00a0these two witnesses. Indeed, if the affidavits and their authors had no weak points, the oral\u00a0testimony could only reinforce the Respondent's allegations\n209. \u00a0Furthermore, why were only two affidavits and - reluctantly - two witnesses presented in this\u00a0procedure? According to the witnesses, all the members of the Contracts Commission were\u00a0convened to the office of the President (Mr. Fofana) by the judicial officer, in order o be heard\n288 Mr. Kourouma: TR III, p.35:18, p.47:6, p.51:43 and p.56:25; Mr. Cond\u00e9: TR III, p.60:21;p.62:2, p.73:14 and\u00a0p.78:36.\n49\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 57 of 173\nregarding what had occurred in the Contracts Commission?89 One can therefore reasonably infer that the Ministry attempted to obtain affidavits or confessions from the other members\u00a0also. There were even confrontations between Mr. Diallo and Mr. Cond\u00e9 during which Mr.\u00a0Diallo contradicted Mr. Cond\u00e9 and denied the corruption.290 It is also reasonably to believe\u00a0that the other members also denied it, otherwise their affidavits would have been produced.\n210. \u00a0Nonetheless, the Respondent announced to the CCJA that, in a period of several weeks, it\u00a0would gather other evidence of corruption. And yet, with the exception of these two affidavits\u00a0(and the complaint), no other proof has since been produced.\n211. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that there is no other evidence confirming the testimony of Messrs.\u00a0Cond\u00e9 and Kourouma (other than Mr. Fox' affidavit, on the condition that the differences in\u00a0the amounts of the bribes paid to these two witnesses not be taken into consideration.)291\u00a0Their two testimonies are not confirmed by other evidence: Mr. Diallo was not introduced as a\u00a0witness, and since Mr. Cond\u00e9's testimony, we know that this can be explained by Mr. Diallo's\u00a0denial of Mr. Cond\u00e9's confession. Mr. Ansoumane Camara, the Chairman of the Committee,\u00a0who asked Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9 to follow him in the points he gave to the different\u00a0tenderers, has died.292\n212. \u00a0Mr. Ansoumane Camara's role in the corruption of the two \"witnesses\" is not clearly apparent\u00a0in the two testimonies. Mr. Kourouma first states that Mr. Camara told him that Getma had\u00a0approached him to assist him and was grateful to him for this.293 He then becomes more\u00a0vague:\nMr. Fischer. - Mr. Ansoumane Camara made a specific proposal to you?\nMr. Kourouma. - No.\nMr. Fischer. - Implied to you. In your mind, what was it... what did you think? In your mind, what did you understand from what he said?\nMr. Kourouma.-Judging from what he said, I understood that Getma had to be assisted and if Getma is the successful tenderer.Jt was clear, he said: it'll do something for you.\u00a0Mr. Fischer.- And what did you personally hope for?\nMr. Kourouma.-1 don't know what I hoped for. He promised us, he would do something for us. I said to myself that...He wasn't going to give us each a car. It will be money.\nMr. Kourouma.[sic].- You therefore thought that they were proposing something if you cast the right vote?\nMr. Kourouma.-1 said to myself that that's the promise they made to the President.294\n213. On the other hand, Mr. Camara supposedly asked Mr. Cond\u00e9 only to \"support him each time,\u00a0particularly at the time of the votes and attributions\"295, without telling him exactly what\u00a0tenderer was to be favored, while indicating that he would be rewarded.296\n289 Mr. Kourouma : TR III, p.40:23 and following; Mr. Cond\u00e9: TR III, p.64:18-35.\n290 TR III, p.69 :29-38 ; .76 .6 and p.78 :39 - p.79 :19\n291 The Arbitral Tribunal notes that according to Mr. Fox' affidavit (R-33), Mr. Talbot provided a budget to Mr\u00a0Challoub for a total amount of 2.5 million euros (3.3 million US$) with funds from an account opened in Zug,\u00a0Switzerland. This corresponds partially with Mr. Cond\u00e9's testimony that the President of the Contracts\u00a0Commission had told him that he had been approached by Mr. Challoub.\n292 TR III, p.68 .38-41.\n293 TR III, p.44 :14-19.\n294 TR III, p.44 :14-26.\n295 TR III, p.70:17-37.\n296 TR III, p.71:13-28 and p.76 :15-18.\n50\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 58 of 173\n214. The two witnesses' statements concerning the request for \"leniency\" made to them by the\u00a0President of the Contracts Commission, Mr. Ansoumane Camara, are plausible, but\u00a0unverifiable given that Mr. Camara has since died.\n215. \u00a0The fact that there are only two witnesses who admitted their passive corruption (while,\u00a0according to Mr. Fox' report, at least eight persons, namely two ministers and six members of\u00a0the Contracts Commission, were corrupted), in itself does not prove that the corruption did\u00a0not take place. Self incrimination is in itself sufficiently extraordinary to not find it surprising\u00a0that six persons refused to participate therein. But the absence of any other written or other\u00a0evidence (other than Mr. Fox' report) of the corruption either of the two witnesses, or of one\u00a0of the other corrupted parties, considerably weakens the evidentiary value which the two\u00a0testimonies could have in other circumstances.\n216. This absence of evidence is even more surprising in that neither of the two witnesses was\u00a0disturbed following his confession of passive corruption. They did not even know that a\u00a0complaint had been filed against them.297 The degree to which Mr. Cond\u00e9 showed himself to\u00a0be even heedless of the possible consequences of his confession, while insisting on the fact\u00a0that he had told the truth, is striking forthat matter.298\n217. \u00a0Mr. Cond\u00e9 testified that he had \"discovered\" the existence of the criminal complaint during his\u00a0deposition before this Arbitral Tribunal299 and confirms that he was never questioned\u00a0regarding the complaint by the local or state police, but that it was the judicial officer who\u00a0subsequently mentioned it to him300. Later on during his examination, he stated that the\u00a0judicial officer threatened to \"communicate the file to the court\".301 Mr. Cond\u00e9 is very\u00a0uncertain as to the date of this conversation with the judicial officer302: first of all, he appears\u00a0to be saying that over two years ago (therefore prior to the end of 2013), but later he\u00a0confirmed that this meeting occurred after the date of his affidavit.303 One cannot totally\u00a0escape the impression that the criminal complaint was used to exert pressure on the authors\u00a0of the affidavit in order to secure their oral testimony, even if, in the chronology of the events,\u00a0the specific request that they come to testify at the hearing of this Arbitral Tribunal does not\u00a0appear to have been made prior to prior to Friday, November 20, 2015.\n218. This Arbitral Tribunal can only conclude that the testimony of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9\u00a0did not provide clear convincing evidence of the corruption of which Getma International is\u00a0accused and this notwithstanding all powers and resources t Guinea's disposal to provide such\u00a0proof. This testimony however remains to be evaluated in the context of other elements.\n(ii) The complaint filed on December 13, 2013 by the Guinean State on the counts of corruption and influence peddling (rR-34)\n219. According to the complaint, it was \"in the framework of the arbitration procedure opposing\u00a0the Guinean State and Getma International\" that the Council of State mandated Mr. Fox to\u00a0investigate the conditions under which the concession had been granted. The complaint was\n297 Mr. Kourouma : TR III, p.39:29-p.40:7; Mr. Cond\u00e9: TR III, p 62 43-p.63:9.\n298 TR III, p.62 :7-19 ;p.64-17.\n299 TR III, p.62 :44,p. 63 :9.\n300 TR III, p. 63 :10-14\n301 TR III, p.67 :24-33\n302 TR III, p.63-27.\n303 TR III, p 64 :4-28.\n51\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 59 of 173\nobviously based on the data in Mr. Tox' report which refers to \"payments [which...] were allegedly made to the persons [...] in exchange for their assistance for granting to Getma the\u00a0desired port concession\". It concludes that, \"if the investigation shows that the\u00a0aforementioned facts prove true, they could constitute the offences of corruption and\u00a0influence peddling governed by and punishable under Articles 191 and the following of the\u00a0Guinean Republic's Criminal Code\". Mr. Fox therefore did not consider that he already\u00a0possessed proof of the alleged corruption, but required an investigation. And yet, this\u00a0investigation apparently never took place; at least Guinea never produced proof thereof. The\u00a0examination of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9 of December 13,2013 did not occur in the\u00a0framework of an investigation (which was not possible for that matter given that the complaint\u00a0itself dates back to December 13, 2013), but apparently fell into the context of the State's\u00a0defense in the CCJA arbitration, which was approaching its final phase. The date of the\u00a0complaint, which is the same as that of the affidavits of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9,\u00a0confirms that it too was filed in conjunction with Guinea's defense before the CCJA Court:\u00a0strangely, Mr. Fox' report is not dated, but it is obviously at the basis of the letter from counsel\u00a0for the Respondent to the CCJA Court of November 4, 2013, in which it is informed that \"the\u00a0Republic of Guinea very recently obtained information and evidence regarding the\u00a0circumstances surrounding the conclusion of the Concession Agreement for the Container\u00a0Terminal in the Port of Conakry in 2008\"; therefore Guinea was aware thereof by November 4,\u00a02013 at the latest and yet it waited until December 13, 2013 to file a complaint, probably\u00a0prompted by the letter from counsel for the Claimants of November 29, 2013 expressing\u00a0surprise that the parties who were allegedly corrupt not be the subject matter of judicial\u00a0prosecution in Guinea.304\n220. Subsequently, in the contest of this arbitration procedure and its exhibit production process,\u00a0the Claimants asked that the Respondent produce \"the documents established by the\u00a0Respondent following the criminal complaint filed on December 13, 2013 by the public\u00a0prosecutor at the district court of Kaloum (exhibit no. R34)\" (point 12 of the Claimants' request\u00a0for the production of documents). The Claimants' request concerned in particular the\u00a0administrative documents (and therefore not covered by the secrecy of the investigation or\u00a0the inquiry) which are normally drafted following a complaint, such as the notice of the\u00a0definitive closing of the case, the notice of the opening of a judicial investigation, the filing of a\u00a0complaint with request for damages, or the direct subpoenas (cf. Redfern Schedule, Claimants'\u00a0requests no.12a, 12b and 12c). Notwithstanding Order no. 6 (point 12) of the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0according to which these documents had to be produced by June 8, 2015, they were not\u00a0produced because, according to the letter from counsel for Guinea of June 19, 2015 to counsel\u00a0for the Claimants (of which the Arbitral Tribunal received copy), these documents could not be\u00a0found, and this, \"despite the steps taken in the office of public prosecution at the district court\u00a0of Kaloum, Conakry\".\n221. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that it can conclude from this failure to produce exhibits,\u00a0combined with the flagrant absence of any other evidence of any follow-up whatsoever given\u00a0to the complaint of December 13, 2013, that Guinea and its Justice Ministry attempted rather\u00a0to prove corruption in the CCJA procedure than to sanction it. The Respondent gave priority to\u00a0the grounds of defense which corruption constitutes, rather than to the prosecution of the\u00a0corrupted parties. Even if the offense of corruption had been time-barred at the time that\u00a0Guinea, on the basis of Mr. Fox' report, had become aware of the corruption305, one could\n304 Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of November 29, 2013 (C-340),p.5, point 3.\n305 The Claimants referred to Article 4 of the Guinean Criminal Code, according to which offenses are time\u00a0barred after three years (Repl. \u00a7 77 and footnote no. 59) and are of the opinion that the admitted that the\u00a0statute of limitations had become effective (Mem. AAC \u00a7\u00a76 and 121-123).\n52\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 60 of 173\nhave expected that the State would protect its public interests by seeing to it that the persons suspected of passive corruption no longer have the opportunity to exploit their public office a\u00a0second time to make money. And yet, neither of the two witnesses was fired, or demoted: Mr.\u00a0Kourouma, \"previously ad interim director at the Direction des Infrastructures et Transports\u00a0(Infrastructure and Transport Administration) [was] appointed Directeur des Travaux Publics\u00a0et Urbanisme\" (Director of Public Works and Urban Planning) in a Decree of President Alpha\u00a0Cond\u00e9 of March 8, 2011,306 and Mr. Lamizana Cond\u00e9 performs, according to his own affidavit,\u00a0the duties of Inspector of financial and accounting services.307 Similarly, the duties of Mr.\u00a0Cheick Tour\u00e9, one of the other persons called into question in Mr. Fox' report, as Secretary\u00a0General at the Ministry of Transportation, were confirmed by President Alpha Cond\u00e9.308 And\u00a0on June 18, 2014, the President appointed Mr. Mamadou Diallo, who, according to Mr. Fox'\u00a0report, made the alleged payments, as the National Deputy Director of the Merchant Marine\u00a0and Mr. Mohamed Fofana as Director General of the Engineering and Planning Bureau.309\n222. According to the complaint of December 13, 2013, \"at the time of the attribution of the\u00a0Concession Agreement, a certain number of press articles reported deeds of corruption which\u00a0permitted Getma to obtain the concession against competitors with a sum of experience and a\u00a0financial capacity which by far exceeded its own\". Indeed, these articles were produced in this\u00a0arbitration, not by Guinea, but by the Claimants themselves310 to illustrate what they call a\u00a0slanderous press campaign against them and following which Getma International and its CEO\u00a0Richard Talbot filed a complaint311 in Paris (complaint closed with no action). The only press\u00a0article which the Respondent produced concerning the alleged corruption pertaining to Getma\u00a0International's concession appears to be the one of May 6, 2009 and concerns \"suspicions of\u00a0occult dealings to obtain the lifting of the suspension of the Getma concession\"312 (suspension\u00a0ordered on January 14, 2009 and lifted on April 9, 2009). It therefore does not concern the\u00a0actual awarding of the concession.\n223 The Arbitral Tribunal is surprised that, notwithstanding these rumors of corruption, Guinea waited until 2013, five years later, before appointing Mr. Fox/Veracity Worldwide LLC, to\u00a0conduct an investigation into the conditions on which the concession was awarded. It cannot\u00a0explain either why President Alpha Cond\u00e9, who had announced publicly that he wished to\u00a0cancel the concession, did not order an investigation which could have proven the corruption\u00a0and justified the cancellation.\n224. The Arbitral Tribunal can only admit that the State itself did not attach sufficient importance to\u00a0the corruption to launch an investigation or, if it did so, to give it the follow-up it warranted in\u00a0the general interest. Such a complaint is therefore void of all relevance as evidence.\n225. \u00a0What's more, by failing to follow-up on the complaint and to launch the investigation, Guinea\u00a0deprived itself of the possibility it had to prove the alleged corruption clearly and convincingly.\u00a0Not only did the Respondent have the necessary powers for gathering evidence of the alleged\u00a0corruption, it also had the obligation to do so because it is responsible for the proof of the\u00a0corruption it is invoking.\n306 Article from AfricaLog of July 2, 2015 (C-339).\n307 Statement of Mr. Ibrahima Lamizana Cond\u00e9 of December 13,2013 (R-36).\n308 Article from the website Guineenews.org of June 19, 2014 (C-334).\n309 Article from the website Guineenews.org of June 19, 2014 (C-334)\n310 Articles from the website guinee24.com of September 25, 2008 ; of September 27,2008, of October 10,\u00a02008, of October 24, 2008, and October 30 and 31, 2008 (C-130 to C-135).\n311 Claimants' complaint against X with request for damages of October 31, 2008 (C 137).\n312 Article from the website Guin\u00e9a Actu of April 16,2012 (R-30).\n53\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 61 of 173\n226. \u00a0In the absence of any justification on the Respondent's part of its failure to use its powers to\u00a0provide evidence, as the case may be, of corruption, the Arbitral Tribunal sees no possible\u00a0conclusion to draw from this omission other than that the State itself did not believe that the\u00a0proof existed.\n(iii) The \"body of proof\" of corruption\n227. The Respondent insisted greatly on the \"endemic nature\" of the corruption in Guinea, in\u00a0particular in 2008, and spoke of it in its Post-Hearing Memorial, even before processing the\u00a0testimony of Messrs. Kourouma and Cond\u00e9 regarding which it requests that it be \"taken in the\u00a0context of the general corruption which has taken root in Guinea\".313\n228. This Tribunal considers however that this context changes nothing in the value as evidence of\u00a0each of the individual elements of proof submitted to it, which must be ruled on\u00a0independently, unless these elements have an evidentiary weight exceeding a threshold of\u00a0credibility which the Arbitral Tribunal has now found in the two testimonies and the complaint\u00a0of December 13, 2013. Even widespread corruption does not permit one to consider that a\u00a0specific alleged corruption is proven. Inversely, the absence of widespread or endemic\u00a0corruption does not permit one either to neutralize proof of a specific instance of corruption.\u00a0Even if one accepts that corruption is plausible, in a specific case because it is endemic in the\u00a0country, this does not prove that it effectively exists. As the Respondent admits, this is indeed\u00a0only a clue which, although it inspires greater attentiveness to the elements of proof put forth,\u00a0does not suffice to render convincing the elements of proof which are not. Even if this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal acknowledges that it is not to be ruled out that Getma International obtained its\u00a0contract by resorting to corruption, the two witnesses and the complaint alone did not\u00a0convince it that this corruption effectively took place. On the contrary, the State's soliciting of\u00a0testimony (which inspired a positive reaction only on the part of Messrs. Kourouma and\u00a0Lamizana Cond\u00e9, and not the six other \"corrupted parties\" named in Mr. Fox's report) and the\u00a0absence of any follow-up on the complaint prove rather that no corruption occurred in the\u00a0case at issue.\n229. \u00a0Also the allegations of corruption surrounding the granting of the concession to Bollor\u00e9, after\u00a0the termination of Getma's contract, do not suffice as evidence of corruption likely to increase\u00a0the credibility of the testimonies of Messrs. Kourouma and Lamizana Cond\u00e9. On the contrary,\u00a0when the Arbitral Tribunal attempted to test, in questioning these witnesses, the allegedly\u00a0endemic nature of corruption in Guinea, it did not obtain a clear confirmation thereof: Mr.\u00a0Kourouma asserted that he had never received an offer of money in exchange for irregular\u00a0conduct314, which rather indicates the absence of endemic corruption; Mr. Cond\u00e9 for this part\u00a0refused obstinately to answer the question of whether he had been the subject matter of\u00a0(other attempts at) corruption315, which can of course be explained by the desire not to\u00a0incriminate himself further. Questioned directly regarding the endemic nature of corruption in\u00a0this country, he replied that \"perhaps with the newspapers... You know that we were at the\u00a0centre of the most corrupt country during Cont\u00e9's time. That, we acknowledge\".\n230 The Respondent also relied on alleged irregularities in Getma International's offer and the \"guilty passivity\" of the members of the Evaluation Commission who did not take them into\u00a0account; it considers that this attitude can be explained only by corruption. One again, the\n313 MemAAR\u00a7101.\n314 TR III, p. 56:7-9.\n315 TR III, p. 5-39\n54\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 62 of 173\nTribunal wonders why this argument was evoked only after Getma International had begun the CCJA arbitration aimed at obtaining indemnification for the termination of the concession,\u00a0why, if indeed fraud had occurred at the time of the conclusion of the concession, this did not\u00a0constitute the legal \u25a0 grounds for the cancellation of the Concession Agreement.\n231. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal however will verify these alleged irregularities, not only as possible\u00a0indications of corruption, but also from the standpoint of fraud. Indeed, the Respondent\u00a0contends that Getma International's investment is not only vitiated by corruption, but also by\u00a0fraud due to the false statements made by Getma International, at the time of the invitation\u00a0for bids, concerning its references and its experience, its financial situation and the existence\u00a0of a partnership with the MSC group. According to the Respondent, these \"fraudulent tactics\u00a0are contrary to the Guinean laws governing fraud, the general principles pertaining to public\u00a0contracts and the obligation to invest in the respect of Guinean laws\".316\n1 The partnership between MSC and Getma\n232. The parties spoke a great deal about a partnership between Getma International and MSC, but\u00a0in fact, if partnership there was, it was with MSC's subsidiary, Europe Terminal. According to\u00a0the Respondent, Getma International, boasted falsely of having a partnership with MSC and\u00a0appropriated its references wrongfully.\n233. \u00a0It must first of all be established that this partnership was not mentioned as such, in Getma\u00a0International's letter of March 10, 2008, in response to the invitation for expression of interest\u00a0in an extension and the concession of the CT of March 9, 2008. This letter mentioned MSC as\u00a0one of the 11 \"principal client or partner shipowners\"317 and among its three appendices was a\u00a0letter from MSC's Vice President already written on March 5, 2008 regarding \"the MSC group's\u00a0commitment in the context of the concession of the terminal\"318. The Vice President referred\u00a0to \"general agreements binding the MSC group and Getma International on the African West\u00a0coast\" and confirmed that Getma International benefited \"in this capacity from all the\u00a0necessary support which our group can provide to you, and in particular our terminal\u00a0subsidiary\". The letter went on to say:\nIt falls perfectly into the framework of the partnership agreement MSC has with Getma International for Africa.\nThis partnership covers all domains of expertise and eligibility required specifically for this project...\nWe authorize you to mention it in your final bid and to present MSC as Gl's joint and several partner in accordance with the terms of the Bidding Regulations (Article 4). Our shipyard\u00a0would be very interested in your management of this terminal and could envisage stops in\u00a0Conakry port in the future.319\n234. On the day following this letter, March 6, 2008, a Technical Partnership Agreement was signed\u00a0between Getma International and MSC's Europe Terminal subsidiary (C-174, p. 89 - 92), the\u00a0principal terms of which stipulated the following:\n316 C-Mem. \u00a7 242-244.\n317 Getma International's Expression of Interest of March 10, 2008 (C-103), p. 8\n318 Getma International's Expression of Interest of March 10, 2008 (C-103), p. 15\n319 Getma International's Expression of Interest of March 10, 2008 (C-103), p. 15\n55\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 63 of 173\nArt. 1; Definitions: [...]\nRepresentative: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The GETMA INTERNATIONAL Company, represented by\nTRANSAFRICA, representing each of the parties vis-a-vis the Grantor and, as the case may be, third parties;\nTechnical Partner: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The EUROPE TERMINAL Company; [............]\nArt. 2:...with a view to elaborating and submitting the Bid to the Grantor and in the event that the Project were awarded to the parties, to negotiating the Contract with the Grantor\u00a0and carrying out the Project.\nArt. 3: [...]\nIf, at the Grantor's request, the Parties accept the principle of a \"joint and several\" commitment to the Grantor for the realization of the Project, joint and several liability is\u00a0excluded in relations with third parties and for the Parties' mutual relations.\nArt. 4: Generally speaking, the Representative's mission is to represent each of the Parties vis-\u00e0-vis the Grantor and, as the case may be, third parties, as well as the management of\u00a0the Project.\nThe Representative is more particularly responsible for the following tasks: [...]\nArt. 5: Generally speaking, the Technical Partner's mission is to provide technical support in order to permit the realization of the Project.\nThe Technical Partner is responsible more particularly for the following tasks:\n\u2756 Engineering studies (sizing of infrastructures, sampling, etc.)\n\u2756 Traffic and traffic projection analysis\n\u2756 Proposal regarding the required handling equipment\n\u2756 Elaboration of the documents necessary for the Project\nThe Technical Partner authorizes the Representative to avail itself of its technical support for the account and on behalf of the Parties.\nArt. 7: The Agreement [...] shall remain in force:\n- \u00a0In the case of the non-acceptance of the Bid, until the date of the Grantor's notice of the\u00a0rejection of the Bid;\n- \u00a0in the case of the acceptance of the Bid, until the signing of the contract between the\u00a0Grantor and GETMA INTERNATIONAL.\n235. On July 28, 2008, it was this technical partnership agreement which Getma International\u00a0appended to \"the NCT Necotrans Group's Getma International/Transafrica SA technical bid320\".\u00a0This bid (the mere title of which already creates ambiguity as to the bidder's identity\") refers\u00a0to its Europe Terminal partnership in Chapter 1.1, which provides a \"general presentation of\u00a0the bidder and its partner\" in the following terms:\nGETMA INTERNATIONAL is a network of agencies established essentially on the Atlantic coast of Africa, specialized in the shipping professions: forwarding..., cargo handling, the\n320 Technical proposal (C-174).\n56\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 64 of 173\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n236.\nI\n  \nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n236.\nI\n  \n237.\n  \n237.\n  \nmanagement of Container Terminals, transit, post-shipment to landlocked countries, warehousing and international logistics, (p. 5)\nGetma International is a container handler in the ports of the Dakar, Conakry (via the subsidiary TransAfrica S.A.), San Pedro, [...] and Luanda.

(Page 6-7).\nGetma International's primary ship owner clients or partners in the domain of container handling are:\n\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MAERSK LINE, world leader\no \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MSC, second worldwide (p. 8)\n[\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0]\nGetma International is the privileged partner of Europe Terminal, subsidiary of the group Mediterranean Shipping Company (MST), with which the global port handling contract was\u00a0signed for the principal ports of the African West Coast. In this capacity, GETMA\u00a0INTERNATIONAL enjoys the full support of Europe Terminal. Its references for putting into\u00a0place and managing a Container Terminal are presented below. The technical partnership\u00a0agreement binding Getma International and Europe Terminal, is appended hereto in\u00a0appendix OT2.321 (p. 9)\nThe bid adds this to page 10 under the heading \"Contractual Partner\":\nEurope Terminal is a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) shipyard and 50% partner of MSC Home Terminal S.A. in Antwerp. This company operates and exploits\u00a0Container Terminals in Belgium (Antwerp), in Spain (Valencia), in Italy (Naples), in France (Le\u00a0Havre and Marseilles) and in Brazil with the recent creation of a Navigantes terminal\u00a0(southeast coast of Brazil). The total annual container traffic volume (EVP) transiting\u00a0through the various terminals is well above 5 million EVP.\nThe performances of several European terminals managed and operated in full and under the direct sole control of Europe Terminal (among the 30 Container Terminals throughout\u00a0the world in which MSC is either the sole shareholder, or a partner) make this entity one of\u00a0the European leaders in the management of Container Terminals. [...]\nThe technical - commercial strategy of the Mediterranean Shipping Company Group (MSC) and a brief presentation of Europe Terminal are appended hereto in appendices OT3 and\u00a0OT4.322\nAt first sight, a partnership therefore existed between Getma International and Europe Terminal, which required that Europe Terminal assist Getma International in negotiating the\u00a0contract and carrying out the project, and, \"in the event that the parties were the successful\u00a0bidders\", to negotiate the contract with the Grantor and to carry out the Project. The Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal is aware that such a modus operandi in the event of the grouping together of two or\u00a0several partners for project is commonplace: the partners first commit to cooperation during\u00a0the pre-contract phase and then specify their cooperation for the execution in greater detail,\u00a0after the contract has been awarded to them.\n  \n321 Our underlining\n322 Appendices OT 3 and OT 4 were commercial brochures of MSC and Europe Terminal, resp\n57\n  \n  \nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 65 of 173\n238. \u00a0The impression which the expression of interest and the bid, in combination with their\u00a0attached documents, gave however, does not correspond to reality because Getma\u00a0International expressed its interest in its own name only and not in the name of a group\u00a0comprised of itself and its \"partner\".\n239. \u00a0Indeed, article 4 of the Bidding Regulations stipulated the following:\nThis bid is reserved to the selected candidates following the call for expression of interest. The term \"bidder\" used below applies strictly to the selected candidates. It is understood\u00a0that no grouping together of the selected candidates following the call for expression of\u00a0interest is henceforth authorized.323\n240. Getma International therefore knew - must have known - from the outset of the competitive\u00a0bidding for the Concession that Europe Terminal could not be the joint and several bidder if\u00a0both partners did not express their interest in the invitation for bids together and formally, as\u00a0a group. Without a joint expression of interest permitting a preselection of Europe Terminal\u00a0also, Europe Terminal could never become one of the successful bidders in the project,\u00a0although the technical partnership agreement envisaged such a scenario324.\n241. \u00a0Moreover, Getma International, by not including Europe Terminal in the expression of interest,\u00a0disregarded the terms of Mr. Aponte's letter of March 5, 2008, quoted above. This letter\u00a0authorizes Getma International to \"present MSC as joint and several partner of Getma\u00a0International in accordance with the terms of the Bidding Regulations (Article 4)\"325. Getma\u00a0International did not respect this authorization procedure when it expressed it interest alone,\u00a0and not on behalf of the partnership. This implies that the technical partnership agreement\u00a0which was signed the day following Mr. Aponte's letter of support, could not come into effect\u00a0if the expression of interest originated solely in Getma International and not also Europe\u00a0terminal. Indeed, as already stipulated above, the agreement itself envisaged that the partners\u00a0would become successful bidders.\n242. Article 7 of the technical partnership agreement stipulates that the agreement would end at\u00a0the time of the signing of the contract between Getma International and the Grantor, namely,\u00a0precisely at the time that Getma International would need Europe Terminal for executing its\u00a0contractual obligations for the building of the new terminal326. Although it is possible that the\u00a0parties to the technical partnership agreement envisaged the conclusion of a new, more\u00a0detailed contract at the time of the signing of the agreement with the Grantor, as is generally\u00a0done in this type of partnership, this intention is not expressed and, according to the wording\u00a0of article 7, the technical partnership agreement - in the event that it had come into effect\u00a0notwithstanding the failure to respect article 4 of the regulations on which Mr. Aponte had\u00a0insisted - ended at the time of the signing of the Concession Agreement, namely on September\u00a022, 2008. The file therefore contains no indication establishing that a new contract was\u00a0effectively signed between the partners after the awarding of the concession to Getma\u00a0International. Nor did Getma International prove, or even claim, that it had called upon Europe\n323 Bidding Regulations (C-108) p. 13.\n324 Article 2 confirms that if their offer prevails, both parties become \u00ab successful bidders \u00bb and Articles 4 and 5\u00a0concerning the assignment of roles between them in this case also imply a contractual commitment on the part\u00a0of the Technical Partner to the Grantor and not at all a subcontracting relation.\n325 Our underlining\n326 The CCJA Tribunal quoted this clause but without discussing it : it simply added that article broadened the\u00a0purpose of the Agreement beyond the elaboration of the bid (C-50 \u00a7 134) and does not appear to have realized\u00a0that this required that Europe Terminal be a co-successive bidder.\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 66 of 173\nTerminal for performing engineering studies or traffic analyses. On the contrary, it recognized that Europe Terminal did not provide services to Getma International for the execution of the\u00a0Concession Agreement.327 If \"other subsidiaries in the MSC group\" intervened in the execution\u00a0according to Mr. Qu\u00e9rel, such interventions were limited to the purchase of equipment and\u00a0the opening of a line to Conakry, as ship owner.328 In any event, if the partnership had been\u00a0extended beyond the award to Getma International, it would not have been joint and several\u00a0with respect to the Grantor as the bid and the Agreement implied.\n243. \u00a0In short, (i) this agreement - in the event that it had entered into force notwithstanding the\u00a0\"obsolete\" expression of interest - existed only very briefly and was not renewed; (ii), even\u00a0during this short period, the partnership was not joint and several, and (iii) that which\u00a0remained after the awarding of the concession to Getma International was merely a \"general\"\u00a0partnership, which envisaged the possible direct or indirect holding of 50% of Getma\u00a0International's capital, as well as the possibility of port handling services in Africa and a joint\u00a0participation in the port projects in Africa.\n244. \u00a0In the presence of these observations, it is up to the Tribunal to determine whether the\u00a0partnership was false, as Guinea alleges.\n245. The Claimants contend that these references to a partner are warranted by a Memorandum of\u00a0Understanding (MoU), signed on November 9, 2005 between the Necotrans group and the\u00a0MSC group, defining the major lies of the cooperation between the two groups concerning\u00a0port activities in Africa, in the context of which the e.a. Technical partnership agreement of\u00a0March 6, 2008, was concluded, but which was much broader and covered all port operations.\u00a0According to the Claimants, this MoU however, is confidential331, which was confirmed in the\u00a0response of MSC's CEO, Mr. Aponte of April 10, 2013332 at the request of Mr. Talbot, CEO of\u00a0Necotrans, to authorize communication of the MoU in the framework of the CCJA\u00a0arbitration333. In this same letter, Mr. Aponte confirmed that \"it is in the framework of our\u00a0agreements, including, in particular our participation in the capital of Getma International that\u00a0you made a bid for the concession of the Conakry Container Terminal, and that in this context,\u00a0you have included in your bid our partnership agreement, my letter of March 5, 2008, as well\u00a0as the references of Europe terminal\".\n246. The Arbitral Tribunal has ascertained that the information as its disposal, concerning the MoU,\u00a0MSC's direct participation in Getma International's capital and the technical partnership\u00a0agreement prove that a partnership effectively existed between Getma International (or at\u00a0least its parent company Necotrans) and MSC or at least Europe terminal). The file contains no\u00a0trace of any complaint on the part of MSC regarding the fact that Getma International had not\u00a0involved it as a full partner in the expression of interest or in the bid. On the contrary, Mr.\u00a0Aponte's letter to Necotrans of April 10, 2013, confirms that MSC maintained its support to\u00a0Getma International, also in the context of the arbitration proceedings, following the\u00a0termination of the contract, and that, notwithstanding the fact that MSC or Europe Terminal\u00a0had not become a co-successful bidder of the concession, another form of cooperation for this\u00a0operation was certainly envisaged. One can accept as fact that Getma International could at all\u00a0times call upon Europe terminal's assistance and would have probably obtained it, on the\n327 Repl. \u00a7 176\n328 TR I, p. 54:18-55:20.\n331 Repl; \u00a7\u00a7 150-158 and TR I, p. 58:11-21.\n332 Letter of April 10, 2013 from Mediterranean Shipping Compny S.A. to NTC Necotrans (C-346).\n333 Letter of January 3,2013 from Necotrans to Mediterranean Shipping Company (C-347).\n59\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 67 of 173\ncondition that the two companies come to an agreement as to the terms and conditions. In this sense, the two companies were partners.\n247. \u00a0However, this partnership was a commercial one only and the file contains no evidence that\u00a0Europe Terminal was effectively bound to Getma International legally. As soon as it was\u00a0excluded from the expression of interest and above all after the awarding of the concession to\u00a0Getma International alone, Europe Terminal was no longer bound by the Technical Partnership\u00a0Agreement. Furthermore, and above all, there was no joint and several liability between the\u00a0two partners and Europe Terminal made no commitment to the Grantor. MSC's participation\u00a0in Getma International's capital created no commitment beyond the amount of this financial\u00a0participation and in any event did not give Guinea a second debtor for the contractual\u00a0obligations made to it by Getma International. In his letter of April 10, 2013, Mr. Aponte did\u00a0not confirm either that his group had made a concrete commitment to Getma International for\u00a0the execution of its obligations to Guinea - beyond that which was covered by the Technical\u00a0Partnership Agreement of March 6, 2008. During his deposition, Mr. Qu\u00e9rel, who was\u00a0Secretary General of NCT Necotrans from 2008 to 2010, recognized for that matter that in the\u00a0Necotrans group, they were aware that by responding alone and in its own name to the\u00a0expression of interest, Getma International had excluded Europe Terminal from becoming a\u00a0joint and several partner.334\n248. Hence, could Getma International, aware that there was no concrete commitment on Europe\u00a0Terminal's part for the concession, refer to Mr. Aponte's letter of March 5, 2008 in its\u00a0expression of interest, and join the Technical Partnership Agreement of May 6, 2008 to the bid\u00a0it handed in on July 28, 2008? At first glance, the answer is no.\n249. \u00a0Mr. Qu\u00e9rel was questioned during the hearing on this incoherent attitude, in particular,\u00a0following his statement that \"the method of the bidding as a joint and several group was\u00a0abandoned following the ascertainment that Getma International, and it alone, had been\u00a0preselected\".335 . According to his recollection, this \"pertained, according to the explanation\u00a0provided by our local teams, to the fact the file had been withdrawn, on behalf of Getma\u00a0International\"336. Therefore, he appears to be saying that the two partners confronted a fait\u00a0accompli, following the withdrawal of the file and the expression of interest in the name of\u00a0Getma International. And yet, as the Respondent pointed out337, this statement does not\u00a0comply with the statement made before the CCJA Tribunal according to which the joint\u00a0undertaking was abandoned following a decision of the shareholders of both companies, in\u00a0particular because they did not deem it was necessary to create one more joint entity while\u00a0they were already together in the shareholding of Getma International338. Questioned again\u00a0regarding this contradiction, during the hearing of this Arbitral Tribunal, the witness was\u00a0repeated this explanation, Getma had withdrawn its file and the teams launched the file, the\u00a0shareholders were informed and then decided \"not to enter into the legal mechanism\",\u00a0because the partnership still existed, but not according to that which had been envisaged at\u00a0the outset339.\n250. The Arbitral Tribunal can understand that there was a misunderstanding between \"the local\u00a0teams at the time, who, according to Mr. Qu\u00e9rel, withdrew the file locally and launched the\n334 TRI, p. 62:1-7.\n335 Our underlining.\n336 G.

But when questioned further, Mr. Qu\u00e9rel answered that\u00a0\"Getma International's staff is not necessarily aware of the complete agreement between the\u00a0N\u00e9cotrans group and the MSC group\"3'10. This comment may be true for the local teams, but\u00a0not for Mr. J F. Ollivier, director general of Getma International who signed the cover letter for\u00a0the expression of interest341 in Paris and who, one can presume, was aware of the intention to\u00a0submit a joint bid. Even if, like the local teams, he was indeed not aware of his intention and\u00a0believed that the expression of interest concerned Getma International alone, one cannot\u00a0explain how Mr. Aponte's letter of March 5, 2008 could have been appended to the expression\u00a0of interest, although precisely he had sent it in his capacity as director general of Getma\u00a0International-Paris\" authorizing it to introduce MSC as joint and several partner. One does not\u00a0understand either how the signature page of the expression of interest (p. 14/19) could have\u00a0mentioned as appendix 1 \"MSC's commitment\" without alerting the staff in charge, whoever\u00a0they be, of the fact that this commitment necessitated that the partners be introduced as a\u00a0group.\n251. Another contradiction exists between the following statements:\nGetma International's staff is not necessarily aware of the complete agreement between the Necotrans Group and the MSC Group.342 and\nThen, in the production of exhibits, our teams asked MSC who, among them, had written this letter.\"343\n252. \u00a0How also can one explain that Mr. Qu\u00e9rel, over a period of time of several minutes, presented\u00a0first the staff, as ignorant of all that which concerns the cooperation agreements between\u00a0their management/ shareholders and MSC, and then as persons who were even taking the\u00a0initiative of soliciting MSC who \"on their own\"344 prepare the disputed letter authorizing the\u00a0presentation of MSC as a joint and several partner? The Claimants, apparently aware of the\u00a0weakness of this testimony, the responded in their Post-Hearing Memorial that Mr. Qu\u00e9rel had\u00a0not been involved in the expression of interest.345 This can only increase the doubt concerning\u00a0his credibility regarding this topic.\n253. The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced by these fluctuating explanations, which are\u00a0contradictory and sometimes inaccurate. Indeed, it is not the identity of the party withdrawing\u00a0the file from the administration which determines who may express its interest and, after its\u00a0preselection, submit a bid. It ensues from article 4 of the regulations that groups may\u00a0participate in the procedure on the condition that they be preselected. To do so, all they had\u00a0to do was to file the expression of interest in the name of the two companies. The cover letter\u00a0on the expression of interest was received by the APC on March 28, 2008346, namely three\u00a0weeks after Mr. Aponte's letter of March 5 and the signing of the partnership agreement of\n340 TR I, p. 61:28-29.\n341 Letter of March 28, 2008 from Getma International to the General Management of the Port Authority of\u00a0Conakry (R-27 and C-16).\n342 TR I, p. 61:28-29.\n343 TR I, p. 61:23-24.\n344 The term appears to contradict the fact that MSC was approached by Getma International.\n345 Mem; AAC \u00a7 242.\n346 See the handwritten date of receipt on Getma International's letter to the General Management of the Port\u00a0Authority of Conakry (R-27 and C-16).\n61\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 69 of 173\nMarch 6, 2008 This lapse of time was perfect for making sure that the teams and the staff on the one hand, and the shareholders on the other, were in tune.\n254. \u00a0In their Post Hearing Memorial, the Claimants even attempted to blame the Respondent for\u00a0the situation, alleging that \"[...] if [...] the fact that MSC authorized Getma to introduce it as\u00a0joint and several partner in its final bid had played the crucial role purported by Guinea in\u00a0APC's preselection of Getma, it should have (also) preselected MSC. [As footnote no. 116:] by\u00a0failing to do so, it put an end once and for all - given the substance of article 4 of the [...]\u00a0Regulations - to any possibility that Getma come forth as a formal joint and several group with\u00a0MSC\"347. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot accept this rejection of responsibility on the Claimants'\u00a0part: they alone chose, with full knowledge of the regulations, if and how, with or without a\u00a0partner, one of them would submit a bid. If Getma International bid alone, it was not up to the\u00a0Grantor, who was in its turn also bound by its own regulations, to attract a third-party, as\u00a0bidder and force it into a group with another bidder.\n255. Therefore, it is not proven that Getma International effectively intended to bid as a group with\u00a0Europe Terminal, and that it was effectively due to poor communication between the Getma\u00a0International staff on-site and the shareholders in Paris that Getma International acted alone\u00a0in the bidding procedure.\n256. Mr. Qu\u00e9rel was unable to explain why, notwithstanding the abandonment of the joint and\nseveral partnership, Getma International nonetheless enclosed MSC's letter in its bid, unless he was saying that the letter was, in addition to a joint and several commitment, \"also a\u00a0commercial expression\" and that MSC \"like the other ship owners, [......] was confirming\ncommercially its interest in the project\".348\n257. Getma International's bid makes no secret of its dependency on other companies of the\u00a0N\u00e9cotrans group and also on other partners: it refers numerous times to various Getma\u00a0International partners and mentions them almost each time that Getma International,\u00a0N\u00e9cotrans and the group are mentioned; the bid says nothing which could lead one to believe\u00a0that one of them is jointly and severally committed with Getma International regarding the\u00a0concession project.\n258. The situation is different however, for Europe terminal: in (Chapter 1.1 of) its bid Getma\u00a0International introduced itself and its partner349, calling it its \"CONTRACTUAL PARTNER\"350,\u00a0described in its chapter 1.2. the commitments of Getma International and its partner, Europe\u00a0Terminal, concerning the granting of a concession to the Conakry CT and its extension351, and\u00a0confirmed that \"our group and its partners pledge to take on the work of the refurbishment of\u00a0the existing terminal352\" and \"the work of building the extension to the existing terminal\"353.\u00a0However, these statements rely on only one MoU between N\u00e9cotrans and MSC which was not\u00a0attached to the bid (nor could it be produced in this arbitration). If the MoU made it possible\u00a0to call Europe Terminal (like MSC and all its subsidiaries) a partner (in the commercial sense),\n347 Mem; AAC \u00a7 228\n62\n  \n  \n348 TR I, p.62:16-18.\n349 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 26\n350 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 31\n351 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 32\n352 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 59\n353 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 59\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 70 of 173\nthe Arbitral Tribunal sees no justification for the confirmation of commitments on the partner's part and above all for calling Europe terminal, a contractual partner35'1.\n259. There is no doubt that by appending the technical partnership agreement with Europe\u00a0Terminal355 to its bid, Getma International wanted to lend credibility to its reference to a\u00a0\"contractual\" partner. But as noted above, the condition for permitting this agreement to\u00a0come into effect, in particular, a joint bid, was not met. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant,\u00a0that Guinea cannot confuse a partnership with a joint and several group and \"that it is possible\u00a0to have a partnership without having a joint, several group''.356 However, a \"contractual\u00a0partner\" implies a contract between the partners and the existence of a contract binding\u00a0Europe Terminal has not been proven.\n260. \u00a0Furthermore, even if, in its bid Getma International did not declare that it had a \"joint and\u00a0several\" partnership with Europe terminal, the use of this term in article 3 of the technical\u00a0partnership agreement (p. 90/254) quoted above, could only reinforce the desired impression\u00a0of a contractual partnership.\n261. The following question is that of determining whether Getma International had the intention\u00a0of misleading Guinea, by presenting the bid in this manner, and if Guinea was misled.\n262. The Arbitral Tribunal points out beforehand that the \"deliberate vagueness\" of the expression\u00a0of interest and of Getma International's bid extends also to the identity of the bidder itself: the\u00a0letter in which Getma International transmitted the expression of interest to the APC states\u00a0that the expression of interest is that \"of the GETMA INTERNATIONAL group\"357 and contains\u00a0as an attachment, among others, \"the NECOTRANS group's introductory folder\"; the\u00a0expression of interest itself mentions that \"GETMA INTERNATIONAL and the NCT N\u00e9cotrans\u00a0group pledge...\"358; and the first page of technical bid mentions that it is the \"bid of the NCT\u00a0N\u00e9cotrans / Getma International/ Transafrica group\".359\n263. \u00a0Notwithstanding these multiple references to the group, the file contains no evidence that\u00a0other companies in the N\u00e9cotrans group, other than Getma International, made a\u00a0commitment to the Respondent. Even Getma International Investissements, which was\u00a0created by Getma International and NCT N\u00e9cotrans on October 31, 2008 and in its turn created\u00a0the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Exploitation Guin\u00e9enne (STCC) on November 20, 2008, did not make a\u00a0commitment in addition to those of Getma International. It simply replaced Getma\u00a0International for meeting the contractual obligation it had taken on with respect to the\u00a0Respondent, namely that of creating, within three months following the signing of the\u00a0Agreement, an operating company under Guinean law which it controlled.360\n354 Our underlining.\n355 Technical proposal (C-174), p. 89-92.\n356 Mem; AAC \u00a7241.\n357 Letter of March 28, 2008 from Getma International to the General Management of he Conkry Port\u00a0Authority (C-16 and R-27); our underlining.\n358 Getma International's expression of interest to the PAC (C-103), p 11; our underlining.\n359 Technical proposal (C-174); our underlining.\n360 Concession Agreement (C-ll) art. 7.1. See also \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 54 above and footnote no. 14. According to the\u00a0Claimants' opening brief, it was decided that Getma International Investissements would be created \"as an\u00a0intermediate structure [{...] which would therefore have direct access to the financing of the N\u00e9cotrans group's\u00a0holding company\" (\u00a756). The Arbitral Tribunal wonders however why a Getma International subsidiary would\u00a0have had more direct access to this financing than Getma International itself and suspects that other grounds\u00a0were at play.\n63\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 71 of 173\n264. \u00a0However, it is not the group's commitments which are called into question, but rather those of\u00a0Getma International's \"contractual partner\u201d whom Getma International involved in its bid in a\u00a0manner not warranted by circumstance. This Arbitral Tribunal deems that it \"embellished\" the\u00a0facts more than commercially and that it at least verged on, if it did not exceed, the limit\u00a0between a favorable, commercially skillful presentation and a misleading one. Even if one\u00a0does not take account of the absence of joint and several liability, Getma International has\u00a0always presented Europe Terminal as a \"contractual partner\" while there was no contract\u00a0binding the two companies, and in the arbitration it attempted to justify this presentation by\u00a0relying on an Mol) between the parent companies of the commercial partners which was\u00a0anything but concrete.\n265. \u00a0In any event, the Respondent, on its side, could not have been unaware that a single company,\u00a0and not a group, had expressed its interest, submitted the bid and subsequently negotiated\u00a0and signed the Agreement, and that its only co-contractor was Getma International and not\u00a0Europe Terminal. The file contains no trace of a request by the Respondent for a commitment\u00a0on the part of Europe Terminal. This can be explained by the Respondent's confidence in the\u00a0statements made by Getma International concerning its partnership. It is difficult to\u00a0determine whether this trust was deserved.\n266. And yet, to conclude that fraud was committed, not only must one party have made a false\u00a0statement; this statement must also concern a substantial element and the other party must\u00a0have effectively been misled.\n267. \u00a0However it is judicious not to rule on these aspects without taking into account\u00a0simultaneously, the Respondent's second charge regarding the bid.\n2. The references in the bid\n268. The call for an expression of interest in the extension and the granting of a concession on the\u00a0CT specified that it was intended \"exclusively for candidates with long, solid experience in the\u00a0design, financing, realization, operation and maintenance of CT. Only candidates who are legal\u00a0entities or groups will be admissible\". It is not easy to determine whether Getma\u00a0International's response to this call for bids, confirms this long, solid experience in very vast\u00a0and diverse activities. Getma International wrote the following:\nGETMA INTERNATIONAL wishes to become lastingly involved in the region through the granting of a concession for certain port activities, and among them the Conakry Container\u00a0Terminal is one of its priority projects, (p. 1)\n[..........1\nbeginning in 1989, the GETMA network vested itself in port operations and land logistics [.........]\nalong the West African Coast\n[.........] Industrial project and oil related logistics gave the NCT N\u00e9cotrans group, the dimension it has today.\nThis dimension was reinforced in 2007 by the creation of the \"NCT Infrastructure - logistique\" company specialized in land, infrastructure projects (rail, roads, ports and airports), (p. 2)\n269. \u00a0Getma International therefore does not at all claim to have the required experience. Phrases\u00a0such as:\nSpecialized in Africa, the NCT Necotrans group rapidly diversified around the domains of international transport and multimodal logistics.\nor\n64\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 72 of 173\nin 1992, the NCT Necotrans group seized the opportunity of diversifying itself by building an automobile distribution network\nare certainly proof of a spirit of initiative and ambition, but in fact do not say that Getma International or the group to which it belongs, has the required experience \"in the design, the\u00a0financing, realization, operation and maintenance of CTs\". The letter is commercial and it must\u00a0be read attentively if one is to understand what it truly states and does not state.\n. Further down, we read that \"NCT Infrastructure et Logistique is the last subsidiary created by NCT Necotrans to meet the needs of its own network and its subsidiaries, railroad networks,\u00a0local authorities, or any other company the goal of which is to perform all studies, expert\u00a0research, audits in all the domains linked to logistics and land, sea and air transportation. This\u00a0new subsidiary, is specialized in infrastructure projects such as they are to be found in the port\u00a0and railroad domains, but also concerning mining or oil logistics and falls into a logic of\u00a0complementarity with the various subsidiaries of the NCT Necotrans group in order to best\u00a0meet the logistic and operational challenges of these various structures\" (C-103) (p. 5-6).\n. An attentive reader understands that ali the group's experience in the design, realization and maintenance of infrastructures could be found at NCT Infrastructure et Logistique, which had\u00a0existed on March 10, 2008 for no more than one year and whose services at the time were\u00a0\"complementary\" to those of the group's other subsidiaries, namely that it operated primarily\u00a0within the group. And yet, the document continues with reassuring phrases such as:\nNecotrans aata, AMT SA and Vopak-AMT are all vectors of growth in traffic, whether it be via the transport commission or through major industrial and mining projects. [.........]\nGetma International's experience and professionalism in the management, development, operation and development of port activities are a token of success in the conduct of the\u00a0project, (p. 12)\n. By using such language, one skillfully creates the impression that this large group in fact does possess all the required experience, at least for operating a CT. An inattentive reader can be\u00a0misled... And this was undoubtedly the goal. And yet, the letter does not contain any false\u00a0statements: when it says that, for studies, Getma International can count on the Inros-Lackner\u00a0AG engineering firm, the Gottwald Port Technology engineering firm and, in the third place,\u00a0NCT Infrastructure et Logistique (p. 11), one understands that the role of Getma International\u00a0and NCT Infrastructure et Logistique in this aspect of the concession will be minimal. Even if\u00a0the letter adds that \"The expertise of NCT Infrastructure et Logistique is a true asset in this\u00a0context for the development of intermodality, in particular concerning land development and\u00a0service in Guinea's hinterlands\" (p.ll), it is nonetheless a fact that the company has\u00a0accumulated this expertise in no more than one year.\n. On the other hand, financing is not at all mentioned in the long list of \"Getma International's commitment concerning the taking-on of the Container Terminal concession in the\u00a0Autonomous Port of Conakry and its future extension\" (p. 11-14).\nThe expression of interest, and its presentation of the group achieved the desired effect, given that on April 7, 2008, the director general of the Autonomous Port of Conakry (APC) informed\u00a0Transafrica as Getma International's representative, that it had been preselected and that it\u00a0could submit a bid. Hardly any mention has been made in this arbitration of the preselect on\u00a0process, but one can surmise, due to the fact that the expression of interest was sent to the\u00a0APC and that it was the APC which responded thereto, that this preselection was performed by\n65\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 73 of 173\nthe APC. The Respondent did not allege that the APC was also corrupted365 and the Arbitral Tribunal infers therefrom that, if Getma International was selected, this was not due to\u00a0corruption, but to the fact that the presentation of the group had been deemed satisfactory, at\u00a0least for the purposes of the preselection.\n275. \u00a0Nonetheless, the APC's decision to preselect G.l. is contestable. Even Mr. Qu\u00e9rel admitted,\u00a0after lengthy questioning by counsel for the Respondent, that Getma International had\u00a0\"neither designed, nor realized, nor financed Container Terminals in 2008\"366 and that it would\u00a0have been possible that it not pass preselection stage367. This question revealed the point to\u00a0which the commercial aspect and ambition can outweigh stringency in bidding procedures.\u00a0Initially, Mr. Qu\u00e9rel defended the expression of interest, insisting on Getma International's\u00a0financing of \"port terminals\" in Cameroon, namely a \"dock\"368, on the fact that \"we369\u00a0financed, operated, realized, maintained areas dedicated to containers, but did not have the\u00a0notion of terminals\"370 and on the fact that the \"Container Terminal\" notion did not exist in\u00a02008 in Senegal, which implies that Getma International's financing of a \"port operation,\" in\u00a0Dakar could also meet the criterion of experience.371\n276. The question then arises of determining whether Getma International's expression of interest\u00a0constitutes fraud. The Arbitral Tribunal deems that this is not the case. It is commonplace that,\u00a0in practice, contractors who do not meet all of the conditions of admissibility participate in the\u00a0preselection, in the hope of getting through notwithstanding their lack of qualifications. One\u00a0obvious motivation is to open up new markets. This precisely is the reason for which calls for\u00a0bids are preceded by a preselection. The awarding authority may be more or less strict in\u00a0evaluating the criteria it itself has established (on the condition of course that it not\u00a0discriminate against the other competitors). The Arbitral Tribunal considers that, in this\u00a0concrete case, Getma International was not guilty of fraud and the tactics it used in its\u00a0expression of interest were nothing but commonplace commercial tactics and were not\u00a0fraudulent. In any event, its preselection can be explained otherwise than by corruption.\n277. \u00a0Getma International's technical bid is more explicit concerning the references. Article 11.2.1 of\u00a0the Bidding Regulations demanded explicitly the following technical data:\no The BIDDER'S experience and references in the design, financing, realization, operation and management of Container Terminals;\no Consolidated global traffic reports per port and for all the terminals managed on behalf of and under the responsibility of the BIDDER for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007;\n\u2022 \u00a0Presentation of the BIDDER'S activities and references in the domains of handling, the\u00a0operation, maintenance, design, financing and realization of Container Terminals, including\u00a0the following information:\n\u2022 \u00a0\u00a0[\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0]\n365 Notwithstanding the fact that one of the press articles concerning the awarding of the concession to Getma\u00a0International, produced by the Claimants to prove the slanderous nature of the campaign organized, according\u00a0to them, by competitors, mentions that the PAC's director, Mr. Morlaye Camara, also received money from\u00a0Getma International, in particular the sum. of \u20ac 300,000. Articles in guinee24.com of Oct. 10, 2008, Oct. 24,\u00a02008, Oct. 31, 2008 (C-132 and C-134).\n366 TR I, p.63:17-p.64:34\n367 TR I, p.64:39.\n368 TR I, p.64:1-10.\n369 The Arbitral Tribunal notes the use of the term \"we\" which does not indicate whether the financing,\u00a0operating and reafzing party was effectively Getma International or another company in the MSC group.\n370 TR I, p.64:13-14.\n371 TR I, p. 64:20-26.\n66\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 74 of 173\n\u2022 List of the ports for which the design, financing and realization of the terminals was handled by the BIDDER...\no Proof of the capacities for performing the study, the planning and the monitoring of the work for the construction of the Container Terminal;\n\u00bb an indication of possible TECHNICAL PARTNERS and financial partners for the implementation of the concession.372\n278. \u00a0We noted therefore that the references requested are those of the bidder itself, and that the\u00a0partners were simply to be mentioned.\n279. Chapter 1.3, of the bid submitted by Getma International comprises \"the BIDDER'S experience\u00a0and references in the design, financing, realization, operation and management of Container\u00a0Terminals\".373 . It consists in a chart which enumerates ten Container Terminals, including\u00a0Antwerp, Le Havre, Los Angeles and Marseilles, as well as the date of their creation, their\u00a0surface areas in square meters, the length of their docks and the fact that MSC operates in\u00a0these terminals. One cannot infer therefrom, what is or was Getma International's role in the\u00a0design, financing, realization, operation or management of these various terminals. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal understands that these are perhaps terminals in which one of these\u00a0subsidiaries of the Necotrans group rendered services to MSC or perhaps terminals financed or\u00a0built by Europe Terminal. In any event, they are not Container Terminals which the bidder,\u00a0namely, Getma International, designed, financed and or built. And yet, the experience\u00a0requested had to cover all of these aspects, not all for each of the terminals, but at least for\u00a0one of them.\n280. When the Arbitral Tribunal questioned the Claimants regarding these references, one of their\u00a0attorneys answered that \"at the time 50% of Getma International was owned by the MSC\u00a0group. Therefore, Getma International was a sister company of all the companies in the MSC\u00a0group\" and that \"it was a joint 50/50 company with two families\". Thus, the President of the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the \"references which were provided are not only those, or\u00a0are not those [...] of the bidder, including in the technical legal sense; in other words, Getma\u00a0International, but they are also or exclusively references of the bidder's shareholders\", which\u00a0was confirmed.374\n281. This response is therefore not satisfactory. Indeed, although a shareholder can very well form\u00a0a group with its subsidiary and if the two can then submit bids together as a group, a\u00a0shareholder is not automatically a bidder and its references cannot be mentioned as being\u00a0those of the bidder. Counsel for the Claimants confirmed during the hearing that \"indications\u00a0of references indicate very clearly what company manages them\"375, but the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0considers that this statement is incorrect: the chart on page 15 of the technical bid mentions\u00a0for the 10 Container Terminals only what lines are operated on each of them (MSC), but does\u00a0not state that it was also MSC which designed and built them.376\n282. \u00a0The following chapter of the technical bid is entitled: \"1.4. Consolidated global traffic per port\u00a0and for all the terminals managed on behalf and under the responsibility of the Bidder377\u00a0(2005, 2006, 2007)\". The Arbitral Tribunal can only infer that Getma International manages\n372 Implementation of the Concession (C-108), p.8-16. Our capital letters.\n373 Technical proposal (C-174) p. 36.

However, Mr. Querel admitted clearly that these are MSC references378.\n283. \u00a0Chapter 1.5 \"Presentation of the Bidder's379 activities and references (handling, operations,\u00a0maintenance, design, financing, building)\" contains a simple reference to appendices OT 1 and\u00a0OT 4, the first being a description of \"Getma International's network in Africa\" consisting in its\u00a0presence380 in 14 different countries on the continent, and the second being a presentation of\u00a0Europe Terminal (including its \"home terminal\" in Antwerp). If the Arbitral Tribunal rejects the\u00a0notion that a bidder's shareholder can, due to the simple fact of its shareholder's capacity,\u00a0become a bidder itself, the production of appendix OT 4 was not warranted. The Tribunal\u00a0notes, incidentally, the same confusion between Getma International, the sole shareholder,\u00a0and Europe terminal, a MSC subsidiary, when the financial statements of Europe Terminal for\u00a0the years 2005, 2006 and 2007 were attached, with those of Getma International, to the\u00a0financial bid, representing almost 90 pages in this 230-and page document.381\n284. \u00a0Chapter 1.6 then follows with the \"List of the ports for which the design, financing and\u00a0realization of the terminals were performed by the Bidder382. Here, the bid does not refer to\u00a0\"Container Terminals\", but to \"terminals\" only.383 The chart mentions four of them, regarding\u00a0which one understands, thanks to a comparison with appendices OT 1 and 4, that only the\u00a0first, to be built in 2008-2013 in Luanda, has a link - the intensity of which is unknown - with\u00a0Getma International, inasmuch as it is a \"shareholder of the 5M company, in charge of the\u00a0construction, management and operation of the Luanda Container Terminal\" and that the\u00a0three others are Europe Terminal references. In short, Getma International had one single\u00a0reference work, in the future, which remains to be built for a price which was not mentioned,\u00a0and by a subsidiary company in which it is not even the only shareholder. The Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0notes that Getma was clearly more transparent in the note entitled \"Conakry port: the truth\u00a0and the proof\" which it published on 14 February 2011 to defend itself against the rumors of a\u00a0threat that its contract with the terminated:\n1.2.2. Proof of Getma's experience\nGetma at the time was found [sic] the MSC group (your terminal) under a technical partnership agreement (appendix no. 13).\nIn the context of the call for bids, Getma was able to provide proof of significant experience (appendix no. 14); today, Getma Aubrey operates terminals, alone or in cooperation (in\u00a0particular with Bollor\u00e9 and Maersk) in Luanda, Lom\u00e9, Douala, Libreville, Cotonou and\u00a0Abidjan.384\n378 TR I, p. 71:16-23.\n379 Our underlining.\n380 The Arbitral Tribunal notes a certain negligence in the description of this \"presence\": depending on the\u00a0country, it can be a subsidiary, establishment or branch office, or Getma International, or the \"Getma\u00a0International group\" which was never defined by the Claimants.\n381 Financial bid of July 2008 (C-179), p. 112-201/230.\n382 Technical Proposal (C-174), p.16.

Thus, therefore, Getma International bid did not satisfy the requirements of the bidding\u00a0regulations, according to which: \"the bid submitted by the bidder (one single entity or group of\u00a0companies) shall contain [...] all the members of the group must be jointly and severally liable\u00a0to the Grantor, for the execution of the concession. A statement to this effect is included in the\u00a0mandate mentioned above, as well as in the submission\". Either Getma International\u00a0relinquished your terminal references and submitted a bid alone, or it formed a group with\u00a0Europe terminal, which was then required to make a joint and several commitments to the\u00a0Grantor.\n287. \u00a0Notwithstanding the problems raised therefore by Getma International's offer, it nonetheless\u00a0received a positive appreciation and even obtained the contract, to the detriment of its\u00a0competitors. The Respondent considers that this can be explained only by the corruption of\u00a0the members of the evaluation. As the purpose of the corruption was to obtain the concession,\u00a0it is fitting to verify whether because references permitted Getma International to become\u00a0successful bidders. If the awarding of the concession does not depend on references, one\u00a0cannot consider these false references as evidence of corruption. In this case, the references\u00a0do not constitute either a substantial factor for concluding the contract and the fact that they\u00a0are false cannot constitute fraud.\n288. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore verified the impact which Getma International's presentation\u00a0of Europe terminal's references as its own may have had on the evaluation of the bids and the\u00a0awarding of the concession.\n289. The evaluation report shows that the committee work in two phases: the first analyzed the\u00a0technical bids of the four bidders on the basis of the criteria defined in article 17 of the bidding\u00a0regulations. The references were part of the \"technical proposal\" criteria, accounting for 15\u00a0points. These 15 points were broken down into 67 criteria, the following of which are\u00a0impacted:\nb.l Experience and references in design, financing, realization, operation and management of container terminals: 4 points.\nGetma International received 4/4 on the grounds that \"the bidder has [...] It's more than two (2) experiences in the design, financing, realization, operation and management of\u00a0container terminals\". It's competitor Bollor\u00e9, on the other hand, has received only two\u00a0because \"the committee notes that bidder presents no experience in the design and\u00a0realization of container terminals\".\nThe Arbitral Tribunal notes that Getma International did not have these references either, nor did it have those for the financing, and that it therefore was able to receive\u00a0only 2/4 at the most (given that we are not even certain that it was indeed it, and not\u00a0Europe terminal, which operated and managed the container terminals). In order to verify\u00a0the maximum impact of the lack of references, the Arbitral Tribunal grants it 1/4.\nb.2 Global consolidated traffic report for 2005, 2006, and 2007:1 point\nI CL i 1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01' 1 - '\np- 5!

The ports\u00a0concerned are located in Belgium, the Bahamas, the United States, Spain and France.\"\nIt turned out in this arbitration that this evaluation was inaccurate: these ports are managed by Europe Terminal, and not at all in the name and under the responsibility of Getma\u00a0International, which was a handler only in the ports of the African Atlantic Coast.\u00a0Therefore: 0/1.\nb.3 [...]\nb.4 List of the container terminals designed, financed and built by the bidder: 2 points.\nThe committee deducted 0.5 points because it had noted that \"the structure of the capital of the operating companies and the operating system of each terminal are not specified\".\nBollor\u00e9 received zero points because \"the bidder presented no experience in the design, financing and building of container terminals\".\nNor did Getma have any experience and the justification which the committee gives for the point of 1.5 is false: \"the information provided by the bidder is the following. [s/c]:[...]\u00a0the length of the docks varies between 900 to 2,140 meters; the costs and construction\u00a0time vary from one \u20ac130 to \u20ac200 million and construction time from 2 to 8 years; [...] The\u00a0list of the equipment implemented and the characteristics was provided\". As we have\u00a0seen above, Getma had never yet built a CT and the figures which the commission quotes\u00a0here are those of the chart, which constitutes chapter 1.6 of Getma International's\u00a0technical bid, in which the only CT mentioned among the four referred to, which is not an\u00a0MSC reference, concerns the Luanda terminal to be built by 5M between 2008 and 2013\u00a0with docks of 300+600 meters, i.e. shorter than the 900 to 2140 meters which the\u00a0commission quotes.\nGetma International had to receive, like Bollor\u00e9, 0/2.\n290. \u00a0Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that instead of receiving 14.5/15 as total rating for its\u00a0technical proposal (while Bollor\u00e9 had 11), Getma International deserved only 9/15. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has no reason to verify the other aspects of the evaluation, because only the\u00a0partnership and the references were the object of debate in this arbitration. Thus, the sum of\u00a0the points for Getma's technical bid would have been 86.75 points, instead of 92.25 points\u00a0which the committee awarded (to be compared with the 90.75 points of Bollor\u00e9's technical\u00a0bid).\n291. As the four bidders had obtained the minimum of 70 points, their financial bids were also\u00a0opened by the commission, which granted 78.54 points to Getma International and 69.95\u00a0points to Bollor\u00e9. The Arbitral Tribunal notes however that among the financial sub-criteria,\u00a0there was also one which pertained to the references, in particular the references to the\u00a0financing of similar projects. The commission granted 5/5 to Getma International, deeming\u00a0that \"the references presented by the bidder prove its capacity to design, finance, build and\u00a0operate container terminals.\" Given that it has been established above that Getma\u00a0International had never designed, financed, or built a container terminal in 2008, it did not\u00a0deserve these five points. This judgment is warranted by the standards/applied by the\u00a0commission for the same sub-criterion to Bollor\u00e9: \"the commission notes upon reading the\u00a0four affidavits presented, that the bidder did not provide any references in design, or for the\n70\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 78 of 173\nwork of constructing walls, docks and backfilling\". Thus, the grade to be granted to Getma International was 73.54 instead of the 78.53 granted by the commission (to be compared with\u00a0the 55.68 for Bollor\u00e9's financial bid).\n292. The final grades were calculated by the commission by adding the weighted technical and\u00a0financial grades. If the Tribunal applies the same weighting to Getma International's corrected\u00a0points, one obtains:\n(86.75 x 0.60) + (73.54 x 0.40) = 52.02 + 29.416 = 81.436 (instead of 86.77)\n293. \u00a0This means that in the general classification of the four competitors, Getma international\u00a0should have received at least four fewer points, but would have still been the first, with at\u00a0least four points more than Bollor\u00e9. Therefore, if Getma International won the competitive\u00a0bidding, it was not due to the false references. The references counted, among the various\u00a0criteria for the award, only for 10 out of the 100 points of the evaluation of the technical bid\u00a0and 5/100 in that of the financial bid, therefore, a total of 10 x 0.6 + 5 x 0.4 = 8 points out of\u00a0100.\n294. \u00a0Furthermore, the fact that the criteria of experience and references were graded, like the\u00a0other evaluation criteria, by a point system, proves that these criteria were not eliminatory\u00a0criteria. The elimination of the parties concerned who did not have the required experience\u00a0and references was done at the preselection stage. And as noted in \u00a7274 above, the PAC,\u00a0which in this instance is beyond any suspicion of corruption, deemed that Getma\u00a0International's manifestation of interest was satisfactory.\n295. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept that the granting of the concession to Getma\u00a0International, notwithstanding these false references, proves corruption\n296. The issue remains of determining whether the investment is legal because it was obtained by\u00a0fraud as alleged by the Respondent;\n297. \u00a0It is not excluded that the bid may have misled the Grantor. Given the size and expertise of the\u00a0group to which Getma International belonged, it is not excluded either that this was precisely\u00a0Getma International's intention. An undertaking such as Getma International is familiar with\u00a0the bidding rules and practices for contracts and cannot deny that it knows the difference\u00a0between-and the legal consequences of-eight bids submitted in its own name and the bid,\u00a0binding a group of contractors. Furthermore, the bidding regulations were clear in this respect.\n298. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the attractive/misleading nature of the technical bid is not\u00a0obvious. Both the manifestation of interest, and the technical bid were voluminous documents\u00a0and, the analysis thereof required a serious study, as is apparent in the preceding paragraphs.\u00a0Only an attentive reading of the technical partnership agreement, such as appended to the\u00a0bid, could reveal that it did not bind Europe Terminal with respect to the Respondent, that it\u00a0had never, and could no longer, become effective without violating the bidding regulations\u00a0(because Getma International alone, had manifested its interest and it alone would submit a\u00a0bid). The Arbitral Tribunal does not know whether there was a legal expert on the evaluation\u00a0commission386, but in all events, it was up to the Respondent to create a commission\u00a0comprising persons sufficiently informed to evaluate a bid well.\n386 The list of the members of the Commission is at the beginning of the evaluation report (C-lll, p. 3). The file\u00a0contains only the following information on some of them:\nAt the end of 2012, Mr. Kourouma was Director of public works and urban planning (R-35)\n71\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 79 of 173\n299. \u00a0In all events, Mr. Sory Camara, one of the two members of the evaluation commission, who,\u00a0according to Mr. Fox's report, had not been corrupted and who appeared as witness for\u00a0Guinea in the CCJA arbitration, attested that:\nFor us, it therefore appeared that Getma International was bidding in the context of its partnership with MSC. MSC's presence therefore lent credibility to Getma International's\u00a0candidacy which permitted it to be selected at this stage;\n[F]or the members of the Commission, it was clear that Getma International was bidding with its partner, MSC, which had serious references in the domain of the design, financing and\u00a0building of container terminals.\nGiven this partnership, it appeared normal that Getma International present MSC's references...388 ; and\nThe Commission also took account of the commercial strategy commitments made by Getma International, and in particular, the commitment under the agreement with the shippers from\u00a0Mali, which met the goal sought in the call for manifestations of interest, which was that the\u00a0container terminal become a cross-docking and transit platform for the hinterland countries,\u00a0and in particular Mali, a neighboring country of Guinea.389\n300. This testimony confirms:\n(i) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that Guinea was aware that the references were not those of Getma International, but\u00a0those of MSC; and\n(ii) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that other criteria, then the references had also played in favor of Getma International.\n301. \u00a0Even if the bid was presented by Getma International in a manner which could mislead an\u00a0inattentive reader, and even if, from a strictly legal standpoint, Getma International was not\u00a0authorized to mention the references of its commercial partner because the bid did not\u00a0originate in their group, the Respondent was not unaware that the bid was that of Getma\u00a0International alone, and that the references were those of MSC. The Respondent therefore\u00a0was not misled (and if it nonetheless was, it was also due to its own negligence in examining\u00a0the bid and its appendices) and the agreement was concluded by the Respondent with full\u00a0knowledge of the facts. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that it is not proven that the\u00a0agreement was concluded based on fraud. This conclusion is confirmed, even when one takes\u00a0into account not only the false references, but also the references to a false contractual\u00a0partnership.\n3. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The financial commitments\n302. \u00a0The bidding regulations required that the bid be accompanied by affidavits testifying to\u00a0financial capacity, issued in accordance with the appended model and issued by one of the first\nIn 2013 Mr. Cond\u00e9 was Inspector of financial and accounting services (R-36);\nMr. Sory Camara has training in \"finance\" economy (R-31);\nMr. Morlaye Camara was Director of the PAC's technical services and project chief (\u00a7 16)\n387 Mr.\u00a0Sory Camara's affidavit produced in the CCJA arbitration, on\u00a0March 22,\u00a02013 (R-31) \u00a7\u00a013.\n388 Mr\u00a0Sory Camara's affidavit produced in the CCJA arbitration, on\u00a0March 22,\u00a02013 (R-31) \u00a7\u00a019.\n388 Mr. Sory Camara's affidavit produced in the CCJA arbitration, on\u00a0March 22,\u00a02013 (R-31) \u00a7\u00a020.\n72\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 80 of 173\nranking banks in Guinea or abroad, certifying that the candidate had access to loans for an amount permitting it on the one hand, to take on and operate the existing container terminal,\u00a0and on the other hand, to build the extension to the container terminal and to install an\u00a0embankment on the rail connection platform.390\n303. \u00a0According to the formula model, this should attest that\nThe candidate has access to the loans of.......Euros[...] permitting it on the one hand, to take on\nand operate the existing container terminal, and, on the other hand, to build the container terminal extension and to install an embankment on the rail connection platform.391\n304. \u00a0Getma International produced a Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale certificate of financial capacity, the terms of\u00a0which in no manner reiterated those of the formula required in the invitation for bids, but\u00a0confirmed only that:\nSince 1993, the Getma International company [...] has had an account in our books, which has operated to our full satisfaction. We entertain excellent relations with this company, which to\u00a0date has never made any commercial or financial commitments which it was unable to meet\u00a0[..J.392\n305. \u00a0It also produced a \"certificate of recognition\", worded in a similar manner, on the part of the\u00a0Natexis company.393\n306. \u00a0It is obvious, and it must have been obvious for the members of the evaluation commission,\u00a0that these certificates were not compliant. For that matter, the commission noted this\u00a0nonconformity explicitly in the evaluation report and it also gave a reduced rating (1/3) for this\u00a0item.\n307. The fact that points are granted for the evaluation sub-criterion called \"financial capacity\u00a0certificates\" proves that these certificates do not constitute a condition of the admissibility of\u00a0the bid, but are, along with other sub-criteria, a factor in the global evaluation.\n308. This is confirmed by the fact that other bids, which were not accompanied either by the\u00a0required financial certificates, were not eliminated either. Thus, it was shown during the\u00a0hearing that another competitor, APM Terminals, had not attached the proper financial\u00a0certificate, but that its bid was nonetheless not eliminated.394\nIt even received 3/3 points for this item in the administrative file on the basis of the simple realization by the evaluation commission that \"the financial capacity certificate presented by\u00a0the bidder was issued by the HSBC bank of the Netherlands\".395\nAnother competitor, the group Maritime TCB/Afrimarine, did not present any bank certificate at all396, as was pointed out by the Claimants in their rejoinder.397 . The Arbitral Tribunal was\u00a0able to verify that TBC/Afrimarine received 0/3 points for not having provided a bank\n390 File of call for bids of the Republic of Guinea for the granting of a concession to the Container Terminal of\u00a0the Port of Conakry, its extension and the building of a rail connection (C-108) p. 7.\n391 Concession Agreement (R-4) p. 61.\n392 Technical bid (C-174) p. 17 of the electronic version\n393 Technical bid (C-174) p. 18 of the electronic version\n394 TR I, p.87:37-88:12.\n395 Commission Nationale des Grands March\u00e9s de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e (C-lll) p. 26\n396 Letters of Bid and Interest (C-358).\n397 Repl. \u00a7 202 and footnote n\u00b0 173.\n73\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 81 of 173\ncertificate (but from KPMG)398. Only Bollor\u00e9's certificates complied\u2122 with requirements, and this company received the maximum number of points for this item in the administrative file\n309. \u00a0The fact that Getma International's bid was taken into consideration, despite the\u00a0nonconformity of its financial certificates with the model, is therefore in no manner an\u00a0indication of corruption and is warranted once more, by the little weight which these\u00a0certificates carry among the various sub criteria of the evaluation and the relative importance\u00a0of certain other sub-criteria, such as the entry ticket, for which Getma International was by far\u00a0the best bidder.400 Mr. Sory Camara's testimony before the CCJA Tribunal confirmed this:\nMr. Fischer.- You therefore considered that the commission on which you sat had at its own initiative changed the order of the criteria and decided that the financial criteria on the\u00a0entry ticket, to speak simply, prevailed over the technical criterion?\nMr. Camara.- In the ratings attributed to each of the bidders, the entry tickets had received many more points because Getma had proposed 15 M\u20ac, compared to the others who had\u00a0proposed 5 or 10 million. The fees they proposed where higher than those of the others.\u00a0Given the context in which we were working, collecting funds for the State appeared\u00a0important. I believe that it was that which meant that... Because each time the commission\u00a0worked, the finance ministry's representative consulted the department for the decision to\u00a0be made. When the technical bids were evaluated, it obtained the minister's opinion, when\u00a0the financial evaluations were made, the opinion of the Finance Minister. I believe that's\u00a0what happened.401\n310. The financial certificates which did not comply with regulations did not constitute fraud either:\u00a0they were not false and their non-compliance did not escape the Respondent, who was\u00a0therefore not misled in this regard.\n4. The failure to make the investments\n311. The Respondent invokes Getma's failure to finance and make the investments in the\u00a0concession, as the consequence of its fraudulent obtaining thereof. This failure-on which the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has not been called upon to rule, but regarding which it notes that it was not\u00a0invoked as grounds for terminating the concession-can in no event prove corruption. At most,\u00a0it is evidence that the quality of the bid, of the partnership with MSC, and the references\u00a0given, was not sufficiently sound to guarantee the punctual execution of the Concession\u00a0Agreement. Neither this failure, nor its possible causes, whether it be the noncompliant bid or\u00a0the use of references of a partner which was not involved, prove corruption, whether it be per\u00a0se or in combination with other factors. None of these alleged pieces of evidence will lend\u00a0more credibility to the two testimonies referred to above.\n312. \u00a0In the absence of other proof, the Arbitral Tribunal can only conclude that corruption or fraud\u00a0has not been proven in a clear convincing manner, and that the investment was not illegal on\u00a0one of these counts.\n398 Commission Nationale des Grands March\u00e9s de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e (C-lll) p. 9\n399 TR I, p.82:l-83:ll.\n400 Commission Nationale des Grands March\u00e9s de la Republique de Guin\u00e9e (C-lll) p.88/88.\u00a0i'01 Record of the CCJA hearing of May 28, 2013 (R-104) p. 36:23-35.\n74\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 82 of 173\n(2) The Tribunal's jurisdiction regarding the effects of termination, the loss of profit and the additional counts of prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree, due to the Decision\u00a0regarding Jurisdiction of December 29, 2012\n313. \u00a0In its decision of December 29, 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal decided the following:\nThere is a \u201ccontrary agreement\" pursuant to which the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal replaces that of the ICSID, but the scope of application of which is strictly determined by the\u00a0terms of article 32.5. There is therefore no jurisdiction which competes with the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0and with that of the ICSID Tribunal for the requests based on the termination of the\u00a0agreement caused by an act of the Public Authorities, but at the very most, it jurisdiction,\u00a0which is complementary to this Tribunal if the Concessionary considers that an act of the\u00a0Public Authorities constituted a violation of the Investment Code and entailed damaging\u00a0consequences other than (those of) the termination of the agreement.402\nThe scope of the application of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal therefore does not encompass litigations resulting from the Concession Agreement, including its termination, even following\u00a0an act of the Public Authorities. Articles 32.5 and 31 of the Concession Agreement are in fact\u00a0also binding upon this Tribunal. However, it will not be until the time of the analysis of the\u00a0Claimants' precise requests, of their legal foundation, of their factual causes and of the\u00a0damages that this Tribunal will be able to determine whether and to what extent its\u00a0jurisdiction which is complementary to that of the CCJA Tribunal can be effectively\u00a0implemented to award a \"complementary\" indemnity for a \"complementary\" prejudice,\u00a0which might exceed the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal. 403\n314. The Claimants allege that the loss of profit (like the additional counts of prejudice resulting\u00a0from the Termination Decree) \"is not in casu a contractual consequence of the termination of\u00a0the contract, but a consequence of the breach of the Investment Code, resulting from an illegal\u00a0act of expropriation under the auspices of the termination of a contract.404\n315. Contrary to that which the Claimants contend, the loss of profit, like most of the additional\u00a0counts of prejudice405, is the consequence of termination and the following distinctions which\u00a0the Claimants make to maintain the contrary change nothing.\n316. The distinction which the Claimants want to make between \"termination\" and \"the act of\u00a0termination\" is not warranted. It's not because the manner in which termination was carried\u00a0out in this case (by Decree) is not explicitly stipulated in article 32.5 that termination does not\u00a0constitute a breach of the contract and would become a violation of the Investment Code. An\u00a0irregular termination constitutes a fortiori a breach of contract and the ensuing litigation falls\u00a0within the jurisdiction of the court stipulated in the contract. If termination is an act of the\u00a0Public Authorities, the consequence is the same: it is still the termination of the same contract,\u00a0the ensuing disputes and litigations of which fall within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction\u00a0of the CCJA Tribunal. Article 32.5 of the agreement contains a very broad definition of acts of\u00a0the Public Authorities with an exemplary list of those which can impede its proper execution,\n402 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 125.\n403 Decision on jurisdiction \u00a7 152.\n404 Repl. \u00a7 340.\n405 Namely the costs of repatriating the requisitioned equipment, and the employee costs caused by the laying\u00a0off of the personnel. This is less clear for the costs of crisis management; see below.\n75\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 83 of 173\nin particular expropriation. Therefore, the Claimants insist in vain on the fact that the act of termination was in fact an expropriation, as the latter was also included in article 32.5.\n317. The distinction made by the Claimants between the so-called \"contractual\" consequences and\u00a0the \"extra contractual\" consequences of termination cannot be adopted by the Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal . Indeed, their definition of contractual consequences is unacceptable: The\u00a0contractual consequences of the act of termination are those stipulated in the contract\".406\u00a0According to them, it would ensue that all indemnities not stipulated in article 32.3 would be\u00a0extra contractual consequences and therefore would be covered by the Investment Code and\u00a0fall within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal inasmuch as the prejudice exceeds the contractual\u00a0ceiling for indemnification stipulated in article 32.3\n318. \u00a0The Claimants' reasoning cannot be followed. A count of prejudice is not of a different nature\u00a0because it is limited under the contract and the amount which exceeds the contractual limit\u00a0does not become \"extra-contractual\". The Claimants appeared to lose sight of the fact that this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal has already declared in its decision on jurisdiction, that \"what the agreement\u00a0regulates are the consequences of these acts [of the Public Authorities] on the agreement.\u00a0Inasmuch as termination is consecutive to an act of the Public Authorities, article 32.5\u00a0\"contractualizes\" the treaty claims which, consequently, must be submitted to the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal in accordance with article 31 of the agreement.\"407\n319. Contrary to that which the Claimants suggest, the serious nature of termination does not\u00a0prevent it either from falling into the contractual context. Indeed, article 32.5 thereof refers to\u00a0acts of the Public Authorities which can, due to their nature, be serious and yet does not make\u00a0a distinction between such acts based on their seriousness.\n320. The agreement set a clear limit on the indemnity which the Concessionary can claim. This all-inclusive/limitative nature of the indemnity of article 32.3 was apparently not the object of\u00a0debate before the CCJA Tribunal. As noted in the decision on jurisdiction, this was an issue on\u00a0the merits, \"which shall be settled by the court before which requests concerning such\u00a0additional indemnitees are brought\".408 Contrary to that which the Claimants are attempting\u00a0to do, this sentence cannot be interpreted as an acknowledgment of the jurisdiction of this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal in the event that the CCJA Tribunal did not consider that it entertained\u00a0jurisdiction, and even less in the event that it did not rule on the issue for another reason.\n321. \u00a0Indeed, Getma International had initially requested of the CCJA Tribunal not only what it called\u00a0its \"contractual prejudice\", namely four counts of damages set as a limited sum in article 32.3\u00a0of the agreement, but also the \"additional prejudice\" comprising \"an indemnity equal to the\u00a0loss of profit it could legitimately have expected for the entire duration of the Concession\u00a0Agreement\".409 After having confirmed in the CCJA arbitration award its request for indemnity\u00a0for the additional prejudice410, Getma International nonetheless omitted this lucrum cessans\u00a0from the request made in its CCJA memorial of June 15, 2012411, while maintaining its request\u00a0for the all-inclusive termination indemnity which is, according to article 32.3, \"designed to\u00a0compensate for the loss of activity\". Also the CCJA Tribunal noted in its award of April 29, 2014\u00a0that Getma International confirmed during the CCJA hearing of July 8, 2013 the withdrawal of\n406 Repl. \u00a7 341.\n407 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 123.\n408 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 124.\n409 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 129 and Request for Arbitration submitted to the CCJA on May 1 , Oil (R-9)\n410 CCJA record of March 12, 2012 (R-10), p. 16\n411 Claimants' CCJA memorial of June 15, 2012 (R-6) and Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 139.\n76\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 84 of 173\nits request for indemnification for loss of profit and decided that it could not, on pain of committing ultra petita, rule on the withdrawn request'\u201912.\n322. \u00a0The Claimants now consider that \"this Arbitral Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the\u00a0breach of the Investment Code, because the CCJA Tribunal recognized that it had not been\u00a0asked to rule on the request for damages, linked to the loss of profit and the request for\u00a0damages, linked to the property requisition'\"113. This reasoning cannot be followed: it is not\u00a0because Getma International, withdrew its request for additional prejudice from the CCJA\u00a0arbitration, and subsequently submitted it in this ICSID arbitration, that the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0lacked or could have lacked jurisdiction and that the ICSID Tribunal entertains or could\u00a0entertain jurisdiction. The referral of a case to a Tribunal does not suffice to confirm or justify\u00a0the jurisdiction thereof. The complementary jurisdiction of the two Tribunals requires that the\u00a0jurisdiction of each of them be determined on the basis of the rules which apply thereto,\u00a0respectively. The \"carve-out\" brought about by article 32.5 of the agreement is clear and\u00a0concerns terminations resulting from an act of the Public Authorities: \"The scope of the\u00a0application of this Tribunal's jurisdiction therefore does not include litigations resulting from\u00a0the Concession Agreement, including the termination thereof, even following an act of the\u00a0Public Authorities\".41'1\n323. \u00a0In their opening brief, the Claimants presented to this Arbitral Tribunal a request for\u00a0additional indemnification for loss of profit 415and claimed the sum of 103,031,250 euros\u00a0(subsequently increased to 108,428,125 euros) \"corresponding to the net value of the cash\u00a0flow updated for the period of the concession of which the Claimants were deprived due to\u00a0their expropriation,\" as well as the sum of 1,058,502 euros, \"corresponding to the additional\u00a0prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree\".\n324. The net value of the cash flow is nothing other than the loss of profit416 and therefore targets\u00a0the same prejudice as the all-inclusive indemnification for termination referred to in article\u00a032.3, which is, again, according to a literal reading of this article, \"designed to compensate for\u00a0the loss of activity\" in the case of the termination of the agreement. This all-inclusive\u00a0termination indemnification is equal to:\no The sales made over the course of the 12 (twelve) preceding months if termination takes place over 12 (twelve) months after the entry into force of the agreement;\no the sales of the first year stipulated in the realistic business plan mentioned in appendix 8 if termination takes place over the course of the 12 (twelve) first months following the\u00a0entry into force of the agreement.417\n325. \u00a0It therefore appears that the parties, by agreeing that the damages following the loss of\u00a0activity, or of income, namely the loss of profit, would be limited to an amount equal to the\u00a0sales of one year, recognized implicitly that these damages are the result of the termination of\u00a0the agreement.\n412 CCJA award of April 29, 2014 \u00a7\u00a7 189 and 190.\n413 Mem.AAR p. 12, Heading B\n414 Decision on jurisdiction \u00a7 153.\n415 The request for arbitration claimed in general a \"faire, adequate\" indemnification, but no quantified for the\u00a0prejudice caused by Guinea's breach of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Investment Code\n416 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 443 and the following in which the Claimants explain how they utilize the updated cash flow\u00a0method to calculate \"the prejudice resulting from the loss of future income from the Concession\".\n417 Art. 32.3 Agreement\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\\n77\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 85 of 173\n326. \u00a0In CCJA arbitration, Getma International based its request for compensation for the profit it\u00a0may have \"hoped for for the entire duration of the concession\" on article 104, paragraph 2, of\u00a0the code of public contracts of the Republic of Guinea, which determines the formalities to be\u00a0performed \"when the contracting authority puts an end to the execution of the services prior\u00a0to the completion thereof in a contract termination decision1'18\". This confirms once again that\u00a0the request for loss of profit is directly linked to the termination of the concession and that the\u00a0litigation arising around the request is indeed a dispute resulting from the agreement.\n327. The same is true of \"the additional prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree\" which is a\u00a0consequence of the termination of the agreement which was governed in its entirety by the\u00a0agreement.\n328. \u00a0Indeed, it's not enough to change the terminology and to no longer refer to loss of profit after\u00a0termination of the contract, but to a \u201cprejudice sustained by the expropriated investors419,\" or\u00a0a consequence of the breach of the Investment Code, resulting from an illegal act of\u00a0expropriation under the appearance of the termination of the contract\"420 to change the legal\u00a0grounds and the cause of the request. That article. 32.5 of the agreement applies also in the\u00a0cases in which termination is the result of an expropriation, is the result of the very wording of\u00a0this article, which applies to:\nAny act or decision,... originating in the State,... the direct or indirect effect of which is to impede the Concessionary's proper execution of its obligations..., and in particular:\n(Hi)...\n(iv) Expropriation...421\n329. \u00a0It is therefore not by using the term \"expropriation\" that the Claimants can avoid the\u00a0consequences of the agreement, which they made after intensive negotiations422. Their\u00a0agreement concerned both the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal and the limit on the amount of\u00a0damages. Therefore, even if this Arbitral Tribunal entertained jurisdiction to rule on the\u00a0damaging consequences of termination - quod non -, it should also apply the parties'\u00a0agreement, namely article 323, and not the Investment Code.\n330. The damages which the Claimants are claiming were caused by the termination of the\u00a0agreement. It matters little that such termination was carried out by means of a notice, such as\u00a0stipulated in the public contracts code, by a simple letter, or by a Decree; the parties' intention\u00a0to limit the indemnification to which the Concessionary would be entitled in such cases was\u00a0clear. Article 31, 32.3 and 32.5, were not imposed upon the Concessionary unilaterally by the\u00a0Respondent in the framework of a competitive procedure, in which the contractual clauses are\u00a0sometimes non-negotiable. On the contrary, the Articles and Conditions on the basis of which\n418 When the contracting authority terminates the performance of the services prior to the completion thereof\u00a0due to a decision to terminate the contract, this must be notified by registered mail or hand-delivered against\u00a0an acknowledgement of receipt to the contract holder, the latter may present a demand for compensation for\u00a0the prejudice he claims to suffer. This demand must be presented at the latest 60 days after notification of the\u00a0decision to terminate. The compensation may in no event be higher that the loss of profits of the holder of the\u00a0cancelled contract, and this loss must be proven via accounting documents.

Regarding the\u00a0end of the concession, the Articles and Conditions specified only that \"the duration of the\u00a0concession will be established in the agreement\" (article 2) and that \"the conditions of\u00a0termination, are defined in the agreement\" (article 24). Negotiations for the agreement began\u00a0on September 2, 2008424 and lasted for several weeks; the agreement was signed on\u00a0September 22, 2008. Even if the Respondent in no manner proved its allegation that Getma\u00a0International is the \"author\" of article 32.5, the Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that it had the\u00a0opportunity to rule on the indemnity scheme of article 32.3, and that of the acts of the Public\u00a0Authorities governed by article 32.5425. The Claimants themselves provided proof that there\u00a0were 15 negotiation projects426 and that the delegations counted two legal consultants and\u00a0three attorneys on Getma International's side and two legal consultants on the State's side422\u00a0who \"discussed, article by article, the draft Concession Agreement prepared on the basis of the\u00a0draft appearing in the appendix to the articles and conditions\"428. This Arbitral Tribunal is\u00a0therefore satisfied that the wording of article 31 and 32 was validly agreed upon by the\u00a0parties, and that nothing opposes the application thereof.\n331. \u00a0Clearly, after the termination of the agreement, the Claimants were unable to settle for this\u00a0limited indemnification and attempted to escape the contractual limit by initiating a second\u00a0arbitration invoking violations of the Investment Code before the ICSID Tribunal. One of the\u00a0Claimants' attorneys recognized explicitly that the goal was to find a way to escape the\u00a0limitation, although Getma International had accepted it freely:\nSecond point, why did we slip, evolve as you said? It's perfectly true, because the issue we were confronting was to determine if the all-inclusive indemnity stipulated under the\u00a0Concession Agreement was necessarily limited in the context of the contract and could we\u00a0request a higher sum or not? In other words, could we consider under the Concession\u00a0Agreement that the damages determined contractually exhausted all the prejudice for\u00a0which we could request indemnification under the Concession Agreement?429\n332. \u00a0With the exception of the observation that this question alone indicates that for the Claimants\u00a0also the lucrum cessans is a contractual matter, governed by the agreement, the response is\u00a0clearly that the damages determined in the contract exhausted the prejudice in its entirety.\u00a0The Claimants provided no valid argument to prove the contrary. They did not explain why\u00a0their agreement does not mean that which it states and why, notwithstanding the clear\u00a0agreement, it would suffice, to come before another court and evoke the Investment Code, to\u00a0annul the validity of the contractual limitation on damages. On the contrary, the Claimants'\u00a0spontaneous reaction after termination, of calling upon the CCJA Tribunal, confirms that in\u00a0their minds also the consequences of termination, regardless of the cause thereof, were those\u00a0agreed upon in the contract. Indeed, to request such indemnification based on the Investment\u00a0Code and to present termination as expropriation, permitted the Claimants to hope for access\n423 Bid evaluation report (C-ll) p. 54-62\n424 Notice of provisional award decision (C-10).\n425 Mem.

But as long as the object of the request concerned the consequences of termination and not damaging consequences other than (those of)\u00a0termination, an ICSID Tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction.\n333. \u00a0Indeed, it was decided that this ICSID Arbitral Tribunal entertained, \"at the most, a\u00a0complementary jurisdiction [...] [that] if the Concessionary considers'\u201930 that an act of the Public\u00a0Authorities constitutes a breach of the Investment Code and entailed damaging consequences\u00a0other than (those of) termination'\"'31. A determination will be made in chapter VI of whether\u00a0these conditions have been met.\n334. \u00a0To conclude, the Tribunal can only confirm what had already been decided, in its decision on\u00a0jurisdiction, namely that \"this Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the effects of\u00a0the termination of the Concession Agreement with respect to four Claimants\".\n(3) The effects of article 32.5 of the Concession Agreement as a contrary agreement in light of\u00a0the Decision of December 29, 2012\n335. The decision on jurisdiction has already clearly established that article 32.5 was a contrary\u00a0agreement pursuant to which the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal replaces that of the ICSID,\u00a0but the scope of the application of which is strictly limited by the terms of article 32.5.432\n336. The Claimants now rely on an observation of the Arbitral Tribunal in the same decision to\u00a0assert that article 32.5 of the agreement does not apply to the case at issue:\nEven if this is not explicitly stipulated, the preliminary and final notifications procedure stipulated in article 32.5 requires that the decision to terminate the agreement following a\u00a0change of law/act of the Public Authorities belongs to the Concessionary. Only this decision\u00a0carries entitlement for the Concessionary to the indemnification stipulated in article 32.3\u00a0(which is identical to that stipulated in the case of termination due to a fault on the\u00a0Grantor's part).433\n337. The Respondent opposes, with various arguments, the conclusion that the Respondents draw\u00a0from this observation, namely that this Arbitral Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on the\u00a0issue of the additional prejudice.\n338. \u00a0It is not necessary for this Arbitral Tribunal to evaluate each party's arguments on this point,\u00a0because it ensues from the decision on jurisdiction and the respective jurisdiction of this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal and the COA Tribunal that it is not up to the former to decide whether article\u00a032.5 of the agreement applies or not in the case at issue. The observation referred to was\u00a0merely a non-decisive which followed the ascertainment of this Arbitral Tribunal that article\u00a0325 does not establish \"a strict correlation between the change of law/act of the Public\u00a0Authorities and the termination of the agreement\". Neither of the parties had, at the time this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal rendered its award on jurisdiction, formulated an argument based on the\u00a0formalities required under article 32.5 or the author of the notices envisaged in this article.\u00a0Over the course of the first phase of this arbitration, and prior to the decision on jurisdiction,\u00a0there was therefore no debate on this issue; thus, paragraph 116 of this decision was merely a\n430 The formula necessarily implies also 'and proves1.\n431 Decision regarding Jurisdiction \u00a7 125.\n432 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 125.\n433 Decision on Jurisdiction \u00a7 116.\n80\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 88 of 173\nreflection following an exhaustive legal analysis, without being necessary for the purposes of the decision.\n339. \u00a0Notwithstanding their knowledge of this reflection (the decision was made on December 29,\u00a02012), the Claimants formulated no argument concerning the applicability of article 32.5\u00a0before the CCJA Tribunal, the only Tribunal with jurisdiction for this subject; on the contrary,\u00a0they continue to request the application of this article:\nGETMA observes that the Termination Decree is a legal act, which is binding upon it (summary statement number 833) with immediate effect and without any possible return to\u00a0the prior status quo due to the conclusion of a contract with a new Concessionary. The\u00a0direct effect of the Decree thereby prevented the Concessionary from executing its\u00a0contractual obligations. Based on this analysis, the Claimant applied the provisions of article\u00a032.5 of the agreement governing \"changes of law and acts of the Public Authorities\u00a0impeding the proper functioning of the activities granted in the concession\". It therefore\u00a0proceeded to make a preliminary notice of change of law which the Republic of Guinea left\u00a0without response, then a final notice, following the 60-day period stipulated in article 32.5.\nConsequently, Getma International is requesting the application of the stipulation of article 32.5, which states that: [...]\nThus it requested payment of the indemnities listed in article 32.3 and the indemnification for the violation of article 3.2.5, paragraph 3, which imposes upon the Grantor that it\u00a0minimize the effects of the change of law and the acts of the Public Authorities\".434\nGetma considers that the termination decision, made without prior notice, was illegal.\nIt likens the termination which occurred to a change of law and act of the Public Authorities, impeding the proper functioning of the activities granted in the concession (article 32.5 of\u00a0the agreement) carrying its entitlement to the indemnification provided under article 32.5 of\u00a0the agreement.433\n340. The absence of any debate regarding the applicability of article 32.5 before the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0does not create a legal foundation for extending the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal in\u00a0disregard of the parties' agreement. The arguments exchanged between the parties in this\u00a0arbitration concerning the applicability of article 32.5, and in particular the Claimants'\u00a0objections to this applicability436 could have and should have been presented before the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal, which entertained jurisdiction to rule on all litigations resulting from the agreement,\u00a0therefore a priori a dispute concerning the application of article 32.5, in the case at issue. In no\u00a0event should this Arbitral Tribunal disregard the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal by basing its\u00a0decision on the observation that article 32.5 does not apply in the case at issue.\n341. A possible decision of a CCJA Tribunal that article. 32.5 does not apply in the case at issue,\nwould still not mean that this Arbitral Tribunal would automatically entertain jurisdiction to rule on the consequences of the termination, on the basis of the Investment Code. Even a\u00a0termination carried out in a manner not explicitly stipulated in the contract, and which, to\u00a0quote the Claimants, \"goes beyond contractual logic\" in that it is carried out (i), by means of a\u00a0presidential Decree, (ii), without respecting the contractual formalities and (iii), without\n434 CCJA award of May 26, 2014 (C-50) \u00a7 59.\n435 CCJA award of May 26, 2014 (C-50) \u00a7 98.\n436 The most recently in Mem.

If they considered that termination\u00a0was irregular, nothing forced them to base their argument on this article in their successive\u00a0notices, or in their statement and nothing prevented them from contending that none of the\u00a0provisions of article 32 apply. Whatever the argument developed may have been, it should\u00a0have been developed before the CCJA Tribunal which entertained jurisdiction to rule on a\u00a0litigation following the agreement, including its termination.\n343. \u00a0The principal of estoppel, invoked, by the Respondent, effectively prohibits the Claimants from\u00a0invoking before this Arbitral Tribunal the inapplicability of article 32.5, after Getma\u00a0International based itself explicitly on this article in these notices of March 9 and May 4, 2011,\u00a0after it requested and obtained from the CCJA Tribunal the application of this article, and\u00a0continues to pursue the execution of the CCJA award notwithstanding its annulment.437\n(4) \u00a0\u00a0Res judicata and waiver\n344. The Claimants consider that the Respondent's arguments concerning the waiver and res\u00a0judicata are no longer relevant, since the annulment of the CCJA award, no portions of which\u00a0survive according to them. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to analyze\u00a0the impact of the annulment of the award on these additional arguments of the Respondent in\u00a0support of its objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Even if these arguments fall, the\u00a0annulment cannot bestow upon this Arbitral Tribunal a jurisdiction which it has never had. Its\u00a0jurisdiction does not exist by default, but concerns exclusively the breaches of the Investment\u00a0Code with the exception of those which were contractualized. Thus, the disputes resulting\u00a0from the agreement and its termination are still subject to the jurisdiction of a CCJA Tribunal.\n(5) \u00a0\u00a0The annulment of the CCJA award.\n345. The Arbitral Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants in their analysis of the consequences of the\u00a0annulment of the CCJA award. First of all, it is not true that \"the contract claims have ceased to\u00a0exist;\"438 it is only the decision concerning the requests which Getma International brought\u00a0before the CCJA Tribunal, which was annulled and which therefore may no longer be\u00a0enforceable in certain countries. The annulment of this decision, however, cannot influence\u00a0the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal , as the contractual jurisdiction clause which\u00a0contractualized the Acts of the Public Authorities, impeding the execution of the agreement, is\u00a0still valid. This contractualization also comprises the limitation of the damages following the\u00a0termination of the agreement. The issues of the validity and applicability of this limitation are\u00a0contractual issues which continue to fall within the jurisdiction of a CCJA Tribunal.\n346. Then, it is not the initial referral of a request for additional damages to the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0which prevents the Claimants from requesting this indemnification in this arbitration, as the\u00a0Claimants are suggesting439. Even if Getma International had never submitted a request to the\n437 In their Mem.AAC \u00a7\u00a7 85-87 and 92, the Claimants state that their initial referral of the case before the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal for loss of profit and the counts of prejudice following the requisition can no longer have an estoppel\u00a0effect since the annulment of the CCJA award. This Arbitral Tribunal points out however that estoppel is not\u00a0linked to the CCJA award, but to the Claimants' prior conduct.\n438 Mem.AAC \u00a7 83.\n439 Mem.AAC \u00a784.\n82\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 90 of 173\nCCJA Tribunal, this Arbitral Tribunal would have declared its lack of jurisdiction because we are referring to a prejudice resulting from termination. Contrary to that which the Claimants\u00a0suggest, the intention of this Arbitral Tribunal has never been \"to accept the decision of the\u00a0CCJA a Tribunal in [the] domains [of loss of profit and the requisition]'\"\u2019''0, but indeed to\u00a0determine with full independence its own jurisdiction, while granting the CCJA Tribunal, the\u00a0right and the duty to do likewise.\n347. The Claimants declared that \"the injustice of the annulment of the CCJA award did not modify\u00a0the scope of the jurisdiction of this arbitral procedure\"'1''1. The Arbitral Tribunal also considers\u00a0that the annulment has no impact on its jurisdiction, such as specified in its decision on\u00a0jurisdiction, and confirmed above. The annulment of the CCJA award cannot give this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal a jurisdiction which it has never had. Even if the Respondent's arguments concerning\u00a0estoppel, waiver, and res judicata fall with the annulment of the CCJA award as the Claimants\u00a0are claiming'\u2019''2, the two preceding subchapters show that it is not on these arguments that this\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal based its decision. Its decision of lack of jurisdiction for the litigations\u00a0resulting from the Concession Agreement, including the termination thereof, even following an\u00a0Act of the Public Authorities'\u2019'\u20193, was made independently of any decision of the CCJA Tribunal\u00a0(and even 17 months prior to the CCJA award) and continues to be valid, notwithstanding the\u00a0annulment thereof. If the Decision on jurisdiction specified that \"however it will not be until\u00a0the time of the analysis of the Claimants' precise requests, their legal foundation, their factual\u00a0causes and damages that this Tribunal can determine whether and to what extent its\u00a0jurisdiction, complementary to that of the CCJA Tribunal, can effectively be implemented for\u00a0deciding on a 'complementary' indemnification for a 'complementary' prejudice, which would\u00a0exceed the jurisdiction of the CCJA Tribunal \", this does not mean, as the Claimants appear to\u00a0believe, that any damages not obtained from the CCJA Tribunal (whether it be due to the\u00a0rejection of the request or because of the annulment of the award acceding to the request)\u00a0could be attributed by this Arbitral Tribunal, namely, would automatically fall within its\u00a0jurisdiction. The sentence would refer solely to the fact that the Claimants' requests before\u00a0this Arbitral Tribunal were not, at the end of 2012, detailed and did not therefore make it\u00a0possible to appoint nominatim and concretely those for which the Arbitral Tribunal could\u00a0assume jurisdiction.\n348. \u00a0In their letter of December 21, 2016, in which they informed this Arbitral Tribunal of the\u00a0annulment of the CCJA award, the Claimants referred to this Arbitral Tribunal as \"the last\u00a0bastion separating the Claimants from a denial of justice\". This viewpoint is not accurate. In\u00a0this respect they themselves referred44'\u2019 to Article 29.5 of the CCJA regulations. It stipulates\u00a0that after an annulment, either the court evokes if the parties so request, or the case is taken\u00a0on at the request of the most diligent party. If, as the Claimants noticed, the court has not\u00a0designated \"the last act of the arbitral body recognized as valid by the Court\", it ensues that\u00a0the proceedings must begin again from zero, but not that the Claimants are deprived of all\u00a0access to the court system. If they have no confidence in the CCJA institution as the dissident\u00a0opinion445 suggests, this in itself does not yet prove a denial of justice. If an ICSID Tribunal can\u00a0entertain jurisdiction to rule on a denial of justice, this must be proven and be attributable to\u00a0the Respondent. In the case at issue, the Claimants did not adapt their requests or arguments\u00a0in order to justify a correction by this Arbitral Tribunal of the alleged denial of justice, which\n440 Mem.AAC \u00a7 88.\n441 Mem.AAC \u00a791.\n442 Mem.

The requests before this Arbitral Tribunal are always the same, either loss of profit and the additional prejudice and the grounds thereof are\u00a0always the termination of the agreement. It is not because the alleged denial of justice was\u00a0committed by annulling the CCJA award, that this Arbitral Tribunal can extend its jurisdiction\u00a0to matters which the parties, by their agreement to the contrary, excluded from the\u00a0jurisdiction of the ICSID Tribunals.\n(6) \u00a0\u00a0In a subsidiary capacity: the inadmissibility of the requests\n349. \u00a0Given that the Arbitral Tribunal decided that the Claimants' investment was not illegal, the\u00a0requests are not inadmissible, but come up against the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.\n(7) \u00a0\u00a0In an infinitely subsidiary capacity: rejection of the requests due to false statements\n350. The Respondent invokes to no avail the Azinian versus Mexico case, which is not comparable to\u00a0the case at issue. In this case, the contract had been terminated by the Grantor who had\u00a0determined beforehand that it had valid, serious reasons (false statements at the time of the\u00a0call for bids) for canceling it; then, three successive levels of Mexican courts had, at the\u00a0initiative of the investors, verified and confirmed the validity of the termination decision.\u00a0Lastly, and ICSID Tribunal rejected the request for indemnification of the investors because,\u00a0among other grounds, they had not proven that the Mexican courts had committed errors or\u00a0denied justice.446\n351. \u00a0In this case, the Respondent did not prove that it had been misled by the statements in the\u00a0bid, nor that the concession was attributed to Getma International on the basis of false\u00a0statements. On the contrary, it has been proven above that its bid was accepted with full\u00a0knowledge of its flaws, because it was planning on an entry ticket which the Respondent could\u00a0not resist and which prevailed over all other considerations.\n\\*\\*\\*\n352. \u00a0To conclude, the Arbitral Tribunal did not accept jurisdiction to rule on the effects of the\u00a0termination of the Agreement. Nonetheless, it still entertains jurisdiction to verify whether\u00a0the Acts of the Public Authorities, other than termination, constitute a breach of the\u00a0Investment Code and entailed damaging consequences other than those of termination.\n446 Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, and Ellen BACA versus the United States of Mexico, ICSID ARB (AF)/97/2,\u00a0Award 1st November 1999 (R-133).\n84\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 92 of 173\nVI. LIABILITY\nA. The Claimants' Position\n(1) Guinea violated article 5 of the Investment Code and customary international law in that it\u00a0carried out an illegal expropriation, as a result both of the Termination Decree and the\u00a0requisition Decree\na. The Termination Decree\n353. \u00a0The Claimants contend that the Termination Decree, as an act of the Public Authorities,\u00a0constitutes an expropriation, which falls into the scope of the Investment Code and customary\u00a0international law, because (i) termination was carried out outside the contractual framework\u00a0(ii) by the President of the Republic and (iii), without any grounds or contractual justification.\n354. To characterize the Termination Decree as an act of the Public Authorities void of any\u00a0contractual logic, the Claimants refer to several cases in which it was determined that the acts\u00a0of the state, were not those of a co-contracting party, but rather stemmed from the Public\u00a0Authorities447 : Biwater versus Tanzania4'18 (announcement in the press of the termination of a\u00a0license and the occupation by the Public Authorities of the co-contracting party's premises) ;\u00a0SAUR versus Argentina449 (administrative takeover of the concession and termination of the\u00a0contract by Decree); RFCC versus Morocco450 (distinction between contractual actions and\u00a0those falling into the scope of international law, in which the instrumentum -, such as a law, a\u00a0Decree or court decision - is an indication of the non-contractual nature, thereof).\n355. \u00a0On these bases, the Claimants contend first of all that termination fell into no contractual\u00a0framework because it was carried out by means of a presidential Decree, without respecting\u00a0the provisions of the agreement governing termination and without corresponding to the\u00a0application of the procedure stipulated under the agreement. On the contrary, the\u00a0Termination Decree was purportedly an act of the Public Authorities stemming from the\u00a0President's will alone, without articulating any justification or non-performance the\u00a0contract451. The Claimants consider that the fictively contractual appearance given by Guinea\u00a0to termination should not mislead the court, inasmuch as the non-performances alleged by\u00a0Guinea were nonexistent.452\n356. They also affirm the following:\nEx abundante cautela, if all of these elements did not suffice to qualify the Termination Decree as an act of the Public Authorities, the presence of the Army and the armed police\u00a0force In the CT and in the Concessionary's premises [sic] to deny access to the employees of\u00a0the Concessionary and the STCC to their facilities as soon as the Termination Decree was\u00a0signed, and this even before the requisition Decree was signed and before any of these two\nw- Mem.\u00a7\u00a7 456-468.\n448 Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd.

Having concluded that the Termination Decree constitutes an expropriation, the Claimants\u00a0then analyze the criteria of article 5 of the Code, to conclude that the expropriation resulting\u00a0from termination, was illegal. On the following grounds:\n(i) \u00a0It was not an act of public utility, because the ultimate goal was to grant the concession to\u00a0the Bollor\u00e945'1 group. The Decree makes no mention of public utility as grounds for\u00a0termination and, in all events, under Guinean law, expropriation, in order to be legal,\u00a0must be preceded by a notice to the parties, followed by an act declaring it as a measure\u00a0of public utility;\n(ii) \u00a0expropriation was allegedly discriminatory because the Termination Decree was aimed\u00a0solely and specifically at the concession, rather than at a particular sector or group of\u00a0companies. Other foreign investors were not the object of the same animosity on the\u00a0government's part even when it wanted to terminate their contracts; indeed, Guinea gave\u00a0them a more favorable treatment455;\n(iii) No indemnification was awarded, such as explicitly specified in the Termination Decree\u00a0itself.456\n358. The Claimants contend lastly, in a subsidiary capacity, that even if one were to conclude that\u00a0the Termination Decree was not violated [s/c] by article 5 of the Code, it nonetheless\u00a0constitutes a violation of the minimum standard of treatment which Guinea was required to\u00a0grant to the Claimants under international law.457\n359. The Claimants consider that this standard implies \"that the actions of the state toward\u00a0foreigners present on its territory must be judged in light of the \"ordinary standards of\u00a0civilization\"\" and define it as protection against \"all arbitrary actions, carried out without\u00a0reason, or contrary to good faith\" based on the award rendered in the Abengoa versus\u00a0Mexico\u201c58 case. The Claimants allege that termination was carried out without prior notice and\u00a0was utilized as a political tool in Mr. Conde's presidential campaign.459\nb. The Requisition Decree\n360. The Claimants affirm, evoking the Saur versus Argentina 460case, \"that there is no doubt\" that\u00a0the requisition Decree constitutes an act of the Public Authorities governed by the Investment\u00a0Code and international law in general.461\n  \n453 Mem. \u00a7 448.\n454 Mem. \u00a7 474-478.\n455 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 484-488.\n456 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 489-490.\n457 Mem. \u00a7 491 (it is to be noted that the Code does not contain any articles on fair, equitable treatment, hence\u00a0the use of customary law as grounds).\n458 Abengoa S.A and Cofides S.A. versus the United States of Mexico, ICSID ARB/(AF\u00b0/09/2, Award, Apr. 18,\u00a02013 (C-251).\n459 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 491-498.\n460 saur Internationale SA versus the Republic of Argentina, ICSID ARB/04/98/4, Award, Dec; 8, 2000 (C-253).\n461 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 499 501.\n86\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 94 of 173\n361. \u00a0They then consider that the requisition violated article 5, even if it was only temporary'\u20196'\u2019,\u00a0based on draft number 12 of the Harvard Convention, and the awards in the Wena Hotels\u00a0versus Egypt\u21223, and Middle East Cement versus Egypt46'1 cases.\n362. \u00a0Lastly, the Claimants contend in a subsidiary capacity that even if it were concluded that the\u00a0requisition Decree did not violate article 5 of the code, it is nonetheless contrary to the\u00a0minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. They contend that the\u00a0test, in the case of abstention or insufficient action on the part of the executive of the host\u00a0state, is that of a \"simple absence or lack of diligence\". The Claimants contend here, that\u00a0Guinea did not take the necessary measures to minimize the consequences of the requisition\u00a0on them, for example by providing protection and maintaining the requisitioned equipment465.\n(2) Guinea violated article 6 of the Investment Code\n363. \u00a0The Claimants consider that the (termination and requisition) Decrees, violated article 6 of the\u00a0code on national treatment, because, by being expropriated without indemnification, they\u00a0received a less favorable treatment that the Guinean investor. According to the Claimants,\u00a0Guinean investors would have benefited from the provisions of fundamental Guinean law and\u00a0the Civil Code, which stipulate indemnifications in the event of expropriation.466\nB. The Respondent's position\n(1) The application of article 5 of the Investment Code to the case at issue\n364. \u00a0The Respondent states that article 5 of the Investment Code stipulates \"that, in the case of\u00a0expropriation, the investor is entitled to just, adequate compensation, to be determined\u00a0according to the usual rules and practices in international law\" and that, in this case, the\u00a0parties stipulated by contract the just and adequate compensation for the consequences of an\u00a0expropriation in articles 32.5 and 32.3 of the Concession Agreement.467\n365. Thus, article 32.5 constitutes a special agreement governing the just compensation for the\u00a0prejudice claimed in the framework of a treaty claim resulting from the termination of the\u00a0Concession Agreement, following an act of the Public Authorities468 and the indemnities of\u00a0article 32.3 covering all of the consequences of the alleged expropriation, and in particular loss\u00a0of profit469. The Respondent considers moreover, that:\nThe Tribunal must therefore apply the indemnification agreement concluded by the parties, in accordance with the principles of autonomy of will and the binding force of the contract,\u00a0which are both general principles of international law. It is only if the contract makes no\u00a0provision to this effect that it can apply the general standards of international law, the\u00a0purpose of which is merely suppletive.\n462 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 504.\n462 Wena Hotels Limited versus the Arab Republic of Egypt, ICSID ARB/98/4, Award.

The Respondent concludes that, as the value of the investment in the event of the loss thereof,\u00a0following termination by an act of the Public Authorities, is defined by article 32.2 of the\u00a0agreement, it also corresponds to the \"just and adequate compensation\" referred to in article\u00a05 of the Investment Code. \"It is therefore this amount which shall be awarded to the Claimants\u00a0in the event that the Tribunal were to consider that the Claimants are entitled to\u00a0indemnification.'\"\u201971\n367. The Respondent contends moreover that there is no contradiction to the detriment of others\u00a0in requesting, in a subsidiary capacity, the application of the all-inclusive indemnification\u00a0agreement concluded by the parties, in the event that the Tribunal were to consider that the\u00a0Claimants are entitled to indemnification472, and that, in all events, the indemnification\u00a0agreement constitutes the lex specialis of international law, which applies to the consequences\u00a0of the termination of the Concession Agreement caused by an act of the Public Authorities.473\u00a0The Respondent explains this in the following manner:\nPursuant to the aforementioned article 5 of the Investment Code, the rules governing compensation in the domain of expropriation are to be found in the standards of\u00a0international law in the broad sense, and this includes investment contracts such as the\u00a0Concession Agreement.... In the instance of a state contract, the rules governing\u00a0compensation of the agreement are based on international law, and in particular on the\u00a0principle of pacta sunt servanda which is at the top of the hierarchy of international law\u00a0standards. Of all the standards of international law, which are potentially applicable, articles\u00a032.5 and 32.3 of the Concession Agreement therefore constitute the lex speciali by which the\u00a0parties explicitly stipulated the rules governing the indemnification of the consequences of the\u00a0termination of the Concession Agreement as a result of an act of the Public Authorities.\n(2) Article 6 of the Investment Code\n368. The Respondent presents no arguments on this point.\nC. The Tribunal's Analysis\n369. \u00a0In their arbitration request, the Claimants charged the Respondent with having dispossessed\u00a0them in a discriminating manner, without prompt, fair, adequate indemnification, in breach of\u00a0Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Investment Code and/or in breach of customary international law.\u00a0The violation of Article 7 however was not discussed and no longer appears in their\u00a0subsequent statements. Thus, this Arbitral Tribunal shall limit itself to the enacting terms\u00a0reiterated in paragraph 471 of the Post-Hearing Memorial which mentions only the violations,\u00a0by both the Termination Decree and by the requisition Decree, of Articles 5 and 6 of the\u00a0Investment Code and, in a subsidiary capacity, of the minimum standard of treatment\u00a0pursuant to customary international law.\n470 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 261-262.\n471 Dupl; \u00a7\u00a7 268-269.\n472 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 280-285.\n473 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 286-293.\n88\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 96 of 173\n(1) Article 5 of the Investment Code\n370 Article 5 stipulates this:\nThe Guinean State takes no expropriation or nationalization measure regarding investments made by persons or companies subject to cases of public utility established on the conditions\u00a0stipulated by law.\nIn the case of public utility, the expropriation measures must not be discriminating and must provide a faire, sufficient compensation for an amount to be determined according to the\u00a0usual rules and practices of international law.47\u201c\na. The Termination Decree\n371. This Arbitral Tribunal has already noted that it does not suffice to call the termination of a\u00a0contract a \"expropriation\" to make the Investment Code applicable. The Claimants consider\u00a0however that termination constitutes an expropriation because (i) it was carried out by a\u00a0presidential Decree, (ii) it refers to no contractual non-execution, and (iii) it does not respect\u00a0the contractual provisions for a termnation.475\n372. \u00a0Regarding these factors, the Arbitral Tribunal notes the following:\n(i) \u00a0The president's intervention is surprising inasmuch as the Transport Minister and the\u00a0Minister of the Economy and Finance had signed the agreement and were therefore the\u00a0persons authorized to terminate the contract.\n(ii) \u00a0The Decree mentions explicitly that the Agreement is terminated \"for failures to meet the\u00a0concession-holder's obligations\", without however specifying the grievances.\n(iii) The holder of the concession was not ordered by a written notice of the failures to\u00a0remedy this situation and did not, within a grace period of 60 days, as required under\u00a0Article 32.2.\n373. There is no question that this makes the termination irregular, and contractually faulty.\u00a0According to the Claimants, this \"contractual fault, due to its seriousness, also constitutes a\u00a0violation of the Investment Code and of customary international law\u201c75\n374. The Arbitral Tribunal is aware of the doctrine quoted by the Claimants according to which the\u00a0termination of a contract can constitute an expropriation. However, as the Claimants\u00a0acknowledge, \"in order to fall within the scope of international law, such termination must\u00a0however display certain characteristics; in particular, it must result from a powerful public act\u00a0in which the State acts above and beyond the contractual framework.\n375. This Arbitral Tribunal considers that the contractualization carried out under Article 32.5 of the\u00a0Agreement, of Acts by the Public Authorities entail the termination of the concession, the\u00a0specific of the first file and permits a distinction between the case law mentioned by the\u00a0Claimants. 477 . Thus, the form given to the termination decision, namely that of a presidential\n474 Investment Code of Guinea, Order no. 001/PRG/87 of January 3, 19087 (R-l).\n475 Mem; \u00a7\u00a7 431-447.\n476 M.AAC \u00a7 319.\n89\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 97 of 173\nDecree, does not suffice to remove it from the context of the agreement, which stipulates explicitly in article 32.5 the acts of the Public Authorities. The result of termination would have\u00a0been the same if the ministers in office had made the decision to terminate instead of the\u00a0president. In any event, the contract to isolation of the acts of the Public Authorities, including\u00a0the expropriation which the termination of the contract represents, implies that this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal entertained jurisdiction, even for wrongful termination.\n376. The subsequent granting of the concession to Bollor\u00e9 is also quoted by the Claimants, as\u00a0evidenced of the dispossessing nature of the termination. The Arbitral Tribunal notes,\u00a0however, that Bollor\u00e9 was classified second following the evaluation of the bids of and that the\u00a0Claimants did not prove that the Guinean public contract code required a new invitation for\u00a0tenders before being able to the award the concession or that this awarding was in any other\u00a0way wrongful under the Guinean law.478 The fact that it is proven that termination was\u00a0inspired by the presidents wish to grant the concession to Bollor\u00e9, could confirm that the\u00a0concession was not terminated in the public interest, but this does not suffice to requalify\u00a0termination as expropriation.\n377. On the other hand, the presidents public announcement of his intention to terminate the\u00a0Getma International contract479 , the reading on the 8 PM news on the same day of the\u00a0effectiveness of the Termination Decree480 , even before it had been notified and the\u00a0enlistment of soldiers and policemen, beginning at 9 PM, before the offices of STCC on the CT\u00a0481 are indeed aggravating and vexatious circumstances which go beyond the termination,\u00a0regardless of its form, and constitute acts of the Public Authorities, other than termination.\n378. Concerning the evidence of these deeds which exceed the framework of termination, the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal notes that Mr. Malone's affidavit is more reliable than the press article which\u00a0the Claimants quote in extenso as follows:482 \"The Port of Conakry, outside nighttime. On\u00a0March 8, at around 9 PM, a squad of policeman and Guinean soldiers, carrying Kalashnikovs,\u00a0take over the docks harboring cranes and containers. The commando jumps onto the offices of\u00a0Getma International, the French company, which has exploited the port zone since 2008. The\u00a0employees are evicted manu militari; the premises securely locked. \"Requisition\"? The order\u00a0comes from the presidential palace.\"483 The article clearly mixes up the events of the evening\u00a0of March 8th 2011, following the Termination Decree but preceding the requisition Decree,\u00a0with those of March 9, 2011, following the requisition Decree. According to Mr. Barone, the\u00a0evening of March 8th, at around 9 p.m., soldiers and policemen \"were in the process of taking\n478 the Claimants assert that the Bollor\u00e9 contract is more advantageous than theirs, but do not prove that this\u00a0makes it illegal, nor that they exercised action against this allegedly wrongful awarding.\n479 In an interview of President Alpha Cond\u00e9 on the website of the television channel France 24 placed online\u00a0on February 6, 2012 (C-227), the president declared: \"before my election, I told friends who have supported me\u00a0that if I won, I would annul this contract. [...] This undertaking made no investment in the Port, go look at the\u00a0Port. Therefore, they sign the contract on the basis of lies, stating that they managed many ports, whereas they\u00a0managed no ports anywhere.

They were joined\u00a0by a certain number of drivers and maintenance personnel...There must have been about sixty\u00a0persons in front of the offices; The employees were in a state of shock and traumatized by\u00a0what they were seeing;..the armed forces, as though they were arresting criminals\".\n379. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore concludes that, contrary to that which the press articles quoted\u00a0by the Claimants and above all the comic strip produced as exhibit C-203 (p. 8) imply, during\u00a0the night of March 8, 2011, the soldiers and the policemen did not \"jump\" onto Getma's\u00a0offices, by force in the company of Bollor\u00e9's representatives, nor did they evict its personnel.\u00a0Nonetheless, the presence of soldiers and policemen in front of the offices on the eve of\u00a0March 8, 2011, while the requisition Decree had not yet been adopted, is an act of the Public\u00a0Authorities, which is not at all necessary for terminating a contract, and for which the\u00a0Respondent did not proffer the slightest justification. This was an act of the Public Authorities\u00a0which is not covered by the Agreement and which constitutes a violation of the most basic\u00a0standard of treatment under customary international law.\n380. We shall see further down, in Chapter VII, whether and what damage, other than that of\u00a0termination itself, these aggravating circumstances caused the Claimants.\nb. The requisition Decree\n381. The requisition Decree of March 9, 2011 was pronounced \"considering the necessity of the\u00a0continuity of the public services provided in the Conakry Container Terminal\"486 and it\u00a0concerned \"the personnel, equipment, facilities, real property and assets which the Guinean\u00a0State] deems necessary, belonging to Getma International and to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Terminal \u00e0\u00a0Conteneurs [Container Terminal Company of Conakry]\".\n382. \u00a0It is not contested that this was an act of the Public Authorities, but the Claimants consider\u00a0furthermore that the requisition constitutes an illegal expropriation, even if the requisition was\u00a0only temporary. 487 They base their argument not only on what they call \"the Harvard\u00a0Agreement\" (but which to date is merely a project), but also on the Wena Hotels versus Egypt\u00a0and Middle East Cement versus Egypt cases.488\n383. This Arbitral Tribunal considers that indeed the requisition for over three months constitutes\u00a0an illegal expropriation, if and inasmuch as the State did not pay compensation for the losses\u00a0sustained by the Claimants and STCC, even if the assets were subsequently returned. The\u00a0consequence of the restitution of the assets on June 22, 2011 was that the expropriation was\u00a0only temporary, which will have an impact on the determination of the indemnification owed.\n484 \u00a7 4 of Claude Barone's affidavit of November 14 72014.\n485 \u00a7 5 of Claude Barone's affidavit of November 14, 2014.\n486 Requisition Decree (C-21).\n487 Indeed, the requisition was lifted on June 22, 2011 with, as sole justification, other than the references to\u00a0legal texts, \"the necessities of operations and the implementation of the Conakry Container Terminal extension\u00a0project\" (C-26).\n488 Mem ; \u00a7 504.\n91\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 99 of 173\n(2) Article 6 of the Investment Code\n384. \u00a0Article 6 is worded as follows:\n1) Subject to the laws and regulations of the Republic, foreign natural persons and legal entities duly established in Guinea receive the same treatment as Guinean citizens regarding\u00a0the rights and obligations pertaining to the pursuit of their activities. 489\n385. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the resorting to law enforcement was excessive and it has not\u00a0been proven that the acts of intimidation of the Claimants' personnel which accompanied the\u00a0requisition were necessary, duly warranted or proportionate.\n386. The Arbitral Tribunal recalls that any administrative measure or act of the Public Authorities\u00a0must be duly warranted and proportional to the goal pursued; this constitutes a general\u00a0principle which applies also under Guinean law. This principle is essential in any state\u00a0governed by law in order to avoid arbitrary actions. It applies in both civil and administrative\u00a0and criminal matters, and for foreigners and for citizens. In this sense, the Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0notes that the Government's actions toward the Claimants exceeded its prerogatives.\n387. The Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the requisition act and the measures which accompanied\u00a0termination did not respect Article 6 of the Investment Code.\n388. \u00a0Similarly, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the foreign investors were not treated in\u00a0accordance with the basis standards of international law.\nVII. COMPENSATION FOR THE PREJUDICE\nA. The Claimants' Position\n(1) The Claimants are entitled to full compensation and an outright sum in indemnification pursuant to Article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement does not apply\n389. According to the Claimants, compensation for the prejudice resulting from Guinea's violation\u00a0of the Investment Code and Customary International Law must be calculated in accordance\u00a0with Customary International Law. Thus, in evoking the Chorzow case and the UN\u00a0International Law Committee, the Claimants contend that the compensation for the damage\u00a0sustained must comply with the principle of compensation in full.490\n390. They also consider that:491\n\"The Investment Code (and Article 5, para. 2 thereof) governs the measure of compensation only as the condition of a lawful expropriation. Such a measure cannot therefore not\u00a0constitute a direct basis for determining the compensation measure owed for an unlawful\u00a0expropriation, thereby making it necessary to refer to customary international law and the\u00a0criterion of indemnification which it stipulates in cases of unlawful expropriation. \"\n489 The Investment Code of Guinea, Order no. 001/PRG/87 of January 3,1987 (R-l).\n490 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 523-531 ; Case of the Chorzow Factory (request for indemnity) (merits), Permanent International\u00a0Court of Justice, Recueil des Arrets, Series A - no. 17, Sept. 13,1928, p. 47 - (C.263).\n491 Mem. \u00a7 535.\n92\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 100 of 173\nAnd that:\n\"In any event, the criterion of compensation of Article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement was not intended to apply in this casef93\n391. The Claimants claim that the standard of full compensation implies more precisely \"that one\u00a0adopt the hypothetical scenario in which the Concession Agreement has been executed to\u00a0term\" and consequently \"all contractual provisions pertaining to the indemnification owed in\u00a0the case of the termination of said agreement cannot be taken into account.'\"193\n392. \u00a0Regarding the two arguments raised by the Respondent, it considers (i) that Guinea's invoking\u00a0of article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement and the pacta sunt servanda principle is not\u00a0admissible, although it itself violated its various contractual agreements on several\u00a0occasions49'\u2019, and (ii) that the lex specialis principle cannot lead to the fact that the agreement\u00a0(a contractual agreement) can prevail over an established rule of public international law,\u00a0stipulating full compensation; moreover the agreement was \"repudiated\" by the Termination\u00a0Decree and article 323 thereof can therefore not apply.495\n(2) Amount of compensation\n393. The Claimants are requesting compensation for four counts of prejudice: (i) the loss of future\u00a0income caused by the termination of the Concession Agreement (also called the \"loss of\u00a0profit\"); (ii) the prejudice linked to the requisition; (\u00a1ii) the additional prejudice resulting from\u00a0termination; and (iv) the moral prejudice.496\n394. Regarding the loss of future income, the Claimants have submitted a report by PwC based on\u00a0the method of updated, or discounted, cash flow (DCF) taking into account as point of\u00a0departure the value of the concession on the date of termination, which they considered as\u00a0the date of the evaluation. The report establishes two cash flows (based on two different\u00a0hypotheses on inflation) until the end of the Concession Agreement, namely the year 2034, for\u00a0the amount of 1,134,548 million GNF and 882,607 million GNF. The two assumptions are then\u00a0updated by the capital cost rate and the cost of the debt. The average of the two assumptions\u00a0leads PwC to conclude that the value of the concession at March 8, 2011 (date of the\u00a0Termination Decree) was \u20ac105,000,000, and that as Getma International owned 98.125% of\u00a0STCC, the prejudice of loss of profit, amounts to 103,031,250 euros for the Claimants.497\n395. \u00a0In their rejoinder, the Claimants, based on a second PwC report, revised these amounts\u00a0upwards: having modified the estimated rate of inflation, as well as the fiscal burden, PwC\u00a0determines in its second report, the value of the concession at \u20ac124 and \u20ac97.5 million in the\u00a0two respective assumptions, which gives an average value of \u20ac110.5 million498, of which the\u00a0Claimants are claiming 98.125%, or \u20ac108,428,125.499\n492 Mem. \u00a7 536.\n493 Mem. \u00a7 538.\n494 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 453-460\n495 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 536-539; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 461-471.\n496 It is noteworthy that the Claimants do not consider that the requisition alone is an expropriation, and as\u00a0seen above, termination is, according to them, one of the aspects of expropriation of which they were the\u00a0victims\n497 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 543-570.\n498 Second PwC report, \u00a7 219.\n499 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 578-589.\n93\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 101 of 173\n396. \u00a0In their rejoinder, the Claimants contend that PwC's calculation assumption corresponds to the\u00a0price of sale of the concession at a given time, but that this constitutes merely a working\u00a0assumption which does not require that a sale be effectively authorized at a given time under\u00a0the Concession Agreement itself\u2122. They also contend that the evaluation must indeed be\u00a0made at March 8, 2011 with the information available on this date (and not on the date of\u00a0PwC's report), without article 7.2 of the agreement departing from this principle, particularly\u00a0as international law places the evaluation on the date of expropriation501. Lastly, they proffer\u00a0that, if Guinea would like to prove that they in fact derived a profit from termination, the\u00a0Respondent must produce evidence of this affirmation502. They add that PwC's model is based\u00a0on solid assumptions because, contrary to that which the Respondent asserts, they had the\u00a0capacities to finance the investments and the method for calculating projected growth in\u00a0container traffic and prices is described in precise detail by PwC.503\n397. Regarding the additional prejudice caused by the Termination Decree, the Claimants are\u00a0claiming reimbursement of certain costs which, according to them, are independent of the loss\u00a0of profit, namely:504\nThe costs of repatriating the requisitioned equipment for the amount of \u20ac734,212. They specify in their rejoinder that it is commonplace in concessions that the Grantor buyback\u00a0the equipment, following the contract505.\nCrisis management costs for the amount of \u20ac258,834. They add in their rejoinder that these costs are linked directly to Guinea's specific fault, and that even the costs already\u00a0incurred prior to the Termination Decree are owed because they are \"the direct material\u00a0consequences of this breach\".506\nThe wage costs caused by the laying off of several employees, for the amount of \u20ac65,456. They specify in their rejoinder that labor law obligations in terms of reclassification and\u00a0paid leave, do not leave the Claimants any alternative for the two employees concerned,\u00a0other than layoffs507.\n398. \u00a0Regarding the prejudice caused by the requisition, the Claimants consider that they are entitled\u00a0to the following:508\nReimbursement of the costs of repairing the requisitioned operating equipment. They consider that two cranes and five container removal vehicles were considerably damaged,\u00a0and that the cost of their repair amounts to \u20ac1,151,508. They specify in their rejoinder\u00a0that the damage indeed occurred during the period of the requisition, and not prior\u00a0thereto.509\nThe reimbursement of stocks (such as gasoline or spare parts for handling machinery) which were part of the requisition equipment and which they recovered only partially at\n500 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 509-513.\n501 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 514-540.\n502 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 548-558\n503 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 559-599.\n504 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 601-615, Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 600-614.\n505 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 602-606; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 600-604.\n506 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 607-609; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 605-610.\n507 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 610-615; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 611-614.\n508 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 571-600.\n509 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 571-587; Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 615-622.\n94\nCase 1-.19-CV-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 102 of 173\nthe time of the lifting of the requisition, for the amount of 210,070 euros530. They specify in their rejoinder that these stocks were consumed by Guinea, and that the amount\u00a0claimed in this capacity is not part of the indemnification for the value of the concession,\u00a0which was calculated on the basis of the DCF method and therefore does not include the\u00a0book value of the stocks at March 8, 2O115\u20191.\nPayment of these services performed by STCC, but not invoiced on the date of the requisition, for the amount of \u20ac589,418. They explain that due to the requisition, it was\u00a0impossible to know whether the goods had been delivered to their owners512 and that\u00a0invoices could be issued only on the basis of documents in its successor's possession513.\u00a0They add that their expert accountant, PwC, verified that the data produced by the\u00a0Getport software program, based on which they calculated this prejudice, are reliable.514\u00a0Lastly, they confirm that the amount of the invoices to be issued is not included in the\u00a02011 sales used for calculating the value of the concession and that this prejudice is\u00a0therefore not one in the same with the loss of profit515.\n399. \u00a0Regarding the moral prejudice, the Claimants recall first of all the recognition of the principle\u00a0of compensation for this type of prejudice under international law and consider that moral\u00a0prejudice can consist \"in prejudice caused to the credit or reputation of a natural person or\u00a0legal entity\" and in a prejudice caused to the legal entity516 for \"physical violence exercised on\u00a0a company's personnel\".517\n400. \u00a0The Claimants consider that their moral prejudice is of the seriousness required for\u00a0entitlement to indemnification518, but nonetheless recall that doctrine is of the opinion that\u00a0moral damage opposes this different treatment of material damage519. They emphasize the\u00a0suddenness of the termination and the requisition, which, according to them was conducted\u00a0by a unit of soldiers and armed policeman, in a hostile tense atmosphere, in which the\u00a0employees were \"requisitioned\" and \"the premises were partially looted\". Furthermore, the\u00a0Claimants suffered an undermining of their image, due to the fact of the propagation of the\u00a0erroneous idea by the President of the Republic, the Bollor\u00e9 group and the national and\u00a0international press that Necotrans was a \"substandard\" and \"faulty\" operator, following the\u00a0termination and granting of the contract to the Bollor\u00e9 company, its direct competitor.520\n401. The Claimants consider that they are entitled to an indemnification of \u20ac1,000,000 on this\u00a0count.521\nS1\u00b0 Mem \u00a7\u00a7588-593.\n511 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 623-632.\n512 Mem. \u00a7 599.\n513 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 637-638.\n514 Repl. \u00a7 639 and PwC report of July 10, 2015 \u00a7\u00a7 240-243.\n515 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 6365-636.\n516 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 616-617 (quoting the Desert Line Projects LCC versus Republic of Yemen case, ICSID ARB/05/17,\u00a0Award, Feb. 6, 2008, (C-267); and Opinion in the cases of Lusitania, Joint Germany- USA Commission, Nov. 1st,\u00a01923, Recueil des sentences arbitrales, Volume VII, pp. 32-44, p. 40, (C-280)).\n517 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 618-619.\n518 Mem. \u00a7 620 (quoting Franck Charles Arif versus the Republic of Moldavia, ICSID ARB/11/23, Award, April 8,\u00a02013, (C-282); Joseph Charles Lemire versus the Republic of Ukraine, ICSID ARB/06/18, Award, March 28, 2011,\u00a0(C-281)).\n519 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 641-649.\n520 Mem. \u00a7 620 and Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 650-669.\n521 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 616-624, Repl \u00a7\u00a7 640-669.\n95\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 103 of 173\n402. \u00a0Regarding interest, the Claimants are requesting payment of interest, capitalized annually at\u00a0the rate of 8.7%, from March 8, 2011 onwards'\"''\u2019. They specify in their rejoinder that this\u00a0interest is indeed owed to them in order to indemnify them for the lapsing of the period of\u00a0time between the date of the expropriation and the date of the payment of the indemnity and\u00a0that this interest was calculated at July 10, 2015, at the sum of \u20ac160,087,489.523\n(3) The allegations of double compensation\n403. \u00a0Regarding the issue of double compensation, the Claimants consider first of all that the\u00a0Respondent is ill-advised to invoke this argument, inasmuch as (i) to date, the Claimants have\u00a0obtained no payment pursuant to the CCJA award, and (ii) the Respondent filed action for the\u00a0annulment of said award - which in the interim has been confirmed.524 Furthermore, this issue\u00a0is not a new one in ICSID arbitration, and the Tribunal has full freedom in its enacting terms to\u00a0reduce the compensation awarded based on other payments effectively received from Guinea\u00a0(and not merely awarded by the CCJA Tribunal). The Claimants quote several ICSID awards and\u00a0one decision of the Paris Court of Appeal which adopted this solution in the case of parallel\u00a0procedures.525\n404. \u00a0The Claimants consider that the Respondent's position consisting in taking into account only\u00a0the amounts invested on the date of termination, to then consider that the Claimants had\u00a0already recovered a portion of the sums by operating the CT, disregards the principle of full\u00a0compensation, including the loss of profit.526\nB. The Respondent's position\n(1) The all-inclusive indemnification referred to in article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement is applicable and requires that all indemnification be strictly appreciated\n405. The Respondent contends that article 32.3 of the Concession Agreement, which stipulates\u00a0Guinea's payment of an all-inclusive termination indemnification, covers all of the\u00a0consequences of the alleged expropriation.527\n406. \u00a0More precisely, the Respondent quotes several legal sources who confirmed the possibility of\u00a0stipulating an all-inclusive indemnification agreement in international arbitration.528 It then\u00a0contends that the all-inclusive sum covers all requests, because (i) the loss of profit is included\u00a0in the expression \"to compensate the loss of activity\" of article 32.3, and (ii) the list of the\u00a0indemnities in article 32.3 (which includes unamortized assets or severance pay) is\u00a0exhaustive529. It adds in its Replication that the addition of article 32.3 had been explicitly\u00a0requested by Getma International, during the process of concluding the agreement and had\u00a0been worded in a precise sophisticated manner in order to cover the entire prejudice\n522 Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 625-630.\n523 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 670-677.\n524 The CCJA award has since been annulled in a decision of the CCJA of November 30, 2015.\n525 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 472-488.\n526 Repl. \u00a7\u00a7 489-504.\n527 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 350-353.\n528 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 334-346\n529 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 347-354\n96\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 104 of 173\nsustained in the event of termination, while avoiding the Concessionary's enrichment in the case of premature termination?10\n407. \u00a0The two principles which the Respondent would like the Tribunal to apply are (i) pacta sunt\u00a0servanda, namely the fact that, as the parties reached a contractual agreement regarding the\u00a0compensation to pay in the event of termination, it is not possible to apply the principle of full\u00a0compensation resulting, according to the Claimants, from international law\u201c131 and (ii)\u00a0moreover, the Agreement constitutes a lex specialis which permits a departure from the\u00a0common law governing compensation without its being possible that the termination of the\u00a0Concession Agreement imply the non-application of the indemnification agreement it\u00a0contains.532\n408. \u00a0In its Replication, the Respondent adds that the principle of estoppel inhibits the Claimants\u00a0from contesting the application of article 32.5. Whereas if the argument they presented (and,\u00a0on which they obtained compensation) before the CCJA a Tribunal, and that on its side, it\u00a0never waived its right to invoke the indemnification agreement (either by another alleged\u00a0termination of the agreement, which would entail the non-applicability of the all-inclusive\u00a0agreement, according to the Claimants, or by the principle of estoppel, the conditions of the\u00a0application of which have not been met in the case at issue).533\n409. The Respondent considers furthermore that the Tribunal must adopt a strict vision of the\u00a0alleged counts of prejudice, in order to avoid all unwarranted increment of wealth, considering\u00a0that on the date of termination, the results of the operation permitted Getma International to\u00a0cover all of the investments it had made534.\n410. \u00a0In this capacity, it contends that the Claimants already received, during the operation.,\u00a0\u20ac20,000,000, which covers, according to the Respondent, their entry ticket, as well as the\u00a0investments in the work performed, corresponding to the amount of approximately \u20ac3\u00a0million.535 Furthermore, the Claimants recovered all of the equipment fully for an amount of\u00a0\u20ac10-\u20ac12 million.536\n(2) Amount of compensation\n411. For loss of profit, the Respondent's main position consists in contending that this prejudice is\u00a0already covered by the all-inclusive indemnification of article 32.3, which constituted the basis\u00a0for the CCJA award, and which is designed to compensate the loss of activity.\n412. \u00a0In a subsidiary capacity, the Respondent criticizes PwC's calculation method.537\nIt considers first of all that the calculation premise (PwC sought on March 8, 2011, the price of the sale of the concession to a potential third-party) is erroneous and ineffective\u00a0because the agreement could not be sold pursuant to article 7.2 of the Concession\u00a0Agreement, which prohibited such sale.\n530 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 246-258.\n531 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 359-365 ; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 259-269.\n532 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 366-376; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 286-298.\n533 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 270-285.\n534 C-Mem. \u00a7 505.\n535 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 500-502\n536 C-Mem. \u00a7 503.\n537 C-Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 509-533 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 377-433.\n97\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 105 of 173\nPwC should have taken into account all of the \"ex post\" data and information known on the date of the evaluation, and not only the information available on March 8, 2011. In\u00a0particular, the value of the concession should have been calculated by taking into account\u00a0all the cash flow which the pursuit of the agreement would have generated over the\u00a0period of 2011 to 203453K. According to the Respondent, taking account of all the ex post\u00a0factors complies with the principle of full compensation singled out in the Chorzow case\u00a0presented by the Claimants, which is to reposition the investor in a financial situation\u00a0identical to the situation it would have been in had the damaging event not occurred.539\u00a0This method also permits a precise, coherent evaluation5'\u20190 of the loss of profit and avoids\u00a0at the same time the punitive nature of the indemnification5'11.\nPwC could not add to the value of the concession the interest on arrears between March 8, 2011, and the date of the award, inasmuch as in the event of the maintaining of the\u00a0concession, the Claimants would never have been credited at March 8, 2011, with a sum\u00a0equal to the value of the concession. The Respondent adds that interest is not\u00a0automatically granted in international law, that the all-inclusive agreement excludes the\u00a0addition of interest, particularly for the prejudice for loss of profit, and that the granting\u00a0of interest must be excluded for the period during which the Claimants, prolonged the\u00a0procedure, with no grounds before this Arbitral Tribunal .542\nPwC did not take into account the Claimants, poor financial situation and ignores the fact that they would have been unable to finance the investments, including for the second\u00a0terminal, and that consequently all of PwC's financial projections based on the existence\u00a0of the second terminal, and the increase in volumes and fees thought to result therefrom\u00a0must be disregarded543.\nPwC ignores the profits which the Claimants derived from termination, for example by not having to accumulate debts because the Claimants released from their obligation to\u00a0mobilize 77.7 million in funds to make the CT investments544.\n413. Regarding the accounting aspects of the calculation of loss of profit, the Respondent contends\u00a0that:545\nThe sales (constituting the basis for calculating updated cash flow) were overestimated because (i) PwC does not explain how the container volume handled was calculated, while\u00a0Guinea's growth prospects are not optimistic, (ii) the calculation of the evolution in the\u00a0price of services per container, did not take account of real inflation;\nThe cost projections taken into account by PwC are not presented in detail and can therefore not be verified;\n538 Dupl. \u00a7 380.\n539 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 380-398\n540 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 399-403.\n541 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 404-406.\n542 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7416-433.\n543 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 407-410.\n544 Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7411-415\n545 C-Mem ; \u00a7\u00a7 534-549 ; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 435-472.\n98\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 106 of 173\nthe rate of the updating of cash flow is poorly calculated because the market risk premium utilized by PwC was not accurate and the country risk premium was\u00a0underestimated.\n414. The Respondent concludes that, on October 30, 2015, the value of the concession taken at\u00a0March 8, 2011 was \u20ac30 million or 33 million constant euros.5'\u20196\n415. Regarding the additional prejudice caused by the Termination Decree 5\u201c7, the Respondent\u00a0contends that (i) the repatriation costs are unwarranted because in all events the Grantor had\u00a0no obligation to recover the equipment, which therefore would nonetheless have had to be\u00a0repatriated, (ii) crisis management costs are unrelated to termination because they\u00a0correspond to services rendered prior to the Termination Decree and are not connected to this\u00a0litigation, (iii) the wages were paid because the Claimants decided to keep the employees at\u00a0issue on the premises where they rendered further services for that matter; and that the first\u00a0two counts of prejudice are also covered by the indemnification referred to in article 32.2.\n416. Regarding the prejudice caused by the requisition 548 the Respondent contends that:\nthe costs of repairing the equipment are unwarranted because (i) the same request was made and rejected before the CCJA, and (ii) the real cause of the damage is Getma\u00a0International's poor maintenance during the operation of the CT as established, according\u00a0to the Respondent, in the reports presented by the Claimants; lastly, the report presented\u00a0by the Claimants in their rejoinder supposedly to prove the good condition of the\u00a0equipment on the date of the requisition is very limited (only two cranes) and the\u00a0Respondent wonders why this report was not presented to the CCJA Tribunal, given its\u00a0relevance.\nThe value of the stocks not returned implies that the Claimants did not effectively recover them, which they are not able to prove549; the Claimants had an inventory taken of their\u00a0property by a bailiff on March 12, 2011 and their defense argument that no physical\u00a0inventory of their stocks could be performed on March 8, 2011 therefore does not justify\u00a0their present calculation of the value of the stocks which were allegedly not returned550;\n546 Dupl. \u00a7 469.\n547 C-Mem \u00a7\u00a7 550-567; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 473-479\n548 C-Mem \u00a7\u00a7 568-606; Dupl. \u00a7\u00a7 484-499\n549 C-Mem \u00a7\u00a7 594-597; Dupl. \u00a7 496\n550 Dupl. \u00a7 469 and Mem.

They recall that the Claimants had had access to the PAC after the\u00a0requisition, as proven by the inventory of March 12, 2011 and the expert inspection of a\u00a0Gottwald Crane performed on April 15, 201155''.\n417. \u00a0Regarding the moral prejudice, the Respondent contends that, even if this type of prejudice\u00a0was acknowledged in the arbitration, it requires, for entitlement to damages, the existence of\u00a0exceptional circumstances when the alleged facts are particularly serious, especially when it is\u00a0invoked by a legal entity, and quotes several ICSID awards in this domain555.\n418. The Respondent then considers that no exceptional circumstances warrant here the granting\u00a0of damages for moral prejudice because (i) a contractual failure cannot suffice, particularly if\u00a0as is the case here it is repaired by an all-inclusive indemnification556, (ii) the presence of the\u00a0police force and the Army does not constitute a unit as the Claimants contend and\u00a0corresponds to the normal exercise of public authority, particularly in that the Claimants have\u00a0not proven that they resorted to the use of force557, (iii) the so-called looting by the PAC's\u00a0employees and the Bollor\u00e9 company is alleged only in a statement by a witness and the simple\u00a0stress of an employee cannot be qualified as moral prejudice, and the Claimants had access to\u00a0the TAC during the requisition period558 and (iv) the undermining of the image has not been\u00a0proven inasmuch as the Claimants refocused their activities on a different type of container\u00a0and even work with the Bollor\u00e9 company on certain projects559.\n(3) Double Damages\n419. The defendant considers that if the Claimants obtained the full compensation which they are\u00a0claiming in this case, they will have received double the amount in damages for the same\u00a0prejudice560. It insists on the fact that the same requests were already made before the CCJA\u00a0Tribunal and that this Tribunal awarded:\n\u20ac20,884,966 for the all-inclusive termination indemnification for which the amount of hundred and \u20ac103,031,250 was requested based on the future income of the concession,\u00a0and would cover according to the defendant the entire amount of the indemnity owed in\u00a0the event of expropriation;\n\u20ac210,070 for the goods returned which would also correspond to the indemnity requested for the unreturned stocks;\n\u20ac734,212 for the costs of repatriating the operating equipment and \u20ac258,834 for the crisis management costs, included in the amount of \u20ac38,321,057 granted to Getma\u00a0International pursuant to article 32.3 of the agreement561.\n420. The Respondent contends that it does not suffice to \"offset the sums possibly granted\u00a0pursuant to this procedure against those effectively paid by the Republic of Guinea for the\u00a0same counts of prejudice pursuant to the CCJA arbitration, to avoid this risk of double\u00a0indemnification562.\"\n100\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 108 of 173\n421. \u00a0According to the Respondent, \"the only way of avoiding all risks of double indemnification is\u00a0therefore to establish that the Claimants have already obtained a sentence against the\u00a0Republic of Guinea to pay indemnifications\" requested by the Claimants. If this were not the\u00a0case, the Republic of Guinea could be in the possession of two writs of execution, both\u00a0ordering pecuniary sentences for the same counts of prejudice.\n422. \u00a0The Respondent alleges first of all that the Claimants are not acting in good faith because\u00a0without contesting that they obtained indemnification for the counts of prejudice they are\u00a0again bringing before the ICSID Tribunal, they nonetheless do not deduct from the amounts\u00a0requested in this procedure the sums already awarded by the CCJA Tribunal563.\n423. Therefore according to the Respondent, there is a risk surrounding the Claimants argument\u00a0according to which full damages should be awarded to them, it's being up to them to execute\u00a0the ICSID award only partially so as to recover only the surplus of the sums to which they\u00a0would be entitled, particularly since Guinea will not be able to prevent the parallel\u00a0enforcement of the CCJA and ICSID awards564. Indeed, according to the Respondent no\u00a0contractual mechanism exists compelling the Claimants to reimburse sums collected twice, or\u00a0any mechanism whatsoever which we would permit the Republic of Guinea to avoid double\u00a0indemnification, thereby creating a true risk of an unwarranted increase of wealth565.\n424 The Respondent adds that its action for the annulment of the CCJA award does not at all dispel the risk of twofold compensation. It contends that the Tribunal must take all necessary\u00a0precautions to avoid this risk566 and concludes by urging the Tribunal to simply deduct the\u00a0amounts awarded by the CCJA Tribunal from any compensation it may grant in this\u00a0procedure.567\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tribunal's analysis\n(1) \u00a0\u00a0The principles of compensation\n425. As the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the consequences of the termination, there\u00a0is no cause to rule on the requests for indemnification for the damaging consequences of\u00a0termination, or the loss of profit and additional prejudice resulting from termination, which\u00a0were established as a set amount by agreement of the Parties.\n426. The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore not dwell on the following items:\n(i) \u00a0The costs of repatriating the equipment, which are a consequence of termination (as was\u00a0decided for that matter by the CCJA Tribunal568);\n(ii) \u00a0The wages of the two employees during the latency period which followed the\u00a0Termination Decree (\u20ac 65 456) which were a consequence of termination and Getma\u00a0International's internal decision to maintain the personnel. According to Article 32.5 of\u00a0the Agreement, a maximum of 75 days could lapse between the Public Authority's Act and\u00a0termination; in the event of termination on the basis of Article 32.3, there would have\u00a0been 60 days between the notice of the grievances and termination. In both cases,\u00a0Getma International itself would have had to absorb the costs of the latency, its being\n566 Dupl \u00a7\u00a7348-350.\n567 Dupl ; \u00a7\u00a7 369-376.\n568 CCJA award \u00a7 256\n101\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 109 of 173\nunderstood that Article 32.3 stipulated only the reimbursement of the severance pay and this only inasmuch as the concession-holder had paid them.\n427. \u00a0On the other hand, the damage caused not by the termination, but by the aggravating\u00a0circumstances surrounding the termination as well as those caused by the requisition Decree\u00a0falling within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, are to be indemnified.\n(2) The amount of the compensation\n428. \u00a0Five counts of indemnification remain in the Claimants' requests (three of which are linked to\u00a0the requisition) for which the Arbitral Tribunal entertains jurisdiction and established the\u00a0Respondent's liability.\na. Crisis management costs\n429. \u00a0In paragraph 608 of their opening brief, the Claimants confirm that these costs amount to\u00a0\u20ac248 834569 and refer in footnote no. 492 to Appendix 57 of the PwC expert's report; It\u00a0appears that the invoices are in fact in Appendix 56 of the PwC report, at least in the paper\u00a0version.570 Eight of these 19 invoices which, according to the Claimants, \"constitute a natural,\u00a0direct (future, consummated) consequence of the Termination Decree\" were issued prior to\u00a0termination (the earliest one was issued on January 28, 2011 and concerns the creation of a\u00a0website for STCC). This caused the Respondent to allege that these costs cannot be recovered\u00a0because they precede termination. They also asserted that these costs are not the result of a\u00a0specific fault on the part of Guinea.\n430. This request has already been submitted to the CCJA Tribunal which considered that \"these\u00a0costs are included in the indemnity of article 32.3\" and that \"Getma has not proven a special\u00a0expenditure which might be due to a specific fault, other than termination, on the part of the\u00a0Republic of Guinea\".\n431. The Arbitral Tribunal, having verified the invoices at issue (including not only invoices from\u00a0communication consulting agencies, but also from Mr. Fischer), notes that they concern\u00a0services in the framework of the reaction against the rumors which circulated at the beginning\u00a0of 2011 after Mr. Alpha Cond\u00e9's appointment as President, regarding his intention to\u00a0terminate the agreement. As established above, the President's announcement of his\u00a0intention to terminate the agreement was a violation of the investment Code, to be\u00a0distinguished from termination itself. The Claimants were warranted in protecting themselves\u00a0from the rumors and in making their position publicly known by press releases and notes.571.\u00a0The lack of discretion concerning the intention to terminate the agreement constitutes a fault\u00a0to be distinguished from termination itself, the consequences of which, other than those of\u00a0termination, are not covered by article 32.3 and therefore recoverable. Thus, Guinea must\u00a0indemnify the Claimants for the communication and public defense expenditures they had to\u00a0incur, amounting to 248 834 euros.572\n569 In the CCJA procedure, Getma International requested \u20ac258,834 on this count.\n570 In the digital version, these invoices were not produced, as Appendix 56 contains the detailed charts and pay\u00a0slips of Messrs. B\u00e9renger and Chanchevrier.\n571 examples and traces of which can be found in (C193), (C-173), (C-187), (C-283), (which refers to a press\nconference given by Mr. Fischer and his partner), and (C-199). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\\\n572 The sum of the invoices is \u20ac 258.83, but the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award such a small amount.\n102\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 110 of 173\nb. The costs of repairing the requisitioned operating equipment\n432. The Claimants have proven the violation of the Investment Code by the Respondent's\u00a0requisition Decree, but they also have the burden of proof of the existence of the prejudice\u00a0and the amount thereof, as well as the causal link with the violation.\n433. \u00a0To appreciate this evidence, it is worthwhile to first the recall several relevant dates:573\nOn March 8, 2011 access to the STCC offices and to the CT was blocked.\nOn March 9, 2011 the requisition was made;\nA \"transfer of powers\" between the APC and Bollor\u00e9 took place on April 11, 2011;\nOn April 29, 2011, Getma International proposed to Bollor\u00e9 to sell to it the requisitioned goods which were then being used by Bollor\u00e9; but the proposal remained unanswered;\nOn June 22, 2011, the State lifted the requisition;\nFrom June 22 to August 19, 2011, Getma International organized the repatriation of the requisitioned goods; in the interim, the equipment was on a median adjacent to the CT\u00a0and in the custody of the APC and Bollor\u00e9574;\non August 19, 2011, the requisitioned goods were transported to the SS Happy River from Conakry in Lom\u00e9 where they were unloaded by the Manuport company.575\n434. As regards the damage to the requisitioned equipment, the Claimants produced with their\u00a0opening brief (i) a list of the goods requisitioned (established between March 12 and 25 by a\u00a0court bailiff appointed by Getma International and STCC, which is an inventory of the\u00a0equipment in the offices and in the perimeter of the CT576 , and which says nothing regarding\u00a0the state of these goods), and (ii) a general inspection report which was drafted according to\u00a0the Claimants on April 15, 2011 during the \"transfer of power\" between APC and Bollor\u00e9, by an\u00a0employee of the Raoul Neveu-Gottwald company and which concerns one of Getma\u00a0International's two Gottwald cranes in Conakry, bearing number 360190.577 . The Claimants\u00a0quoted three statements in this report, according to which certain parts are in good condition.\n435. \u00a0Upon reading this report, which confirms essentially that the crane is generally in good\u00a0condition and well maintained, the Arbitral Tribunal however notes that it also mentions\u00a0negative points such as:\n\"the hydraulic slip ring for its part, is not functioning! Leaks were ascertained and oil covers the floor of the well\" (p.7);\nin the orientation gear-motor \"the filter must be changed for the cooling of the motor to take place properly and to operate under nominal conditions [sic]\" (p. 7);\n573 Generally affirmed by the Claimants (Mem. \u00a7\u00a7 575-581); not contested by Respondent\n574 Mem. \u00a7 580\n575 Gexco expert report (C-278), p. 2\n576 Bailiff's report on the State of the premises of March 25, 2011 (C-170); see also appendix PwC 17\n577 General Inspection STCC Conakry - Guinea on April 15, 2011 (C-276); p.l\n103\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 111 of 173\nthe air conditioners in the electrical room \"(absence of dehumidifier!\") (p. 8);\nseveral neon lights are not operating, thereby making access to \"Tower Cabin\" dangerous, (p. 10);\nin the Tower cabin we note that \"nonetheless, the orientation manipulator is slightly loose.\" (p. 10);\n\"the base of the halogen lamp in the middle of the arrow is no longer properly installed (risk of accident !!)\" (p. 11)\nthere is a large leak in the jack\" (p. 11) \"a slight leak detected in the hook thereby flooding the oil spreader\" (p. 12)\nThe flippers \"are beginning to show wear\" (p. 12).\nThe arrow has not been entirely verified: \"the 'Arrowhead\" and 'rewinder' parts will not be repaired due to lack of means for reaching these elements on the one hand and the\u00a0unavailability of the crane, on the other\" (p. 11).\n436. The Arbitral Tribunal infers therefrom that this crane was not in impeccable condition. In any\u00a0event, this report concerns only one crane and proves nothing regarding the condition on\u00a0March 9, 2011 of the other requisitioned goods.\n437. The Claimants then rely578 on the fact that \"the two Gottwald HMK cranes were then inspected\u00a0twice by three independent experts\":\nAn initial technical inspection [...] performed in the Port of Conakry, just before the loading of the cranes for Lom\u00e9 and after their arrival, by Messrs. Ferreiro and Delaroche of the\u00a0Raoul Neveu-Gottwald firm.579\nExpert operations [...] conducted in Lom\u00e9 from August 22-26, 2011 by Mr. Dur (who has since died) of the Gexco company.580\n438. A study of these reports raises several questions for the Arbitral Tribunal:\n1. The first page of the report by Messrs. Ferreiro and Delaroche of the Raoul Neveu SAS\u00a0company explains that \"it comes as a complement to the expert report prepared by Mr.\u00a0Christian DUR-GEXCO\", that the place in which the expert inspection was performed is\u00a0\"Conakry, Lom\u00e9\", that the period is weeks 33 and 34\" and that it concerns the \"general\u00a0condition of the two cranes, such as found in the Port of Conakry prior to all\u00a0interventions\".581 Weeks 33 and 34 of 2011 were the weeks of August 15 and August 22,\u00a02011. One therefore can understand that the technical inspection performed by Messrs.\u00a0Ferreiro and Delaroche began in Conakry no earlier than four days prior to the departure of\u00a0the equipment for Lom\u00e9 on August 19, and continued after the transport, to Lom\u00e9, to be\n578Mem. \u00a7 582.\n579 Mem. \u00a7 582, first point: with reference to Appendix 48 of the PwC report, the Claimants' expert and the Gexco Expert's Report (C-278)\nS8\u00b0 Mem. \u00a7 582, second pint; also with reference to the Gexco Expert Report exhibit (C-278).\n581 P.l of appendix 47 (paper version) to the PwC report and appendix 48 (digital version to which the\u00a0Claimants appeared to refer).\n104\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 112 of 173\nterminated there no later than August 26, 2011.582 However, Mr. Dur Gexco's report bears the title \"Expert inspection in Lom\u00e9 from August 22 to 26, 2011 of a batch of handling\u00a0equipment transported on the SS \"Happy River\" from Conakry\"583 and mentions on page\u00a089 the date of September 21, 2011. If Mr. Dur began his expert inspection operations on\u00a0August 22, 2011 in Lom\u00e9584 , one has difficulty understanding how Messrs. Ferreiro and\u00a0Delaroche who, according to the Claimants, began their inspection prior to the loading of\u00a0the cranes for Lom\u00e9, can write that their report, which was not dated for that matter, \"is in\u00a0addition\" to the expert report drafted by Mr. Dur who was not appointed until August 12,\u00a02011.585\n2. Mr. Dur's report specifies equipment according to type, with the registration numbers, the\u00a0chassis numbers and the fleet numbers, in short, a much more detailed precise method\u00a0than that which had been applied by the bailiff in Conakry between March 12 to 25 2011.\u00a0The correlation between the enumeration in the Gexco report and the bailiff's inventory is\u00a0only partial and the Arbitral Tribunal's comparison thereof reveals that there are exhibits\u00a0mentioned in one of them which are not mentioned in the other one, and vice versa.\n3. The heading on the first page of the undated report by Messrs. Ferreiro and Delaroche\u00a0indicates that their employer is Raoul Neveu S.A.S., a simplified joint stock company, and it\u00a0bears on the same page Raoul Neveu S.A.'s stamp, with the same address as that\u00a0mentioned in the heading to the report for the engineering Department of Raoul Neveu\u00a0S.A.S.586. Even if one admits that two different companies belonging to the same group can\u00a0bear the same name, the Tribunal is surprised that this general inspection report of April\u00a015, 2011 of Raoul Neveu S.A. (C-276) bears another heading and has a form which in no\u00a0manner resembles that of the report of \"weeks 33 and 34, 2011\" (appendix 47/48 to the\u00a0PwC report).\n4. The purpose of the undated report by Messrs. Ferreiro and Delaroche (Raoul Neveu S.A.S.),\u00a0even if \"it is complementary to\" the report by Mr. Dur, is much more restricted than this\u00a0one, and is limited to ascertainments concerning the two Gottwald cranes.587 At the\u00a0beginning of the chapters in his report concerning each of the Gottwald cranes, Mr. Dur\u00a0explains his cooperation with Raoul Neveu S.A.(S.?) as follows: \"the following\u00a0ascertainments were made in the presence of the technical director of Gottwald France ,\u00a0whose expertise permitted us to detect the anomalies, the defects, the failures and the\u00a0damage impacting this equipment\".588 On page 2 of his report, Mr. Dur drafts a list of the\u00a0parties present during his expert inspection, among whom there was Mr. Delaroche, but\u00a0not Mr. Ferreiro. And yet Raoul Neveu's report of weeks 33 and 34 mentions explicitly that\u00a0it was prepared jointly by Messrs. Ferreiro and Delaroche.\n582 These dates are more or less corroborated by the invoice to be found for this expert inspection in appendix\u00a049 (p. 19-1) to the PwC report which refers among other things to \"the travel of Messrs. Delaroche and Ferreiro\u00a0on August 16-27, 2011 to Conakry, then Lom\u00e9\".\n583 Gexco Expert Report (C-278), p. 1\n584 Gexco Expert Report (C-278), p. 2: \"expert inspection: it occurred on August 22 to 26, 2011 in Lom\u00e9 on the Ss\u00a0\"Happy River\" and on the dock of the Lom\u00e9 (Togo) Port Authority\".\n585 Gexco Expert's report (C-278, p. 2).\n586 Appendix 47, PwC report (paper version) or appendix 48 in digital version.\n587 This can undoubtedly be explained by the fact that Raoul Neveu S.A. (or S.A.S ) is the Gottwald crane\u00a0specialist in France: see the heading on its report of April 15, 2011: \"Raoul Neveu SA, Gottwald France\" (C-276),\u00a0p.l as well as the reference in Mr. Dur's report concerning the participation in his expert inspection of \"Mr\u00a0Delaroche Raoul Neveu SA, representative of the manufacturer Gottwald (cranes)\" (C-278), p. 2\n588 Gexco Expert's Report (C-278), pp. 8 & 20.\n105\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 113 of 173\n5 Another issue appears upon reading the reports of Mr. Dur and those of Raoul Neveu\nS.A.S . each report which concerns the Gottwald cranes contains, for each crane, a statement of the hours of operation. Thus, one can compare statements in different\u00a0reports, including only the engine hours mentioned on the packing list which the Claimants\u00a0produced locally only with their rejoinder:\nReport\nN/S 360189, fleet no.

Ferreiro and Delaroche (Raoul Neveu S.A.S.), one of their reports of August inverted the values of\u00a0the two cranes; (ii) that the values mentioned in the two successive Raoul Neveu reports do\u00a0not follow each other logically, inasmuch as one of them, for the hydraulic pump, was\u00a0higher in April than the value in August 2011. It would therefore appear that it was Raoul\u00a0Neveu S.A.S. which inverted the two cranes in its report for weeks 33 and 34 of 2011.\n439. With the exception of these issues, as well as the very pertinent issues of the Respondents\u00a0concerning the Raoul Neveu report of April 2011589, which was not even communicated to the\u00a0Claimant's expert, PwC, the Arbitral Tribunal has no doubts concerning the value as evidence\u00a0of the report by Mr. Dur-Gexco regarding the damage to the equipment on the date on which\u00a0the expert inspection was performed. However, one must note that none of the reports\u00a0produced by the Claimants, including Mr. Dur-Gexco's report, prove:\nthe condition of the equipment prior to the requisition: the bailiffs inventory of March 12, 2011 does not describe the condition of the equipment590 and the Respondent, as it\u00a0does not bear the burden of proof, was not required to prepare a description thereof;\u00a0however, proof that prior to the requisition the equipment was not in the good condition\u00a0which the Claimants would have had us believe, was provided by the Respondents in the\u00a0form of the technical opinion of the technical director of the APC of February 9, 2011\u00a0concerning the Concession Agreement591; the report by Raoul Neveu S.A.S. of April 15,\u00a02015 cannot be used to establish the condition of the equipment at this time because it is\u00a0a document which was apparently drafted for other purposes (a \"transfer of authority\"\n589 c ; Mem ; \u00a7\u00a7 579-583.\n590 The Respondent justly remarked that that this very detailed inventory, prepared the day after the\u00a0requisition, indeed proves that G.l. access to equipment, even in its premises, and therefore could have, with\u00a0the exception of a bailiff, also been able to appoint a technical expert to prepare the necessary reports on the\u00a0condition of this equipment (Mem.AAR \u00a7\u00a7 421-424).\n591 \"three cranes have broken down. State of advanced deterioration of the other cranes must be established\":\u00a0(C-175) p. 4. This exhibit was produced by the Claimants for other purposes, and the portion quoted, although\u00a0not flattering for G.I., was not contested by them.\n106\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 114 of 173\nbetween the state and Bollor\u00e9)\\*\u201c9\u201c\u2019, and in any event, the concerned solely crane 36109, namely the G6402 ;\nthat the damage ascertained after the lifting of the requisition, the storing thereof while awaiting transport, the transport thereof from Conakry to Lom\u00e9 and the unloading\u00a0thereof in Lom\u00e9593 were caused during the requisition: first, because the state of the\u00a0equipment at the time of the requisition is not known; then, because between the lifting\u00a0of the requisition and the reports of August 2011, 2 months elapsed. The Arbitral Tribunal\u00a0notes, furthermore, that this period from June 22 of August 19, 2011 is problematic. The\u00a0Claimants affirm that during the period the equipment was being stored on his median\u00a0adjacent to the TC in the custody of the APC and of Bollor\u00e9\"59'1. And yet, and yet, it is not\u00a0clear whether and in what circumstances this custody was imposed upon Getma\u00a0International and why it accepted it. As soon as the requisition was lifted, it recovered\u00a0possession of its equipment and again became responsible for the custody thereof.\n440. As regards the quantification of the cost of repairing equipment which the Claimants are\u00a0claiming, Mr. Dur stated in his expert report that the precise estimate for the repair of\u00a0Gottwald cranes G6401 and G6402 must be communicated to Getma International by\u00a0Gottwald595and that the calculation for the remaining machines would be prepared by\u00a0Manuport's engineering department596. The Manuport Togo company, holder of a container\u00a0maintenance license, is a subsidiary 100% controlled by Getma International597. One can\u00a0therefore wonder about the objectivity of the crisis. It practices. The Claimants produced as\u00a0appendix 50598 the PWC report, the invoices they had a for this repair work, coming to a total\u00a0amount of 1,151,508 \u20ac. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that most of the invoices, initially issued by\u00a0Raoul Neveu to Necotrans trading, were subsequently reinvoiced by Necotrans Trading to\u00a0Manuport, which apparently became the owner or at least the user of the equipment after its\u00a0arrival in Lom\u00e9. Some of these invoices refer explicitly to the equipment to be repaired (such\u00a0for example, as crane no. 361090, but for numerous other orders or invoices, it is impossible to\u00a0link them to a damaged piece of equipment. The Respondent's expert complained, moreover,\u00a0that he could not attribute certain invoices to damage ascertained by Gexco599. The Claimants\u00a0reply that PWC may have established this late on the basis of the Konecrane catalog pertaining\u00a0to the reachstackers600. However, the reply does not state where and in what PwC report. The\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal can find this conciliation. In any case, it does not concern reachstackers.\n441. \u00a0In conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that it cannot exceed to the Claimant's request\u00a0for indemnification for the cost of repairing the requisition equipment, because neither\u00a0because only between the requisition and the damage, nor the amount of the damage, has\u00a0been proven to the point of satisfying the law.\n592 We do not know who appointed Raoul Neveu for this report, and one can even wonder why and how the\u00a0Claimants could have obtained a copy of this report\n593 \u00a0The Tribunal notes that all of the equipment requisitioned was apparently unloaded in Lom\u00e9,\u00a0notwithstanding the mention on the packing list (see-391) that only 13 pieces of equipment, including the\u00a0Gottwald G6402 crane were intended for a final destination in Lom\u00e9, while the destination of all the other\u00a0items, including the G6401 crane, had still \"to be defined\".\n594 Mem; \u00a7 580\n59S(C-278);pp 11 & 23.\n596 (C-278), p. 89.\n597 Financial proposal of July 2008 (C-179), p. 110/230.\n598 Appendix 49 in the paper version.\n599 First OCA report of March 30, 2015, \u00a7\u00a7 242-249.\n600 Reply. \u00a7 621.\n107\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 115 of 173\nc. Prejudice corresponding to the stocks which were not returned\n442. \u00a0Guinea's defense that this Arbitral Tribunal can no longer award, and indemnity for this\u00a0prejudice because the CCJA Tribunal has already awarded. It, has no longer been valid, since\u00a0the cancellation of the CCJA award\n443. \u00a0In any event, this prejudice is clearly linked to the requisition (as the CCJA Tribunal also noted\u00a0that matter607), and this Arbitral Tribunal entertains jurisdiction to rule on all the consequences\u00a0of the act of the Public Authorities constituted by the requisition.\n444. \u00a0If the return of the requisition aspects after the lifting of the requisition is the Respondent's\u00a0responsibility, the burden of proof that it did not return all the requisition stocks is incumbent\u00a0upon the Claimants. Thus, therefore, they must prove the value of the requisition stocks and\u00a0that of the stocks not returned. To do so, the Claimants rely on the report by the PWC expert\u00a0of November 13, 2014, who in his term refers to the PWC report of January 7, 2013 in the CCJA\u00a0arbitration602. Article 149 explains the following:\nGiven the context, no visible inventory of the stocks could be prepared on March 8, 2011. For this reason, the amounts entered into accounts in the general balancing thereof on this\u00a0date corresponds to the evaluation of stocks on the date of the closing of the last financial\u00a0year (December 31, 2010) to which the 2011 movements were added.\n445. The value obtained in this matter is 244 828 euros, an amount also reiterated in \u00a7327 of the\u00a0PWC report of November 13, 2014. PwC then states that the stock returned was sold by STCC\u00a0to NCT Trading for the amount of 36,608 euros603. This Arbitral Tribunal then expected that\u00a0the value of stocks not returned be calculated by deducting this amount from the value of the\u00a0stocks at December 31, 2010, namely 208,220 euros. PWC however obtains a value of 210070\u00a0euros on the basis of the general balance sheets at December 31, 2011 and the conversion of\u00a0the amounts into GNF which this table mentions as stock provisions (GNF 2,196,936,859) at\u00a0the exchange rate at March 8, 2O11.604\n446. The expert of the Respondent, OCA, however, does not criticize this calculation which the\u00a0Tribunal therefore accepts. It considers on the other hand that the value of the stocks which\u00a0were not returned duplicates the value of the concession which the Claimants are claiming in\u00a0the first instance: if the concession had not been terminated, STCC would have used these\u00a0stocks, the consumption of which is necessarily already taken into account in calculating the\u00a0cash flow which the concession would have generated.605 PwC responded that, in paragraph\u00a0293 of its report of November 13, 2014, it had deducted, for the purpose of calculating the\u00a0project's net value, the needs in working capital which also comprise the stocks determined on\u00a0the basis of the balance at March 8, 2011.606 In its second report, OCA formally acknowledged\u00a0this response and confirmed the absence of a duplicate amount.607\n601 CCJA award, \u00a7 255.\n602 Appendix 1 to the PwC report of November 13, 2014.\n60 ' PwC report of January 7, 2013, \u00a7 152 which contains in appendix 20 the invoice for this sale. If this report was produced in this arbitration as Appendix 1 to the PwC report of November 13, 2014, this is not the case of\u00a0its appendix 20. The Tribunal was therefore not able to examine the description in this invoice, which probably\u00a0contains details concerning the equipment sold which may have been compared to the equipment mentioned\u00a0in the inventory of March 8, 2011.\n604 PwC report of Nov. 13, 2014, \u00a7\u00a7 328-330 and its appendix 1 \u00a7\u00a7 154-156.\n605 OCA Expert report 253-255.\n606 Second PwC report of July 10, 2015, \u00a7 231 and appendix 45 to the PwC report of Nov. 13, 2014.\n507 Second OCA report of Oct. 14, 2015, \u00a7 284.\n108\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 116 of 173\n447. \u00a0Thus, all that remains is the Respondent's charge that the Claimants had an inventory taken on\u00a0March 12, 2011, and that it was on the basis of a physical inventory of this type that they\u00a0should have proved their prejudice. At the hearing of the witnesses, PwC's expert, Mrs.\u00a0Perrier, questioned in this regard, acknowledged that at the time of the return of the stocks,\u00a0the Claimants had not verified whether the stocks which were missing had been included in\u00a0the inventory of March 12, 2011. On the other hand, PwC \"adopted a global approach which\u00a0consisted [in a calculation] based on the accounting stock. We deducted that which had been\u00a0returned by Guinea and determined the stock which had been lost, by comparison. It was not\u00a0possible to go into more detail. Therefore, it was an estimated approach\". 608 The expert also\u00a0testified that to verify that that which was allegedly missing was indeed in the physical\u00a0inventory of March 12, 2011 \"would have been very complicated, given that it would have\u00a0been necessary to be able to juxtapose to these factors the state of the stock at December\u00a031st. And there are not necessarily enough details. In any event, this is not the only part, there\u00a0are many others. For example, when one reads \"total oil stock, 2 full barrels, barrels partially\u00a0used\", I do not see how one can balance this with the stocks. We found ourselves in the\u00a0situation in which we had an accounting inventory and these detailed elements, but they could\u00a0not be balanced. This is why we adopted an approximate approach\"609.\n448. The Arbitral Tribunal notes the following:\n(i) \u00a0Due to the failure to produce the invoice for the goods returned and sold by STCC to NCT\u00a0Trading, it has become impossible to compare the list of these returned goods with the\u00a0physical inventory of the goods at March 12, 2011;\n(ii) \u00a0PwC was not able to convince the Arbitral Tribunal that it was impossible to work on the\u00a0basis of physical inventories (instead of accounting inventories);\n(iii) PwC could not convince the Arbitral Tribunal either that it could not base its calculation\u00a0on the physical inventory at March 12, 2011 without comparing it beforehand \"to the\u00a0statement of the stock at December 31st\";\n(iv) The physical inventory of March 12, 2011 is as detailed as one could hope and has not at\u00a0all overlooked the stocks;\n(v) \u00a0PwC declared in its report of January 7, 2013 for the CCJA Tribunal that \"given the\u00a0context, no physical inventory of the stocks could be taken on March 87, 2O11\"610 and\u00a0thereby justified why it had worked with an accounting inventory: \"the amounts entered\u00a0into account in the general balance on this date [March 8, 2011] correspond to the value\u00a0of the stocks on the date of the closing of the last financial year (Dec. 31, 2010) to which\u00a0the 2011 movements were added\". In the footnote in this same report, it declared that\u00a0\"we were informed of the existence of a bailiff's report attesting to the use of the\u00a0equipment by the new license-holder\"611. It therefore appears that at the time of its\u00a0report for the CCJA Tribunal, PwC was not aware of the physical inventory which the\u00a0bailiff prepared on March 12, 2011. However, when it prepared its report of Nov. 13,\u00a02014 for this arbitration, PwC was aware of this physical inventory, given that it attached\u00a0it to this report as appendix 17 (to prove the presence of new equipment, which would\u00a0make it possible to establish that phase I of the investments required under the\u00a0Concession Agreement had been made).612 Therefore, in its report of November 13, 2014,\u00a0PwC no longer explains why it calculated the value of the stocks which had not been\n608 TR II, p.39 :37-40.\n609 TR II, p. 39 ;44-p.4O :5.\n610 PwC report for the CCJA Tribunal of Jan. 7, 2013, p. 27\u00a7149.\n611 PwC report for the CCJA Tribunal of Jan. 7, 2013, p. 28, note no. 42.\n612 PwC report of Nov. 13, 2014, \u00a7 98 and note no. 27.\n109\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 117 of 173\nreturned on the basis of the general balance at December 31, 2030, to which the movements which occurred up until March 8, 2011 were added. Hence Mrs. Perrier's\u00a0questioning in this regard during the hearing.\n449. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the calculation method adopted by the\u00a0Claimants' expert is not warranted and is too theoretical. However, this is not a reason for\u00a0rejecting the request. Indeed, it is entirely reasonable to assume that the requisitioned stocks\u00a0were used in the operation of the CT following March 8, 2011 and the Respondent did not\u00a0deny this either. In the absence of other evidence (such for example as the average month use\u00a0of stocks) and as the Respondent did not express an objection either to the price of the sale of\u00a0the returned stocks, the Arbitral Tribunal sets the amount of this prejudice at the flat sum of \u20ac\u00a0200,000.\nd. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prejudice pertaining to the land services provided prior to the requisition, but not invoiced\n450. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimants did not prove that it was impossible for\u00a0them to issue the invoices for STCC's services linked to the unloading of containers or in\u00a0storage at the time of the requisition:\n- \u00a0First because it turns out that, contrary to that which the Claimants contend, they were\u00a0able to have access to the CT after March 8, 2011, which is established by the fact that they\u00a0were able to have a detailed inventory taken on March 12, 2011, and an expert inspection\u00a0of one of the Gottwald cranes, on April 15, 2011.\n- \u00a0Then, because it also turns out that, in order to be able to issue invoices, the Claimants did\u00a0not at all need to know the date of the removal of the goods by the importers. Indeed,\u00a0after March 8, 2011, the Claimants no longer operated the CT; therefore, the only services\u00a0they could still invoice were those rendered up until March 8,2011. To do so, it was not\u00a0necessary to have documentary proof of the lifting of the containers, or to know the date of\u00a0the removal of the goods. At most, it might have been pertinent for determining the date\u00a0on which the invoice was owed.\n- \u00a0The Claimants had a software program for managing invoicing which enabled the issuing of\u00a0invoices. It is this program moreover, combined with the data produced by the Getport\u00a0software program concerning the operations which permitted them to calculate the\u00a0amount of the invoices to be issued.\n451. The Claimants moreover did not prove either that they at least attempted to collect the\u00a0amounts for their services up until March 8, 2011, from their clients, nor that they served\u00a0formal notice on the Respondent requesting that it permit it to issue its invoices.\n452. \u00a0In the absence of any evidence that the non-invoicing is due to the requisition, the request is\u00a0rejected.\ne. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moral prejudice\n453. The issue of determining whether a moral prejudice can be compensated in an investment\u00a0arbitration is controversial. Several decisions admitted the principle and are invoked, by both\u00a0the Claimants and the Respondent. The Arbitral Tribunal analyzed them and retained the\u00a0following:\n110\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 118 of 173\nThere is no doubt that the measure is of a particular nature and that, in the few decisions which admitted it, the situation was particular: in the former Lusitania case, the mental\u00a0suffering and consternation of the families of the 128 persons who perished out of the 197\u00a0persons on board the ship which sank and in the Desert Line case of 2008, it had been\u00a0proven that the Claimant had been the victim of a real siege of its worksite, the arrest of\u00a0three of its executives, including the son of the company's CEO, physical violence and theft\u00a0by armed gangs. Particularly serious violence is required.\nIn the (2011) Lemire case, the Tribunal based its decision on the two cases mentioned, as well as a third case, Siag, which simply recalled the rule of Desert Line that moral prejudice\u00a0is reserved for extreme cases, for establishing three conditions for acknowledging moral\u00a0prejudice:\n(i) \u00a0Acts by the state must involve physical threats, illegal detention or a similar situation\u00a0the abuse of which violates the standards of civilized nations;\n(ii) \u00a0The acts of the state are damaging to health, cause stress, anxiety or another form of\u00a0mental suffering such as humiliation, shame, debasement, or loss of reputation,\u00a0credit and social position;\n(iii) Both the cause and the prejudice must be serious and substantial.613\n- \u00a0In the third case quoted by the Parties, Arif, the Tribunal rejected the strict, cumulative\u00a0application of the three conditions of the Lemire case, and insisted on the discretion which\u00a0a Tribunal generally enjoys to rule that damages for moral prejudice are an exceptional\u00a0remedy.614\n- \u00a0Two cases, Lemire and Arif, in their decision not to indemnify moral prejudice, referred to\u00a0the indemnification of material damage:\nThe acknowledgement in the First Decision that Ukraine has indeed breached the BIT, and the present award of substantial compensation, are elements of redress which may\u00a0significantly repair Mr. Lemire's loss of reputation. [... ] the moral aspects of his injuries have\u00a0already been compensated by the awarding of a significant amount of economic\u00a0compensation, and [that] the extraordinary tests required for the recognition of separate\u00a0and additional moral damages have not been met in this case.615\n613 \"The State's actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act; the State's actions\u00a0cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and\u00a0degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and both cause and effect are grave or\u00a0substantial.\"(C-281)\u00a7 333.\n614 Franck Charles Arif versus the Republic of Moldavia, ICSID ARB/11/23, Award, April 8, 2013 (C-282)\u00a7\u00a7 590-591.\n615 Joseph Charles Lemire versus Ukraine ICSID ARB/06/18) Award, March 28, 2011 (C-281)\u00a7\u00a7 339 and 344.

This Arbitral Tribunal shall examine the evidence produced for Claimants' the moral prejudice\u00a0in light of the principles established by this relatively limited case law. They invoke four factors\u00a0to justify their moral prejudice:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n  \nThe non-respect of the Agreement;\nThe intervention of the police and the military;\nThe pillage and attitude of the employees of the APC and Bollor\u00e9;\nThe undermining of the Claimants' image and reputation.\n455. \u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal refers to Chapter VI.C(l) a above, in which it has already concluded that\u00a0\"the President's public announcement of his intention to terminate the Getma International\u00a0contract, the reading on the news on television on 8 p.m. of the same day of the effectiveness\u00a0of the Termination Decree before it had even been notified and the positioning of soldiers and\u00a0policemen, beginning at 9 p.m., in front of STCC's offices on the CT are effectively aggravating\u00a0and vexatious circumstances which go beyond termination, regardless of its form, and\u00a0constitute acts of the Public Authorities other than termination\".\n456. The Arbitral Tribunal considers however that none of these deeds displays the seriousness\u00a0required by case law for the moral prejudice to warrant indemnification:\n(i) \u00a0The President's announcement of his intention to termination the contract was the\u00a0subject of rumors which were not confirmed until the day on which the President\u00a0mentioned it, eleven months after termination, in his interview of February 6, 2012617.\u00a0According to the interview, the announcement was made to friends and was therefore\u00a0less sudden than the public announcement made in December 2008 by Capitan Moussa\u00a0Dadis Camara in the interview with Jeune Afrique, several days after he took over power\u00a0after the death of President Lansana Cont\u00e9, under whose regime Getma International had\u00a0won the concession: \"...All the administration's contracts will be reviewed. The\u00a0concession of the Autonomous Port of Conakry's to Getma International, for example, will\u00a0purely and simply be annulled. Despite an audit conducted by FFA Ernst & Young, which\u00a0declared that this contract was obviously unfavorable to the State, the outgoing\u00a0government obstinately decided to give away our port\".618 The numerous press articles\u00a0produced in this file, also on the topic of the granting of the concession to Bollor\u00e9, prove\u00a0the degree to which these major contracts, important for the country's economy, were at\u00a0the centre of the public's attention and were not of an extraordinary nature.\n(ii) \u00a0This Arbitral Tribunal has already noted in paragraph 379 above that the placing of\u00a0soldiers and policemen in front of STCC's offices on March 8,2011 even before the\u00a0requisition Decree was adopted was neither warranted nor necessary, but that their\n816 Franck Charles Arif versus the Republic of Moldavia, 1CSID ARB/11/23, Award, April 8, 2013 (C-282)\u00a7.\u00a7 592 our underlining.\n617 See note at the bottom of page no. 478\n618 Interview of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara (R-29).\n112\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 120 of 173\nintervention was correct and had not been as sudden as suggested in the press articles619 and the comic strip concerning these events6'\u20190 produced by the Claimants.\n(in) Mr. Barone attested that on March 10, 2011, when the police force performed the requisition per se, a \"chaos\" reigned in STCC's offices at the end of the morning (\u00a7 7j)\u00a0where \"at least 25 members of Bollor\u00e9's personnel, very sure of themselves and totally\u00a0serene, and even arrogant in their conduct\" were also present (\u00a78). That \u201cSTCC's\u00a0employees [...] had the impression that a part of themselves was being torn out of them\"\u00a0(\u00a7 9) and that \"STCC's expatriate executive staff members decided to leave Guinea [...]\u00a0leaving their personal effects behind in their homes\" (\u00a7 13). These events were indeed\u00a0unpleasant for the personnel and for Mr. Barone himself, but do not prove pillage or any\u00a0other excessive conduct. Also the fact that the requisitioned stocks were not returned\u00a0does not constitute pillage.\n(iv) The presence and even the arrogance of Bollor\u00e9's personnel may have been vexatious for\u00a0the personnel of Getma International, particularly in the competitive context which had\u00a0existed between the two groups since Getma International had won the concession.\u00a0However, there is nothing surprising or shocking in this fact, given that it was a public\u00a0secret that the concession had been withdrawn to be awarded to Bollor\u00e9: the newspapers\u00a0had been speaking of it since February 8, 2O11621 and the press releases which Getma\u00a0itself published on February 28 and March 1st, 2011, as well as its letter of February 9,\u00a02011 to the Minister of Transport refer explicitly to Mr. Vincent Bollor\u00e9's personal\u00a0measures of February 3 and 4, 2011 in Conakry to exert pressure on the authorities with a\u00a0view to terminating the Agreement.622 The opposition of the two competitors was also\u00a0expressed in France for that matter; it was strong, but was not at all extraordinary, as\u00a0proven moreover by the cooperation which was subsequently developed between the\u00a0two groups.\n(v) \u00a0Mr. Barone also mentioned home visits to several STCC executives by bailiffs and APC\u00a0executives which created a feeling of danger, and caused expatriate executives to leave\u00a0the country on March 11, 2011. It is not proven however, nor is it even alleged, that\u00a0these visits involved physical violence or were anything more than administrative visits,\u00a0linked to the unfolding of CT's takeover and its operations.\n457. The acts by the Public Authorities which surrounded the termination of the Agreement and the\u00a0requisition therefore do not display the seriousness required for recognizing moral prejudice.\u00a0Furthermore, the Claimants obtained of the CCJA Tribunal an award which grants\u00a0compensation to Getma International for the material prejudice caused by the termination\n619 Article in the classified Archives of March 24, 2011 (C-199).

The fact that the amounts awarded are\u00a0not as high as that which Getma International, respectively the Claimants, requested of the\u00a0two Arbitral Tribunals is due to different reasons (lack of evidence, withdrawal of the request\u00a0for loss of profit before a court and lack of jurisdiction of the other court). Therefore, even if a\u00a0broad interpretation of the Lemire case leaves room for pleading that a moral prejudice can be\u00a0indemnified when the compensation for material prejudice is not significant, this Arbitral\u00a0Tribunal cannot, in this concrete case, take account of the reduced indemnification of the\u00a0material prejudice.\n458. The Arbitral Tribunal rejects the request for compensation for moral prejudice.\nf. interest\n459. The Claimants are requesting interest, capitalized annually on the sums which are awarded to\u00a0them at the rate of 8.7% for the period of March 8, 2011 up to the day of effective, full\u00a0payment thereof. In their Post-Hearing Memorial, they quantify this interest, at February\u00a03,2016, at the amount of \u20ac 56,950,551.\n460. The Respondent was categorically opposed to the application of interest to the amount of the\u00a0lucrum cessans, but did not have any special reaction to the rate requested, nor to the\u00a0capitalization requested. Its sole defense concerns the application of interest for the period\u00a0during which this arbitration was suspended, according to it at the Claimants' initiative, from\u00a0January 31, 2013 to June 17, 2014.\n461. And if this Arbitral Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the lucrum cessans, the\u00a0disagreement regarding the application of interest on the amount thereof becomes pointless.\n462. As regards the period for which the interest is owed, the Arbitral Tribunal recalls the following\u00a0facts:\nOn January 10, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the Parties \"as soon as they have examined the Decision on the Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal [...] to consult each\u00a0other in order to reach an agreement if possible on the follow-up on the procedure, in\u00a0particular if they intend to request that it be suspended\".\nIn a letter of January 31, 2013, the Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal suspend the ICSID arbitration procedure until the Decision in the CCJA arbitration procedure. On\u00a0the same day, the Respondent responded that the pursuit or suspension of the procedure\u00a0depended on the clarifications which the Claimants provide regarding the requests they\u00a0intend to pursue before this Arbitral Tribunal.\nOn February 12, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal suspended the proceedings due to the nonpayment of the second advance requested of the Parties, in accordance with Article 14(3) (d) of the administrative and financial Regulations. It informed the Parties moreover that\u00a0it would refuse to follow-up on the Claimants' suspension request of January 31, 2013 as\u00a0long as the proceedings were suspended for the non-payment of the advance.\nOn August 21, 2013, the Claimants confirmed that they had replaced the Respondent for the payment of the second advance, and reiterated their request for a suspension of the\u00a0suit until notice of the CCJA's arbitral award.\n114\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 122 of 173\nOn August 22, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal announced the resumption of the proceedings, following the Claimants' payment of the entire amount of the second advance and asked\u00a0the Respondent to respond to the Claimants' request for a suspension. The Respondent\u00a0maintained its position of January 31, 2013.\nOn September 30, 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal suspended the proceedings until December 1st, 2013.\nThis suspension was extended three times and was lifted on June 17, 2014.\n463. Thus, the suspension due to the parallel proceedings lasted only from September 30, 2013\u00a0until June 17, 2014, i.e. for 260 days.\n464. \u00a0Even if, in an initial stage, the Claimants requested a suspension in response to an invitation on\u00a0the part of the Arbitral Tribunal and even if the suspension was warranted by the\u00a0circumstances, these circumstances were the result of the Claimants' decision to launch two\u00a0parallel arbitration proceedings. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that they are responsible\u00a0for the suspension and are not entitled to interest during this period.\n465. \u00a0Interest at the rate of 8.7% capitalized annually is owed on the principal sum of \u20ac448,834 from\u00a0March 8, 2011 until September 30 2013 and beginning on June 17, 2014 until the date of\u00a0effective full payment.\n(3) The allegations of twofold damages\n466. \u00a0Given (i) the restrictions to this Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction, (ii) its decision to order the\u00a0Respondent to pay the amount of \u20ac 200,000 as an indemnity determined ex aequo et bono for\u00a0the requisitioned goods which were not returned, it appears that duplicate damages would be\u00a0possible only in the event that the Claimants, after having received payment of this amount of\u00a0\u20ac 200,000 on the basis of this award, succeeded, notwithstanding the annulment of the CCJA\u00a0award, in having it enforced and received, on the basis of this award, another sum of \u20ac\u00a0210,070 for the same prejudice.\n467. \u00a0In order to avoid this risk of duplicate damages, this Arbitral Tribunal will accompany the\u00a0ordering of the Respondent to pay the amount of \u20ac200,000 by the condition that the\u00a0Claimants not have recovered beforehand the amount of \u20ac210,070 on the basis of the CCJA\u00a0award and, vice versa, waive for the future their claim to this CCJA award.\n468. The Claimants have also asked the Arbitral Tribunal to \"state that all sums effectively and\u00a0definitively paid [..] by the Bollor\u00e9 group pursuant to the procedure against the Necotrans\u00a0group before the French state courts will be deducted from the sums awarded by this\u00a0Tribunal\"623. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that neither the Claimants nor the Respondent have\u00a0mentioned this request in their briefs, if only to explain which requests pending before the\u00a0French courts could duplicate the requests awarded by this Arbitral Tribunal. The request can\u00a0therefore not be accepted and must not be, inasmuch as the Claimants themselves can see to\u00a0it that the enforcement of duplicate indemnification is not claimed.\n623 \u00a7 107 above.\n115\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 123 of 173\nVIII.

The Claimants invoke international case law and doctrine to request that the breakdown of the\u00a0costs of the arbitration take account of the Respondent's poor conduct:\n- \u00a0the presentation of a request, which it knew was unfounded, for an arbitrator's recusal, as\u00a0a delaying tactic;\n- \u00a0the Respondent's nonpayment of the advances requested of it by the Centre;\n- \u00a0the presentation and maintaining of arguments which it knew were unfounded;\n- \u00a0delays in producing certain documents and the failure to produce others;\n- \u00a0reliance on a contractual clause and award which it never had the intention to respect;\n- \u00a0the maintaining of suspense concerning the appearance of Messrs.

Regarding the amounts claimed by each party, the Tribunal notes the following:\n  \nNotwithstanding the three successive requests for the payment of advances by the Secretariat, the Respondent never paid its share and the Claimant had to replace it for\u00a0such payment, for a total to date of \u20ac425,OOO630; thus, the Claimants advanced the total\u00a0amount of the expenses and fees of the arbitrators and the Secretariat, amounting to US\u00a0dollars 850,000;\n  \nThe amounts of the fees of each of the parties' counsel are comparable and can be considered as reasonable; the same is true of the experts' fees, even if those of PwC\u00a0represent twice the amount of those of OCA, and of the expenses of the witnesses for the\u00a0Respondent; furthermore, neither party requested the right to react to the\u00a0communication of the other party's expenses.\n476. Regarding the Respondent's conduct, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot concur with the Claimants' criticism (the request for recusal and the arguments developed by the Respondent are not\u00a0manifestly unfounded; and the delay or failure to produce documents, like the late\n  \n627 Letter of February 17, 2016.\n628 The ICSID Secretariat will send a detailed financial statement of the account of the case to the Parties as\n  \nsoon as it has been finalized.\n  \n629 This amount covers in particular the costs pertaining to the hearing, and includes the estimate of the costs (express courier services, printing, copying) for the sending of this Award.

Ct \u20187\n  \n  \nRespondent).\n  \n117  \n  \nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 125 of 173\nconfirmation of the appearance of the Respondent's witnesses, can be explained otherwise than by deliberate tactics), except as concerns the nonpayment of the advances to the ICSID.\u00a0Article 14 of the ICSID's administrative and financial regulations stipulates that the parties will\u00a0make advanced payments in order to permit the centre to cover the direct costs of ongoing\u00a0ICSID proceedings including the arbitrators' fees and expenses. The Respondent, which did not\u00a0even attempt to justify its nonpayment, therefore violated its obligation to pay its share,\u00a0although it had accepted this obligation by stipulating in its Investment Code that disputes\u00a0concerning the application of the code are, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, settled by\u00a0arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID convention, ratified by it on\u00a0November 4,1986.\n477. \u00a0In rendering its decision concerning the costs of the arbitration, the Tribunal will take into\u00a0consideration on the one hand the fact that the Claimants prevailed (even if this choice is\u00a0accompanied by considerable overtones) in the decision on jurisdiction of December 29, 2012\u00a0and the principle of the breach of the Investment Code, and, on the other hand, the fact that\u00a0the Respondent was unable to prove corruption and fraud (subjects which occupied the\u00a0Arbitral Tribunal to a great extent), but prevailed in the issue concerning lack of jurisdiction for\u00a0the lucrum cessans following termination and, as concerns the merits, on several counts of\u00a0prejudice which were either rejected or the amount of which was reduced.\n478. \u00a0Consequently, availing itself of its power of appreciation afforded also by Article 28 of the\u00a0ICSID arbitration regulations, the Tribunal decides that the costs of the arbitration are to be\u00a0broken down as follows:\nEach party will bear the burden of the expenses and fees of the attorneys and experts it has hired in this procedure;\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the expenses and fees of the members of the Tribunal, as well as the ICSID costs will be borne by the Claimants for the amount of 60%\u00a0and by the Respondent for the amount of 40%.\nIX. ENACTING TERMS\nA. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The investment was not illegal due to corruption and the Arbitral Tribunal therefore confirms\u00a0its jurisdiction (already decided on December 29, 2012) to rule on the effects of the requisition\u00a0and other alleged violations of the Investment Code which do not fall into the framework of\u00a0the Concession Agreement with respect to the four Claimants.\nB. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the request concerning the net\u00a0value of the cash flow for the period of the concession of which the Claimants were deprived\u00a0(lucrum cessans) because this loss is a consequence solely of the termination of the Concession\u00a0Agreement.\nC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arbitral Tribunal does not entertain jurisdiction to rule on the requests concerning the\u00a0additional counts of prejudice resulting from the Termination Decree which are the\u00a0consequence solely of the termination of the Agreement.\n118\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 126 of 173\nD The Respondent violated Articles 5 and 6 of the Investment Code by the acts of the Public Authorities which certain aggravating circumstances of the Termination Decree and the\u00a0requisition Decree constitute.\nE. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent is sentenced to indemnify the Claimants for the prejudice linked to crisis\u00a0management and to pay the sum of euros 248,834 in this capacity.\nF. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Respondent is sentenced to indemnify the Claimants for the prejudice linked to the nonrestitution of a portion of the requisitioned goods and to pay in this capacity \u20ac200,000. If\u00a0Getma International obtains, notwithstanding its annulment, the enforcement of the CCJA\u00a0award and the payment of euros 210,070 which the CCJA Tribunal awarded to it for the same\u00a0prejudice, the amount already received for this prejudice will be deducted from the amount\u00a0awarded here in the same capacity.\nG. \u00a0\u00a0The Respondent is sentenced to pay interest capitalized annually on the foregoing amounts\u00a0accruing from March 8, 2011 until September 30, 2013 and from June 17, 2014 up to the date\u00a0of effective full payment.\nH. \u00a0\u00a0The Respondent is sentenced to pay to the Claimants 40% of the cost of the arbitration,\u00a0namely US dollars 340,000.\nI. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the parties' other requests are rejected.\n119\nCase l:19-cv-02405-DLF Document 1-2 Filed 08/08/19 Page 127 of 173\n[signature]\n[signature]\nProfessor Pierre Tercier Arbitrator\nMarch 8,2016\n  \nMr. Bernardo M.
