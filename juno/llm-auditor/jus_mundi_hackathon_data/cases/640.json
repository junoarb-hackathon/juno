It was registered in Nefteyugansk, Tyumen Region, and at the relevant time was managed by its subsidiary, OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, registered in Moscow. It was represented before the Court by Mr J.P. Gardner, a lawyer practising in London.\n\n2.\n\nThe Russian Government (\"the Government\") were represented by Mr P. Laptev and Mrs V. Milinchuk, former Representatives of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n**A. The circumstances of the case**\n------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.\n\n4.\n\nThe applicant was a holding company established by the Russian Government in 1993 to own and control a number of stand-alone entities specialised in oil production. The company remained fully State-owned until 1995-1996 when, through a series of tenders and auctions, it was privatised.\n\n*1. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2000*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Tax assessment 2000**\n---------------------------\n\n*(i) Original tax inspection*\n-----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nBetween 13 November 2002 and 4 March 2003 the Tax Inspectorate of the town of Nefteyugansk (\"the Tax Office\") conducted a tax inspection of the applicant company.\n\n6.\n\nAs a result of the inspection, on 28 April 2003 the Tax Office drew up a report indicating a number of relatively minor errors in the company's tax returns and served it on the company.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing the company's objections, on 9 June 2003 the Tax Office adopted a decision in which it found the company liable for having filed incomplete returns in respect of certain taxes.\n\n8.\n\nThe decision of the Tax Office was accepted and complied with by the company on 7 July 2003.\n\n*(ii) Additional tax inspection*\n--------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 8 December 2003 the Tax Ministry (\"the Ministry\"), acting as a reviewing body within the meaning of Section 87 (3) of the Tax Code, carried out an additional tax inspection of the applicant company.\n\n10.\n\nOn 29 December 2003 the Ministry issued a report indicating that the applicant company had a large tax liability for the year 2000. The report was detailed and came to over 70 pages. It also had 284 supporting documents in annex. The date of the notification of the report is unclear.\n\n11.\n\nThe Ministry established that in 2000 the applicant company had carried out its activities through a network of 22 trading companies registered in low-tax areas of Russia (the Republic of Mordoviya, the town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the Republic of Kalmykiya, the town of Trekhgornyy in the Chelyabinsk Region, the town of Lesnoy in the Sverdlovsk Region and the Evenk Autonomous District). For all legal purposes, these entities were set up as entirely independent from the applicant, though their sole activity consisted of commissioning the applicant company to buy crude oil on their behalf from the company's own oilproducing subsidiaries and either putting it up for sale on the domestic market or abroad, or first handing it over to the company's own oil-processing plants and then selling it. There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company, its oil-processing and oil-producing subsidiaries and the trading entities, and the company's own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead. All the money thus accumulated from the sales was then transferred unilaterally to the \"Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS\", a commercial entity founded, owned and run by the applicant company. Since at all relevant times the applicant company took part in all the transactions of the trading companies, but acted as the companies' agent and never as an owner of the goods produced and processed by its own subsidiaries and the reward for its services paid by the trading entities was negligible, the company's real turnover was never reflected in any tax documents and, consequently, on its tax returns. In addition, the trading companies were in fact sham entities, as they were neither present nor operated at the place of their registration. In addition, they had no assets and no employees of their own.\n\n12.\n\nThe Ministry found it established, among other things, that:\n\n(a) the actual movement of the traded oil was from the company's production sites to its own processing or storage facilities;\n\n(b) the applicant company acted as an exporter of goods for the purpose of customs clearance, even though the goods had formally been owned and sold by sham companies;\n\n(c) the applicant company through the use of various techniques indirectly established and, at all relevant times *de facto,* controlled and owned the sham entities;\n\n(d) the entirety of the accounting of the companies was carried out by the same two entities, OOO \"YUKOS\" FBC and OOO \"YUKOS\" Invest, both dependant on or belonging to the applicant company;\n\n(e) the network of sham companies was officially managed by OOO \"YUKOS\" RM, all official correspondence, including tax documents, being sent from the postal address of OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, the applicant company's managing subsidiary;\n\n(f) the sham companies and the applicant subsidiaries' companies entered into transactions with lowered prices for the purpose of reducing the taxable base of their operations;\n\n(g) all revenues perceived by the sham companies were thereafter unilaterally transferred to the applicant company;\n\n(h) the statements by the owners and directors of the sham entities, who confessed that they had signed the documents they had been required to sign by the officials of the applicant company, had never conducted any independent activity on behalf of their companies;\n\n(i) and, lastly, that the sham companies received tax benefits unlawfully.\n\n13.\n\nHaving regard to all this, the Ministry decided that the activities of the sham companies served the purpose of screening the real business activity of the applicant company, that the transactions of these companies were sham and that it had been the applicant company, and not the sham entities, which conducted the transactions and became the owner of the traded goods. In view of the above, and also since neither the sham entities nor the applicant company qualified for the tax exemptions, the report concluded that the company, having acted in bad faith, failed properly to reflect these operations in its tax declarations thus avoiding the payment of value-added tax, motorway tax, corporate property tax, housing and socio-cultural tax, tax in respect of sales of fuels and lubricants and profit tax.\n\n14.\n\nThe report referred, *inter alia*, to Articles 7 (3), 38, 39 (1) and 41 of the Tax Code, section 3 of Law No. 1992-1 of the Russian Federation (RF) of 6 December 1991 \"On Value Added Tax\", sections 4 and 5 (2) of RF Law No. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 \"On motorway funds in the Russian Federation\", section 21 (\"Ch\") of RF Law No. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the basics of the tax system\", Article 209 (1-2) of the Civil Code, section 2 of RF Law No. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 \"On corporate property tax\", section 2 (1-2) of RF Law No. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On corporate profit tax\", Decision No. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of Russia of 25 July 2001 and Article 56 of the Tax Code.\n\n15.\n\nOn 12 January 2004 the applicant company filed its detailed thirty-page objections to the report. The company admitted that for a very short period of time it had partly owned three out of twenty two organisations mentioned in the report, but denied its involvement in the ownership and management of the remaining nineteen companies. They maintained the position about the lack of their involvement in the companies in question throughout the proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nDuring a meeting between the representatives of the Ministry and the company on 27 January 2004, the applicant's counsel were given an opportunity to state orally their arguments against the report.\n\n17.\n\nHaving considered the company's objections, on 14 April 2004 the Ministry adopted a decision establishing that the applicant had a large outstanding tax liability for the year 2000. As the applicant had failed properly to declare the above-mentioned operations in its tax declarations and to pay corresponding taxes, in accordance with Article 122 (3) of the Tax Code the Ministry found that the company had underreported its tax liability for 2000 and ordered it to pay 47,989,241,953 Russian roubles (RUB) (approximately 1,394,748,234 euros, (EUR)) in tax arrears, RUB 32,190,599,501.40 (approximately EUR 935,580,142) in default interest and RUB 19,195,696,780 as a 40 percent penalty (approximately EUR 557,899,293), totalling RUB 99,375,538,234.40 (approximately EUR 2,888,227,669). The arguments contained in the decision were identical to those of the report of 29 December 2003. In addition, the decision responded in detail to each of the counter-arguments advanced by the company in its objections of 12 January 2004.\n\n18.\n\nThe decision was served on the applicant company on 15 April 2004.\n\n19.\n\nThe company was given until 16 April 2004 to pay voluntarily the amounts due.\n\n20.\n\nThe applicant company alleged that it had requested the Ministry to clarify the report of 29 December 2003 and that the Ministry had failed to respond to this request.\n\n*(iii) Institution of proceedings by the Ministry*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nUnder a rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute between the tax authority and the taxpayer was insolvable, the Ministry did not wait until 16 April 2004.\n\n22.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 it applied to the Moscow City Commercial Court (\"the City Court\") and requested the court to seize the applicant company's assets as a security for the claim.\n\n23.\n\nBy decision of 15 April 2004 the City Court initiated proceedings and prohibited the applicant company from disposing of its assets pending the outcome of litigation. The injunction did not concern goods produced by the company and related cash transactions.\n\n24.\n\nBy the same decision the court fixed the date of the preliminary hearing for 7 May 2004 and invited the applicant company to respond to the Ministry's claims.\n\n25.\n\nOn 23 April 2004 the applicant company filed a motion in which it argued that the City Court had no territorial jurisdiction over the company's legal seat and requested that the case be referred a court in Nefteyugansk, where it was registered.\n\n26.\n\nOn 6 May 2004 the Ministry filed a motion inviting the court to call the applicant company's managing subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva as a co-defendant in the case.\n\n*(iv) Hearing of 7 May 2004*\n----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAt the hearing the City Court examined and rejected the applicant company's motion of 23 April 2004. Having regard to the fact that the applicant company was operated by its own subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, registered and located in Moscow, the court established that the applicant company's real headquarters were in Moscow and not in Nefteyugansk. In view of the above, the court concluded that it was competent to deal with the case.\n\n28.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the applicant company appealed against this decision. The appeal was examined and rejected by the Appeals Division of the Moscow City Commercial Court (\"the Appeal Court\") on 3 June 2004.\n\n29.\n\nThe City Court also examined and granted the Ministry's motion of 6 May 2004. The court ordered OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva to join the proceedings as a co-defendant and adjourned the hearing until 14 May 2004.\n\n30.\n\nAt the hearing of 7 May 2004 the applicant company lodged with the City Court a separate action against the tax assessment of 14 April 2004, seeking to have the assessment decision declared unlawful. The applicant company's brief came to 42 pages and had 22 supporting documents in annex. This action was examined separately and rejected as unsubstantiated by the City Court on 27 August 2004. The judgment of 27 August 2004 was upheld on appeal on 23 November 2004. On 30 December 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts.\n\n*(v) Hearing of 14 May 2004*\n----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn the meantime the tax assessment case continued. On 14 May 2004 the City Court rejected the applicant company's request to adjourn the proceedings, having found that the applicant's counterclaim did not require such adjournment of the proceedings concerning the Ministry's action.\n\n32.\n\nOOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva also requested that the hearing be adjourned as it was allegedly not ready to participate in the proceedings.\n\n33.\n\nThis request was rejected by the court as unfounded on the same date.\n\n34.\n\nAt the hearing the respondent companies also requested the City Court to vary their procedural status to that of interested parties.\n\n35.\n\nThe court rejected this request and, on the applicant company's motion, ordered the Ministry to disclose its evidence.\n\n36.\n\nThe court then decided that the merits of the case would be heard on 21 May 2004.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the Ministry invited the applicant company to examine the evidence in the case file at its premises. A team of at least five lawyers representing the applicant company made use of this invitation on 18, 19 and 20 May 2004.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the applicant company, the supporting material underlying the case was first provided to the company on 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed approximately 24,000 pages of documents. Allegedly, on 18 May 2004 the Ministry disclosed approximately 45,000 further pages, and a further 2,000 pages on the eve of the hearing before the City Court, i.e. on 20 May 2004.\n\n*(vi) First-instance judgment*\n------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe hearings on the merits of the case commenced on 21 May and lasted until 26 May 2004.\n\n40.\n\nOn 26 May 2004, at the end of the hearings, the City Court gave its judgment in which, for the most part, it reached the same findings and came to the same conclusions as in the Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004. Having confirmed the factual findings of the decision of 14 April 2004 in respect of the relations and transactions between the sham companies and the applicant company, the court then reasoned as follows:\n\n\"... Under section 3 of RF Law N. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 'On value-added tax', part 2 of Section 5 and section 4 of RF Law No. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 'On motorway funds in the Russian Federation', subpart 'ch' of section 21 of RF Law No. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 'On the basics of the tax system', the sale of goods (works and services) give rise to an obligation to pay value-added tax, motorway users' tax, tax on the sale of oil and oil products, tax on maintenance of the housing fund and objects of socio-cultural sphere.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 38 of the Tax Code, the objects of taxation may be the sale of goods (works and services), assets, profit, value of the sold goods (works and services) or other objects having value, quantity or physical characteristics on the presence of which the tax legislation bases the obligation to pay tax.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 39 of the Tax Code, sales are defined as the transfer of property rights in respect of goods. Under subpart 1 and 2 of Article 209 of the Civil Code (taking into account Article 11 of the Tax Code) the owner of goods in the person who has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of his property, that is, the one who has the right to carry out at his own discretion in respect of this property any actions which are not against the law and other legal acts and do not breach the rights and protected interests of other persons ...\n\nThe court established that the owner of the oil sold under contracts concluded with organisations registered in low-tax territories had been OAO Yukos. The respondents' arguments about the unlawfulness of the use of the notion of *de facto* owner (*\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a*) on the basis that, according to Article 10 (3) and Article 8 (1) part 3 of the Civil Code ... there existed a presumption of good faith on the part of parties involved in civil-law transactions and that therefore the persons indicated as owners in the respective contracts should be regarded as the owners, are baseless, because the above-mentioned organisations never acquired any property rights in respect of oil and oil products (*\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0443 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e*).\n\nOAO NK Yukos was therefore under an obligation to pay [the taxes], which has not been complied with in good time.\n\nArticle 41 of the Tax Code establishes that profit is an economic gain in monetary form or in kind, which is taken into account if it is possible to evaluate it and in so far as it can be assessed. Under subparts 1 and 2 of section 2 of RF Law No. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 'On profit tax of enterprises and organisations' which was then in force, the object of taxation is the gross profit of the enterprise, decreased (or increased) in accordance with the provisions of the present section. The gross profit is the total of revenues (receipts) from the sale of products (works and services), main assets (including land parcels), other property of the enterprise and the profit derived from operations other than sales, decreased by the sum of expenses in respect of these operations. Since it follows from the case file that the economic profit from the sale of oil and oil products was perceived by OAO NK Yukos, it was incumbent on [the applicant company] to comply with the obligation to pay profit tax.\n\nSection 2 of RF Law No. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 'On corporate property tax' taxes the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts which are indicated on the taxpayer's balance sheet. It follows that the obligation to pay property tax was incumbent on the person who was legally responsible for reflecting the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts on its balance sheet. Since it follows from the materials of the case that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.\n\nThe court does not accept the respondent's arguments that the tax authorities lacked the power to levy taxes from OAO NK Yukos in respect of the sums ... perceived by other organisations. The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision No. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001. At the same time the bad faith of taxpayer OAO NK Yukos and the fact that the proceeds from operations with oil and oil products is confirmed by the materials of the case file.\n\nThe court has also established that the use of tax benefits by organisations which were dependent from OAO NK Yukos and participated in the tax evasion scheme set up by that company was unlawful.\n\nPursuant to Article 56 of the Tax Code, tax benefits are recognised as preferences provided for in the tax legislation for certain groups of taxpayers, in comparison to other taxpayers, including the possibility of not paying a tax or of paying it at a lower rate.\n\nThe court believes that tax payers must use their right to such benefits in good faith.\n\nMeanwhile, it follows from the materials of the case that the taxpayers [concerned] used their right in bad faith.\n\nThe entities registered on the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya (OOO Yu-Mordoviya ..., ZAO Yukos-M ..., OAO Alta-Treyd ..., OOO Ratmir ..., OOO Mars XXII ...) applied benefits governed by Law of the Republic of Mordoviya No. 9-Z of 9 March 1999 'On conditions for the efficient use of the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya', which set out a special taxation procedure for entities with the purpose of creating beneficial conditions for attracting capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, developing the securities market and creating additional jobs. Under section 2 of that law, the special taxation procedure applies in respect of entities (including foreign entities, operating through permanent representative offices established in the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya), established after the entry into force of the law (with the exception of entities conducting leasing business, banks and other credit institutions) and whose business conforms to one of the following conditions: export operations, with the resulting quarterly earnings totalling at least at fifteen percent of the whole of the entity's earnings; wholesale trading of combustibles and lubricants and other kinds of hydrocarbons with the resulting quarterly earning totalling at least at seventy percent of the whole of the entity's earnings; and other conditions enumerated in that law. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Law, the Government of the Republic of Mordoviya passed resolutions on the application of the special taxation procedure in respect of the mentioned entities and, consequently, on the application of the following tax rates: at the rate of zero percent in respect of profit tax in so far as it is credited to the republican and local budgets of the Republic of Mordoviya; at the rate of zero per cent on motorway users' tax in so far as it is credited to the Territorial Road Fund of the Republic of Mordoviya; and at the rate of zero percent on corporate property tax. Moreover, the above-mentioned entities were exempted from payment of tax on maintenance of the housing fund and socio-cultural facilities by local government resolutions.\n\nHowever, the special taxation procedure is provided for [by this law] for the purposes of creating favourable conditions to attract capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, develop the securities market and create additional jobs. The entities which used those benefits did not actually carry out their activities on the territory of this subject of the Russian Federation, did not attract capital, did not facilitate the strengthening of the Republic's socio-economic potential, but, on the contrary, inflicted material damage through non-payment of taxes to the budget of the Republic, the local budget and the federal budget. Thus, the use of the tax benefits in respect of these entities was not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Mordoviya but pursued the aim of evading taxes on the production, refining and sales operations of in respect of oil and oil products by OAO NK Yukos and is, as a consequence, unlawful.\n\nThe entity registered on the territory of the Republic of Kalmykiya (OOO Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya ...) did not pay profit tax, property tax, motorway users' tax, tax on the acquisition of vehicles and other taxes in accordance with Law No. 12-P-3 of the Republic of Kalmykiya of 12 March 1999 'On tax benefits to enterprises investing in the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya', which establishes advantages in respect of taxes and duties for the categories of taxpayers that invest into the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya and are registered as such enterprises with the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic of Kalmykiya. Moreover, the entity in question was exempt from payment of local taxes and payment of profit tax to the consolidated budget.\n\nAt the same time, it follows from the presumption of good faith of taxpayers (Decisions No. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 25 July 2001, No. 4-O of 10 January 2002 and No. 108-O of 14 May 2002, Rulings of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court no. 9408/00 dated 18 September 2001, no. 7374/01 of 18 June 2002, No. 6294/01 of 5 November 2002 and no. 11259/02 of 17 December 2002 and letter no. \u04215-5/\u0443\u043f-342 of the Deputy President of the Supreme Commercial Court of 17 April 2002) that, for the application of tax advantages to become lawful, the amount of the advantages provided and the sum of investments made by the entity should be commensurate. Since the amounts of benefits declared for tax purposes by the above-mentioned entities and the sums of investment made are obviously not commensurate, application of the advantages is unlawful. The application of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya but pursues the aim of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of the operations of production, refining and sales of oil and oil products and, consequently, is unlawful.\n\nThe entity registered in the closed administrative territorial formation (ZATO) town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (OOO Yuksar ...) concluded a tax agreement on the provision of tax concessions with the Sarov municipal administration. The granting of additional tax advantages on the territory of the Sarov ZATO (Federal Nuclear Centre) in 2000 was regulated by the norms of Articles 21 and 56 of the Tax Code, section 58 of Law no. 227-FZ of 31 December 1999 'On the federal budget for the year 2000', section 5 of Law No. 3297-1 'On closed administrative territorial formations' of 14 July 1992, Item 2 of Paragraph 30 of Decree No. 222 of the Russian Government of 13 March 2000 'On measures for implementation of the Federal Law 'On the Federal Budget for 2000' and Regulations 'On the investment zone of the town of Sarov', approved by a Resolution of the Sarov Duma on 30 December 1999. According to the tax agreement, the Sarov administration confers advantages in respect of taxes payable into the Sarov budget to the entity in question in the form of a reduction in the share of taxes and other compulsory payments to the budget, to twenty-five percent of the sums due in value-added tax, property tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, tax on vehicle owners, tax on the acquisition of vehicles, profit tax, tax on operations with securities and excise duties; in exchange, the entity undertakes to participate in investment projects (programmes) implemented in the Sarov investment zone or with its participation, aimed at raising additional budget receipts and solving the problems of Sarov's socioeconomic development by transferring quarterly at least one percent of the sum of the tax advantages.\n\nAt the same time, according to Paragraph 1 of section 5 of the Federal Law No. 3297-1 'On closed administrative territorial formations' of 17 July 1992, additional benefits on taxes and duties are granted by the appropriate local government authorities to entities registered as taxpayers with the authorities of the closed administrative territorial formations in compliance with the mentioned law. Entities possessing at least ninety percent of capital assets and at least seventy percent of their activities on the territories of the closed administrative territorial formations (including the requirement that persons who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question must constitute at least seventy percent of the average number of employees on the payroll and at least seventy percent of the labour remuneration fund must be paid to employees who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question) enjoy the right to obtain the benefits in question. Given that OOO Yuksar did not actually carry out any activity on the territory of Sarov, was not actually present on the territory of Sarov and that there were no assets and production facilities necessary for the procurement and storage of oil on the territory of Sarov, Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the given entity applied the tax advantages unlawfully.\n\nThus, the use of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Sarov ZATO but pursued the aimed of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of its obligation to pay taxes on operations of production, refining and sales of oil and oil products and is, consequently, unlawful.\n\nEntities registered in the Trekhgornyy ZATO in the Chelyabinsk Region (OOO Kverkus ..., OOO Muskron ..., OOO Nortex ..., OOO Greis ... and OOO Virtus ...) concluded tax agreements with the administration of the town of Trekhgornyy, according to which entities were granted advantages in respect of profit tax, tax on maintenance of the housing fund and socio-cultural facilities, property tax, land tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, tax on vehicle users, and tax on the acquisition of vehicles, on condition that the entities would remit the sum of five percent from the amount of tax advantages conferred for the implementation of the town's socioeconomic programmes to the Trekhgornyy administration's account. Reasoning from the contents and sense of tax agreements, it follows that their purpose was the implementation of the particularly important socioeconomic task of developing the educational, medical service and housing spheres in the Trekhgornyy ZATO. At the same time, the sums which were transferred to the budget by the taxpayers in question were many times less than the sums of the declared tax advantages (the sum of investments is around 0.006 percent of the sum of the advantages for each taxpayer). Thus, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of Trekhgornyy's economy. On the contrary, since the above-mentioned organisations did not in fact carry out any activities, were never located on the territory of Trekhgornyy, had no assets and production facilities necessary to buy and store oil on the territory of Trekhgornyy, the application of tax advantages by the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law No. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 'On closed administrative territorial formations'.\n\nThe organisations registered in the Lesnoy ZATO in the Sverdlovsk Region (OOO Mitra ..., OOO Vald-oyl ..., OOO Bizness-oyl ...) concluded tax agreements on the granting of a targeted tax concession under which organisations were granted the concession in respect of profit tax, land tax, tax on the sales of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, vehicle users' tax, tax on the acquisition of vehicles, tax on maintenance of the housing fund and socio-cultural facilities and property tax, whilst the organisations [in question] were under an obligation to transfer to the account of the Lesnoy municipal administration sums in the amount of five percent of the sums of the granted tax concessions, but no less than 6,000 roubles quarterly, for implementation of the town's socioeconomic programmes. [However], the sums received from the taxpayers are many times less than the sums of the declared tax advantages. Accordingly, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of the economy of the town of Lesnoy because the above-mentioned organisations never carried out any activities on the territory of Lesnoy, were never in fact located on the territory of Lesnoy and had no assets and production facilities required to sell and store oil on the territory of Lesnoy, the application of the tax advantages in respect of the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law No. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 'On closed administrative territorial formations'.\n\nThe organisation registered in the Evenk Autonomous District (OOO Petroleum-Treiding) without in fact carrying out any activity on the territory of the district in question and without in fact being located on the territory of the Evenk Autonomous District, abused its right granted by Law No. 108 of the Evenk Autonomous District of 24 September 1998 'On specific features of the tax system in the Evenk Autonomous District'. The mentioned organisation was registered in the given district solely for the purpose of acquiring the right to the tax concession that could be granted in the Evenk Autonomous District. The use of the tax benefits by the organisation in question is not aimed at strengthening of economy of the Evenk Autonomous District, but is rather aimed at tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of operations of extraction, processing and sales of oil and oil products and is thus unlawful.\n\nThus, the use of tax concessions by the above-mentioned organisations is not aimed at strengthening of the economy of the regions in which they were registered but is aimed at evading the taxes due in respect of the operations of extraction, processing and sales of oil and oil products by OAO NK Yukos and is thus unlawful. ...\"\n\n41.\n\nThe first-instance judgment also responded to the applicant company's submissions. As regards the argument that the Ministry's calculations were erroneous in that they led to double taxation and the failure to take account of the right to a refund of value-added tax (VAT) for export operations, the court noted that, contrary to the company's allegations, both the revenues and expenses of the sham entities had been taken into account by the Ministry so as to avoid double taxation. In addition, under Law No. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On value-added tax\", in order to claim a refund of the value-added tax paid during export operations a tax payer had to justify the claim in accordance with a special procedure and the applicant company had failed to apply for a refund either in 2000 or at any later date. As to the argument that the Ministry's claim was time-barred, the court refuted it with reference to Article 113 of the Tax Code and Decision No. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 21 July 2001. The court held that the rules on limitation periods were inapplicable in the case at issue as the applicant had acted in bad faith. In response to the company's argument that the interdependency within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code was only relevant for the purposes of price correction under Article 40 of the Code, the court observed that the interdependency of the sham companies and the applicant company was one of the circumstances on the basis of which the tax authorities had proved the tax offence committed by the applicant company in bad faith.\n\n42.\n\nAccordingly, by the judgment of 26 May 2004 the court upheld the decision of 14 April 2004, albeit slightly reducing the payable amounts by reference to the Ministry's failure to prove the relations of the applicant company with one of the entities mentioned in the decision of 14 April 2004. The court ordered the applicant company to pay RUB 47,989,073,311 (approximately EUR 1,375,080,541) in taxes, RUB 32,190,430,314 (approximately EUR 922,385,687) in default interest and RUB 19,195,606,923 (approximately EUR 550,031,575) in penalties, totalling RUB 99,375,110,548 (approximately EUR 2,847,497,802) and ordered its managing subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva to comply with this decision. The judgment could be appealed against by the parties within a thirty-day time-limit.\n\n43.\n\nAt the hearings of 21 to 26 May 2004 the applicant company and its managing subsidiary were represented by eight counsel. The reasoned copy of the judgment of 26 May 2004 was produced and became available to the parties on 28 May 2004.\n\n*(vii) Appeal proceedings*\n--------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 1 June 2004 OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva filed an appeal against the judgment of 26 May 2004.\n\n45.\n\nThe Ministry appealed against the judgment on 2 June 2004.\n\n46.\n\nOn 4 June 2004 the Appeal Court listed the appeals of OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva and the Ministry to be heard on 18 June 2004.\n\n47.\n\nOn 17 June 2004 the applicant company filed its appeal against the judgment of 26 May 2004. The brief came to 115 pages and contained 41 documents in annex. The company complained, in particular, that the time for filing an appeal had been unlawfully abridged, in breach of its rights to fair and adversarial proceedings, that the first-instance judgment was ungrounded and unlawful, that the evidence in the case was unlawful, that the first instance court had erred in interpretation and application of the domestic law in that it had lacked legal authority to \"assign\" the tax liabilities of one company to another and that the court's interpretation of legislation on tax concessions had been erroneous. The company also argued that the lower court had wrongly assessed the evidence in the case and had come to wrong factual conclusions in respect of the relationships between the applicant and sham companies, that in any event some of the operations of the sham companies had been unrelated to the alleged tax evasion and that the respective sums should not be \"assigned\" to the applicant company, and also that the case should have been tried in the town of Nefteyugansk, where the company was registered.\n\n48.\n\nThe appeal hearing in the case lasted from 18 until 29 June 2004.\n\n49.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing of 18 June 2004 the applicant company requested the Appeal Court to adjourn the proceedings. The company considered that the hearing had been fixed for too early a date, before the expiry of the statutory time-limit for lodging appeals.\n\n50.\n\nThe court refused this request as unfounded.\n\n51.\n\nAt the hearings of 21 and 28 June 2004 the applicant company filed four supplements to its appeal. The company and its managing subsidiary were represented by ten counsel.\n\n52.\n\nUnder Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure the court fully re-examined the case presented by the Ministry rather than simply reviewing the first-instance judgment.\n\n53.\n\nAt the end of the hearing of 29 June 2004 the court delivered its judgment, in which it reached largely similar findings and came to the same conclusions as the first-instance judgment. The court rejected the company's appeals as unfounded and decided to change the first instance judgment in part. In particular, it declared the Ministry's claims in respect of the VAT partly unfounded, reduced the amount of the VAT arrears by RUB 22,939,931 (approximately EUR 649,336) and quashed the corresponding penalty of RUB 10,334,226 (approximately EUR 292,520).\n\n54.\n\nThe court judgment, in its relevant parts, read as follows:\n\n\"... The parties declared under part 5 of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts procedure that there was a need to check the lawfulness and grounds of the first instance judgment and to hold a repeated hearing of the case in full.\n\nThe Appeal Court has checked the lawfulness and grounds of the first instance judgment pursuant to ... Article 268 ... of the Code of Commercial Courts procedure.\n\n...\n\nThe Appeal Court does not accept the arguments of the respondents about the erroneous interpretation and application of the norms of the substantive law by the first instance court and about the factual incorrectness of the court's conclusions.\n\n[the court went on reviewing and confirming all factual findings made by the Ministry and the first instance court in respect of the tax evasion scheme set up by the applicant company]\n\n... Having in mind the stated circumstances, the Appeal Court established that the *de facto* owner of the oil was [the applicant]. The acquisition and transfer for processing of the oil and the sales of the oil in reality was carried out by [the applicant] as the owner, which is proved by the control of [the applicant company] over all operations, the actual movement of the oil from the extracting entities to processing entities or oil facilities controlled by [the applicant company], which is proved by the materials of the case.\n\n...\n\nThe [applicant company's] ownership of the oil is confirmed by the interdependence of the contracting parties, by the control that [the applicant company] had over them, by the registration of the contracting parties on the territories with low-tax regime, by the lack of activities by these entities at their place of registration, by the fact that the accounting of these was carried by OOO Yukos-Invest or OOO Yukos-FBC, companies officially dependant on [the applicant company], by the fact that the accounting of these entities was filed from the addresses of [the applicant company] and OOO Yukos-Moskva, by the fact that the bank accounts were opened in the same banks owned by [the applicant company], by the presence and character of commercial relations between [the applicant company] and the dependent entities, and by the use of promissory notes and mutual offsetting between them.\n\n...\n\nUnder the legislation then in force, such as section 3 of RF Law N. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 'On value-added tax', part 2 of Section 5 and section 4 of RF Law No. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 'On motorway funds in the Russian Federation', subpart 'ch' of section 21 of RF Law No. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 'On the basics of the tax system', the sale of goods (works and services) give rise to an obligation to pay value-added tax, motorway users' tax, tax on the sale of oil and oil products, tax on maintenance of the housing fund and objects of socio-cultural sphere.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 39 of the Tax Code, sales are defined as the transfer of property rights in respect of goods. Under subpart 1 and 2 of Article 209 of the Civil Code (taking into account Article 11 of the Tax Code) the owner of goods in the person who has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of his property, that is, the one who has the right to carry out at his own discretion in respect of this property any actions which are not against the law and other legal acts and do not breach the rights and protected interests of other persons...\n\nIt follows that the person who in fact had the rights ownership, use and disposal of his property and who, in view of these rights, actually, at his discretion exercises in respect of his property any actions, including transfers of property to other persons ... is the owner of this property.\n\nTherefore, OAO NK Yukos, being a *de facto* owner of the oil, was under an obligation to pay [the taxes], which has not been complied with in good time.\n\nAs it was established, Article 41 of the Tax Code establishes that profit is an economic gain in monetary form or in kind, which is taken into account if it is possible to evaluate it and in so far as it can be assessed, and determined in accordance with chapters 'Taxes in respect of the profits of natural persons', 'Taxes in respect of the profits of organisations', 'Taxes in respect of the capital profits' of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. Under subparts 1 and 2 of section 2 of RF Law No. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 'On profit tax of enterprises and organisations' which was then in force, the object of taxation is the gross profit of the enterprise, decreased (or increased) in accordance with the provisions of the present section. The gross profit is the total of revenues (receipts) from the sale of products (works and services), main assets (including land parcels), other property of the enterprise and the profit derived from operations other than sales, decreased by the sum of expenses in respect of these operations. The court established that the economic profit from the sale of oil and oil products was perceived by OAO NK Yukos, it was incumbent on [the applicant company] to comply with the obligation to pay profit tax.\n\nSection 2 of RF Law No. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 'On corporate property tax' taxes the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts which are indicated on the taxpayer's balance sheet. It follows that the obligation to pay property tax was incumbent on the person who was legally responsible for reflecting the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts on its balance sheet. Since it follows from the materials of the on-site tax inspection that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of the RF in its decision of 25.07.2001 n. 138-0 stated that it followed from the meaning of the norm contained in part 7 of Article 3 of the Tax Code of the RF that there is a presumption of good faith of taxpayers. In order to refute it and establish the bad faith of the taxpayer, the tax authorities have the right \u2013 in order to strike a balance between the public and private interests \u2013 to carry out necessary checks and bring subsequent claims in commercial courts which would guarantee the payment of taxes to the budget.\n\nIn view of the above, the tax authorities ... have the right to carry out checks with a view to establishing the *de facto* owner of the sold property and the *de facto* recipient of the economic profit and also with a view to establishing his bad faith expressed in the application of the tax evasion scheme. At the same time, the tax authorities establish the *de facto* owner with regard to the actual relations between the parties to the transaction irrespective of whether the persons had been declared as owners of the property in the documents submitted during the tax inspections.\n\nThe circumstances indicating that OAO NK Yukos in fact had the rights of ownership, use and disposal of its oil and oil products and, at its discretion carried out in this connection any actions, including the sale, the transfer for processing etc. through specially registered organisations dependant on OAO NK Yukos is confirmed by the materials of the case.\n\n...\n\nIn view of the above, the court does not accept the respondents' arguments about the unlawfulness and the lack of factual basis of the decision to levy additional taxes from OAO NK Yukos as the *de facto* owner of the oil and oil products.\n\nThe respondent's argument that OAO NK Yukos had not perceived any economic profit from the application of benefits by the entities mentioned in the decision of the Ministry contradicts the materials of the case. The court had established that OAO NK Yukos received economic profit in the form of unilateral transfers of cash. OAO NK Yukos has created the Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO NK Yukos [to this effect].\n\n...\n\nThe argument of OAO NK Yukos that the Ministry is levying taxes in respect of transactions \"within the same owner\" is unsupported, since the calculations of additional taxes (except for the property tax in respect of which [this is inapplicable]) take into account also the expenses connected with the acquisition of the oil and oil products.\n\nThe court does not accept the respondent's arguments that the tax authorities lacked the power to levy taxes from OAO NK Yukos in respect of the sums ... perceived by other organisations. The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision No. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001. At the same time the bad faith of taxpayer OAO NK Yukos and the fact that the proceeds from operations with oil and oil products is confirmed by the materials of the case file.\n\nThe circumstances of the transactions of acquisition and sales of the oil and oil products taken in their entirety established by the Appeal Court indicate the presence of bad faith in the actions of OAO NK Yukos which was expressed in intentional actions aimed at tax evasion by the application of unlawful schemes. In accordance with part 2 of Article 110 of the Tax Code of the RF the tax offence is considered intentional, if the person who has committed it knew about the unlawful character of the actions (inactions), wished them or conscientiously admitted the possibility of harmful consequences of such actions (inactions) taking place.\n\nSince OAO NK Yukos intentionally committed action aimed at the tax evasion, and its officers were aware of the unlawful character of such actions, wished or knowingly admitted the possibility of harmful consequences due to such actions, OAO NK Yukos has to be held liable under part 3 of Article 122 of the Tax Code of the RF for the non-payment or incomplete payment of taxes due to the lowering of the taxable base or incorrect calculation of the tax or other unlawful actions (inactions) committed intentionally, in the form of a fine in the amount of 40 percent of the unpaid taxes.\n\n...\n\nHaving repeatedly examined the case and checked the lawfulness and grounds of the first instance judgment in full, having examined the evidence and having heard the arguments of the parties, the Appeal Court came to the conclusion that the decision of the Ministry dated 14.04.2004 ... is in compliance with the Tax Code as well as with Federal laws and other laws on taxes ...\n\nThe claims for payment of taxes, interest surcharges and fines made in the decision of the Ministry of 14.04.2004 ... are grounded, lawful and confirmed by the primary documents of the materials of the inspection submitted to the court to justify them. ...\"\n\n55.\n\nThe appeal judgment also responded to the applicant company's other arguments. As regards the alleged breaches of the procedure and the lack of time for the preparation of the defence at first instance, the court noted that it had checked this allegation and that there had been no violation of procedure at first instance and that in any event the applicant company had had ample opportunities to study the evidence relied on by the Ministry both at the Ministry's premises and in court. As regards the argument that the evidence used by the Ministry was inadmissible, the court noted that the materials of the case had been collected in full compliance with the requirements of the domestic legislation. The court also agreed with the first instance court in that the three years statutory time-limit had been inapplicable in the applicant's case since the company had been acting in bad faith.\n\n56.\n\nThe first instance judgment, as upheld on appeal, came into force on 29 June 2004.\n\n57.\n\nThe applicant company had two months from the date of the delivery of the appeal judgment to challenge it in third-instance cassation proceedings (*\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f*).\n\n*(viii) Cassation proceedings*\n------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nOn 7 July 2004 the applicant company filed a cassation appeal against the judgments of 26 May and of 29 June 2004 with the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit (\"the Circuit Court\"). The applicant company's brief came to 77 pages and had 6 documents in annex. The arguments in the brief were largely similar to those raised by the applicant company on appeal, namely that the judgment was unlawful and unfounded, that the entities mentioned in the report ought to have taken part in the proceedings, that the trial court had had insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant company and other entities were interrelated, that the evidence used by the trial court was unlawful, that the trial proceedings had not been adversarial and that the principle of equality of arms had been breached. In addition, the company alleged that it had had insufficient time to study the evidence and had been unable to contest the evidence in the case, that the Ministry had unlawfully applied to a court before the applicant company had an opportunity to comply with the decision of 14 April 2004 voluntarily, that the entities mentioned in the report had in fact been eligible for the tax exemptions, that the rules governing tax exemption had been wrongly interpreted, that the Ministry's claims had been time-barred, that the company had had insufficient time for the preparation of the appeal, and that the case ought to have been examined by a court in Nefteyugansk.\n\n59.\n\nA copy of the reasoned version of the appeal judgment of 29 June 2004 was attached to the brief.\n\n60.\n\nIt appears that on an unspecified date the Ministry, too, also challenged the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004.\n\n61.\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the Circuit Court examined the cassation appeals and upheld in substance the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004.\n\n62.\n\nIn respect of the applicant company's allegations of unfairness in the appeal proceedings, the court noted that both defendant companies had had ample opportunities to avail themselves of their right to bring appeals within the statutory time-limit, as the appeal decision was not taken until 29 June 2004, which was more than thirty days from the date of the delivery of the judgment of 26 May 2004. Furthermore, the court observed that the evidence presented by the Ministry and examined by the lower courts was lawful and admissible, and that it had been fully available to the defendant companies before the commencement of the trial hearings. The court also noted that on 14 May 2004 the City Court specifically ordered the Ministry to disclose all the evidence in the case, that this order has been complied with by the Ministry and that, despite the fact that the evidence was voluminous, the applicant company had had sufficient time to examine and challenge it repeatedly throughout the proceedings between May and July 2004.\n\n63.\n\nAs regards the applicant company's complaint that the Ministry had brought proceedings before the expiry of the time-limit for voluntary compliance with the decision of 14 April 2004, the court noted that the Ministry and lower courts had acted in compliance with Article 213 of the Commercial Court Procedure Code, as there were irreconcilable differences between the parties and, throughout the proceedings, the applicant company had had insufficient cash to satisfy the Ministry's claims.\n\n64.\n\nIn respect of the applicant company's argument that the case should have been tried by a court in Nefteyugansk, the court noted that the City Court had had jurisdiction over the case under Article 54 of the Civil Code and decision no. 6/8 of the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court and Supreme Commercial Court of 1 July 1996.\n\n65.\n\nOn the merits of the case, the court noted that the lower courts had reached reasoned conclusions that the applicant company was the effective owner of all goods traded by the sham companies registered in low-tax areas, that the transactions of these entities were in fact those of the applicant, that neither the company nor the sham entities were eligible for the tax exemptions and that the applicant company had perceived the entirety of the resulting profits. The court upheld the lower courts' conclusion that, acting in bad faith, the applicant company had failed properly to declare its transactions for the year 2000 and to return corresponding taxes, including value-added tax, profit tax, motorway users' tax, property tax, tax on maintenance of the residential fund and socio-cultural facilities and tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants.\n\n66.\n\nThe court noted some arithmetical mistakes in the appeal judgment of 29 June 2004, increasing the penalty by RUB 1,158,254.40 (approximately EUR 32,613) and reducing the default interest by RUB 22,939,931 (approximately EUR 645,917) accordingly.\n\n*(ix) Constitutional review*\n----------------------------\n\n67.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant company lodged a complaint against the domestic courts' decisions in its case with the Constitutional Court.\n\n68.\n\nBy decision of 18 January 2005 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n*(x) Supervisory review*\n------------------------\n\n69.\n\nSimultaneously to bringing the cassation appeal, on 7 July 2004 the applicant company also challenged the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004 by way of supervisory review before the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia.\n\n70.\n\nOn 31 December 2004 the applicant company's case was accepted for examination by the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n71.\n\nBy a decision of 13 January 2005 the Supreme Commercial Court, sitting with a bench of three judges, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court. Addressing one of the applicant company's arguments, the court noted that the lower courts had decided that the three-year statutory time-bar was inapplicable in the case at issue since the applicant company had been acting in bad faith. It further noted that such an interpretation of the rules on the time-limits was not in line with the existing legislation and case-law and that therefore the issue should be resolved by the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n72.\n\nOn 19 April 2005 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court referred the above-mentioned issue to the Constitutional Court and adjourned the examination of the applicant company's supervisory review appeal pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.\n\n73.\n\nBy a decision of 14 July 2005 the Constitutional Court upheld Article 113 of the Tax Code as compatible with the Constitution, having ruled that the legal provisions on the statutory time-limits ought to be applied in all cases without exception and irrespective of the applicant's conduct. The court further mentioned that:\n\n\"... the provisions of Article 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in their constitutional and legal sense and in the present legal context do not exclude that the court may have a possibility in cases where the taxpayer impedes the tax supervision and the carrying out of the tax inspections to excuse the tax authorities' failure to bring the proceedings on time ...\"\n\n\"... In their constitutional and legal sense in the context of the present legal regulation... [these provisions] mean that the running of the statutory time-bar in respect of a person prosecuted for tax offences stops on the date of the production of the tax audit report in which the supported facts of the tax offences revealed during the inspection are mentioned and in which there are reference to the relevant articles of the Tax Code or - in cases where there was no need in producing such a report -from the moment on which the respective decision of the tax authority holding a taxpayer liable of a tax offence was taken. ...\"\n\n74.\n\nThe case was then returned to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n75.\n\nOn 4 October 2005 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court examined and rejected the company's appeal. In respect of the company's argument that the Ministry's claims were time-barred, the court noted that the Ministry's tax audit report in the applicant's case had been completed on 29 December 2003 that is within the statutory three-year time-limit and that thus the case was not time-barred.\n\n**(b) Enforcement measures relating to the 2000 Tax Assessment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nSimultaneously with the determination of the case before the courts in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2000, the parties also took part in various enforcement proceedings.\n\n*(i) Attachment of the applicant's property*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nOn 15 April 2004 the City Court accepted the Ministry's action in respect of 2000 for consideration and attached the applicant company's assets, excluding goods produced by the company and related cash transactions, as a security for the claims. The court also issued writs of execution in this respect (see paragraph 22).\n\n78.\n\nBy a decision of 16 April 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in connection with the attachment.\n\n79.\n\nOn the same day they executed the attachment order by informing the applicant company and the holder of its corporate register, ZAO 'M-Reestr', of the decision of 15 April 2004.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to the Government, the applicant company impeded the execution of the writs issued by the court by hiding its corporate register from the bailiffs. In particular, they alleged that a few hours prior to the bailiffs' visit, the applicant company had cancelled its contracts with ZAO 'M-Reestr'. The register was then dispatched by ordinary post to a location in Russia so that, over the next weeks, it could not be physically found and the execution writs could not be enforced.\n\n81.\n\nOn 22 April 2004 the applicant company filed a court request to have the attachment of the entirety of its assets replaced by the attachment of the shares in OAO Sibirskaya neftyanaya kompaniya (\"the Sibneft company\", a major Russian oil company which had attempted unsuccessfully to merge with the applicant company in 2003), which belonged to the applicant company and was allegedly worth three times as much as the then liability. The applicant company also alleged that the attachment order adversely affected its proper functioning and invited the authorities to opt for less intrusive measures, insisting on the lack of any risk of asset-stripping.\n\n82.\n\nBy a decision of 23 April 2004 the City Court examined and rejected this request as unfounded. The court found no evidence that the interim measures affected any of the company's production activities.\n\n83.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the applicant company appealed against the decision of 23 April 2004.\n\n84.\n\nThe outcome of court proceedings in respect of the applicant company's appeal of 17 May 2004 is unclear.\n\n85.\n\nOn 23 April 2004 the City Court also examined the applicant company's request for an injunction order against the attachment and rejected it. The court noted that the attachment did not interfere with the company's day-to-day operations and it was a reasonable measure aimed at securing the Ministry's claims.\n\n86.\n\nOn 2 July 2004 the Appeal Court rejected the company's appeal and upheld the judgment.\n\n87.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company brought cassation proceedings in this respect.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement of the Tax Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn the meantime, on 7 May 2004 the applicant company applied to the City Court with a separate action against the tax assessment of 14 April 2004, seeking its invalidation (see paragraph 30 above). The company also requested interim measures in this connection.\n\n89.\n\nFollowing the applicant's request for interim measures, on 19 May 2004 the City Court stayed the enforcement of the Tax Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004, having noted that the Ministry could have enforced the decision in the part relating to taxes and default interests even without waiting for the outcome of the Ministry's claim (Article 46 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure). The court decided however that this might be detrimental for the applicant company and stayed the decision of 14 April 2004 accordingly.\n\n90.\n\nOn 27 May 2004 the applicant company made a public announcement that:\n\n\"... it [was] under an injunction prohibiting it from selling any of its property, including the shares owned by the company. Until the injunction is lifted, the Company is unable to sell its assets in order to obtain liquid funds. Consequently, if the Tax Ministry's efforts continue, we are very likely to enter a state of bankruptcy before the end of 2004\".\n\n91.\n\nIt appears that the City Court's decision of 19 May 2004 to stay the enforcement was appealed against by the Ministry. Having examined the Ministry's arguments at the hearing of 23 June 2004, the Appeal Court quashed the first-instance decision of 19 May 2004 as unlawful and rejected the applicant company's request for interim measures as unfounded.\n\n92.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company appealed against this decision before the Circuit Court.\n\n*(iii) Enforcement of the judgments concerning the 2000 Tax Assessment*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nAs already mentioned earlier (paragraphs 40-57), by a judgment of 26 May 2004 the City Court found in favour of the Tax Ministry upholding the Tax Assessment of 14 April 2004. The Tax Assessment was upheld by the Appeal Court with minor reductions and became enforceable on 29 June 2004.\n\n94.\n\nOn 30 June 2004 the Appeal Court issued the writ of enforcement in this respect. The applicant company was to pay RUB 47,958,133,380 (approximately EUR 1,358,914,565) in reassessed taxes, RUB 32,190,430,314 (approximately EUR 912,129,842) in interest surcharges and RUB 19,185,272,697 (approximately EUR 543,623,045) in penalties.\n\n95.\n\nOn 30 June 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings based on the above judgment, seized the applicant company's assets and gave it five days to pay. The applicant company was informed that it would be liable to pay enforcement fees of seven percent, totalling at RUB 6,953,375,547 (approximately EUR 197,026,920), in the event of failure to honour the debt voluntarily.\n\n96.\n\nOn 7 July 2004 the applicant company challenged the bailiffs' decision of 30 June 2004.\n\n97.\n\nIt argued that the decision to open enforcement proceedings had been unlawful as it was in breach of the rules of bailiffs' territorial competence as the enforcement ought to have taken place in Nefteyugansk and not in Moscow, that the five-day term for voluntary compliance with the court decisions had been too short and that the seizure had made such compliance impossible.\n\n98.\n\nOn 30 July 2004 the City Court examined and rejected these claims as groundless. The court ruled that the bailiffs had acted lawfully and that the seizure of the company's assets did not interfere with its ability or inability to honour its debts.\n\n99.\n\nIt does not appear that the company brought appeal proceedings against this judgment.\n\n100.\n\nIn the meantime, on 1 July 2004 the bailiffs decided to seize 24 subsidiary companies belonging to the applicant company.\n\n101.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision in court.\n\n102.\n\nBy a first-instance judgment of 17 September 2004 the appeal was rejected as unfounded. The judgment was produced on 20 September 2004.\n\n103.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against the judgment before the Appeal Court, though it did bring further appeal proceedings before the Circuit Court.\n\n104.\n\nOn 2 February 2005 the judgment was upheld by the Circuit Court.\n\n105.\n\nIn addition to the above attempts to stay the enforcement of the judgments concerning the 2000 Tax Assessment, the applicant company, by a letter of 5 July 2004, also suggested to the bailiffs that it repay its debts by using Sibneft stock allegedly worth 4,050,000,000 United States dollars (USD), citing its vertically integrated structure as a possible reason for seeking to find the least intrusive solution as well as the need to honour its contractual debts.\n\n106.\n\nOn 14 July 2004 the applicant company filed an action against the bailiffs on account of their alleged failure to respond to the company's offer of 5 July 2004.\n\n107.\n\nOn 17 August 2004 the City Court rejected this action, having noted that the failure to respond was lawful and within the scope of the bailiffs' discretion. The court established that some of the steps undertaken by the applicant company during the unsuccessful merger with the Sibneft company had been contested in different set of proceedings as unlawful. In addition, the applicant company's ownership of the Sibneft shares had been contested by third parties in two different sets of proceedings. On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the bailiff did not breach the law by ignoring the company's offer.\n\n108.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company appealed against the judgment.\n\n109.\n\nAs set out above (paragraph 58), on 7 July 2004 the applicant company filed a cassation appeal against the court judgments on the 2000 Tax Assessment and at the same time it moved to stay the enforcement proceedings. It argued that the company's assets were highly valuable, but that it had insufficient cash to honour the debts immediately and that the seizure of assets made any voluntary settlement impossible. The company also argued that the enforcement of the court judgments in the case would irreparably damage its business as a reversal of the enforcement would be impossible.\n\n110.\n\nBy decision of 16 July 2004 the Appeal Court accepted the cassation appeal and, having examined the motion to stay the enforcement, rejected it as unsubstantiated and unfounded, as the circumstances referred to by the applicant were irrelevant for the domestic law. The court noted that it would be possible to reverse the enforcement as the plaintiff was the Treasury.\n\n111.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Circuit Court on 4 August 2004.\n\n112.\n\nOn 8 October 2004 the applicant company announced that it would comply with the City Court's judgment of 1 March 2004, which had cancelled the issue of additional shares in the applicant company, used for the purpose of acquiring Sibneft. The applicant company, acting in compliance with the court order, instructed the registrar to return its 57.5 percent stake in Sibneft to its former owners.\n\n*(iv) Seven percent enforcement fee*\n------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nBy decision of 9 July 2004 the bailiffs levied an enforcement fee of seven percent in respect of the company's failure to comply with the execution writs of 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 95 above). The applicant company was to pay RUB 6,848,291,175.45 (approximately EUR 190,481,640)\n\n114.\n\nOn 19 July 2004 the applicant company challenged this decision in court.\n\n115.\n\nBy decision of 3 August 2004 the City Court examined the company's action and quashed the decision of 9 July 2004 as disproportionate and unjustified. The court decided that the enforcement fee could only be levied if the respondent had acted in bad faith and found that the bailiffs had failed to examine this question. The court also noted that seven percent was the highest possible rate and that the bailiffs' decision failed to explain why the fee could not be lower. Among other things, the court referred to section 3 of the Ruling of the Constitutional Court No. 13-P of 30 July 2001.\n\n116.\n\nFollowing an appeal by the Ministry, on 27 August 2004 the Appeal Court quashed the decision of 3 August 2004 as erroneous and held that the bailiffs' actions were lawful and justified. The court noted that the applicant company had failed to demonstrate that it had taken any steps to meet the liabilities. It further noted that the cash in the company's accounts was only seized in certain specified amounts and that, over those amounts, the company was free to function as usual. As regards the company's proposal to proffer the Sibneft shares as payment, the court noted that this could not be accepted, because the company's property rights in respect of these shares had been questioned by a third party in a parallel set of proceedings. In addition, the court noted that the applicant company had failed to use a remedy provided in Article 324 of the Commercial Procedure Code.\n\n117.\n\nThe Circuit Court upheld the appeal decision on 6 December 2004.\n\n*(v) Overall debt in respect of 2000*\n-------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2000, the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 99,333,836,391 (approximately EUR 2,814,667,452)\n\n*(vi) Seizure of shares of the applicant company's subsidiary companies*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nOn 14 July 2004 the bailiffs seized the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegas, one of the applicant company's principal production subsidiaries. The decision referred to the applicant company's inability to meet its liabilities.\n\n120.\n\nThe applicant company appealed against this decision in court. With reference to section 59 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, it argued that the bailiffs ought firstly to claim assets which were not involved in the production process, secondly those goods and other values which were not related to the production process and, thirdly, immovable objects, raw material and other main assets relating to the production cycle. In addition, the applicant company referred to Ruling No. 4 of the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court \"On certain questions arising out of seizure and enforcement actions in respect of corporate shares\", dated 3 March 1999, which suggested in respect of those companies which had been privatised by the State as parts of bigger holding groups through the transfer of controlling blocks of shares that the production cycle of the respective production unit should be preserved as much as possible. The company further claimed that the above ruling was applicable to the case at issue, that OAO Yuganskneftegas was a major production unit and that the bailiffs had produced no evidence that the assets and goods and other values not involved in the production process were insufficient. In addition, it reiterated its offer of the shares in Sibneft.\n\n121.\n\nOn 6 August 2004 the City Court examined and allowed the applicant company's challenge of this seizure.\n\n122.\n\nAt the hearing the Ministry and bailiffs referred to sections 9 (5) and 51 (1-4) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act and Government Decree No. 934 \"On seizure of securities\" of 12 August 1998. They argued that, under the applicable domestic law, the seizure should be made first in respect of the cash-flow and then, under section 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings, it would be open to the bailiffs to assess and seize the assets depending on their liquidity. They countered the company's arguments by saying that their references were invalid as they related to the other stage of enforcement stage (the collection of debt and not the seizure as such). Furthermore, they argued that Ruling No. 4 of the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable since, in the case of Yuganskneftegas, the State had transferred only 38 percent of the shares and not a controlling block. With regard to the offer of Sibneft stock, the Ministry and bailiffs argued that the applicant company's rights in respect of these shares had been contested in separate sets of court proceedings and it was therefore risky to accept them as a payment. Lastly, they informed the court that the applicant company had recently hidden the registry records of its three major subsidiaries, OAO Yuganskneftegas, OAO Samaraneftegas and OAO Tomskneft, which, in their view, demonstrated the risk of possible assetstripping by the applicant company.\n\n123.\n\nHaving examined the parties' submissions, the court upheld the applicant company's arguments. It noted that the company's references to the applicable domestic law were correct. With regard to the non-controlling block argument, the court noted that at the time of transfer of the shares, 25 percent of shares were privileged and non-voting. For the remaining 75 percent of the voting stock, the 38 percent transferred by the State constituted the controlling block. The court concluded that the decision of 14 July 2004 was unlawful and quashed it.\n\n124.\n\nOn 9 August 2004 the Ministry challenged the decision of 6 August 2004 on appeal.\n\n125.\n\nOn 18 August 2004 the Appeal Court quashed the decision, finding that the first-instance court had erred both in law and fact. In particular, the court confirmed that it was up to the bailiffs to choose the most liquid assets and dispose of them with a view to honouring the company's huge debt. It also noted that Ruling No. 4 of the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable to the case at issue, as 25 percent of the Yuganskneftgas shares had become privileged by a decision of 2001, and not through privatisation.\n\n126.\n\nFollowing an appeal by the applicant company, on 25 October 2004 the Circuit Court upheld the decision of 18 August 2004.\n\n127.\n\nThe applicant company's attempts to bring supervisory review proceedings against this decision proved unsuccessful.\n\n128.\n\nThe respective complaint was rejected by decision of the Supreme Commercial Court dated 17 December 2004.\n\n129.\n\nIn addition to seizing the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraphs 119-128 above), on 14 July 2004 the bailiffs also seized the shares of OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegas, the applicant company's two other principal production units.\n\n130.\n\nThe company's complaint against the seizure of OAO Tomskneft-VNK proved unsuccessful.\n\n131.\n\nThe City Court rejected an appeal as unfounded on 13 August 2004.\n\n132.\n\nThe applicant company did not contest the judgment in cassation before the Appeal Court.\n\n133.\n\nOn 5 November 2004 the Circuit Court rejected the company's cassation appeal in respect of the judgment of 13 August 2004. The court noted that the seizure was intended to protect the creditor's claims and that there was no indication that the seizure impeded the production cycle or otherwise disturbed the normal functioning of the company.\n\n134.\n\nThe company also unsuccessfully complained about the seizure of its shares in OAO Samaraneftegaz.\n\n135.\n\nThe City Court, acting as a first instance court, dismissed the appeal on 2 September 2004.\n\n136.\n\nThe applicant company failed to appeal the judgment before the Appeal Court, though did pursue the cassation proceedings.\n\n137.\n\nOn 18 January 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the judgment.\n\n138.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant company also offered to settle the debt in fifteen monthly instalments.\n\n139.\n\nOn 12 August 2004 the City Court examined the applicant's request to re-pay the 2000 Tax Assessment award in instalments and rejected it as unfounded. The court noted, among other things, that the tax debt had resulted from intentional tax evasion by the applicant company and that the conduct of the debtor in court and during the enforcement proceedings demonstrated that they did not intend to pay the debts voluntarily.\n\n140.\n\nIt does not appear that the company brought any appeal proceedings in respect of this judgment.\n\n141.\n\nOn 23 August 2004 the applicant company announced that \"to date the Company has voluntarily paid over USD 700 million of 2000 tax charge. Approximately another USD 800 million has been taken from the Company through the collection process\".\n\n*2. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Tax Assessment 2001**\n---------------------------\n\n*(i) Proceedings before the Ministry*\n-------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nBy a decision of 2 September 2004 the Ministry issued a tax assessment for the year 2001 (\"the 2001 Tax Assessment\"). This time the applicant company had to pay RUB 50,759,436,900 (approximately EUR 1,424,746,313) in tax arrears and RUB 28,520,204,254 (approximately EUR 800,522,195) in default interest and RUB 40,607,549,520 in penalties (approximately EUR 1,139,797,051). Since the applicant company had recently been found guilty of a similar offence, the penalty was doubled.\n\n*(ii) The applicant company's request for court injunction*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nOn 14 September 2004 the applicant company brought a court appeal against the decision of 2 September 2004 and requested an injunction against the immediate enforcement of this decision.\n\n144.\n\nOn 5 October 2004 the City Court turned down the request for an injunction and on 13 October 2004 it issued execution writs in respect of the Ministry's decision of 2 September 2004. The court referred to Information Letter No. 83 of the Supreme Commercial Court of 13 August 2004 which recommended that requests for interim measures in such situations be granted only if an applicant could demonstrate some security for a creditor's future claims. The court noted that, in the present case, the applicant company clearly had insufficient cash to satisfy the creditor's claims and dismissed the claims accordingly.\n\n145.\n\nIt appears that the judgment of 5 October 2004 was upheld by the Appeal Court on 3 December 2004 and by the Circuit Court on 29 March 2005.\n\n**(b) Enforcement measures relating to the 2001 Tax Assessment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Enforcement of additional taxes and interest surcharges*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nAs the 2001 Tax Assessment was similar to the 2000 Tax Assessment, the Ministry decided to enforce it directly in the part relating to additional taxes and interest surcharges, without taking the matter to the courts. The applicant company was to pay the amounts due by 4 September 2004.\n\n147.\n\nOn 9 September 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in connection with the decision of 2 September 2004. The company was to pay RUB 50,759,436,900 (approximately EUR 1,424,746,313) in tax arrears and RUB 28,520,204,254 (approximately EUR 800,522,195) in default interest.\n\n148.\n\nIt appears that the 2001 Tax Assessment in part relating to additional taxes and interest surcharges was upheld by the City Court on 11 October 2004. The judgment of 11 October 2004 was upheld on appeal on 16 February 2005. The Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts on 9 December 2005.\n\n149.\n\nThe applicant's request for an injunction pending these proceedings was unsuccessful. The City Court rejected it in its judgment of 5 October 2004. The refusal was upheld by the Appeal Court on 3 December 2004 and by the Circuit Court on 29 March 2005.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement of penalties*\n-------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn so far as the 2001 Tax Assessment related to penalties, the Ministry applied to the City Court to recover them on 3 September 2004.\n\n151.\n\nIt appears that on 11 October 2004 the action was examined and granted by the City Court. The judgment in the case was produced on 15 October 2004.\n\n152.\n\nAccording to the applicant company, its appeal against the judgment of 11 October 2004 was rejected by the Appeal Court on 18 November 2004. It appears that the Circuit Court upheld these two decisions on 15 November 2005.\n\n153.\n\nOn 19 November 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the Tax Assessment 2001 in part relating to penalties. The company was to pay RUB 40,607,549,520 in penalties (approximately EUR 1,139,797,051).\n\n*(iii) Seven percent enforcement fee in respect of additional taxes and interest surcharges*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nOn 20 September 2004 the bailiffs decided to impose a seven percent enforcement fee in respect of the company's failure to abide by the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part relating to taxes and interest surcharges. The applicant company was to pay RUB 5,549,574,880.78 (approximately EUR 155,693,193)\n\n155.\n\nThe resolution was served on the applicant company on 1 October 2004.\n\n156.\n\nOn 29 October 2004 the City Court examined and dismissed the challenge of the decision of 20 September 2004 as groundless.\n\n157.\n\nIt does appear that the company pursued appeal proceedings.\n\n158.\n\nOn 1 December 2004 the company appealed in cassation against the judgment of 29 October 2004.\n\n159.\n\nThe appeal was rejected by the Circuit Court on 3 March 2004.\n\n*(iv) Seven percent enforcement fee in respect of penalties*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiff decided to impose a seven percent enforcement fee in respect the company's failure to abide by the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part relating to penalties. The company was to pay a seven percent enforcement fee of RUB 7,102,488,295 or approximately EUR 190,077,377.\n\n161.\n\nOn 23 December 2004 the company challenged this decision in court.\n\n162.\n\nOn 3 February 2005 the City Court dismissed the action.\n\n163.\n\nThe applicant company failed to appeal the judgment of 3 February 2005.\n\n164.\n\nThe Circuit Court upheld the judgment of 3 February 2005 on 16 June 2005.\n\n*(iv) Overall debt in respect of 2001*\n--------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2001 the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 132,539,253,849.78 (approximately EUR 3,710,836,129).\n\n*3. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2002*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Tax Assessment 2002**\n---------------------------\n\n166.\n\nOn 29 October 2004 the Ministry produced an audit report in respect of the applicant company's activities for the year 2002. The report was received by the company on 1 November 2004.\n\n167.\n\nOn 16 November 2004 the Ministry took a decision to levy further tax liabilities, this time in respect of the year 2002 (\"the 2002 Tax Assessment\"). The applicant company was to pay RUB 90,286,552,485 (approximately EUR 2,425,825,387) in taxes, RUB 31,485,110,355.58 (approximately EUR 845,944,140) in default interest and RUB 72,040,907,796 (approximately EUR 1,935,600,133) in penalties.\n\n168.\n\nThe decision established the use of the same scheme of tax evasion (in respect of profit tax, value-added tax, corporate property tax and motorway users' tax) as in the decisions concerning the years 2000 and 2001. It mentioned that the company had carried out its activities through OOO Ratmir, OOO Alta-Treid, ZAO Yukos-M, OOO Yu-Mordoviya, OOO Ratibor, OOO Petroleum treyding, OOO Evoyl, OOO Fargoyl, most of which had also been used by the company in previous years. The entities in question, acting in breach of Article 575 of the Civil Code, which prohibits grants and gifts between independently functioning commercial entities, transferred the entirety of their profits unilaterally to a fund owned and controlled by the applicant company. The decision mentioned that the transfers had been wrongly reflected in the applicant company's financial accounting, that the company had failed to explain the origin of these funds and failed to take these sums into account for tax purposes. Accordingly, the applicant company failed to pay taxes in respect of these amounts.\n\n169.\n\nThe decision mentioned several other mistakes in the company's tax declarations. In particular, the tax in respect of the company's securities transactions was wrongly calculated, there were many general mistakes in the company's financial accounting, there were some mistakes in the company's request for reimbursement of the VAT on export operations (on one occasion the company failed to submit the required sales contract; it also mentioned one contract but received the money on the basis of a different contract; on some occasions the company failed to submit documents proving customs clearance, indicated wrongly calculated sums, made multiple mistakes in VAT export documents). There were further multiple mistakes in tax deductions in respect of the internal VAT.\n\n170.\n\nThe decision also established that the company had used sham entities to lower its group taxes, that the entities and the company's subsidiaries had entered into transactions with reduced prices, that on some occasions the company had declared the extracted oil as \"hydrocarbon liquid\" in order to lower the applicable price even further, that there were no cash transactions between the entities and subsidiaries and that the company's own promissory notes and mutual offsetting had been used instead and that the whole set-up, which had no economic purpose other than tax evasion, had resulted in massive tax evasion by the applicant company. The decision also noted that use of tax concessions in the Republic of Mordoviya and the Evenk Autonomous District by the sham entities had been unlawful, because they had failed to qualify for the exemptions and also because they had been sham companies. The decision was very detailed in respect of the composition and all activities of the sham entities: the Ministry analysed the entirety of their activities month by month.\n\n171.\n\nThe applicant company had until 17 November 2004 to meet the debts voluntarily.\n\n**(b) Enforcement measures relating to the 2002 Tax Assessment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Enforcement of additional taxes and interest surcharges*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nBy decision of 18 November 2004 bailiffs proceeded to enforcement of the decision of 16 November 2004 in so far as it related to additional taxes and interest surcharges.\n\n173.\n\nIt appears that the City Court examined and, in the most part, rejected the applicant company's appeal on 23 December 2004 for similar reasons as those mentioned in relation to the tax assessment for 2000. The court declared the Ministry's conclusions partly unfounded and reduced the company's tax liability by RUB 325,628,742 (approximately EUR 8,752,543), its default interest payments by RUB 98,515,758 (approximately EUR 2,647,995) and the penalty by RUB 851,419,688 (approximately EUR 22,885,227).\n\n174.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 5 March 2005 and the Circuit Court on 30 June 2005.\n\n175.\n\nOn 28 December 2004 the applicant company also appealed against the Ministry's decision in respect of the year 2002 in so far as it had ordered that the tax debts be collected directly.\n\n176.\n\nIt appears that on 7 February 2005 the City Court examined and rejected the claim as unfounded. The judgment was upheld on appeal on 4 April 2005. The Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts on 15 June 2005.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement of penalties*\n-------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nIn so far as the 2002 Tax Assessment related to penalties, the Ministry applied to the City Court on 22 November 2004.\n\n178.\n\nOn an unspecified date the City Court granted the Ministry's action.\n\n179.\n\nOn 28 March 2005 the company appealed against the judgment.\n\n180.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings is unclear.\n\n*(iii) Seven percent enforcement fee in respect of additional taxes and interest surcharges*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiffs decided to impose a seven percent enforcement fee in respect of the company's failure to comply voluntarily with the 2002 Tax Assessment in the part relating to additional taxes and surcharge interests.\n\n182.\n\nOn 23 December 2004 the company appealed against this decision in court.\n\n183.\n\nOn 3 February 2005 the City Court judgment dismissed the appeal.\n\n184.\n\nIt does not appear that the company submitted an appeal in cassation against that judgment.\n\n*(iv) Overall debt in respect of 2002*\n--------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nOverall in respect of the year 2002 (excluding seven percent enforcement fee), the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 192,537,006,448.58 (approximately EUR 4,344,549,434).\n\n*(v) Written information report communicated by ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit to the applicant company's management in respect of the year 2002*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nIn their observations of 15 April 2005 the Government submitted a copy of a report communicated to the applicant company's management by its auditor ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit. The applicant company did not comment on the contents of the report.\n\n187.\n\nIn contrast to \"ordinary\" audit reports, which were made public, the internal information report was produced exclusively for the information of the company's management.\n\n188.\n\nThe report noted specifically that the company's \"Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya YUKOS\" was in breach of the domestic law in that the relevant legislation disallowed unilateral transfers and gifts between commercial entities. It also noted that the company's accounting policy in respect of the operations involving promissory notes had been incompatible with the legislation in force and provided a distorted view of the company's activities.\n\n*4. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2003*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Tax Assessment 2003**\n---------------------------\n\n189.\n\nBy a decision of 6 December 2004 the Ministry levied tax liabilities for the year 2003 (\"the 2003 Tax Assessment\"), consisting of RUB 86,228,187,852 (approximately EUR 2,327,114,103) in taxes, RUB 15,235,930,657.66 (approximately EUR 411,185,136) in default interest and RUB 68,939,326,976.4 (approximately EUR 1,860,524,778) in penalties.\n\n190.\n\nThe decision established that the company was guilty of having evaded taxes (in particular, value-added tax, profit tax and advertising tax) by using the same arrangement as in previous years. The decision mentioned the following entities registered either in the Republic of Mordoviya or the Evenk Autonomous District: OOO Yu-Mordoviya, ZAO Yukos-M, OOO Alta-Treyd, OOO Ratmir, OOO Energotreyd, OOO Makro-Treyd, OOO Fargoyl, and OOO Evoyl. It was alleged that the entities were sham and that they had made unilateral transfers to the applicant company, in breach of Article 575 of the Civil Code, that the company had failed to reflect the transferred amounts as its profits, to account for them and to pay taxes in this connection and that the company had used lowered prices to avoid the payment of taxes. The decision made a detailed contract-by-contract analysis of the transactions of the sham entities.\n\n191.\n\nThe decision also mentioned that some of the company's expenses were unjustifiably deducted from the company's taxable income, that the company failed to account for some of its operations with promissory notes, that there were some mistakes in calculation of the company's VAT in operations and that the company had evaded payment of advertising tax in Moscow.\n\n192.\n\nThe applicant company had one day to comply with the decision, until 7 December 2004.\n\n**(b) Enforcement measures relating to the 2003 Tax Assessment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Enforcement of additional taxes and interest surcharges*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiffs proceeded to enforcement of the decision of 6 December 2004 in so far as it related to taxes and interest surcharges.\n\n194.\n\nIt appears that on 28 April 2005 the City Court dismissed the company's challenge of the 2003 Tax Assessment in the part relating to additional taxes and surcharge interests. In respect of the company's request to reimburse the export VAT on operations conducted by the sham entities, the court noted the request was unsubstantiated and also lodged out of time. In particular, the company had failed to submit a proper claim with monthly calculations and evidence that the goods in question had indeed been exported. The court also addressed the company's argument that Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code prevented the authorities from levying the interest surcharges. It noted that the provision in question only applied to cases in which the sole reason for the taxpayer's inability to pay tax debts was the seizure of its assets and cash funds. On the facts, the applicant company was unable to pay because it had insufficient funds and not because its assets were frozen. The court concluded that the company's argument was unfounded.\n\n195.\n\nThe judgment was upheld on appeal on 16 August 2005.\n\n196.\n\nThe applicant company appealed on cassation.\n\n197.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement of penalties*\n-------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nOn 17 February 2005 the Ministry applied to the City Court to collect the fines mentioned in the 2003 Tax Assessment.\n\n199.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings is unclear.\n\n*(iii) Overall debt in respect of the year 2003*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2003 (excluding the seven percent enforcement fee) the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 170,403,445,486.06 (approximately EUR 4,598,824,017).\n\n*5. Forced auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegas*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nOn 20 July 2004 the Ministry of Justice announced the forthcoming evaluation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegas as a part of its ongoing enforcement procedures.\n\n202.\n\nOn 22 July 2004 the applicant company announced that \"the company management [was] currently making every effort to raise additional funds in order to repay, as soon as possible, the tax liability and to finance current operations. However, should those efforts prove unsuccessful and Yuganskneftegas [be] sold, in the present circumstances, the management of the Company would be compelled to announce the bankruptcy of Russia's largest oil company\".\n\n**(a) Valuation report of 17 September 2004**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the valuation commissioned by the bailiffs and the Ministry of Justice from Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment branch of Dresdner Bank AG (working in Russia as ZAO Dresdner bank), for the purposes of the enforcement proceedings, estimated that 100 percent of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas was worth between USD 15.7 and 18.3 billion, excluding the pending and probable tax liabilities of this entity.\n\n204.\n\nThe report evaluated 100 percent of the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a separate entity and, having deduced its corresponding obligations, calculated the cost of its shares, on the basis of which it would be possible to calculate the price of one share in OAO Yuganskeftegaz.\n\n205.\n\nIt was specifically mentioned in the report that the valuation was not an opinion concerning the attainable price in the event of the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz or any kind of recommendation concerning the starting bid of the auction in the event of the sale of Yuganskneftegaz by the Ministry of Justice or any other State institution, or any recommendation concerning particular actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Justice with a view to levying the judicially determined or estimated amount of the applicant company's tax debt.\n\n206.\n\nAmong the basic risks affecting the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, the report mentioned the tax claims, the validity of oil extraction licences, future oil prices, export quotas etc. The report also mentioned that the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a part of the applicant company could be substantially different from the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a separate entity. The report also mentioned various valuations of OAO Yuganskneftegaz made by third parties, including investment institutions and banks, and ranging from USD 9 to 22 billion. It also mentioned that, because of the size of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, not many buyers would be financially capable of acquiring it.\n\n207.\n\nThe valuation (between USD 15.7 and 18.3 billion) did not take account of already pending and probable tax claims against OAO Yuganskneftegaz. If and when lodged, these claims would \"substantially influence the assessment\" of the equity of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. The claims already announced (as on that date) were USD 951.3 million.\n\n208.\n\nTo carry out the valuation, the report used the following three methods: the method of discounted cash flows, a method based on the analysis of comparable transactions, and a method based on the analysis of comparable publicly-held companies.\n\n209.\n\nThe report also specifically noted that:\n\n\"the decision concerning the starting bid of the auction is a tactical one and should strike a balance between the desire to reach the highest price on the one hand, and the need to attract the maximum number of potential buyers on the other. Because of this, the starting bid is most likely to be different from the assessment of the price.\"\n\n**(b) Service of the valuation report on the applicant company on 13 October 2004**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nA copy of the valuation report was served on the applicant company on 13 October 2004.\n\n211.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company contested the valuations made in the report before the courts.\n\n212.\n\nOn 21 October 2004 the bailiffs confirmed to the Ministry that they had collected 79,584,690,127 RUB (approximately 2,183,447,331 euros).\n\n**(c) The company's reply of 4 November 2004**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nOn 4 November 2004 the applicant company responded to the valuation report. They disagreed with the decision to valuate and sell OAO Yuganskneftegaz, and would have preferred to sell its other assets first. The applicant company informed the bailiffs that it had already honoured a major part of the debt and that the remaining sum was USD 2.5 billion. According to the company, it would be more reasonable to lift the seizure and let it dispose of its minor assets in order to honour the remaining debt.\n\n214.\n\nAs regards Yuganskneftegas, the company referred to independent valuations by ZAO Dresdner Bank and JP Morgan PLC, valuing the subsidiary at \"no less than USD 14 billion\" and \"between USD 16.1 billion and USD 22.1 billion, including tax liabilities\" respectively.\n\n215.\n\nThe letter mentioned that the Ministry had brought tax claims against OAO Yuganskneftegaz totalling USD 2.903 billion.\n\n**(d) The bailiffs' decision of 18 November 2004**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nOn 18 November 2004 the bailiffs noted that the company's debt to the Ministry on that date was RUB 204,902,386,620 (approximately EUR 5,506,781,584 or USD 7,147,250,717). Having referred to sections 4, 46 (6), 54 (2) and 88 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the bailiffs decided to sell 78.79 percent of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas at an auction which would take place on 19 December 2004. The published minimum bidding price for 78.79 percent of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas was RUB 246,753,447,303.18 (approximately USD 8.65 billion).\n\n217.\n\nThe sale was conferred on the Russian Fund of Federal Property (\"the Property Fund\"), a specialised State Institution in charge of organising sales of federal property and the property of those who had debts towards the State. The Fund was to sell the shares in the quantity necessary to meet the debt.\n\n**(e) Court action against the decision of 18 November 2004**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe decision of 18 November 2004 was challenged in court on 26 November 2004.\n\n219.\n\nIt appears that on 3 December 2004 the City Court rejected the appeal against the decision of 18 November 2004.\n\n220.\n\nApparently, the applicant company appealed in cassation against the judgment on 11 January 2005.\n\n221.\n\nIt appears that on 21 January and 3 May 2005 the judgment was upheld on appeal and in cassation respectively.\n\n222.\n\nIt appears that the applicant company argued that the valuation report had failed to give a market valuation of the asset and that the decision of 18 November 2004 failed to mention a specific price for OAO Yuganskneftegaz. In response, the courts noted that 43 ordinary and 13 privileged shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been seized by the bailiffs in satisfaction of the company's liability, that the shares had been valued by ZAO Dresdner Bank and that the applicant had been informed about all of the bailiffs' actions in the course of the enforcement proceedings. They also noted that the seizure of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz had previously been declared lawful, that the valuation by ZAO Dresdner Bank was not contested by the applicant in accordance with the special procedure provided for by the legislation in force, and that the bailiffs had properly indicated the amount of the company's debt and requested the Fund to sell the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the debt.\n\n**(f) Announcement about the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nIn the meantime, on 19 November 2004, the Russian Gazette, an official newspaper of the Government, published the announcement about the sale of 78.79 percent of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz at a public auction organised by the Property Fund. The only two conditions for participating in the auction were to file an application between 19 November and 18 December 2004 and to make a deposit payment.\n\n224.\n\nIt appears that OOO Gazpromneft, ZAO Intercom and OAO First Venture Company filed applications to bid at the auction.\n\n225.\n\nThe media reported that OAO Gazprom, a parent company of OOO Gazpromneft, had begun negotiating a financing arrangement with a consortium of international banks to finance its bid at the auction.\n\n**(g) The applicant company's application for bankruptcy in the United States of America and its request for injunctive relief**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Filing of bankruptcy petition and request for injunctive relief*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nOn 14 December 2004 the applicant company filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (\"the U.S. Bankruptcy Court\").\n\n227.\n\nSimultaneously, the applicant company filed a request for injunctive relief, pursuant to Section 105 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order, among other things, to enforce the automatic stay set out in Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code by enjoining certain parties from participating in the Yuganskneftegaz Auction.\n\n*(ii) Scope of automatic stay*\n------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nUnder U.S. law, an automatic stay went into immediate effect when the company filed for bankruptcy. The automatic stay protected the company's assets by preventing the creditors from collecting claims that arose prior to the bankruptcy filing or from taking \"possession\" or \"control\" of the applicant's property covered under the filing.\n\n*(iii) Temporary restraining order of 16 December 2004*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nOn 16 December 2004, having examined the company's request, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order barring certain specific entities from taking any actions with respect to the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz, including participation in the auction.\n\n230.\n\nThe entities mentioned in the order were (a) the three companies registered to bid at the Auction, including OOO Gazpromneft, ZAO Intercom and OAO First Venture Company, (b) six western financial institutions that had announced their intention to fund OOO Gazpromneft's bid at the auction (ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein) and (c) those persons in active concert or participation with them.\n\n*(iv) The outcome of bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nOn 24 February 2005 the U.S. Bankruptcy Court dismissed the applicant company's petition for bankruptcy with reference to Section 1112 (b) of U.S. Bankruptcy Code which gave the court discretion to dismiss a case \"in the best interest of the creditors and the estate\".\n\n232.\n\nThe court noted that most of the applicant company's assets were oil and gas within Russia, so that the court's ability to carry out a reorganization without the cooperation of the Russian government was extremely limited, that the applicant company sought to substitute U.S. law in place of Russian, European Convention and/or international law, that the applicant company had commenced proceedings in other *fora*, including the European Court of Human Rights, and the court did not feel that it was uniquely qualified or more able that these other *fora* to consider the issues presented. Lastly, the court noted that the vast majority of the business and financial activities of the applicant company continued to occur in Russia and that the applicant company was one of the largest producers of petroleum products in Russia. The court held that \"the sheer size of [the applicant company] and its impact on the entirety of the Russian economy weighs heavily in favour of allowing resolution in a forum in which participation of the Russian government is assured\".\n\n**(h) Auction of 19 December 2004**\n-----------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nOn 19 December 2004 the Property Fund auctioned 78.79 percent of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz. It appears that media reporters were able to attend the auction.\n\n234.\n\nThere were two participants in the auction, OOO Baykalfinansgrup and OOO Gazpromneft. OOO Baikalfinansgrup, the only bidder in the auction, made two bids, first of USD 8.65 billion and then of USD 9.3 billion. It appears that whilst taking part in the auction OOO Gazpromneft was prevented from bidding by the injunction of 16 December 2004 (see paragraphs 229-230 above).\n\n**(i) The decisions and reports concerning the outcome of the auction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nOn 21 December 2004 the Ministry of Justice issued a report accepting that the Property Fund had properly carried out the services due under the contract of 18 November 2004.\n\n236.\n\nOn 21 December 2004 the Property Fund publicly reported the sale of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz.\n\n237.\n\nOn 31 December 2004 the bailiffs issued a resolution confirming the results of the auction. The resolution stated that OOO Baykalfinansgrup had won the auction for 43 shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz (78.79 percent of its stock) for RUB 260,753,447,303.18 (approximately EUR 6,896,341,940 or USD 9,396,960,842). By the time the decision was taken, the money had already been transferred to the bailiffs.\n\n**(j) Takeover of OOO Baykalfinansgrup by OAO Rosneft**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nAccording to press reports of 31 December 2004, OAO Rosneft, a State-owned oil company, acquired OOO Baikalfinansgrup and thus took control of OAO Yuganskneftegas.\n\n**(k) Court proceedings in connection with the auction**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIt appears that on 31 May 2005 the applicant company filed an action in the City Court to annul the auctioning of 43 shares in OAO Yuganksneftegas and the deed of sale. It also claimed damages in excess of RUB 324 billion.\n\n240.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings is unclear.\n\n*6. Bankruptcy proceedings*\n---------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIt does not appear that any enforcement measures took place in respect of the applicant company after the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz and until September 2005.\n\n242.\n\nOn 8 September 2005 a consortium of foreign banks represented by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (\"the banks\") filed an application with the City Court for recognition and enforcement of an English High Court judgment ordering the applicant company to re-pay the contractual debt of USD 482 million.\n\n243.\n\nOn 22 September 2005, at the banks' request, the bailiffs ordered to seize the applicant company's property.\n\n244.\n\nIn October 2005 the applicant company challenged this order.\n\n245.\n\nOn 30 November 2005 the City Court rejected the appeal as groundless.\n\n246.\n\nThe first-instance judgment was upheld by the Appeal Court and the Circuit Court on 27 February and 12 May 2006 respectively.\n\n247.\n\nIn the meantime, on 28 September 2005, the City Court allowed recognition and enforcement of the English High Court judgment.\n\n248.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 the Circuit Court granted the applicant company's cassation appeal and quashed the judgment of 28 September 2005. It remitted the case for a fresh hearing.\n\n249.\n\nOn 21 December 2005, having re-examined the case, the City Court allowed the banks' claims.\n\n250.\n\nOn 25 January 2006 the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 21 December 2005.\n\n251.\n\nOn 2 March 2006 the Circuit Court dismissed the appeal.\n\n252.\n\nIt appears that on 13 December 2005 the banks reached an agreement with the Rosneft company to sell to the latter the applicant company's debt to the banks.\n\n253.\n\nOn 9 March 2006 the banks lodged a petition with the City Court to declare the applicant company bankrupt.\n\n254.\n\nOn 14 March 2006 the banks notified the City Court about the decision to sell the debts owed by the applicant company to Rosneft.\n\n255.\n\nOn 28 March 2006 bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against the applicant company upon the banks' petition. It appears that the Ministry decided to join the proceedings as one of the bankruptcy creditors in respect of remaining tax debts of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments still owed by the applicant company.\n\n256.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 the City Court substituted Rosneft in the place of the banks as a bankruptcy creditor. By the same decision the court imposed a supervision order on the applicant company and appointed Mr Eduard Rebgun as the company's interim receiver. It also prohibited the company's management from disposing of its property over a value of RUB 30 million.\n\n257.\n\nOn 6 and 7 April 2006 the company appealed against the decision of 29 March 2006 on all three points.\n\n258.\n\nOn 27 April 2006 the Appeal Court dismissed the appeals.\n\n259.\n\nOn 21 June 2006 the applicant company appealed against the lower courts' decisions to the Circuit Court. The outcome of these proceedings is unclear.\n\n260.\n\nOn 21 April 2006 the Ministry submitted a claim to the City Court, seeking to be included in the list of the company's creditors for the amount of 353,766,625,235.66 RUB (approximately EUR 10,435,809,153), along with 2,118 pages of documentation. The claim was the company's reassessed tax liability for the year 2004.\n\n261.\n\nIn June 2006 the City Court made a number of rulings concerning the formation of the list of creditors. In particular, on 1 and 7 June 2006 the City Court held hearings on the claim. On 14 June 2006 the final hearing of the claim was held. The court allowed the claims in its entirety and dismissed the application for stay.\n\n262.\n\nOn 21 June 2006 the City Court delivered a full version of the judgment of 14 June 2006. It decided to include the Ministry in the list of the company's creditors for the amount claimed and refused to stay the proceedings.\n\n263.\n\nOn 3 and 6 July the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 14 June 2006 concerning the allowed claims.\n\n264.\n\nOn 4, 7 and 11 August 2006 the Appeal Court heard the company's arguments.\n\n265.\n\nOn the latter date the Appeal Court dismissed the company's appeal.\n\n266.\n\nIt appears that on 18 August 2006 the Appeal Court delivered a full version of the appeal decision.\n\n267.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 the Committee of Creditors rejected the rehabilitation plan offered by the management and recommended the company's liquidation.\n\n268.\n\nOn 31 July 2006 the applicant company appealed against this decision.\n\n269.\n\nOn 4 August 2006 the City Court examined the company's situation, declared that the company was bankrupt and dismissed its management. The court appointed Mr E. Rebgun as the applicant company's trustee. It also refused the company's request to stay the proceedings.\n\n270.\n\nBoth parties appealed on 15 August 2006\n\n271.\n\nThe judgment was upheld on appeal and entered into force on 26 September 2006.\n\n272.\n\nIt appears that on 22 August 2006 Mr E. Rebgun revoked the authority of all counsel appointed by the company's previous management.\n\n273.\n\nOn 12 November 2007 the City Court examined the applicant's company's situation, heard the report of Mr E. Rebgun and decided to terminate the liquidation proceedings. The applicant company ceased to exist.\n\n274.\n\nOn 21 November 2007 a certificate was issued to the effect that the applicant company had been liquidated on the basis of the court decision.\n\n275.\n\nIt appears that a company Glendale Group Limited and Yukos Capital S.A.R.L. contested the decision of 12 November 2007 before the Appeal Court. The appeal of Glendale Group was declared inadmissible for the failure to submit it on time, whilst the appeal of Yukos Capital S.A.R.L. has been accepted for examination. The hearing in this respect was scheduled by the Appeal Court on 19 November 2007.\n\n276.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings remains unclear.\n\n**B. Relevant domestic law and practice**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*1. Tax liability*\n------------------\n\n**(a) General provisions**\n--------------------------\n\n277.\n\nAccording to Article 57 of the Constitution of Russia, everyone is liable to pay taxes and duties established by law.\n\n278.\n\nArticle 44 of the Tax Code of 31 July 1998 No. 146-FZ (as in force at the relevant time) states that an obligation to pay a tax or a duty arises, alters or ceases in accordance with the present Code and other legislative acts on taxes and fees.\n\n279.\n\nArticles 45 and 80 of the Tax Code provide that, as a general rule, taxpayers must comply with their obligation to pay a tax on their own initiative, and define a tax declaration as the written statement of taxpayers on their revenues and expenses, sources of revenue, tax benefits and the calculated sum of the tax, as well as other data related to calculation and payment of the tax.\n\n280.\n\nUnder Article 45, in the event of non-payment or incomplete payment of the tax in due time, the tax authorities may levy the tax liability directly from the taxpayer's bank account.\n\n281.\n\nArticle 11 (2) of the Tax Code defines a branch of an organisation as a geographically separate department, with stable employment posts.\n\n**(b) Tax inspections**\n-----------------------\n\n282.\n\nUnder Articles 82 and 87 of the Tax Code, the tax authorities may carry out documentary and on-site tax inspections of taxpayers. Such inspections may cover only the three calendar years of the taxpayer's activity directly preceding the year of inspection. In exceptional cases the authorities are allowed to carry out repeated on-site tax inspections. Such cases include, among other things, on-site inspections conducted by way of supervision of activities of the tax authority that conducted the initial audit (Article 87 (3) of the Code).\n\n283.\n\nUnder Article 100 (5) of the Tax Code a taxpayer has two months to file a detailed reply to the report drawn up by the tax authorities on the outcome of the tax inspection.\n\n*2. Applicable taxes*\n---------------------\n\n**(a) General provisions**\n--------------------------\n\n284.\n\nArticle 38 of the Tax Code provides that objects of taxation may be the operations of retailing of goods, works and services, property, profit, income, value of retailed goods, works and services or other objects having cost, quantitative or physical parameters on the existence of which the tax legislation bases the obligation to pay tax.\n\n285.\n\nArticle 39 of the Code defines retailing of goods, works and services as, *inter alia*, the transfer (including exchange of services, works and goods) in return for compensation of property rights in respect of goods and results of works from one person to another, as well as the rendering of services from one person to another in exchange for compensation.\n\n286.\n\nArticle 41 of the Code defines profits as economic gains in monetary form or in kind.\n\n**(b) Value-added tax**\n-----------------------\n\n*(i) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nSection 3 of RF Law No. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On Value-Added Tax\" (as in force at the relevant time) subjects to value-added taxation, among other things, the turnover generated by the retailing of goods, works and services on the territory of Russia, the rates of which range between 10 percent and 20 percent. Under section 5 of the Law, exported goods are exempt from payment of the tax. The exemption becomes effective only if the taxpayer properly justifies the claim. Until these documents are filed, the tax remains payable under the non-export rate.\n\n288.\n\nLetter No. B3-8-05/848, 04-03-08 of the State Tax Service of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, dated 21 December 1995, stated that taxpayers had to file the following documents to justify the tax exemption: a contract concluded between the legal personality taxpayer registered in Russia with its foreign partner, proof of payment in respect of the goods, a customs declaration bearing an appropriate mark of the customs body confirming the export of goods from the customs territory of Russia.\n\n*(ii) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nIn respect of the value-added tax (\"VAT\"), the applicable tax rate is zero percent if the traded goods are placed in an \"export\" customs regime and physically removed from the customs territory of the Russian Federation (Article 164 (1) of the Tax Code). In addition, the taxpayer may claim a refund of the \"incoming\" VAT already paid in respect of the exported goods.\n\n290.\n\nFor the zero rate to become effective and in order to claim the VAT refund, it is necessary to justify the claim by filing the following documents with the tax authorities (Article 165 of the Tax Code): the export contract concluded between the taxpayer and the foreign buyer, a bank statement confirming receipt of funds from the foreign buyer by a Russian bank duly registered with the tax authorities, a relevant customs declaration bearing the stamp of the customs bodies confirming the export of the goods from the customs territory of Russia, and copies of relevant transport bills and shipping documents bearing the stamps of the customs bodies confirming the export of goods from the customs territory of Russia.\n\n291.\n\nThe relevant documents should be filed with the competent tax authority within 180 days from the date of the customs clearance of the goods in question (Article 165 (9) of the Tax Code). Until these documents are filed, the tax remains payable under the non-export rate.\n\n**(c) Motorway fund tax**\n-------------------------\n\n292.\n\nSection 5 (2) of RF Law No. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 \"On motorway funds in the Russian Federation\" provides for a one percent motorway users' tax from the turnover of the retail of goods, works and services, payable by all motorway users. Section 4 also makes subject to a 25 percent tax the amount of retailing (excluding VAT) of the companies trading fuels and lubricants.\n\n293.\n\nThis tax was abolished from 1 January 2003.\n\n**(d) Tax for the maintenance of housing fund and objects of socio-cultural sphere**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nSection 21 (\"Ch\") of RF Law No. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the foundations of the tax system\" imposes a tax of up to one-and-a-half percent for the maintenance of the housing fund and socio-economic development.\n\n295.\n\nThis tax was abolished with the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001.\n\n**(e) Corporate property tax**\n------------------------------\n\n*(i) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nSection 2 (1-2) of RF Law No. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 \"On corporate property tax\" provided for a tax of up to two percent in respect of organisations' property.\n\n*(ii) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nChapter 30 of the Tax Code provides for a tax of up to 2.2 percent in respect of organisations' property. The exact rate is defined by the regional authorities.\n\n**(f) Profit tax**\n------------------\n\n*(i) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nLaw No. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On profit tax on enterprises and organisations\" (sections 2 and 5) provided for a profit tax, the rate of which could vary depending on the type of taxable activity and the rate fixed by the local authorities. The mandatory rate to be transferred to the Federal budget was eleven percent.\n\n*(ii) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nChapter 25 of the Tax Code provides for a profit tax of up to 24 percent (6.5 percent to be transferred to the Federal budget and the rest to the regional budget).\n\n**(g) Advertising tax**\n-----------------------\n\n300.\n\nSection 21 (1) \"z\" of RF Law No. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the foundations of the tax system\" imposed a tax in respect of the cost of advertisement services.\n\n301.\n\nThis tax was abolished from 1 January 2005.\n\n*3. Tax advantages*\n-------------------\n\n**(a) General provisions**\n--------------------------\n\n302.\n\nArticle 56 of the Tax Code defines a tax benefit as a full or partial exemption from the payment of taxes, granted by the tax legislation.\n\n**(b) Requirements relating to registration of taxpayers**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nUnder Article 83 (1) of the Tax Code, taxpayers which are legal entities are required to register with the tax authorities at their headquarters (location of their executive bodies), at the location of their branches and at the location of real estate and vehicles belonging to them.\n\n304.\n\nSpecial rules of registration applied in respect of large taxpayers, including the applicant company.\n\n305.\n\nBy Decree No. \u0410\u041f-3-10/399 of the Tax Ministry, dated 15 December 1999, such taxpayers were required to register at their main location, at the location of their branches and at the location of real estate and vehicles belonging to them, in certain specific tax offices (inter-district level or as specifically indicated by the Ministry).\n\n306.\n\nAnnex 3 to the Decree contains the form \"On subsidiary and dependant companies and subsidiary enterprises\", to be filled in by the taxpayer. During registration the taxpayer is required to indicate all of its subsidiary and dependant companies.\n\n307.\n\nIn respect of domestic off-shore territories, according to commentators, this requirement means that in practice the taxpayer's executive body should always be physically located and functioning on the territory of the off-shore. If the taxpayer fails to comply with the requirement, the tax authorities could declare its registration void with the subsequent recovery of the entirety of the perceived tax benefits (see A.V. Bryzgalin, *Practical Tax Encyclopaedia,* Moscow, 2003-2006, Chapter 3 \"Methodology of tax optimisation\").\n\n**(c) Closed administrative-territorial formations (the town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the town of Trekhgornyy in the Chelyabinsk Region and the town of Lesnoy in the Sverdlovsk Region)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Legal provisions*\n----------------------\n\n308.\n\nUnder section 5 of Law No. 3297-1 of the Russian Federation \"On closed administrative-territorial formations\", tax concessions are provided to businesses if, *inter alia*, they have at least 90 percent of their fixed assets and conduct at least 70 percent of their activities on the territory of the respective formation (including a requirement that at least 70 percent of their average workforce be accounted for by persons permanently residing in the ZATO in question, and that at least 70 percent of their wage bill be paid to employees permanently residing in that territory).\n\n309.\n\nLetter No. A\u041f-6-01/505 of the Tax Ministry dated 24 June 1999 contained Methodological Directions to the tax bodies on issues of lawfulness of the use of additional tax benefits granted by local authorities in the closed administrative-territorial formations. It stated that the tax authorities ought to verify the actual presence of the taxpayer's assets on the territory in question by checking its accounting records and financial statements, and by confirming the physical location of the organisation at the indicated address and the actual functioning of the taxpayer's employees at the taxpayer's location.\n\n*(ii) Case No. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 (The Tax Ministry v. OOO Pribrezhnoe), referred to by the applicant company*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is OOO Pribrezhnoe, registered in the closed administrative territorial formation town of Snezhnogorsk, which has a privileged tax regime. The Ministry tried unsuccessfully to contest the use of tax concessions by the respondent, by demonstrating that the entity had not been actually present at the place of its registration. The domestic court found for the respondent. They established that the entity had some assets on the territory of Snezhnogorsk, a number of permanent employees (including a lawyer and the cleaning lady), a cash account in the local bank, which proved that the entity satisfied the criteria provided for in law.\n\n311.\n\nThe final decision in the case was taken by the Cassation Court on 5 June 2002.\n\n**(d) The Republic of Mordoviya**\n---------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nUnder Law No. 9-FZ of the Republic of Mordoviya of 9 March 1999 \"On the conditions of efficient use of the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya\", tax concessions are granted to taxpayers established after the entry into force of that law and whose activities meet certain conditions, including but not limited to the following:\n\n(a) they conduct export operations, the quarterly proceeds from which account for at least 15 per cent of the business' total earnings;\n\n(b) they engage in wholesale trade in fuel and lubricants and other types of hydrocarbon raw materials, the quarterly proceeds from which account for at least 70 percent of the business' total earnings.\n\n313.\n\nSection 1 of the Law states that \"this Law establishes concessions with the objective of creating favourable conditions for attracting capital into the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, strengthening the socioeconomic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya, developing the securities market and creating new jobs through special arrangements for the taxation of organisations\".\n\n**(e) The Republic of Kalmykiya**\n---------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nLaw No. 12-P-3 of the Republic of Kalmykiya of 12 March 1999 \"On tax concessions for companies investing in the Republic of Kalmykiya\" provides tax concessions to those who meet the following criteria:\n\n(a) the taxpayer is not a user of mineral resources in the territory of the Republic;\n\n(b) the taxpayer is registered with the Ministry of the Investment Policy of the Republic of Kalmykiya as an enterprise investing in the economy of the Republic;\n\n(c) the enterprise's investment in the economy of the Republic meets the criteria established by the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic in accordance with this law.\n\n**(f) The Evenk Autonomous District**\n-------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nUnder section 9 of Law No. 108of the Evenk Autonomous District \"On specific features of the tax system in the Evenk Autonomous District\" of 24 September 1998, substantially lower tax rates apply to local businesses whose activities meet certain conditions for applying the special taxation procedure set out in section 8 of that Law.\n\n*4. The use and interpretation of terms of civil legislation in tax disputes*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nUnder Article 11 of the Tax Code, institutions, notions and terms of the civil legislation of Russia used in the Tax Code keep their respective meanings, unless specifically stated.\n\n*5. General principles governing the status of legal entities*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Presumption of independence**\n-----------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nUnder Article 2 of Civil Code of 30 November 1994 No. 51-FZ (as in force at the relevant time), the legal status of parties involved in civil-law transactions, the grounds for the creation of and the order of exercising the right of ownership and other property rights are defined by the civil legislation, which also regulates the contractual and other obligations.\n\n318.\n\nThe civil legislation regulates the relations between persons engaged in business activities or in those performed with their participation, on the assumption that business activity is an independent activity, performed at one's own risk, aimed at systematically deriving a profit from the use of the property, the sale of commodities, the performance of work or the rendering of services by the persons registered in this capacity in conformity with the legally-established procedure.\n\n319.\n\nIt is formally prohibited to make any unilateral property transfers (gifts, grants or gratuitous loans) between independent commercial legal entities (Articles 575 and 690 of the Civil Code). Unilateral property transfers are permitted by Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code and not counted for the purposes of profit tax if they are made between associated entities, one of which holds more than 50 percent of shares in the equity of the other entity.\n\n**(b) Rules applicable to subsidiary and dependant companies**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nArticle 105 of the Civil Code provides that a subsidiary company is one controlled by another company, either through ownership of the subsidiary company's shares, by virtue of a contract or by any other means.\n\n321.\n\nThe controlling company is jointly responsible for debts incurred by the subsidiary company as a result of compliance with the controlling company's instructions. The controlling company may be held vicariously responsible for a debt of the subsidiary company in the event of the latter's insolvency.\n\n322.\n\nArticle 106 of the Code provides that a company is dependant when the other company owns over 20 percent of the former company's voting stock. A company which purchases over 20 percent of the voting shares in other companies is obliged to make this information public.\n\n323.\n\nSimilar rules are established in respect of limited liability companies (*\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e*) by section 6 of Law No. 14-FZ on limited liability companies of 8 February 1998.\n\n*6. Definition of a property owner*\n-----------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nArticle 209 of the Civil Code defines an owner as the person who has the rights of possession, use and disposal of his property. In respect of his property, the owner has the right, at his will, to perform any actions not contradicting the law and the other legal acts, and not violating the rights and legally protected interests of other persons.\n\n*7. Contractual freedom and its limits*\n---------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Presumption of good faith and prohibition on abuse of rights**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nArticles 9 and 10 of the Civil Code provide that the parties involved in civil-law transactions are free to act contractually within the limits defined by law.\n\n326.\n\nArticle 10 (1 and 2) of the Code states specifically that parties involved in civil-law transactions are prohibited from abusing their rights. In such cases, the courts may deny legal protection in respect of the right which is being abused. Article 10 (3) establishes a refutable presumption of good faith and reasonableness of actions on the parties in civil-law transactions.\n\n**(b) Examples of the case-law of the domestic courts concerning the notion of bad faith**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nIn its decision No. 138-O dated 25 July 2001 the Constitutional Court of Russia confirmed that there existed a refutable presumption that the taxpayer was acting in good faith and that a finding that a taxpayer had acted in bad faith could have unfavourable legal consequences for the taxpayer.\n\n328.\n\nIn its decision No. 168-O of 8 April 2004 the Constitutional Court noted that it would be inadmissible for bad faith taxpayers to use manipulation of the legal civil-law institutions to create and operate schemes for unlawful enrichment at the expense of the State budget.\n\n**(c) Rules governing sham transactions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Statutory law*\n-------------------\n\n329.\n\nAccording to Article 153 of the Civil Code, transactions are defined as activities of natural and legal persons creating, altering and terminating their civil rights and obligations.\n\n330.\n\nArticle 166 of the Civil Code states that a transaction may be declared invalid on the grounds, established by the present Code, either by force of its being recognized as such by the court (a disputable transaction, *\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*), or regardless of such recognition (an insignificant deal, *\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*).\n\n331.\n\nAccording to Article 167 of the Civil Code, insignificant transactions entail no legal consequences, apart from those relating to their invalidity, and are invalid from the moment they are effected.\n\n332.\n\nArticle 170 (2) establishes specific rules in respect of two types of insignificant transactions: 'colourable' transactions (\"*\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*\", deals effected only for form's sake, without an intention to create corresponding legal consequences) and 'sham' transactions (\"*\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*\", deals which have been effected for the purpose of screening other transactions). This provision condemns both colourable and sham transactions as insignificant.\n\n333.\n\nIt also provides that in cases of sham transactions, the rules governing the transaction which was actually intended by the parties may be applied by a court, regard being had to the substance of this transaction (the so-called \"substance over form\" rule).\n\n334.\n\nUnder Article 45 of the Tax Code the power to re-characterise transactions by the taxpayer with third parties, the legal status and the character of the taxpayer's activity in tax disputes lies with the courts (as opposed to executive bodies). Section 7 of Law No. 943-1 of 21 March 1991 \"On Tax Authorities in the Russian Federation\" vests the power to contest such transactions and recover everything received in such transactions in favour of the State's budget.\n\n*(ii) Academic sources*\n-----------------------\n\n335.\n\nComments on the Civil Code (O.N. Sadikov, *Comments on the Civil Code*, Yuridicheskaya firma Kontrakt Infra-M, Moscow, 1998) state, with reference to Bulletin No. 11 of the Supreme Court of RSFSR (page 2), that any evidence admitted by the rules on civil procedure may also serve as proof of the invalidity of sham transactions.\n\n*8. General rules on price formation and price adjustment mechanism*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nArticle 40 (1) of the Tax Code requires that the parties trade at market prices. It also establishes a refutable presumption that the prices agreed to by the parties correspond to market levels and are used for taxation purposes.\n\n*9. Price adjustment mechanism of the Tax Code*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nUnder Article 40 (2) of the Tax Code, the tax authorities are empowered to overrule the above presumption by verifying and correcting the prices for taxation purposes. A finding that the prices were lowered usually leads to the conclusion that the taxpayer understated the taxable base and thus failed properly to pay his taxes (see Article 122 of the Tax Code below).\n\n338.\n\nThis may happen only (1) when the parties are interdependent within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code; (2) in the event of barter transactions; (3) or international transactions; (4) when the prices set by a taxpayer during the same short period for certain identical types of goods, work or services fluctuate by more than 20 percent.\n\n339.\n\nArticle 20 (1) of the Tax Code defines interdependent parties as natural persons and (or) organisations whose mutual relations may influence the terms or economic results of their respective activities or the activities of the parties that they represent. In particular, (a) one organisation has a direct and (or) indirect interest in another organisation, and the aggregate share of such interest is more than 20 percent. The share accounted for by the indirect interest held by one organisation in another, through a chain of separate organisations, is defined as the product of the direct interest shares that the organisations in this chain hold in one another; (b) one natural person is subordinate to another natural person *ex officio*; (c) in the case of individuals, they are spouses, relatives, adopters or adoptees, guardians or wards under the family law of the Russian Federation.\n\n340.\n\nArticle 20 (2) of the Tax Code provides that the court may recognize persons as interdependent on other grounds, not provided for by Item 1 of this Article, if the relations between these persons may have influenced the results of transactions in the sale of goods (work, services).\n\n*10. Applicable tax offences and related penalties*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nArticle 122 (1 and 3) of the Tax Code imposes a penalty of 40 percent of the unpaid tax liability on intentional non-payment or incomplete payment of the tax due, resulting from understating the taxable base. Articles 112 (2) and 114 (4) of the Tax Code provide for a 100 percent increase in this penalty in the event of a repeated offence by the same taxpayer.\n\n342.\n\nArticle 75 of the Tax Code provides for payment of an interest surcharge by taxpayers in cases of late payment of the taxes due. The interest surcharge amounts to one three-hundredth of the statutory rate for each day of the delay. The persons and entities that were unable to meet their tax liabilities in due time because their bank account was suspended by the tax authority or a court are excused from payment of the interest surcharge for the duration of the respective suspension (Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code).\n\n*11. Statutory time-bar*\n------------------------\n\n343.\n\nIn accordance with Article 113 of the Tax Code, a person cannot be held liable for a tax offence under Article 122 of the Code if three years have expired since the first day after the end of the tax period during which the offence was committed.\n\n*12. Applicable rules on court procedure*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**(a) First-instance proceedings**\n----------------------------------\n\n*(i) Territorial jurisdiction*\n------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nUnder Article 35 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure of 24 July 2003 No. 95-FZ (as in force at the relevant time), claims should be brought to a court having jurisdiction over the defendant's seat.\n\n345.\n\nArticle 54 of the Civil Code defines a company's seat as the place of the company's registration, unless, in accordance with the law, the company's articles of association do not specify otherwise.\n\n346.\n\nDecision no. 6/8 of the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court and Supreme Commercial Court of 1 July 1996 specifies that the company's seat is the location of its entities.\n\n*(ii) Interim measures*\n-----------------------\n\n347.\n\nUnder Article 91 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure, a party may apply for proportionate security measures, including seizure of defendant's assets, pending the examination of the case by the courts.\n\n*(iii) Grace period*\n--------------------\n\n348.\n\nArticle 213 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure provides that in tax cases a court suit may be filed by the authorities when their demands have not been complied with voluntarily, or when the term for voluntary compliance has expired.\n\n*(iv) Time-limits for the preparation of the case at first instance*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nArticle 134 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure establishes a two-month time-limit for the preparation of the case for examination at first instance.\n\n*(v) Right to bring appeal proceedings against the first instance judgment*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nUnder Article s 257 and 259 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure participants in the proceedings have one month from the delivery of the first-instance judgment to bring appeal proceedings.\n\n**(b) Appeal proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n351.\n\nUnder with Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, an appeal court fully re-examines the case using the evidence contained in the case and any newly-presented additional evidence. In examining procedural motions of the parties, including requests to call and hear additional witnesses or adduce and examine additional pieces of evidence, the appeal court is not bound by previous refusals of the same motions by the first-instance court.\n\n352.\n\nUnder Articles 180 and 271 of the Code, the first-instance judgment becomes enforceable on the date of the entry into force of the appeal decision confirming it.\n\n**(c) Cassation proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n353.\n\nIn accordance with Article 286 of the Code, a cassation instance court, among other things, reviews the lower courts' decisions and checks whether the conclusions of the lower courts in respect of both law and fact correspond to the circumstances of the case.\n\n354.\n\nArticle 283 of the Code provides for a possibility of applying for a stay of enforcement of the lower courts' decisions. The applicant must show that it would be impossible to reverse the effects of an immediate enforcement of the lower courts' decisions if the cassation appeal were successful.\n\n*13. Domestic courts' case-law*\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) Court disputes involving re-characterisation of sham arrangements**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Case No. A40-31714/97-2-312 (the Tax Ministry v. OOO TF Grin Haus)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nIn 1996 the respondent legal entity was involved in a series of intertwined transactions with two third parties (rent contracts and loan agreements): as a result, the respondent rented a building in central Moscow to the third parties but was able to avoid inclusion of the rent payments in the taxable base of its operations by claiming that they were interest payment in respect of the loan agreement. The Ministry discovered the tax evasion scheme, re-characterised the transactions in question as rent and ordered the taxpayer to pay RUB 2 billion in back taxes.\n\n356.\n\nThe case was examined in three rounds of court proceedings by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. Having regard to the substance of the transactions entered into by the respondent, the terms of payment and execution of the contested contracts, and, generally, to the conduct of the respondent company and third parties, the courts decided that the contractual arrangement had been sham, re-characterised the arrangement as rent and upheld the Ministry's decision.\n\n357.\n\nIn the first round of proceedings the courts adopted their decisions on the following dates: 1 December 1997, 27 January 1998 and 30 March 1998.\n\n358.\n\nIn the second round of proceedings the decisions were adopted by the first-instance and appeal courts on 26 May 1998 and 21 July 1998. The decision of the cassation court was taken on an unspecified date.\n\n359.\n\nThe third round of proceedings involved decisions on 17 November 1998, 25 January 1999 and 2 March 1999.\n\n*(ii) Case No. KA-A40/2183-98 (the Tax Ministry v. AuRoKom GMBH)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nThe respondent legal entity entered in a loan agreement with a third person; the tax authorities considered it a sham, re-characterised it as a rent contract and reassessed the tax due in respect of the gains received. The lower courts disagreed and quashed the tax authority's decision. By a decision of 17 September 1998 the cassation court quashed the lower courts' decisions and ordered that the matter be re-examined, giving due regard to all relevant circumstances, including the substance of the transaction. The courts were to reconsider all relevant clauses in the agreement in question, the conduct of the parties and the fact of physical occupation of the allegedly rented space.\n\n*(iii) Case No. A40/36819/04-75-387 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO AKB Rossiyskiy Kapital)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is a bank which in 2001-2002 conducted business by buying and then reselling precious metals. To avoid the payment of full VAT on its sales operations in this respect, the bank entered into commission agreements with the sellers from which it bought the metals, in order to be considered not as the owner of the traded goods, but merely as the sellers' agent.\n\n362.\n\nThe domestic courts took account of the substance of the bank's transactions (terms of payment, actual circumstances of delivery and other relevant factual details) and, having established that in reality the bank had been buying and reselling the precious metals, re-characterised the bank's activity as sales. The courts referred to Article 209 of the Civil Code (containing the legal definition of owner) and concluded that the bank first bought the precious metals, thus becoming the \"owner\" within the meaning of the said provision and thereafter resold the goods. They found the bank liable for tax evasion under Article 122 of the Tax Code, ordered it to pay reassessed VAT in the amount of RUB 1,091,123,539.42, default interest of RUB 408,289.76 and penalties of RUB 436,391,918.65.\n\n363.\n\nThe first-instance judgment was taken on 3 November 2004 and upheld on appeal on 11 January 2005.\n\n**(b) Tax evasion schemes involving sham rent agreements and letter-box entities registered in the domestic offshore town of Baykonur**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Case No. A41 K1-13539/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nOAO Ufimskiy NPZ, the main production unit of one of the biggest Russian oil companies, OAO Bashneft, physically located in the town of Ufa, used the domestic tax offshore territory situated in the town of Baykonur, the territory rented by Russia from the Republic of Kazakhstan for its space-related projects. The town's tax regime was similar to that in the closed administrative-territorial formations (see above).\n\n365.\n\nOn 1 February 2001 the respondents OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M, a letter-box entity registered in Baykonur, entered into a rent agreement whereby the entirety of OAO Ufimskiy NPZ's production facilities were rented by ZAO Bort-M in exchange for nominal compensation. Since ZAO Bort-M was registered in Baykonur, the activity of OAO Ufimskiy NPZ enjoyed lower rates in respect of excise duties. The tax authorities discovered \"the scheme\" and contested it in court as sham and therefore null and void.\n\n366.\n\nOn 8 October 2002 the first-instance court had regard to the substance of the transaction and, having established that, despite the contractual arrangement, OAO Ufimskiy NPZ had continued to operate the facilities in question, that furthermore the letter-box entity was never properly registered and licensed as the operator of oil processing and oil storing facilities in accordance with the relevant law, and that the letter-box entity could not operate the facility because it had rented only one part of the production cycle (which technologically could not be split in two), that the sole aim and effect of the arrangement was tax evasion, that OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M had \"malicious intent\" to evade taxes, upheld the tax authorities' claim.\n\n367.\n\nThe first instance judgment was upheld on appeal and in cassation on 17 December 2002 and 19 March 2003 respectively.\n\n*(ii) Cases nos. A41 K1-13244/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novo-ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M), A41 K1-11474/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novo-ufimskiy NPZ and OOO Korus-Baykonur), A41 K1-137828/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and OOO Korus-Baykonur)*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThese case are essentially follow-ups to the previous case: OAO Novo-Ufimskiy NPZ is the second main production unit of OAO Bashneft and was also involved in exactly the same tax evasion scheme, using the sham offshore entities ZAO Bort-M and OOO Korus-Baykonur.\n\n369.\n\nThe domestic courts examined all three cases at three instances and granted the Ministry's claims.\n\n370.\n\nThe decisions in the first set of proceedings were taken on 9 October, 16 December 2002 and 13 March 2003.\n\n371.\n\nThe decisions in the second set of proceedings were taken on 19 September 2002, 5 December 2002 and 28 February 2003.\n\n372.\n\nThe decisions in the third set of proceedings were taken on 18 December 2002, 20 February 2003 and 26 May 2003.\n\n*(iii) Case No. A41 K1-9254/03 (the Tax Ministry v. OOO Orbitalnye sistemy and OAO MNPZ)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nThis case concerns exactly the same tax evasion scheme as in the previous cases, but involves OAO MNPZ, a major oil-processing facility located in Moscow and owned by the Government of Moscow, as the defendant.\n\n374.\n\nThe decisions in the case were taken on 29 October and 27 December 2004.\n\n**(c) Sham rent agreements and letter-box entities registered in the domestic offshore town of Ozersk (closed administrative-territorial formation)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Case No. A55-1942/04-24 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe case concerns the same tax evasion scheme as in the previous cases (involving the sham renting agreement), but the offshore territory at issue is the town of Ozersk and the taxpayer is OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ, one of the applicant company's subsidiary oil-processing units.\n\n376.\n\nThe scheme operated from January 1999 and was prosecuted in 2004. The first-instance judgment in favour of the Ministry was taken on 13 August 2004. The court applied the same 'substance over form' approach as in the previous cases and, having assessed the defendants' conduct, the character of their relations and statements by the officials of the entities, granted the Ministry's claims and also ordered OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ to pay RUB 120,688,860 in reassessed taxes.\n\n*(ii) Case No. A55-5015/2004-33 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the previous case: in the first-instance judgment the court declared the defendants' contractual arrangement to be sham and unlawful and ordered OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ to pay RUB 252,963,364 in reassessed taxes.\n\n378.\n\nThe first-instance judgment in the case, dated 19 October 2004, was upheld on appeal on 19 October 2004.\n\n*(iii) Case No. A55-1941/2004-40 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Syzranskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the previous cases, involving OAO Syzranskiy NPZ, a production unit belonging to the applicant company. The rent agreement between the letter-box entity and the applicant's production unit was declared sham and voided. OAO Syzranskiy NPZ was ordered to pay RUB 30,309,119 in reassessed taxes.\n\n380.\n\nThe first-instance judgment of 18 August 2004 was upheld on appeal on 4 November 2004.\n\n**(d) Sham arrangements and VAT refund fraud**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Case No. A57-11990/01-5 (the Tax Ministry v. FGUP Nizhnevolzhskgeologiya)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is a State-owned enterprise specialising in geological exploration and identification of oil fields. In 2000 it entered into a series of deliberately unprofitable oil trading transactions with a third party, OOO Roza-Mira Processing. Since the transactions preceded the actual export of oil abroad, the two taxpayers, acting in concert, intended to obtain an artificially increased VAT refund. Having regard to the substance of the transaction and the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the terms of actual payment and execution, the courts decided that the transactions were sham, declared them null and void and refused the respondent's request for a VAT refund. In addition, the courts recovered the unpaid VAT with penalties.\n\n382.\n\nThe domestic courts took their respective decisions on 22 November 2001, 29 April and 8 July 2002.\n\n*(ii) Case No. 7543/02-16 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Saratovneftegaz)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n383.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is the main production unit of OAO NK Russneft, one of the biggest Russian private oil companies, which was involved in a dispute with the Ministry over VAT refunds in respect of its export operations. The courts established that in 2001 the respondent entered into a series of transactions with a number of third parties, aimed at deceiving the Ministry and claiming an artificially increased VAT refund. The courts took account of the overall economic effect of the transactions taken in their entirety, numerous discrepancies and contradictions between the contractual arrangements, the actual movement of oil, the documents certifying the customs clearance of the goods in question, etc., and refused to recognise them as valid for the purposes of reimbursement of VAT. The courts concluded that the Ministry had been acting lawfully by refusing the respondent company's request for an export VAT refund.\n\n384.\n\nThe domestic courts took their respective decisions on 30 June 2003, 31 May and 16 September 2004.\n\n*(iii) Case No. A28-7017/02-301/21 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Kirovskiy Shinnyy Zavod)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThis is essential a follow-up to previous cases. The courts reached similar conclusions in respect of the respondent company and recovered RUB 5,000,000 in overpaid VAT in favour of the Ministry.\n\n386.\n\nThe decisions in the case during the first round of proceedings were taken on 19 December 2002, 19 March 2003 and 27 June 2003.\n\n387.\n\nThe second round of proceedings resulted in the first-instance judgment of 19 December 2002, the appeal decision of 19 March 2003 and the supervisory review decision of 23 December 2003.\n\n**(e) Case-law of the domestic courts concerning the invalidity of sham transactions**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nIn a decision of 9 December 1997 in case No. 5246/97, the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia invalidated a loan secured by a promissory note and a related pay-off agreement as colourable and sham respectively. The court had regard to the terms of contracts concluded between the parties and the manner of their execution, in particular the fact that the loan had never been used by the borrower; it concluded that the transactions in question covered the sale of a promissory note and invalidated them as sham.\n\n389.\n\nIn a decision of 6 October 1998 in case No. 6202/97 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia invalidated two contracts for the sale of securities and a related loan agreement as sham, having regard to the terms of contracts in question, the manner of their execution and the contractual prices. The court established that the sales contracts in fact covered the loan agreement secured by the pledge of securities and remitted the case for re-trial.\n\n*14. Enforcement proceedings in respect of a presumably solvent debtor*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) General principles**\n--------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe Enforcement Proceedings Act (Law No. 119-FZ) of 21 July 1997 (as in force at the relevant time) establishes the procedure by which a creditor may enforce a court award against a presumably solvent legal entity debtor.\n\n391.\n\nRussian legislation provides for a set of special procedures in respect of presumably insolvent legal entity debtors (see section 15 below).\n\n**(b) Term for voluntary compliance with the execution writ**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nUnder section 9 (3) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, on an application by the creditor, the bailiff institutes enforcement proceedings, fixes the time-limit for enforcement of the execution writ, which may not exceed five days from the date of institution of enforcement proceedings, and notifies the debtor accordingly.\n\n**(c) Various ways to stay or delay enforcement proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Enforcement Proceedings Act provides for a possibility either: (a) to postpone enforcement actions for a term of up to 15 days (section 19); (b) to suspend the enforcement proceedings (section 21); or (c) to defer the execution of enforcement of a debt or arrange for payment in instalments (section 18).\n\n394.\n\nWith regard to (a), the bailiff takes the decision in the \"appropriate circumstances\" either on an application by the debtor or of its own motion.\n\n395.\n\nWith regard to (b), the decision may only be taken in seven enumerated cases: if the bailiff applied to the court with a request to interpret the judicial act; on a request from a debtor who has been drafted to serve in the army; if the debtor is on a long-term mission; if the debtor is hospitalised and being treated; if the actions of the bailiff are being contested in court; if the debtor himself or his property is being searched for; if the debtor or creditor are on holiday cannot be contacted.\n\n396.\n\nAs regards (c), the debtor, creditor or bailiff has the right to request the court to defer the execution of enforcement of a debt or arrange for payment in instalments if there are \"circumstances impeding the enforcement actions\".\n\n**(d) Seizure of the debtor's assets**\n--------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nIf the debtor does not comply within the specified time limit, under section 9 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act the bailiff, on an application by the creditor, has the right to make an inventory of the debtor's property and to put it under arrest.\n\n398.\n\nSection 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act provides that, if a debtor lacks sufficient cash funds to satisfy the creditor's claims, the debt may be levied from the other types of the debtor's property, unless the federal law states otherwise. The debtor has the right to indicate his preferred order of priority, but the final order is determined by the bailiff.\n\n399.\n\nSection 51 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act establishes a one-month time-limit for the seizure of the debtor's property from the date of service of the ruling on the institution of enforcement procedure. The seizure is intended, *inter alia*, to secure the safety of the debtor's property and the creditor's claims, which shall be subject to a subsequent transfer to the creditor or to a subsequent sale. The seizure of securities is carried out in conformity with the procedure defined by the Government of the Russian Federation in Decree No. 934 \"On the seizure of securities\", dated 12 August 1998.\n\n400.\n\nSection 59 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act establishes the order of priority in the seizure and forced sale of a debtor's property in three stages. Firstly, the bailiff sells the property which is not immediately involved in the debtor's production cycle (securities, cash on the debtor's deposit and other accounts, currency valuables, cars, office design objects, etc.); secondly, finished products (goods) and other material values not immediately involved in production and not intended to play an immediate part in it; and, thirdly, real-estate objects, as well as raw and other materials, machine-tools and equipment and other fixed assets, intended for immediate involvement in production.\n\n401.\n\nIn Ruling No. 4 \"On certain questions arising out of seizure and enforcement actions in respect of corporate shares\", dated 3 March 1999, the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court decided that in respect of companies which had been privatised by the State as parts of bigger holding groups through the transfer of controlling blocks of shares, the production cycle of the respective production unit should be preserved as much as possible.\n\n**(e) Enforcement fee**\n-----------------------\n\n402.\n\nSection 81 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act penalises the debtor's failure voluntarily to comply with the writ of execution with a seven percent enforcement fee.\n\n403.\n\nIn ruling No. 13-P of 30 July 2001 the Constitutional Court of Russia described the enforcement fee as an administrative penal sanction having a fixed monetary expression, exacted by compulsion, formalised by the decision of an authorised official and levied in favour of the State. The Constitutional court struck the above provision down as unconstitutional, in so far as it did not allow the debtor to excuse his failure to comply with the writ by reference to certain extraordinary, objectively inevitable circumstances and to other unforeseeable and insurmountable obstacles beyond the debtor's control.\n\n**(f) Forced sale of arrested assets**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Rules concerning valuation of arrested property*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nSection 53 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act requires the bailiff to evaluate the arrested property on the basis of market prices on the date of execution of the enforcement writ. Should valuation be problematic for technical or any other reasons, the bailiff should appoint a specialist to carry out the valuation.\n\n405.\n\nAccording to a Decree of the Ministry of Justice dated 27 October 1998, the bailiff is obliged to appoint a specialist to conduct the valuation if the seized property is shares or other securities (*\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438*). Under the same Decree the bailiff should inform the debtor and creditor of the resulting valuation.\n\n*(ii) General rules concerning sales of arrested property*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nSection 54 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act requires the bailiff to sell the arrested property in satisfaction of the debt within two months of the date of seizure. The sale is carried out by a specialised institution on the basis of a commission contract with the bailiff.\n\n407.\n\nAccording to Government Decree No. 418 \"On the Russian Fund of Federal Property\" of 29 November 2001, the Fund is entrusted with the task, *inter alia*, of auctioning property seized in satisfaction of the debts owed to Russia.\n\n**(g) Distribution of levied sums and order of priority in the event of multiple claimants**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nSection 77 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act provides that, in respect of the sums levied from the debtor, including the proceeds from the forced sale of the debtor's property, the bailiffs first recover enforcement fees and all related payments and the remainder is used in satisfaction of the creditors' claims.\n\n409.\n\nIf the proceeds from the forced sale(s) are insufficient to satisfy all creditors, the following order of priority applies (section 78 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act): tort claims, employment and labour-related claims, claims made on behalf of the Pension Fund and the Social Security Fund of Russia, claims made on behalf of the budgets of various territorial levels and finally all other claims.\n\n**(h) Court appeals against bailiffs' decisions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nUnder section 90 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, all actions by the bailiff in the course of enforcement proceedings can be appealed against within ten days from the date of proper notification of the action in question.\n\n411.\n\nAny damage inflicted on the debtor as a result of the bailiff's omission is compensated for in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n\n*15. Enforcement proceedings in respect of an insolvent debtor legal entity*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe enforcement of court awards and more generally debt claims against insolvent or presumably insolvent debtor legal entities is regulated by Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act of 26 October 2002 (Law No. 127-FZ).\n\n**(a) Definition of the state of insolvency (bankruptcy)**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nSection 3 of the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act defines the state of bankruptcy of a legal entity as follows:\n\n\"A legal entity is regarded as being unable to satisfy the claims of creditors in respect of pecuniary obligations and (or) to fulfil its obligations in respect of mandatory payments if the respective obligations and (or) obligation are not complied with within three months of the date on which compliance should have occurred.\"\n\n414.\n\nIn accordance with section 4 of the Act, the obligations are, as a general rule, defined/recognised by the court on the date of examination of the bankruptcy petition.\n\n415.\n\nBankruptcy proceedings in respect of a legal entity may only be instituted by a court if the overall amount of debt claims exceeds RUB 100,000 (section 6 of the Act).\n\n**(b) Bringing of a bankruptcy petition**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nUnder section 7 of the Act the debtor, the debtor's creditors in respect of pecuniary claims and State bodies competent to take part in bankruptcy proceedings in which the State is a creditor in respect of mandatory payments have the right to bring a bankruptcy petition.\n\n417.\n\nWhilst the executive body of the debtor has the right to file for bankruptcy in circumstances where it is obvious that the debtor would be unable to fulfil its obligation in due time (section 8 of the Act), it has a legal duty to do so if the forced taking of the debtor's property in satisfaction of a claim would make the debtor's economic activity considerably difficult or impossible (section 9 of the Act). In this latter respect, the petition should be brought within one month from the date on which the respective relevant circumstances occurred.\n\n418.\n\nFailure to abide by the above rules exposes the offender to civil liability action by virtue of section 10 of the Act and may also make the offender vicariously liable for any resulting damage.\n\n**(c) Examination of a bankruptcy petition**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nThe admissibility of the bankruptcy petition is examined by a single-judge bench (section 48 of the Act). Having declared the petition well-founded (admissible), the judge should impose a supervision order in respect of the debtor (see below).\n\n420.\n\nThe merits of the bankruptcy petition should be examined by a court within seven months of the date of its filing (section 51 of the Act).\n\n421.\n\nHaving examined the merits of the bankruptcy petition, the court takes one of the followings decisions (section 52 of the Act): (a) it declares the debtor bankrupt and applies the liquidation procedure in respect of the debtor; (b) it rejects the request to declare the debtor bankrupt; (c) it introduces a \"financial improvement order\" in respect of the debtor; (d) it applies the procedure of external management; (e) it discontinues the bankruptcy proceedings; (f) it disallows the bankruptcy petition; (g) it approves the friendly settlement of the case.\n\n**(d) Various solutions available to a court in resolving a bankruptcy case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe following five procedures may be applicable in respect of the debtor in a bankruptcy case (section 27 of the Act): (a) order of supervision; (b) financial improvement order; (c) external management; (d) liquidation; (e) friendly settlement.\n\n423.\n\nA supervision order is defined as the first procedure applied to the debtor (see above). It consists of securing the debtor's property, analysing its financial condition, composing the list of creditors and carrying out the first assembly of creditors (section 2 of the Act). The decision to impose a supervision order is taken by a judge in accordance with section 9 of the Act. It can be appealed against to a higher court. In the decision, the judge should also appoint an interim receiver.\n\n424.\n\nA financial improvement order is a bankruptcy procedure aiming at re-establishing the debtor's solvency and consisting in repayment of the debts in accordance with a debt repayment schedule (section 2 of the Act).\n\n425.\n\nExternal management is a bankruptcy procedure aiming at reestablishing the debtor's solvency (section 2 of the Act).\n\n426.\n\nLiquidation is a bankruptcy procedure applied in respect of a debtor who has been declared bankrupt. It is essentially the sale of the debtor's property by a court-appointed trustee in proportionate satisfaction of the creditors' claims (section 2 of the Act).\n\n427.\n\nFriendly settlement is a bankruptcy procedure applicable at any stage of bankruptcy proceedings, whereby the creditors and the debtor reach an agreement in respect of the debtor's liability (section 2 of the Act).\n\n**(e) Order of supervision and its consequences**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nThe automatic consequences of the decision to adopt a supervision order in respect of the debtor legal entity (section 63 of the Act) are, in particular, the following: all debts due after the date of the decision are recoverable only pursuant to a special procedure; enforcement of execution writs already issued, including any pecuniary claims (with the exception of those relating to payment of salaries and tort claims) against the debtor, is halted, the seizure in respect of the debtor's property is lifted.\n\n429.\n\nThe law also introduces some restrictions in respect of operations with the debtor's shares and the actions of the debtor itself (section 64 of the Act). However, the debtor's management team remains in place, subject to limitations restricting their ability to dispose of the debtor's property above a certain value (more than five percent of the book costs of the debtor's property) or to indebt the debtor further by contracting loans, issuing guaranties or sureties, transferring debts to third parties or transferring the debtor's property for external management by a third party.\n\n430.\n\nAn interim receiver is appointed by a court in accordance with sections 45 and 65 of the Act. At this stage of proceedings, he or she has no management functions and is essentially responsible for securing the debtor's property, watching over the activities of the debtor's management, analysing the debtor's financial condition and identifying the debtor's creditors. The interim receiver is accountable to a court and is in charge of organising the first meeting of creditors.\n\n431.\n\nFor a period of thirty days from the date of publication of the supervision order notice, the creditors have the right to file their claims against the debtor (section 71 of the Act). The claims may be included in the list of creditors on the basis of the court's decision.\n\n432.\n\nAt least ten days prior to the date of termination of the supervision order, the interim receiver must organise the first meeting of creditors (section 72 of the Act). At the meeting, the creditors are competent, among other things, to decide either: (a) to introduce a financial supervision order and lodge the relevant request with the court; (b) to introduce an external management order and lodge the respective request with the court; or (c) to request the court to declare the debtor bankrupt and impose a liquidation order (section 73 of the Act).\n\nCOMPLAINTS\n----------\n\n433.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the Convention the applicant company complained that its tax liability case for the year 2000 had not been tried by a tribunal established by law because it should have been tried in Nefteyugansk.\n\n434.\n\nThe applicant company also complained with reference to this Convention provision that the Ministry had not replied to the applicant company's request to clarify the 2000 audit report.\n\n435.\n\nThe applicant company further complained that the proceedings before the domestic courts had been tainted with a number of procedural defects which made them unfair and as a whole unlawful, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. The applicant company complained in respect of the 2000 Tax Assessment, in particular, that in the proceedings before the City Court the action had been brought by the Ministry within the grace period and that there had been no equality between the parties and no adversarial process; the applicant company's lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings before the court; the applicant company had not had enough time to prepare for the trial; the court had refused the applicant company's requests to adjourn the proceedings; the court had abruptly interrupted the pleadings of the applicant company's lawyer; the court gave its judgment without having studied all evidence. It also complained that in the proceedings before the Appeal Court the statutory appeal period was unlawfully abridged; the appeal court refused to adjourn the proceedings; the appeal court delayed the delivery of the reasons for its judgment and thereby prevented the applicant company from lodging a cassation appeal.\n\n436.\n\nAs regards the 2001-2003 Tax Assessments, the applicant company also complained, relying on Article 6 of the Convention, that the tax assessment had not been imposed by a court and that such extrajudicial enforcement of the tax assessment was incompatible with the right of access to court and the right to fair proceedings.\n\n437.\n\nThe applicant company next complained under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention that that the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 had been arbitrary, unlawful and disproportionate.\n\nIn particular, the company argued that the decisions had been disproportionate in so far as they had been likely to ruin the company, and had been arbitrary, discriminatory and given in bad faith. It further submitted the whole \"enforcement\" of the supposed tax liability had been deliberately set up with a view to preventing the applicant company from repaying its debts. According to the applicant, the enforcement proceedings, especially the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, the applicant company's most valued asset, was unlawful, arbitrary and disproportionate. It also argued that the attachment of its assets had been arbitrary and that it had prevented the applicant company from repaying the debt. Lastly, the company also argued that the prosecution for the year 2000 had been time-barred.\n\n438.\n\nRelying on Article 7 of the Convention, the applicant company complained that the Tax Assessments had not been based on any reasonable and foreseeable interpretation of the domestic law. The applicant was allegedly the first entity to have ever been punished for the hitherto generally tolerated tax optimisation scheme. The applicant also submitted that the imposition of double penalties for the years 2001-2003 had amounted to a retrospective penalty, since it had been unforeseeable at the date when the liability had been incurred.\n\nTHE LAW\n-------\n\n**A. The Government's request to discontinue the examination of the case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nOn 26 December 2007 the Government informed the Court that by decision of the City Court of 12 November 2007 the applicant company had been liquidated (see paragraphs 273 and 274 above). The Government submitted that accordingly the Court had lost jurisdiction *ratione personae* in respect of the application and relying on Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention requested to discontinue the examination of the case. In addition, they contested the authority of Mr J. P. Gardner to act continuously on behalf of the applicant company.\n\n440.\n\nThe Court notes that it is undisputed between the parties that the applicant company was not under compulsory administration in April 2004 and that the case was properly introduced with the Court by the company's counsel Mr Gardner (see, by contrast, *Capital bank AD v. Bulgaria* (dec.), no. 49429/99, 9 September 2004, and *Credit and Industrial Bank v. the Czech Republic*, no. 29010/95, \u00a7\u00a7 43-52, ECHR 2003-XI (extracts)).\n\n441.\n\nWhile under Article 34 of the Convention the existence of a \"victim of a violation\" is indispensable for putting the protection mechanism of the Convention into motion, this criterion cannot be applied in a rigid, mechanical and inflexible way throughout the whole proceedings. As a rule, and in particular in cases which, as the one at hand, primarily involve pecuniary, and, for this reason, transferable claims, the existence of other persons to whom that claim is transferred is an important criterion, but cannot be the only one. Human rights cases before the Court generally also have a moral dimension, which it must take into account when considering whether to continue with the examination of an application after the applicant has ceased to exist. All the more so if the issues raised by the case transcend the person and the interests of the applicant (see *Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria*, no. 49429/99, \u00a7\u00a7 74-80, ECHR 2005-XII (extracts), and, *mutatis mutandis*, *Karner v. Austria*, no. 40016/98, \u00a7 25, ECHR 2003-IX, with further references).\n\n442.\n\nThe Court has repeatedly stated that its judgments in fact serve not only to decide those cases brought before it but, more generally, to elucidate, safeguard and develop the rules instituted by the Convention, thereby contributing to the observance by the States of the engagements undertaken by them as Contracting Parties. Although the primary purpose of the Convention system is to provide individual relief, its mission is also to determine issues on public-policy grounds in the common interest, thereby raising the general standards of protection of human rights and extending human rights jurisprudence throughout the community of Convention States (see *Karner*, \u00a7 26).\n\n443.\n\nThe Court notes that the various alleged breaches of Articles 6, 7, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the present case concern the tax assessment and enforcement proceedings in respect of the applicant company which eventually resulted in its bankruptcy and ceasing to exist as a legal person. Striking the application out of the list under such circumstances would undermine the very essence of the right of individual applications by legal persons, as it would encourage governments to deprive such entities of the possibility to pursue an application lodged at a time when they enjoyed legal personality (see *Capital Bank AD*, cited above, \u00a7 80).\n\n444.\n\nThis issue in itself transcends the interests of the applicant company and therefore the Court rejects the Government's request. The Court also accepts Mr Gardner as the valid representative of the applicant company.\n\n**B. Alleged hindrance with the applicant company's right of individual petition**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nIn their submissions on admissibility of the case the applicant company complained under Article 34 of the Convention that the tax debt artificially created by the State had been likely to ruin the applicant company financially and to make it impossible for it to apply for protection to Strasbourg.\n\n446.\n\nThe Court recalls that it is of the utmost importance for the effective operation of the system of individual petition instituted by Article 34 that applicants or potential applicants should be able to communicate freely with the Court without being subjected to any form of pressure from the authorities to withdraw or modify their complaints (see *Akdivar and Others v. Turkey*, 16 September 1996, \u00a7 105, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1996-IV). The applicant company alleged that the tax debt claimed by the State had been so large that the applicant company may have gone bankrupt, and, therefore, would no longer be able to apply to the Court. This allegation, however, is nothing but a restatement of their complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and raises no substantive issues under Article 34 of the Convention.\n\n447.\n\nThe Court accordingly dismisses this part of the application pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 4 of the Convention.\n\n**C. Admissibility of the complaints under Article 6 of the Convention**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Government contended in respect of the applicant company's complaints about the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings that the dispute concerned the company's tax liability and that Article 6 of the Convention was therefore inapplicable.\n\n449.\n\nThe applicant company maintained that the Tax Assessment proceedings in its case had been criminal within the meaning of Article 6, given that they had involved its liability for tax offences and resulted in additional taxes, penalty interest and fines exceeding an overall sum of RUB 450 billion (approximately EUR 13 billion), surcharged fines of a further RUB 23.04 billion (approximately EUR 6 billion) and further enforcement penalties for non-performance of the obligation to pay the above liabilities, and had also concerned the right to control, charge or dispose of any of its assets and the forced sale of its principal production subsidiary. The proceedings were also civil as the tax assessments involved the re-allocation of ownership of the oil and oil products traded by the trading companies to the applicant company, whilst the injunction of 15 April 2004 froze the entirety of its assets and the authorities sold its stake in OAO Yuganskneftegas at auction thus also determining its civil rights and obligations.\n\n450.\n\nThe Court notes that the issue, as raised by the Government, is whether Article 6 of the Convention applied to the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings. The Court observes that as a result of these proceedings the applicant company was required to pay additional taxes of RUB 47,966,133,380 (approximately EUR 1,357,725,489), a default interest surcharge of RUB 32,167,990,383 (approximately\n\nEUR 910,544,532) and a 40 percent fine of RUB 19,186,430,950 (approximately EUR 543,089,561). Since the proceedings concerned, among other things, the imposition of a fine, the Court has to determine whether Article 6 of the Convention applied in these proceedings in its criminal limb.\n\n451.\n\nThe Court recalls that according to its well-established case-law (see, as the most recent authority confirming the approach, *Jussila v. Finland* [GC], no. 73053/01, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, ECHR 2006-...) three criteria are to be considered in the assessment of the applicability of the criminal aspect of Article 6 of the Convention: classification of the \"offence\" as \"criminal\" according to the domestic legal system, the very nature of the offence and the degree of severity of the penalty that the person concerned risks incurring.\n\n452.\n\nTurning to the first criterion, it is apparent that the tax penalties in this case were not classified as criminal but as part of the fiscal regime. This is however not decisive. As regards the second and third criteria, the Court recalls that they are alternative and not necessarily cumulative. It is enough that the offence in question is by its nature to be regarded as criminal or that the offence renders the person liable to a penalty which by its nature and degree of severity belongs in the general criminal sphere.\n\n453.\n\nOn the facts, the company was found guilty of tax evasion and ordered to pay the default interest surcharges and a 40 percent fine. The latter fine, representing a very substantial sum of over half a billion euros, was imposed in proportion to the amount of the tax avoided, had no upper limit and was clearly intended as a punishment to deter re-offending (compare with 20 to 40 percent surcharge rates in the case of *Janosevic v. Sweden*, no. 34619/97, \u00a7 69, ECHR 2002-VII and a 20 percent surcharge rate in the mentioned *Jussila* case). The Court considers that this establishes the criminal nature of the offence for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. Hence, Article 6 applies under its criminal head to the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings.\n\n454.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the Convention the applicant company complained that the case concerning its 2000 Tax Assessment had not been tried by a tribunal established by law as it should have been examined by a court in Nefteyugansk rather than in Moscow.\n\n455.\n\nThe Court recalls that a domestic court complies with the \"established by law\" criterion of Article 6 \u00a7 1 unless it acts in flagrant disregard of the applicable domestic laws governing its jurisdiction and procedures (see *Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium*, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 98-99, ECHR 2000-VII; *Lavents v. Latvia*, no. 58442/00, \u00a7 114, 28 November 2002; and *Buscarini v. San Marino* (dec.), no. 31657/96, 4 May 2000).\n\n456.\n\nThe domestic courts in the case at issue carefully examined the argument about the lack of jurisdiction and rejected it as unfounded (see paragraphs 24, 27 and 28). Indeed, having examined the applicable domestic law (see paragraphs 344 and 346), the Court finds nothing unreasonable about the application of the real seat doctrine in the present case.\n\n457.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds this complaint manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. It must therefore be rejected pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n\n458.\n\nWith reference to Article 6 of the Convention the company was also dissatisfied with the Ministry's failure to reply to the company's request to clarify the audit report in the tax proceedings for the year 2000.\n\n459.\n\nThe Court notes that there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the alleged lack of answer by the Ministry in any way affected the fairness of the subsequent proceedings as such. Furthermore, whilst under the applicable law the Ministry did not have an obligation to answer the company's argument, the Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004 contained detailed answers to all of the company's objections (see paragraph 17).\n\n460.\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds this part of the application manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and rejects it pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n\n461.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the Convention the applicant company complained that it had not received a fair trial. In particular, in respect of the first-instance proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment the applicant company complained that the Ministry had brought the action in these proceedings within the grace period, that the time to prepare for trial had been too short, that the courts had erred in refusing the company's requests to adjourn the proceedings and that there had been no adversarial proceedings on that account, that its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings before the first-instance court, as the court had abruptly interrupted their pleadings. According to the applicant company, the first-instance court pronounced judgment without having studied all the evidence. With reference to the appeal proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case, the company complained that the statutory time-limit for appeal had been unjustifiably abridged and that the appeal court had refused its request for adjournment of the proceedings. Lastly, the applicant company complained that the appeal court had delayed the delivery of the reasons for its judgment in the 2000 Tax Assessment case and thereby had prevented the applicant company from lodging a cassation appeal.\n\n462.\n\nIn its relevant parts, Article 6 provides:\n\n\"1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n\n...\n\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\"\n\n463.\n\nThe Government submitted that the applicant company had brought appeal proceedings against the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004. The possibility of review on both points of fact and law was expressly provided for by Russian law (Article 257 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure) and the company had used it. It thus could not be said that the court procedures fell short of the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention.\n\n464.\n\nAs regards the argument that the company had insufficient time for the preparation of its defence, the Government referred to the domestic legislation, which established a two-month time-limit for the examination of the case at first instance (Article 134 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure). The applicant company had had at least 37 days to prepare its defence from the date of the filing of the suit, which, in view of the above time-limit, had not been unreasonable. Furthermore, the applicant company first became aware of the Ministry's arguments on 29 December 2003, when the Ministry issued the report indicating the applicant company's large tax liability, and already on 12 January 2004 the company filed its objections to the report under Section 100 (5) of the Tax Code. Moreover, the principal arguments contained in these objections remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. It could not therefore be said that the applicant company was unprepared to state its case, as it was well aware of the Ministry's arguments five months prior to the beginning of the court proceedings. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant company's lawyers were given an opportunity to study the evidence both in court and at the Ministry's premises throughout May, June and July 2004. According to the documents submitted by the Government, counsel for the applicant availed themselves of this opportunity on at least two occasions, on 18 and 19 May 2004 respectively. The Government argued that the applicant company's arguments about insufficient time for the preparation of the case had been carefully examined and eventually rejected by the domestic courts as unfounded.\n\n465.\n\nIn the Government's view, the appeal hearings were in compliance with Article 6. Under Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, which requires an appeal court to examine the appeals by the parties within a month from the date on which they were filed, the Appeal Court had to examine the case within a month of 1 June 2004, which was the date on which one party to the case, OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, first lodged an appeal brief, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant company lodged its appeal on 17 June 2004. The appeal hearings started on 18 June and lasted eight days until 29 June 2004, which was in line with the above rule. In addition, the applicant company deliberately delayed the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address.\n\n466.\n\nLastly, the Government underlined that the appeal decision had not been final and had been appealed against by the applicant company both in cassation instance and by way of supervisory review. The Government submitted that the fact that the reasoned copy of the Appeal Court decision of 29 June 2004 had been produced on 9 July 2004 did not affect the fairness of the proceedings as, in any event, it was open to the applicant company to lodge its cassation appeal within the two-month time-limit from the date of the delivery of the appeal decision on 29 June 2004, even in the absence of the reasoned copy of the decision. Indeed, the applicant company lodged its cassation appeal on 6 July 2004 in the absence of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision. The cassation appeal was accepted for consideration and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and rejected by the Circuit Court.\n\n467.\n\nThe applicant company submitted that the supporting material underlying the Tax Assessment for 2000 had first been provided to it as a result of the City Court's decision of 14 May 2004. Allegedly, the disclosure did not occur until 17 May 2004, when the Ministry had filed 24,000 pages of documents and had continued on 18 May 2004 with approximately 45,000 further pages and a further 2,000 pages late on 20 May 2004, the eve of the first-instance hearing. The company conceded that its representatives had indeed been given access to all these materials, both prior to the hearings and during the trial, but submitted that the manner and time for such access had been so unsatisfactory that it was of no practical use. It also argued that it had been unable effectively to access the court's filed documents during the first-instance hearings except for during lunch breaks. Overall, the company insisted that it had had insufficient time to prepare its defence and familiarise itself with the evidence before the court, as it had not had an opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on all evidence adduced or observations filed, or to express its views on every document in the file, contrary to Article 6.\n\n468.\n\nThe applicant company further submitted that the domestic courts had failed to address the question whether the abridgement of time had affected its substantive right to a fair hearing and that, equally, they did not rely on Article 267 referred to by the respondent Government. Also, the rule in Article 267 requiring an appeal to be determined within one month is not respected in practice by the Russian courts; failure to comply with this requirement, even for a whole year, has no consequences for the proceedings. There was, according to the applicant company, no evidence of any particular urgency in listing or resolving the appeal: neither the Ministry, nor the coappellant, OOO \"YUKOS\" Moscow, sought expedition when their appeals were lodged and the latter did not oppose the company's applications to adjourn the appeal hearing.\n\n469.\n\nIn response to the Government's criticism suggesting that the company's appeal was misaddressed, the applicant company stated that no evidence had been provided for any mistake in this respect and that, after all, the appeal had been received by the court and the tax authorities. In any event, the court made no criticism of the company in relation to the exercise of this appeal. Overall, the abridgement of the appeal period was a serious interference with the company's right to prepare for the appeal hearings, which failed to cure but rather accentuated the unfairness of the first-instance proceedings and no substantive reason was offered at all as to why this acceleration was lawful, necessary or consistent with the requirements of a fair trial.\n\n470.\n\nThe applicant company further submitted that the effect of delaying the reasons for the appeal decision was that the decision had been immediately enforced against the company, rendering any appeal nugatory. Only an application for a stay of enforcement pending an appeal in cassation, coupled with a valid appeal in cassation, could operate properly against the enforcement. In the company's view, any such valid appeal was strictly dependent on filing of the reasons by the appeal court. However, the appeal decision became subject to immediate forcible execution, the company became liable for the additional surcharge fine of seven percent of the total liability and the opportunity for exercising an effective appeal against these measures was circumvented. Having regard to all this, the applicant company maintained that the 2000 tax proceedings did not comply with the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention.\n\n471.\n\nIn the light of the parties' submissions, the Court finds that this part of the application raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n\n472.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the Convention the applicant company complained that the 2001-2003 Tax Assessments had been imposed by the Ministry, rather than a court.\n\n473.\n\nThe Court observes that the applicant company had the right to appeal against the 2001-2003 Tax Assessments, which it eventually did (see paragraphs 146-149, 172-180, 193-199). In the absence of any credible allegations of the lack of access to court, the Court finds the complaint manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and rejects it pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 4.\n\n**D. Admissibility of the complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nUnder Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention, the applicant company complained about the allegedly unlawful, arbitrary and disproportionate imposition and enforcement of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments. The company complained furthermore that the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been unlawful, arbitrary and disproportionate too.\n\n475.\n\nThe Convention provisions relied on by the applicant company state as follows:\n\n**Article 1 of the Convention**\n\n\"The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.\"\n\n**Article 13 of the Convention**\n\n\"Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.\"\n\n**Article 14 of the Convention**\n\n\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"\n\n**Article 18 of the Convention**\n\n\"The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.\"\n\n**Article 1 of Protocol No. 1**\n\n\"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\"\n\n476.\n\nThe Government maintained that the tax inspections in respect of the applicant company had been conducted in accordance with the domestic law and that the company had been acting in bad faith throughout the proceedings, in blatant breach of the tax legislation, and had only mimicked compliance with the law. The Government argued that the applicant company had committed blatant tax evasion which was confirmed by the findings of the domestic courts. The evidence to confirm the Ministry's claims was abundant and it was clear that the whole setup with sham entities was organised solely for the purpose of tax evasion.\n\n477.\n\nAs an example of the sham nature of the arrangement, the Government referred to the fact, established by the domestic courts, that on one occasion a person managing one of the company's sham entities signed three contracts simultaneously in three different locations, namely Samara, Nefteyugansk and the Tomsk region, which are located very far one from another. In addition, the Government referred to the internal opinion of the audit company PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which specifically mentioned various problems with the applicant company's \"tax optimisation\" scheme, including the Fund used by the company for receiving the money generated by the sham entities. It was in breach of the Russian legislation as money could only be transferred from one independent commercial entity to another independent commercial entity in exchange or in payment for services or goods (Article 575 of the Civil Code, see paragraph 374). In addition, the company misled the public in its reports and financial statements. The Government submitted that the company's management had presented a distorted picture of the company's performance in order to attract investors.\n\n478.\n\nAccording to the Government, the applicant company acted in bad faith and was also acting in bad faith in other sets of proceedings, including a failed attempt to file for bankruptcy in the United States. Furthermore, the management attempted to create artificial liabilities and existing debts to the applicant company, in order to increase their weight as creditors in the company's insolvency proceedings.\n\n479.\n\nAs regards the applicant company's argument about the selective application of the law in their case, the Government responded that the allegations that other taxpayers may have used similar schemes could not be interpreted as justifying the applicant's failure to abide by the law. They further contended that the occurrence of illegal tax schemes at a certain stage of Russia's historical development was not due to failures or drawbacks of the legislation, but was instead due to bad faith actions of economic actors and weakened governmental control over compliance with the Russian tax legislation on account of objective reasons, such the 1998 economic crisis, and the difficulties of the transitional period. At present, the Government were constantly combating tax evasion and had strengthened supervision in the sphere. The Government referred to statistical data which demonstrated that, since 2000, there had been a sharp increase in the number of tax disputes: during the five years between 2000 and 2005 the number of tax cases almost tripled. The Government also cited domestic case-law demonstrating that the courts' position in similar tax cases had been consistent (see paragraphs 401-426). Furthermore, at the relevant time tax proceedings had also been brought against such large companies as OAO Ufaneftekhim, IZ TNK, OAO Vympelkom, ZAO Ford Motor Ko., ZAO J.T. Marketing and Sales tobacco.\n\n480.\n\nAs regards the lawfulness of the company's use of domestic offshore territories, the Government referred to statements by the former counsel of the applicant company and its majority shareholder Group Menatep, Mr D. Sch. In an interview with the Raschyot magazine of 30 January 2001, he suggested that tax planning was like a piece of cake with multiple layers. According to the Government, the applicant company used the schemes described by Mr D. Sch. in their crudest form and undoubtedly knew that the schemes had been illegal.\n\n481.\n\nIn respect of the lawfulness of the domestic authorities' actions, the Government submitted that the company's tax liability had been established by the domestic courts on the basis of, among other things, Article 122 of the Tax Code, which penalised the understatement of revenues and corresponding taxes, RF Law No. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On profit tax of enterprises and organisations\", RF Law No. 1759-I of 18 October 1991 \"On road funds in the Russian Federation\", RF Law No. 2118-I of 27 December 1991 \"On the basics of the tax system\", RF Law No. 2030-I of 13 December 1991 \"On property tax of enterprises\", RF Law No. 1992-I of 6 December 1991 \"On valued-added tax\" and RF Law No. 3297-I of 14 July 1992 \"On closed administrative-territorial entities\" which were all clear and foreseeable at the relevant time. They also referred to statistical data by AK&M and some other news agencies in 2002, which had reported that OAO LUKOIL and OAO Surgutneftegas, two other large Russian oil producers, had posted sales proceeds of RUB 434.92 billion and RUB 163.652 billion and paid RUB 21.190 billion and RUB 13.885 billion in profit tax respectively, whilst the applicant company had posted sales proceeds of RUB 295.729 billion and paid only RUB 3.193 billion in profit tax.\n\n482.\n\nThe Government submitted that the authorities had acted in full compliance with the domestic legislation and with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, which expressly provided for the \"right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties\". In view of the State's wide margin of appreciation in the fiscal sphere and the applicant company's abusive conduct the Government maintained that the fair balance between the private and public interests had been struck. The tax inspections in respect of the applicant company had been conducted in accordance with the domestic law, and that the company's bad faith had been exemplified by an attempt to conceal the register of its subsidiaries. The tax evasion was committed at the expense of the least developed regions of Russia, represented a blatant breach of the legislation and had inflicted irreplaceable damage on the public interest.\n\n483.\n\nThe Government submitted that the enforcement proceedings in respect of the applicant company had been lawful and proportionate. The company, however, had failed properly to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this part of the application. In particular, its complaints about the seizure of property pending the enforcement proceedings, the alleged failure by the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings, the bailiffs' alleged inaction in respect of the shares of Sibneft, the order to pay a seven percent enforcement fee as well as the circumstances of valuation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz were inadmissible on account of the failure to exhaust domestic remedies.\n\n484.\n\nThe Government also submitted that the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been a lawful, proportionate and reasonable measure aimed at forcing the company to meet its debts. In their first set of observations the Government mentioned that out of a total of RUB 461.3 billion (approximately EUR 13 billion) due by the applicant company, the authorities had succeeded in recovering some RUB 380.9 billion (approximately EUR 11 billion), including RUB 120.5 billion (approximately EUR 3.4 billion) paid by the company in cash and RUB 260.5 billion obtained through auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegas (approximately EUR 7.5 billion). After deduction of these sums, the company still owed some RUB 80 billion. The Government pointed out that during the enforcement proceedings there had been no restrictions on the company's production cycle or the sale of petroleum and mineral oils, and that the applicant company had remained fully operational.\n\n485.\n\nThe Government further submitted that the procedure of compulsory recovery of arrears of mandatory tax payments had been used with due respect to the applicant company. Such tax payments were recovered by way of charging the company's cash flows on bank accounts and in the event of insufficiency or absence of cash, recovery of tax would be effectuated at the expense of the taxpayer's assets the procedure for which was set out in detail in the domestic legislation and followed by the authorities. During the enforcement procedure, no restrictions were imposed on the company's production cycle and the company continued functioning.\n\n486.\n\nThere were no unjustified actions by the bailiffs and the measures represented control of the use of property and were in full compliance with the Convention. As regards the seizure of property, the Government referred to the Gasus Dosier and AGOSI cases and considered that, having regard to relevant factors, such as the enormous amount of arrears, the bad faith conduct of the applicant company and the need for an expedient and efficient recovery of tax to the State budget, the measure in question complied with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n487.\n\nAs regards the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, the measure aimed at securing the payment of taxes and was effected in full compliance with the provisions of the Federal Enforcement Proceedings Act. In the course of the enforcement proceedings the bailiffs seized the entirety of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz belonging to the applicant company. These actions were contested in court, which on 23 August and 25 October 2004 rejected the complaints as unfounded. Before the end of 2004 the bailiffs received six writs to be executed and the total amount to be recovered was then RUB 461.3 billion. The bailiffs did all they could to find the cash, but the company's cash funds were clearly insufficient to cover the arrears. Under section 52 of Enforcement Proceedings Act, an impartial assessment of the cost of the shareholding of OAO Yuganskneftegza belonging to Yukos was commissioned and an appropriate report was submitted on 6 October 2004 to the bailiffs. The parties to the enforcement proceedings, including the applicant company, were familiarised with the assessment act on 13 October 2004, and the company never challenged the results in court.\n\n488.\n\nUnder section 54 (2) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the sale of the applicant company's property was made by a specialised organisation pursuant to the terms of commission and the relevant legislation. On 18 November 2004 the bailiffs decided to sell 43 shares (76.8 percent) of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at an auction. The Government noted that OAO Yuganskneftegaz was itself the debtor in mandatory payments to the budget totalling RUB 102.09 billion, so that the above arrears inevitably affected the price of the auctioned shares, as defined by the valuation institution and the results of the auction. The date of the auction and invitation to participate in the open auction were published in the mass media in due time. The auction itself was open as to its participants and to the form of submissions of price bids for shares. Bids were received between 19 November and 18 December 2004. On 19 December 2004 the open auction took place. The winner of the auction was recognised as OOO Baykalfinancegrup, which offered RUB 260,753,447,303.18 for the shares in question. The auction itself was public. The representatives of the mass media provided extensive media coverage. The results were published in the mass media and broadcasted. With regard to the proportionality of sale, the sum of 260.5 billion roubles generated as a result of the sale of the shares did not, however, cover the arrears of OAO Yukos entirely. In sum, the Government considered that there had been no breach of the Convention.\n\n489.\n\nThe applicant company argued that it had been deprived of its possessions, and that these deprivations had not been in accordance with the law and had imposed a disproportionate burden on the company. Firstly, the applicant company disagreed with the factual conclusions reached by the domestic courts in respect of the trading companies. The applicant argued that it had been the wrong defendant in the case, that there had been no links of dependency between the trading companies and itself, and that there were no grounds for making the applicant company, a holding company having at the material time only two employees with highly important but small scale administrative functions, liable for the trading companies' tax liabilities and creating a previously virtually unknown concept of \"bad faith taxpayer\".\n\n490.\n\nThe company further argued that the denial of tax benefits to the trading companies and the failure to repay VAT in respect of the export of oil and oil products had been unlawful and unsubstantiated. The company further argued that it had been subjected to double taxation in respect of the profits received by the trading companies, that the courts' interpretation of the relevant laws had been unforeseeable, unprecedented, selective and unique, contradicting the established practice of the courts. The tax authorities and the Government had submitted no single comparable case, let alone practice to justify the contrary. The applicant company considered that the case-law referred to by the Government was not comparable to the facts or the legal analysis applied in the present case, that it substantially post-dated the relevant period, was largely unreported and inaccessible and related to the interpretation and application of Civil Code provisions which were not invoked or relied on in these proceedings by any party. Furthermore, the company relied on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code to justify the unilateral transfers of cash from the trading companies to the applicant company's Fund. They further argued that there had been no such notion as a \"sham entity\" in Russian law.\n\n491.\n\nWith reference to Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code, the applicant company claimed that it should not have been ordered to pay interest surcharges at all. The company argued that the authorities ought to have applied Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code in their case. It argued that it had been deprived of its possessions and that these deprivations had not been in accordance with the law and had imposed a disproportionate burden on the company. The tax liability and enforcement proceedings were a *de facto* disguised expropriation. The seizure of assets was disproportionate in that the authorities ordered the applicant company to pay and at the same time froze the company's assets, worth considerably more than the company's then liability. The authorities refused to use the company's equity in the Sibneft company as well as other realistic means of settlement of the debt. The domestic authorities should have accepted those other realistic means of settlement because they were required to do so by precedent in the practice of the commercial courts. The time of merely a couple of days given to the applicant company for payment was absurdly short. The requirement to pay seven percent enforcement fees was disproportionate and unlawful. The sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz was unlawful, conducted at a gross undervaluation through a plainly controlled auction, with the participation of a sham bidder, OOO Baykalfinansgrup.\n\n492.\n\nWith regard to the company's failure to comply with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, the applicant company considered that exhaustion had been unnecessary in view of the lack of prospects of success. The domestic courts consistently rejected the company's attempts to contest the actions of the bailiffs, so the attempts would have been futile. In any event, the company did not disagree with the valuation report in respect of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as it was not materially inaccurate so as to be realistically challenged in litigation. Furthermore, the company submitted that it did challenge the entire process in which the voting shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz were sold to a state-owned company OAO Rosneft.\n\n493.\n\nThe Court first notes that the Government raised an argument of non-exhaustion as regards the applicant company's complaints about various circumstances of the enforcement proceedings, including the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. The Court considers that in view of the applicant company's complaints under Article 13 of the Convention, the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies is so closely linked to the merits of the case that it is inappropriate to determine it at the present stage of the proceedings. The Court therefore decides to join this objection to the merits.\n\n494.\n\nIn the light of the parties' submissions, the Court finds that this part of the application raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes that it is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring them inadmissible have been established.\n\n**E. Admissibility of the complaints under Article 7 of the Convention**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n495.\n\nUnder Article 7 of the Convention the applicant company complained that the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 had been based on an arbitrary interpretation of the domestic law, that the prosecution had been selective and arbitrary and that the imposition of double penalties for the years 2001-2003 had been retrospective. Article 7 of the Convention states as follows:\n\n\"1. No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed.\n\n2. This article shall not prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognised by civilised nations.\"\n\n496.\n\nThe Government argued that the proceedings had not been criminal within the meaning of the Russian law and that there had not been criminal proceedings within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention. According to them, the dispute was adjudication of a tax debt of an administrative-law nature, a purely public policy issue falling outside of the Court's jurisdiction. In any event, Article 7 had not been breached. Overall, the Government argued that both the domestic law and practice had been clear and available and had complied with the requirements of lawfulness and legal certainty within the meaning of Article 7 of the Convention. Their arguments were similar to those mentioned earlier in respect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n497.\n\nThe applicant company argued that the proceedings had been \"criminal\" within the meaning of Article 7, that the offences had been interpreted in a selective, unprecedented and unforeseeable manner, that the case contained a novel interpretation of the Tax Code insofar as the applicant company had been made responsible for tax allegedly due on transactions conducted by the trading companies and these latter companies had been designated as \"sham\", that it could not have known in advance whether its conduct was criminal and that the Government had failed to produce a single example or case to justify the contrary.\n\n498.\n\nAs regards the Government's argument that Article 7 of the Convention was inapplicable, the Court observes that it has earlier established the criminal nature of the tax offence in the 2000 Tax Assessment for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. Since the 20012003 Tax Assessments concerned essentially the same offence committed by the applicant company during three subsequent years, the Court finds that the 2000-2003 Tax Assessment proceedings against the applicant company concerned criminal offence for the purposes of Article 7.\n\n499.\n\nThe Court considers that this part of the application raises serious issues of fact and law under the Convention, the determination of which requires an examination of the merits. The Court concludes that it is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 3 of the Convention. No other grounds for declaring it inadmissible have been established.\n\n[500].\n\nFor these reasons, the Court\n\n*Dismisses* by a majority the Government's request to discontinue the examination of the case and *accepts* Mr Gardner as the valid representative of the applicant company;\n\n*Decides* by a majority to join to the merits the examination of the issue of exhaustion in so far as the applicant company's complaints about the enforcement proceedings, including the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, are concerned;\n\n*Declares* by a majority admissible, without prejudging the merits:\n\n*\u2013* the applicant company's complaints under Article 6 of the Convention concerning various defects in the proceedings concerning its tax liability for the year 2000;\n\n*\u2013* the complaints under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone and conjunction with Articles 1, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention, about the lawfulness and proportionality of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments and their subsequent enforcement, including the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz;\n\n*\u2013* the complaints under Article 7 of the Convention about the lack of proper legal basis, selective and arbitrary prosecution and the imposition of double penalties in the Tax Assessment proceedings for the years 20002003;\n\n*Declares* unanimously inadmissible the remainder of the application."}, {"Title": "Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2009-11-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** |\n| **1994 EU Joint Statement** | Joint statement by the Council, the Commission and the Member States of the European Union on Article 45 of the European Energy Charter Treaty, 14 December 1994 |\n| **Auriga-type Trusts** | The Auriga Trust, the Draco Trust, the Mensa Trust, the Tucana Trust, and the Pictor Trust |\n| **Baikal** | Baikal Finance Group, an entity purportedly controlled by the Russian State |\n| **Bering Sea MBA** | Maritime Boundary Agreement for the Bering Sea, in connection with which notes were exchanged between the United States and the USSR on 1 June 1990 |\n| **BIT** | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| **Briefing** | U.S. Administration Briefing on the Energy Charter Treaty, 1 November 1994 |\n| **BVI** | British Virgin Islands |\n| **Claimants** | Hulley, VPL and YUL |\n| **Constitution** | Constitution of the Russian Federation, 1993 |\n| **Cyprus-Russia DTC** | Cyprus-Russia Double Taxation Convention |\n| **Deferred Requests** | Requests and objections from the Parties regarding document production addressed in Procedural Order No. 2, 8 September 1996 |\n| **ECT** | Energy Charter Treaty, 1994 |\n| **ECT Explanatory Note** | Explanatory Note submitted by the Russian Government to the Duma together with the draft ECT ratification law, 26 August 1996 |\n| **EU** | European Union |\n| **GATT** | General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 1994 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GML** | GML Limited, a company incorporated in Gibraltar |\n| **Guernsey Trusts** | Trusts created in Guernsey in 2003 and 2005 which hold the shares of GML (the Auriga Trust, the Draco Trust, the Mensa Trust, the Tucana Trust, the Pictor Trust, the Southern Cross Trust, and the Palmus Trust) |\n| **FLIT** | Federal Law on International Treaties of the Russian Federation, 1995 |\n| **Hulley** | Hulley Enterprises Limited, a company organized under the laws of Cyprus and Claimant in PCA Case No. AA 226 |\n| **ICJ** | International Court of Justice |\n| **ICSID** | International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| **ILC** | International Law Commission of the United Nations |\n| **Limitation Clause** | The phrase at the end of Article 45(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty: \"... to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" |\n| **NAFTA** | North American Free Trade Agreement, 1992 |\n| **P&C Agreement** | Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation 1994 |\n| **Palmus Settlement** | Settlement on 5 March 2003 creating the Palmus Trust |\n| **Parties** | Claimants and Respondent |\n| **PCA** | Permanent Court of Arbitration |\n| **Red Cross** | The International Committee of the Red Cross |\n| **Respondent** | Russia, Russian Federation |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **RSP** | Russian Service Provider |\n| **Russian Notification** | Notification of 20 August 2009 by Russian Federation to Portuguese Republic pursuant to Article 45(3)(a) of the Treaty |\n| **Rysaffe** | Rysaffe Trust Company (C.I.)

Mindful of the fact that each of the three Claimants maintains separate claims in separate arbitrations that necessitate separate awards, the Tribunal nevertheless shall discuss these arbitrations as a single set of proceedings, except where circumstances distinct to particular Claimants necessitate separate treatment. Thus throughout Parts I to VI, the introductory portions of this Interim Award, the plural \"Claimants\" is used collectively for Hulley, YUL and VPL. In Parts VII, VIII and IX, the Issues, Analysis and Decision portions of this Interim Award, the singular \"Claimant\" refers specifically to YUL.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 November 2004, all three Claimants delivered to the President of Russia notifications of claim with respect to Russia's alleged violation of obligations said to be owed to Claimants' investments in Russia under the Energy Charter Treaty (\" **ECT** \" or \" **Treaty** \")1 and sought to settle the disputes amicably pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT.\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Lisbon, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95.\n\n4.\n\nHaving failed to settle their disputes amicably within the three-month period prescribed under Article 26(2) of the ECT, on 3 February 2005, Hulley and YUL initiated arbitration proceedings through Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim against Respondent. Subsequently, through a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 14 February 2005, VPL initiated arbitration proceedings against Respondent (collectively, the \" **Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim** \"). Claimants' requests for arbitration against Respondent were made pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\" **UNCITRAL Rules** \").2\n\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) GA Res. 31/98.\n\n5.\n\nClaimants alleged in their Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim that Respondent expropriated and failed to protect Claimants' investments in Yukos, resulting in \"enormous losses,\" and sought all available relief in respect of those losses.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn their Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim, Claimants appointed Mr. Daniel Price as arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nOn 8 April 2005, Respondent appointed Judge Stephen M. Schwebel as arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nBy a letter dated 26 May 2005, Claimants informed the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") that the deadline for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator by the Party-appointed arbitrators had expired and requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA designate an appointing authority pursuant to Article 7(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Claimants further stated that they would have no objection to the Secretary-General of the PCA acting as the appointing authority. By a letter dated 17 June 2005, Respondent accepted the Secretary-General of the PCA as appointing authority, while making it clear that such acceptance did not constitute acceptance of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in these arbitrations.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 4 July 2005, the PCA communicated to the Parties a list of three prospective presiding arbitrators in accordance with the list procedure foreseen in Articles 6(3) and 7(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules. On 19 July 2005, the Parties communicated their choices to the PCA, but no arbitrator set forth on the list was considered acceptable to both sides. On 20 July 2005, the PCA notified the Parties that the list procedure had failed and on 21 July 2005 the PCA Secretary-General exercised his discretion, pursuant to Article 6(3)(d) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and directly appointed Ma\u00eetre L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC (the \" **Chairman** \") as presiding arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nThrough a letter dated 1 August 2005, Claimants agreed to Respondent's proposal that The Hague be selected as the legal seat of the arbitrations and confirmed that the Parties agreed to have the PCA administer these arbitrations.\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 October 2005, Respondent submitted its Statements of Defense, in which it objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and denied Claimants' allegations of expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n12.\n\nOn 31 October 2005, a preliminary procedural hearing was held at the Peace Palace, The Hague, during which the Parties and the members of the Tribunal signed Terms of Appointment confirming, *inter alia,* that: (a) the members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed in accordance with the ECT and the UNCITRAL Rules, (b) the proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, (c) the International Bureau of the PCA shall act as registry, (d) the issues in dispute shall be decided in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law, (e) the language of the arbitration shall be English, and (f) all pleadings, documents, testimonial evidence, deliberations and actions taken by the Tribunal, shall remain confidential in perpetuity, unless the Parties release the arbitrators from this obligation. The preliminary procedural hearing was attended by the following:\n\nTribunal\n\nMa\u00eetre L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC\n\nMr. Daniel Price\n\nJudge Stephen M. Schwebel\n\nClaimants\n\n*Counsel Counsel*\n\nProfessor Emmanuel Gaillard\n\nDr. Yas Banifatemi\n\nMr. Philippe Pinsolle\n\nRespondent\n\nMr. Robert T. Greig\n\nDr. Claudia Annacker\n\nMr. Gr\u00e9goire Bertrou\n\nMr. Charles Olson\n\n*Party Representatives*\n\nMr. Tim Osborne\n\nMr. Kevin Bromley\n\nMr. Christopher Cook\n\nMr. Rodney Hodges\n\nPermanent Court of Arbitration\n\nMr. Brooks Daly\n\nMs. Evelien ter Meulen Court Reporter Mr. Trevor McGowan\n\n13.\n\nAt the preliminary procedural hearing, the Tribunal also determined that it would rule on Respondent's plea concerning jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claim as a preliminary question and ordered a procedural calendar for the conduct of the arbitration. The procedural calendar was subsequently confirmed through Procedural Order No. 1, dated 8 November 2005.\n\n14.\n\nOn 31 May 2007, Mr. Daniel Price resigned as arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nOn 26 June 2007, Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as arbitrator to replace Mr. Price. Through a letter dated 29 June 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler disclosed, for purposes of transparency, certain circumstances connecting her then law firm to Claimants and Claimants' counsel which, in her view, did not affect her independence and impartiality. On the basis of those relationships, by its letter of 13 July 2007, Respondent challenged Claimants' appointment of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler pursuant to Article 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules. By a letter dated 20 July 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler maintained that the circumstances disclosed in her letter of 29 June 2007 did not affect her independence and impartiality. Through their letter of 26 July 2007, Claimants did not agree to the challenge of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment as arbitrator. On 31 July 2007, Respondent requested a ruling from the Secretary-General of the PCA on Respondent's challenge to the appointment pursuant to Article 12 of the UNCITRAL Rules. After providing the Parties the opportunity to comment on the challenge, on 4 September 2007, the Secretary-General of the PCA sustained the challenge of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as arbitrator and invited Claimants to appoint a substitute arbitrator in accordance with Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 September 2007, Claimants appointed Dr. Charles Poncet as arbitrator.\n\n**C. WRITTEN AND ORAL PROCEEDINGS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent filed its First Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 28 February 2006 (\" **First Memorials** \"). Claimants filed their Counter-Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 30 June 2006 (\" **CounterMemorials** \").\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 27 March 2006, Claimants requested that Respondent produce certain documents relied upon in its First Memorials. On 8 May 2006, following extensive correspondence, the Tribunal ordered that Respondent produce all the documents relied upon in Respondent's Memorials. These documents were to be submitted by 17 May 2006. On 17 May 2006, Respondent produced certain documents; however, in a letter dated 19 May 2006, Claimants pointed out that Respondent had failed to produce all the required documents and requested that the Tribunal direct Respondent to comply fully with the Tribunal's letter of 8 May 2006 and grant Claimants additional time to prepare their Counter-Memorials. The Chairman requested that Respondent provide its comments on Claimants' letter of 19 May 2006, and by a letter dated 26 May 2006, Respondent stated that it had produced all the requested documents, although some of them were secondary\u2014rather than primary\u2014source documents, and therefore requested that the Tribunal deny Claimants' application. The Chairman requested that Respondent provide its comments on Claimants' letter of 26 May 2006, and by a letter dated 1 June 2006, Claimants reiterated all of the terms of their letter dated 19 May 2006. The Tribunal directed Respondent to produce the primary sources listed in the table attached to Claimants' letter dated 19 May 2006; the deadline for submission of the documents was 23 June 2006. On 23 June 2006 Respondent provided some of the documents requested.\n\n19.\n\nOn 8 September 2006, after considering various requests and objections from the Parties for the production of certain documents, including the various pleadings and requests relating to the Parties' respective \"unclean hands\" contentions and Respondent's contention that \"Claimant(s') corporate responsibility must be disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a criminal enterprise\" (collectively, the \" **Deferred Requests** \"), the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which granted a number of requests, denied others, and invited the Parties to attempt to reach agreement by 18 September 2006 on whether the Deferred Requests should be considered during the Jurisdiction and Admissibility phase or deferred to the merits phase, if any. If the Parties were unable to reach agreement, the Tribunal invited the Parties to communicate their respective views on the question in writing by 2 October 2006 and to comment on the other Party's submission by 16 October 2006.\n\n20.\n\nOn 31 October 2006, after receiving the Parties' submissions following their inability to reach agreement, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding that it was appropriate to defer consideration of the Parties' contentions concerning \"unclean hands,\" Respondent's \"criminal enterprise\" contention, and the resolution of the Deferred Requests (or relevant portions thereof) to the merits phase, if any. Prior to rendering its decision on the Deferred Requests, and in order to facilitate identification of the factual issues in dispute as to which further document production ought to be ordered, the Tribunal also invited Claimants to inform the Tribunal whether they were prepared to stipulate certain facts. On 3 November 2006 Claimants submitted a stipulation of facts, and on 8 November 2006, Respondent submitted its observations on the stipulations.\n\n21.\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, wherein it made a determination on certain of the Parties' Deferred Requests, and modified the procedural calendar.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent filed its Second Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 31 January 2007 (\" **Second Memorials** \").\n\n23.\n\nOn 6 March 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, which, *inter alia*, (a) directed Respondent to provide certain documents requested by Claimants (including publicly available documents), (b) reminded the Parties of their obligation to produce and submit to the other Party all documents relied upon in their Memorials or by their witnesses/experts in their statements/opinions, and (c) ruled that a Party's failure to produce a document within the prescribed time may, on application of the other Party, result in the Tribunal drawing an inference adverse to the defaulting Party or even excluding or limiting the evidence in support of which the document has been invoked.\n\n24.\n\nClaimants filed their Rejoinders on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 1 June 2007 (\" **Rejoinders** \").\n\n25.\n\nOn 1 December 2007, a hearing was conducted at the Conference Centre of the World Bank, Paris, concerning certain procedural matters, hearing schedules, the production of additional documents, and Claimants' request for interim measures for the safekeeping of Yukos' company records. In attendance were the following:\n\nTribunal\n\nMa\u00eetre L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC\n\nDr. Charles Poncet\n\nJudge Stephen M.

This decision was subsequently confirmed on 12 December 2007 as Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n27.\n\nOn 8 and 9 May 2008, a procedural hearing was conducted at the Peace Palace, The Hague. The Chairman was authorized by his co-arbitrators to chair the procedural hearing alone. The procedural hearing dealt with a number of matters, including Claimants' request for interim measures of preservation dated 1 December 2007, the Parties' respective requests to exclude certain documents from the evidentiary record, and the conduct of the scheduled hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility. In attendance were the following:\n\nTribunal\n\nMa\u00eetre L.

The Tribunal decided upon the admission of certain ECT documentation. The Tribunal also decided that while it will remain seized of Claimants' application for interim measures, an order would not be issued in light of Respondent's understanding that the relevant Yukos company records at issue would be retained by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court for a period of 5 years.\n\n29.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, ruling, *inter alia*, upon the allocation of time between the Parties for cross-examination and excluding a witness statement from the evidentiary record. The Tribunal then declared the evidentiary record of the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of the arbitrations closed.\n\n30.\n\nOn 23 September 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, deciding certain procedural matters with respect to the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 November 2008, Claimants and Respondent submitted their respective Skeleton Arguments in aid of the oral arguments to be presented at the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n32.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility was conducted at the Peace Palace, The Hague, on 17 to 21 November, 26 to 29 November, and 1 December 2008. Claimants cross-examined the following witnesses: Professor Suren Avakiyan, Mr. Sydney Fremantle, Mr. Martin Mann, QC, Mr. Daniel Berman, and Mr. Anatoly Martynov. Respondent cross-examined Mr. Vladimir Gladyshev and Mr. Brian Green, QC. The Tribunal also heard the Parties' closing statements and rebuttal.

The Tribunal requested the Parties to submit their observations as to what effect, if any, the Russian Notification had on the Tribunal's consideration of the issues now before it. By letters dated 15 September 2009, the Parties submitted their written observations in response to the Tribunal's request.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe disputes between the Parties to the present proceedings arose during the period between July 2003 and August 2006, after Yukos had emerged following the collapse of the Soviet Union to become the largest oil company in the Russian Federation. In essence, the disputes between the Parties involve various measures taken by the Russian Federation against Yukos and associated companies, that culminated in the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006, thereby allegedly adversely affecting Claimants' investments in Yukos. Such acts include both criminal prosecutions and other measures that Claimants allege to be in violation of the ECT.\n\n**A. ENERGY CHARTER TREATY**\n----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe ECT was opened for signature on 17 December 1994 and entered into force on 16 April 1998. According to Article 2 of the Treaty, its purpose is to establish \"a legal framework in order to promote long-term co-operation in the energy field... in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe Russian Federation signed the ECT on 17 December 1994. The Treaty was submitted for ratification to the Parliament of the Russian Federation on 26 August 1996. Respondent notes that its Parliament has \"never ratified the Treaty, nor has it ever adopted any law accepting or approving its provisional application.\" Instead, the proposal to ratify the Treaty met \"fierce opposition\" in the State Duma hearings in April 1997 and January 2001 and continued to meet such opposition. Respondent therefore contends that at all relevant times, the Treaty had not yet entered into force for the Russian Federation, and that Claimants cannot rely on its terms in the present proceedings.\n\n38.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants submit that the Russian Federation has applied the Treaty on a provisional basis since signing it in December 1994, in accordance with Article 45 of the Treaty.\n\n39.\n\nOn 20 August 2009, the Russian Federation notified the Portuguese Republic, as the ECT Depository, of its intention not to become a party to the ECT. According to Respondent, the Russian Notification is \"fully consistent with the positions taken in these proceedings by the Russian Federation, and was not intended to have any effect on the jurisdictional and admissibility issues currently before the Tribunal.\"\n\n40.\n\nClaimants consider that the Russian Notification of 20 August 2009 has \"no effect whatsoever on the Tribunal's consideration of the issues before it,\" other than furnishing further support for the conclusion that by terminating provisional application of the ECT pursuant to Article 45(3) of the ECT, Russia \"admits having applied the Treaty from the date of signature with such provisional application giving rise to legally binding rights and obligations.\"\n\n**B. THE PARTIES TO THESE PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants and Related Entities**\n-------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe three Claimants in these related cases are all part of the Yukos group of companies, which had at its center the Yukos Oil Corporation OJSC, headed by Chief Executive Officer Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\n42.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 227, YUL, was incorporated on 24 September 1997 in the Isle of Man (a Dependency of the United Kingdom).\n\n43.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 226, Hulley, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on 17 September 1997 and was a 100 percent owned subsidiary of YUL.\n\n44.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 228, VPL, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on 7 February 2001.\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n45.\n\nRespondent in these three proceedings is the Russian Federation.\n\n**C. YUKOS OIL CORPORATION OJSC**\n---------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Yukos was incorporated as a joint stock company in 1993 by Presidential Decree. Fully privatized in 1995-1996, it was a vertically integrated group engaging in exploration, production, refining, marketing and distribution of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Its three main production subsidiaries were Yuganskneftegaz, Samaraneftegaz and, from 1997, Tomskneft. In May 2002, Yukos became the first Russian company to be ranked among the top ten largest oil and gas companies by market capitalization worldwide. At its peak in 2003, it had 100,000 employees, six main refineries and a market capitalization estimated at over US$33 billion. After its 2003 merger with Sibneft, according to Claimants, YukosSibneft became the fourth largest oil producer worldwide, behind BP, Exxon and Shell. At the time of Respondent's alleged adverse actions in the summer of 2003, Yukos was engaged in merger negotiations with ExxonMobil and Chevron.\n\n47.\n\nRespondent, however, contends that Yukos was a \"criminal enterprise,\" engaged in a variety of tax evasion schemes and other fraudulent activities.\n\n**D. CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------\n\n48.\n\nStarting in July 2003, a series of criminal investigations were initiated by the Russian Federation against Yukos management and activities. Claimants characterize these actions as harassment, motivated by Mr. Khodorkovsky's participation in Russian (opposition) politics and intended\u2014together with tax reassessments\u2014to lead to the nationalization of Yukos' assets. Respondent contends that its actions were in response to illegal acts committed by Yukos and its officers and shareholders.\n\n49.\n\nBetween July and October 2003, three key Yukos officers were arrested. In July 2003, Mr. Platon Lebedev, Director of YUL and Chairman of Hulley, was arrested on charges of embezzlement and fraud; he was sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. In October 2003, Mr. Vasily Shakhovsky, President of Yukos-Moscow, was charged with and later convicted of tax evasion. In October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky himself was arrested and charged with crimes including forgery, fraud and tax evasion; he was also sentenced to a nine-year prison term in May 2005. As a result of these arrests, a number of high-ranking Yukos executives fled Russia, such as Mr. Leonid Nevzlin, Deputy Chairman of Yukos until 2003. On 2 February 2007, new charges of embezzlement and money laundering were brought against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev.\n\n50.\n\nFurther arrest warrants were issued from mid-January 2004 against individuals who either held office in Yukos or were associated with it. From late November 2004, mid-level managers and lower-ranking employees were charged or became the subject of criminal investigations. From 2005, several remaining Yukos officials, including many foreign nationals, declined to return to Russia as a result of these investigations. Claimants contend that by April 2006, no fewer than 35 top managers and employees of Yukos had been interrogated, arrested or sentenced and that lawyers acting for Yukos had been obstructed in their work. During the same period, Russian authorities conducted searches, seizures and interrogations of Yukos property and personnel.\n\n51.\n\nClaimants contend that all of these actions amounted to harassment and intimidation, that they \"severely hampered\" the functioning of Yukos as a business and that the underlying motive was to nationalize Yukos' assets.\n\n52.\n\nIn response, Respondent contends that Claimants are \"part of a criminal enterprise engaging in a number of illegal activities [...] including tax evasion, tax fraud, and schemes to avoid enforcement of tax liens\" and that Claimants have \"engaged in a pattern of criminal activity\" designed to divert funds from Russian entities through tax fraud and embezzlement. It contends that Claimants had participated in an illegal tax scheme designed to misuse special low-tax zones in Russia and that they were aware of the illegality of the tax fraud scheme.\n\n53.\n\nRespondent contends that in addition to participation in tax fraud schemes, Claimants participated in a \"massive transfer pricing scheme by which hundreds of millions of dollars from the sales of oil and other products were illegally siphoned off to offshore entities for the benefit of Khodorkovsky/Lebedev and other controlling Russian oligarchs.\" Through this scheme, oil or other products would be sold by Russian entities at below-market prices to offshore companies with no official affiliation to Yukos and then re-sold at market prices, with the profits going to Yukos officials. Respondent contends further that Yukos committed other corporate crimes, such as attempting to issue shares in Yukos subsidiaries to offshore companies in order to dilute the shareholdings of minority shareholders, manipulating the Yukos share price in order to buy back Yukos shares from the banks at below-market prices, and embezzlement of funds.\n\n54.\n\nRespondent also contends that Yukos officials have been engaged in violent crimes, such as the murder, attempted murder and assault of persons seeking to enforce Russian tax laws or otherwise perceived to threaten Yukos interests.\n\n55.\n\nRespondent denies that Yukos and its officers were targeted in a discriminatory way, contending that Russian taxation measures have also applied to other offenders and that the searches and seizures were taken as part of legitimate taxation measures and conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedural protections available under Russian law.\n\n**E. ADDITIONAL MEASURES**\n--------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn the period between October 2003 and August 2006, Yukos and its subsidiaries faced a series of additional measures, including the annulment of Yukos' merger with Sibneft, tax reassessments, the freezing of shares and assets, the threatened revocation of licenses, mutual legal assistance measures and the forced sale of Yukos' main production facility, Yuganskneftegaz. These measures were followed by the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006.\n\n**1. Annulment of Yukos Merger with Sibneft**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nA merger was completed between Yukos and Sibneft, Russia's fifth largest oil company, in October 2003. According to Claimants, the resulting entity, YukosSibneft, became the world's fourth largest oil company. In November 2003, however, after Yukos had acquired 92 percent of Sibneft's shares and after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky, Sibneft's controlling shareholder, Mr. Roman Abramovich, halted the merger process based on court findings of Yukos' violations of Russian securities and anti-monopoly laws.\n\n**2. Tax Reassessments**\n------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent contends that from 2000 until Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest in 2003, Yukos had \"implemented an illegal and fraudulent tax evasion scheme designed to misuse special low-tax zones within the Russian Federation,\" known as \"ZATOs\" or \"internal offshore zones.\" It alleges that the scheme involved setting up numerous sham companies in internal offshore zones to enjoy a favorable tax regime in those territories. Claimants deny that Yukos' actions with regard to these trade subsidiaries was illegal or fraudulent, but rather was consistent with Russian legislation in place at the time. They contend that changes to Russian tax legislation were implemented retroactively and for ulterior purposes.\n\n59.\n\nIn April 2004, the Russian Ministry of Taxation issued a tax reassessment for Yukos exceeding US$3.4 billion for 2000, which was largely upheld by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. Similarly large tax reassessments were issued in the period between 2004 and 2006 for subsequent tax years. (For instance, 2001 taxes were re-assessed in the amount of US$4.1 billion, 2002 taxes in the amount of US$6.9 billion and 2004 taxes in the amount of US$6.1 billion.) Yukos' subsidiaries were also faced with large tax reassessment claims for the years 2001-2003. Respondent contends that the reassessments were a consequence of Yukos' activities relating to the tax fraud scheme. Claimants submit, however, that the reassessments \"were so excessive that the Russian authorities' strategy of destroying Yukos became plain.\"\n\n60.\n\nClaimants note that Yukos made numerous proposals to the Russian authorities throughout this period to settle the tax claims, which were ignored or rejected by the Russian authorities. Overall, Claimants contend, \"there have been over 70 offers to settle Yukos' tax claims, all of which have been ignored by the Russian authorities.\"\n\n**3. Freezing of Shares and Assets**\n------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nAt the same time that tax reassessments were being filed against Yukos and its subsidiaries, Russian authorities began freezing shares and other assets belonging to Yukos and related entities. In October 2003, Russian prosecutors froze shares held by Yukos Universal and Hulley in Yukos\u2014thereby freezing 53 percent of all shares in Yukos. Orders issued by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in April and June 2004 prevented Yukos from disposing of any of its assets. An application by Yukos in July 2004 to have sufficient assets released to meet its tax liabilities was ignored and a US$241 million surcharge was applied for late payment of taxes. Similar fines for late tax payments were charged in 2001 and in 2002.\n\n62.\n\nIn July 2004, Russian authorities began seizing Yukos' shares in Yuganskneftegaz, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft. Yuganskneftegaz bank accounts were frozen in August 2004 and thirteen additional freezing orders were imposed on Yukos' bank accounts in September 2004. The Russian authorities also used mutual legal assistance treaties to affect Yukos' interests abroad.\n\n63.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the freezing of Yukos' assets but contends that \"[t]he freezing of assets of the debtor, including shares owned by it, is a standard enforcement measure for tax levies and judgments.\"\n\n**4. Threatened Revocation of Licenses**\n----------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nBetween October 2003 and December 2004, the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources conducted a review of Yukos' compliance with oil production license obligations. Searches were conducted in September 2004 concerning Yuganskneftegaz licenses; in October 2004, a Government task force recommended revoking 24 licenses to Yukos' subsidiaries, and a special commission began investigations into Yukos' oil and gas fields in the Saratov Region. Investigations ended in December 2004.\n\n**5. Sale of Yuganskneftegaz**\n------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nIn July 2004, the Russian Federation indicated that it intended to appraise and sell Yuganskneftegaz to pay off Yukos' back taxes. A valuation carried out by investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein at the request of the Russian Federation valued Yuganskneftegaz at between US$15.7 billion and US$18.3 billion. A valuation carried out by JP Morgan, at the request of Yukos, valued Yuganskneftegaz at between US$16 billion and US$22 billion. The Russian Ministry of Justice announced that Yukos was worth only US$10.4 billion.\n\n66.\n\nAfter Yukos' attempts to file for bankruptcy in both the Russian Federation and the United States failed, Yuganskneftegaz was sold at auction on 19 December 2004 for US$9.37 billion to Baikal Finance Group (\" **Baikal** \"), an entity purportedly controlled by the Russian State. On 23 December 2004, Baikal was bought by State-owned Rosneft.\n\n**6. Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n67.\n\nClaimants allege that the Russian Federation first reported in March 2005 that it intended to \"push Yukos into bankruptcy in order to redistribute its remaining assets.\" On 6 March 2006, a syndicate of banks filed a bankruptcy petition before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, pursuant to a Sale Agreement with Rosneft. Yuganskneftegaz filed a separate bankruptcy petition against Yukos, which was subsequently joined to that of the bank syndicate. On 29 March 2006, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against Yukos, placing it under external supervision, and on 1 August 2006, Yukos was declared bankrupt.\n\n68.\n\nYukos' remaining assets were acquired by State-owned Gazprom and Rosneft, with the bankruptcy auctions raising a total of US$31.5 billion. In November 2007, Yukos was liquidated and struck off the register of legal entities.\n\n**III. PARTIES' WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAs indicated in Part C of the Procedural History above, the Parties submitted two rounds of memorials. Each party took full advantage of the written phase of these proceedings, filing detailed and extensive written submissions. Respondent's First Memorial runs to 150 pages, and was accompanied by 311 exhibits and five witness statements. Claimant's Counter-Memorial is 137 pages long, and was accompanied by 453 exhibits and three witness statements. Respondent's Second Memorial runs to over 250 pages, and was accompanied by 494 exhibits and 15 witness statements. Finally, Claimant's Rejoinder runs to over 200 pages, and was submitted with 641 exhibits and four witness statements. Hundreds of other additional exhibits and witness statements were submitted in the course of the proceedings.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal studied these submissions carefully. The Parties' principal arguments are re-stated in the Tribunal's analysis of the issues in Part VIII, below. For purposes of this introductory chapter, the Tribunal reproduces below *verbatim* the written \"skeleton arguments\" that the Parties submitted prior to the hearing at the Tribunal's request.\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs 1 to 53 of Respondent's Skeleton Argument submitted on 10 November 2008.\n\nA. Claimants' Mandatory Opt-Out Declaration Argument is Without Merit\n\n1. The Russian Federation is entitled to rely on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) of the ECT irrespective of whether the Russian Federation ever made an opt-out declaration under Article 45(2)(a).\n\n2. Article 45(1) provides that the ECT is to be provisionally applied as to each signatory \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" Article 45(2)(a) separately provides that an ECT signatory \"may\" deliver to the Treaty Depository a declaration \"that it is not able to accept provisional application.\" Contrary to Claimants' contention, Article 45(2)(a) is not a compulsory procedural mechanism, and a Treaty signatory need not have made an opt-out declaration in order to rely on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1).\n\n3. The plain language of Article 45, its context, the Treaty's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, circumstances at the time of the Treaty's conclusion, and State practice in the application of the Treaty all support this conclusion.\n\n4. By their terms, Article 45(1) is self-executing and does not require the delivery of an opt-out declaration, and Article 45(2)(a) operates in express derogation of Article 45(1) (\"Notwithstanding paragraph (1)\") and, in any event, is not obligatory (a signatory \"may\" deliver an opt-out declaration).\n\n5. The inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) is based on standard inconsistency clauses included in other treaties, none of which provide for an opt-out mechanism. When originally proposed, Article 45(1) was drafted as a standalone clause without an opt-out mechanism. Article 45(2)(a) was added later only to accommodate those States that did not want to apply the Treaty provisionally at all, for political or other reasons.\n\n6. At least six States separately stated that they considered themselves entitled to rely on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) without making an opt-out declaration. A Joint Statement of the EU Member States, the Council and the Commission of the European Union is to the same effect. The informal transparency declarations made by several States, relied on by Claimants, are unavailing. While some States did make transparency declarations, none of the transparency declarations was ever delivered to the Treaty Depository, as required by Article 45(2)(a), and several States which expressly relied on Article 45(1), including Germany, France, Spain, and Luxembourg, never made transparency declarations. Though not legally relevant, the Russian Federation's failure to make a transparency declaration is not surprising, given the extraordinarily rapid pace of legal and constitutional change in Russia in the period in question. Under the chaotic circumstances then prevailing, no detailed analysis of the Treaty's consistency with Russian law could fairly be expected.\n\nB. Claimants' All-or-Nothing Approach to Article 45(1) of the Treaty is Without Merit\n\n7. Pursuant to Article 45(1), each provision of the Treaty must be provisionally applied, but only to the extent performance of the obligation created by that provision is not inconsistent with Russia's Constitution, laws or regulations. Claimants' argument notwithstanding, Article 45(1) does not operate on an \"all-or-nothing basis\" so as to require, as a matter of principle, either that the entire Treaty be provisionally applied, or that no portion of the Treaty be provisionally applied.\n\n8. The plain language of Article 45(1), its context, the Treaty's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, the circumstances at the time of the Treaty's conclusion, and State practice in the application of the Treaty all support the conclusion that Article 45(1) is to be applied provision-by-provision, and not on an all-or-nothing basis.\n\n9. In common usage, confirmed by standard dictionary definitions, \"to the extent that\" refers to the \"scope\" or \"width of application.\" \"To the extent that\" is precisely the language used when drafters wish to make clear that a provision is to be applied only insofar as what follows is the case. If it had been intended that the Treaty would be provisionally applied in whole or not at all, Article 45(1) would have instead provided for the Treaty's provisional application \"if\" such provisional application is not inconsistent with a signatory's domestic laws. The drafters of the Treaty likewise could not plausibly have intended that a signatory's provisional application of the entire Treaty would in principle be inconsistent with a signatory's \"regulations.\"\n\n10. The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* confirm that the negotiating States expected that provisional application would differ from country to country based on different domestic inconsistencies; that even relatively minor regulations could result in the non-application *pro tanto* of an inconsistent Treaty provision; and that even a signatory which had no objection in principle to provisional application would only have to apply the Treaty's investment protection provisions to the extent not inconsistent with the signatory's own constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n11. State practice is fully in accord. As reflected in the Joint Statement made by the EU Member States, the Council and the Commission of the European Union, Article 45(1), \"defining the conditions and limits for the provisional application of the ECT by the Signatories[,...] does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the Signatories.\" With specific reference to the Russian Federation, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom stated as recently as February 7, 2006, that Article 45 of the Treaty \"places some obligations on the Russian Federation, but only to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations\" (emphasis supplied). Mr. Craig Bamberger, the Chairman of the ECT Legal Subgroup, and other scholars, agree with the views expressed in the Joint Statement and in the more recent statement of the UK Secretary of State.\n\n12. The Tribunal must accordingly determine whether the dispute-settlement obligations imposed by Article 26 of the Treaty are consistent with Russia's Constitution, laws and regulations.\n\nC. The Claims (and their Resolution by Arbitration) are Inconsistent with Russia's Laws and Constitution\n\n13. For purposes of Article 45(1), a Treaty provision is inconsistent with a signatory's constitution, laws or regulations if, prior to ratification, the Treaty provision (a) imposes an obligation that conflicts with the signatory's domestic law, or (b) creates a new obligation that requires the taking of legal action that, under the signatory's constitution, may only be taken by the signatory's legislature (as distinguished from its executive branch). The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* reflect the importance of the latter type of inconsistency, a concern made explicit in Article 45(1) by the addition to that Article of language requiring the Treaty to be provisionally applied only to the extent the Treaty is consistent not just with a signatory's laws and regulations, but also its constitution.\n\n14. Claimants' argument that Russian law is irrelevant in principle to the provisional application of the Treaty would render the Treaty's inconsistency clause a legal nullity and is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the monist nature of the Russian legal system.\n\n15. According to Claimants, Russian law is irrelevant here because the investors' claim is based on a treaty guarantee rather than domestic law, and thus any resulting investor-State arbitration is \"autonomous and distinct from proceedings under the legal system of the host State.\" This argument is premised on an extreme dualist view, in which investment treaty protections operate on an entirely separate plane from domestic law. Claimants' argument is unavailing both because the argument would, as a matter of principle, deny any possible application to all domestic law exceptions, including the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1), and because Russia does not have a dualist legal system.\n\n16. Following Claimants' tautological argument, there could never in principle be an inconsistency between a treaty provision and a signatory's domestic laws, each operating on its own separate plane. The Russian Federation submits, to the contrary, that the very purpose of a domestic-law exception to provisional application of a treaty is precisely to reconcile treaty-imposed obligations with conflicting domestic-law obligations.\n\n17. Russia's legal system is, in any event, monist (not dualist) in nature. International treaties form an integral part of Russian law, and must be applied directly by Russia's courts. If ratified, the Russian Federation's treaties prevail over inconsistent legislation other than the Constitution. Contrary to Claimants' unstated and incorrect assumption, investment treaty protections are directly enforceable in Russian courts, and do not exist on some \"autonomous and distinct\" plane.\n\n18. Under Russian law, disputes arising from sovereign acts or omissions, including claims for damages for expropriation, may not be submitted to arbitration absent a legal enactment in the form of a law or a ratified treaty so providing. Disputes involving the lawfulness of expropriation, taxation measures, bankruptcy, and other regulatory matters are within the exclusive jurisdiction of Russia's courts, and may not be submitted to arbitration. The Russian Federation's Civil Procedure Code, Arbitrazh Procedure Code and Tax Code confirm the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian courts over these issues, and prohibit their arbitration. Claimants' request for damages is based on allegedly illegal sovereign acts of various Russian authorities, none of which under Russian law may be submitted to arbitration, unless a specific law provides otherwise. The ECT, an unratified treaty, is not such a law.\n\n19. In light of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to Russian courts by Russian law to resolve disputes of the type presented here, allowing Claimants' claims to be resolved by mandatory arbitration under Article 26 of the Treaty would be inconsistent with both Russia's laws and its Constitution. The Russian Constitution is based on the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law. Each branch of State power exercises its power independently, and no branch may usurp the power of another branch. The Russian Constitution specifically preserves the prerogatives of Russia's Federal Assembly (parliament) in the treatymaking process\u2014law-making treaties must be ratified by the adoption of a federal law by both the Duma and the Federation Council\u2014and prohibits the Government from legislating through the conclusion and implementation of international treaties that amend or complement federal laws. This ratification requirement is an emanation of the principle of separation of powers established in Article 10 of the Constitution, and is reflected in Article 15(1)(a) of the Federal Law on International Treaties. Under the latter Article, all treaties whose implementation requires \"the amendment of existing or the adoption of new federal laws, and also those establishing rules that are different from those provided for by law,\" are subject to ratification.\n\n20. The Treaty is also inconsistent with other provisions of Russian law, in addition to the non-arbitrability of disputes involving sovereign acts or omissions and the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian courts to resolve those disputes. Russian law requires privity between the parties to an arbitration agreement, unless a ratified treaty (for example, a ratified bilateral investment treaty) provides otherwise. Professor Kostin's expert opinion on this point has not been disputed. The standing offer to arbitrate investor-State disputes contained in Article 26 of the Treaty is thus inconsistent with Russian law.\n\n21. Russian law also does not allow the shareholders of a Russian joint stock company, such as Claimants, to assert a claim based on injuries allegedly suffered by the company, its management or its subsidiaries. Professor Sukhanov's expert opinion on this point has not been disputed. Claimants' assertion of damages alleged to have been suffered in their capacity as shareholders, in reliance on Article 26, in conjunction with Articles 1(6) and (7), of the Treaty, is thus likewise inconsistent with Russian law.\n\n22. Claimants' contention that Article 23(1) of the Federal Law on International Treaties provides blanket legislative approval for the Russian Government to provisionally apply all treaties, including the ECT, is equally unavailing. Article 23(1) is merely a restatement of Article 25(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which, uncontroversially, provides that a treaty may be provisionally applied pending its entry into force if, and under the conditions, agreed in the treaty.\n\n23. Claimants' blanket-approval argument proves too much and is inconsistent with State practice. If Article 23 of the Federal Law on International Treaties constitutes blanket approval for the Treaty's provisional application, then (a) so does Article 25 of the Vienna Convention, and (b) no party to the Vienna Convention would have found provisional application of the Treaty problematic or have invoked the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1). Claimants' view notwithstanding, nine States party to the Vienna Convention deposited declarations under Article 45(2)(a) of the Treaty that they could not accept its provisional application, and four States party to the Vienna Convention stated at the signature conference that they could not apply the Treaty, relying on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1).\n\n24. Claimants also contend that Article 23 of the Law on International Treaties shows Russian law and treaty practice to be \"perfectly familiar\" with the concept of provisional application. The Russian Federation's familiarity with provisional application cannot, however, override the express inconsistency clause contained in Article 45(1).\n\n25. Claimants mistakenly rely on general statements made by Russian politicians and officials as to the salutary effect of the Treaty, the Russian Federation's practice with respect to bilateral investment treaties, the Explanatory Note to the draft federal law providing for ratification of the Treaty, and a draft document of unknown origin and authorship.\n\n26. General statements made by certain Russian politicians and officials as to the Treaty's benefits are manifestly not a formal or even informal expression of the Russian Federation's views with respect to the scope of the provisional application of the Treaty, and are directly at odds with the Russian Federation's continuing refusal to ratify the Treaty.\n\n27. The Russian Federation's bilateral investment treaty practice not only does not support Claimants' position, it affirmatively undermines their argument. All of the bilateral investment treaties cited by Claimants were ratified by the Russian Federation, and none of them provides for provisional application prior to ratification. It is undisputed that Claimants have not invoked any of the Russian Federation's bilateral investment treaties. That these treaties, following ratification, provide for mandatory investor-State dispute settlement is irrelevant to the preratification consistency-analysis required under Article 45(1).\n\n28. Several explanatory notes prepared in connection with the ratification of Russian bilateral investment treaties state that these treaties are subject to ratification because they contain \"provisions different from those provided by Russian legislation,\" singling out the investor-State arbitration provisions, among others. The Russian Federation's bilateral investment treaty practice thus confirms (a) that mandatory investor-State arbitration is not merely \"additional\" to Russian law, as Claimants contend, but is inconsistent with Russian law, and (b) that application of Article 26 prior to ratification would be inconsistent with Russia's Constitution and laws.\n\n29. The Explanatory Note to the draft federal law on the ratification of the Treaty states that \"provisional application of the ECT would be implemented to the extent that it would not be inconsistent with the constitution, laws and regulations of the country in question.\" The Note thus appropriately concludes, in reliance on the \"to the extent\" clause contained in Article 45(1), that \"the provisions on provisional application were in conformity with Russian legal acts.\" As with most Russian explanatory notes, the ECT Explanatory Note does not contain a detailed or comprehensive analysis of the consistency of the Treaty's provisions with Russian law. The dispute settlement provisions are not mentioned at all, let alone analyzed.\n\n30. The statement in the Explanatory Note that \"The provisions of the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation,\" relied on by Claimants, is a correct statement of Russian law from the post-ratification perspective of the Note, and does not aid in the analysis of the pre-ratification consistency of the Treaty with domestic law, required under Article 45(1). That the Note analyzes the state of Russia's legal affairs following ratification is clear from other statements in the Note, including the need for GATT-related legislation to be enacted and Russia's customs laws to be amended, developments that would manifestly be \"consistent\" with Russia's domestic law only post-ratification. Although the Note does not address the Treaty's dispute settlement mechanism, the Note does state that the ECT is \"consistent with the provisions of Russian bilateral investment treaties,\" and that inconsistencies between Treaty provisions and Russian domestic law would be resolved by ratification. It will be recalled that the Russian Federation's bilateral investment treaties, like the Treaty, provide for mandatory investor-State arbitration, and are likewise subject to ratification because their dispute settlement mechanism is inconsistent with domestic Russian law.\n\n31. Claimants also rely heavily on a draft document of unknown origin and authorship, referred to by Claimants as the \"Russian Note\" even though there is no evidence that this document was prepared, let alone adopted, by the Russian authorities, and overwhelming evidence that the document was never distributed at the session of the Energy Charter Conference identified by Claimants. There is, in any event, nothing in the document at odds with the Russian Federation's position that the Treaty is to be provisionally applied only to the extent consistent with Russian domestic law, and that Article 26 is inconsistent with Russian law.\n\nD. The Claims are Based on Taxation Measures Other than Taxes and are thus Barred under Article 21 of the Treaty\n\n32. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or, alternatively, Claimants' claims are inadmissible, because (a) the Treaty does not create any rights or obligations with respect to Taxation Measures (with enumerated exceptions), (b) the claims in these proceedings are based on Taxation Measures, and (c) none of the enumerated exceptions is applicable to the claims asserted by Claimants in these proceedings.\n\n33. Article 21(1) of the ECT provides that \"nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties,\" except as otherwise provided in the sub-sections to that Article. The same Article further provides, \"In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\"\n\n34. Taxation Measures include not only tax laws and regulations, as Claimants contend, but also measures relating to taxes, including the imposition, administration, collection and enforcement of taxes.\n\n35. The plain meaning of Article 21 requires a broad and inclusive interpretation of Taxation Measures. Article 21(7)(a) states, \"The term \u2018Taxation Measure' includes (i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party.\" The quoted text confirms that Taxation Measures was intended to have broad and inclusive scope, covering \" *any* provision *relating* to taxes.\" Had the drafters intended to limit Taxation Measures solely to the (already broad) provisions referred to in Article 21(7), they would have instead provided that Taxation Measures \"means\" (rather than \"includes\") the referenced provisions.\n\n36. Articles 21(3) and (6) make clear that Taxation Measures cover not only tax laws and regulations, but also a State's imposition and collection of taxes. Article 21(3) gives preferential treatment to \"any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes.\" The \"collection of taxes\" is clearly a subset of the broader class of Taxation Measures. Article 21(6) confirms that Taxation Measures include not only the collection of taxes, but also their imposition. This Article provides, \"For the avoidance of doubt, Article 14 [dealing with an Investor's right to transfer capital, returns and other payments] shall not limit the right of a Contracting Party to impose or collect a tax by withholding or other means.\"\n\n37. The object and purpose of Article 21 supports the Russian Federation's interpretation. States are understandably concerned about possible limitations on their ability to raise revenue. A State's right to promulgate tax laws and regulations is meaningless unless the State also has the right to collect, administer and enforce its tax laws and regulations. The Russian Federation's interpretation is consistent with the purpose intended to be served by Article 21\u2014to protect a State's right to promulgate and enforce its tax laws, and to avoid interference with tax treaties specifically intended to address these issues.\n\n38. The Russian Federation's interpretation of Taxation Measures is supported by other tribunals, and by the testimony of Mr. Stephen Knipler, the executive officer of the International Tax Division of Australia's Tax Office during the ECT negotiations, and of Professor Daniel Berman, the Legislation Counsel to the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation, during the same period. Claimants have not offered any reason or basis for not crediting Mr. Knipler's testimony that Taxation Measures includes measures relating to taxes, and, in particular, the imposition, administration, collection or enforcement of taxes.\n\n39. Claimants' reliance on the exception to Article 21(1) contained in Article 21(5) is misplaced. Article 21(5) states that Article 13, dealing with expropriation, \"shall apply to taxes.\" It is an established rule of treaty interpretation that different treaty terms are intended to refer to different matters. Article 21(5) refers to \"taxes,\" meaning a State's tax laws and regulations, and not to Taxation Measures, a broader term that \"includes\" not only \"taxes\" but also \"any provision relating to taxes.\" Claimants' contrary argument, based on the French text of the Treaty\u2014that \"taxes\" is either a broader term or interchangeable with \"Taxation Measures\"\u2014is inconsistent with the text of the Treaty, and ignores both the fact that the Treaty's tax provisions were negotiated exclusively in English (not French) and the considerable authority that gives primacy to the original (here, English) text, even in cases where several texts are equally authentic.\n\n40. Claimants' reliance on the exception to Article 21(1) contained in Article 21(3) is likewise unavailing. Article 21(3) provides that Articles 10(2) and (7) \"shall apply to Taxation Measures,\" with two enumerated exceptions. Claimants, however, have never asserted a claim under either Article 10(2) or Article 10(7).\n\n41. Claimants' procedural objections to this defense are not well founded. Respondent's Statement of Defense expressly objected to jurisdiction, as required by UNCITRAL Rule 21(3), and even though not so required, also put Claimants on notice of the Taxation Measures carve-out contained in Article 21(1). The cases cited on this issue by Claimants are clearly distinguishable.\n\nE. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction *Ratione Personae* and *Materiae*\n\n42. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *materiae* (a) because Claimants are shell companies, (b) because Claimants are owned and controlled by Russian oligarchs, including Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and other Russian nationals, and (c) because Claimants are mere nominees who do not own or control the Yukos shares that are the subject of these proceedings.\n\n43. The Russian oligarchs (Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, among others) have publicly conceded in newspaper interviews and in other legal proceedings that they effectively own and control Claimants' nominal investment in Yukos. In the case of Veteran Petroleum Limited (\"VPL\"), the Swiss *Premi\u00e8re Cour de Droit Public* has found that Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Golubovitch, Nevzlin, Doubov, Brudno and Chakhnovski are the beneficial owners of the totality of Yukos shares allegedly owned or controlled by VPL. VPL has also failed to establish that it was even a Yukos registered shareholder when VPL filed its request for arbitration.\n\n44. The remaining Yukos shares at issue are also only nominally owned by Yukos Universal Limited and Hulley Enterprises Limited. Both Yukos Universal Limited and Hulley Enterprises Limited are totally dominated by the Russian oligarchs through multiple off-shore shells, for which no *bona fide* purpose is discernable. In large part because of Claimants' less than full compliance with the Tribunal's document production orders, the Tribunal does not now have before it a complete account of the relations between these intermediate legal entities. It is nonetheless clear that one of the principal purposes of the complex legal structure adopted at the Russian oligarchs' behest was to render opaque, but preserve, the oligarchs' continuing *de facto* ownership and control of the Yukos shares. In furtherance of this goal, the oligarchs interposed into the chain of nominal ownership and control legal entities and individuals who appeared to receive limited indicia of ownership and/or control, but who in fact acquired no genuine ownership interest in any of the relevant assets, nor any powers that would diminish the Russian oligarchs' continued effective control in fact over those assets.\n\n45. Claimants have separately acknowledged that they have \"no substantial business activity\" in their countries of incorporation.\n\n46. The object and purpose of the Treaty is to promote and protect foreign investments and foreign investors. The Treaty was never intended to protect Russian investors investing in Russia, and does not provide a remedy for host State nationals. Under \"rules and principles of international law\" applicable to this proceeding under Article 26(6) of the Treaty, a shell company dominated and controlled by host State nationals has no right to bring a claim against the host State. Like other fundamental principles of customary international law, the rule that nationals of a State may not assert an international claim against their own State cannot be dispensed with tacitly.\n\n47. Granting shell companies protection under the Treaty would also be inconsistent with Russian law. As a result of its ratification, the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is now an integral part of Russian law and of the framework for trade, business, and investment conducted by EU companies in Russia. Claimants, EU shell companies lacking the \"real and continuous link with the economy\" of an EU Member State required by Article 30(h) of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, are thus not entitled to protection as investors under Russian law. Insofar as matters covered by the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement are also covered by the Treaty, Article 105 of the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides that the Treaty's provisions shall apply, but not until the Treaty comes into force for the Russian Federation, which has not happened.\n\n48. The Russian Federation's veil-piercing defenses lead to the same conclusion. In accordance with the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 3 of 31 October 2006, these issues are not addressed here.\n\n49. Under Article 1(6) of the Treaty, the Yukos shares that are the subject of these proceedings must be \"owned or controlled\" by Claimants. The Understanding with respect to Article 1(6) adopted upon signature of the Treaty is that \"control of an Investment means control in fact.\" Claimants apparently concede that they do not meet this standard, and instead rely on their nominal ownership of the Yukos shares. Nominal ownership is insufficient to establish ownership of an \"Investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the Treaty or *ius standi* under \"applicable rules and principles of international law.\"\n\nF. The Claims are Inadmissible Because Part III of the Treaty Does\n\nNot Confer Rights on Claimants\n\n50. Article 17 of the Treaty reserves the right to deny the Treaty's benefits to companies owned or controlled by nationals of a third State that do not have substantial business activity in their country of incorporation. Each of the Claimants is a shell company lacking substantial business activity in its country of incorporation.\n\n51. Claimants' contention that host State parties are not third State nationals is unavailing. If Treaty benefits may be denied to third State nationals, *a fortiori* they may be denied to host State nationals. In any event, the term \"third State,\" which is not defined in the Treaty, is used there in a manner that does not exclude the possibility that a third State may be a Contracting Party or a signatory, and a majority in interest of the \"Russian\" oligarchs are in fact nationals of Israel, a \"third\" State.\n\n52. The Treaty's object and purpose also support the denial of benefits to host State nationals. Claimants' argument notwithstanding, no notification to Contracting Parties is required in order to invoke Article 17(1), and even if notification were required, the Russian Federation exercised its right to deny Treaty benefits to EU shell companies such as Claimants by ratifying and publishing the EU-Russian Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.\n\nG. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Disputes Submitted to Russian Courts or to the European Court of Human Rights\n\n53. Each of the Russian oligarchs who owns and controls Claimants, including in particular Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, has brought complaints before the European Court of Human Rights containing allegations that overlap with those raised by Claimants in these proceedings. Lawsuits have also been brought before Russian courts against the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation and other Russian State bodies based, *inter alia*, on alleged violations of \"applicable principles and norms of international law\", including the European Convention on Human Rights. The fork-in-the-road clause contained in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the Treaty precludes these investors from re-litigating in these arbitrations disputes that have already been submitted to the European Court of Human Rights or to a Russian court. Claimants are in effect requesting the Tribunal to sit above the Russian Supreme Court and the Russian courts of appeal that have previously heard and issued final rulings in respect of the same allegations made by Claimants in these arbitrations.\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs 13 to 47 of Claimants' Skeleton Argument submitted on 10 November 2008 (with footnotes omitted).\n\nIII. The Russian Federation is Bound by the ECT\u2014Article 45\n\n13. The Russian Federation contends that it is not bound by the ECT. As a starting point, the Russian Federation argues that the provisional application of treaties does not give rise to legally enforceable rights and obligations. Its chief contention, however, is based on Article 45(1) of the ECT, which it alleges provides for the partial application of the Treaty provisions by virtue of the so-called \"inconsistency clause\". The Russian Federation claims that it is not bound by the ECT as regards the Claimants in these arbitrations because the application of every relevant provision of the ECT, including Article 45 itself, would be inconsistent with the Russian Federation's Constitution, laws or regulations. The Russian Federation's interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT, which sets out the regime of provisional application under the Treaty, is fundamentally flawed and should be rejected. In any event, the ECT is not inconsistent with the Russian Federation's Constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n14. *Provisional application of treaties creates legally enforceable rights and obligations under international law:* Provisional application is a well-established treaty mechanism creating legally enforceable rights and obligations under international law. The Respondent is all the more familiar with these principles in that the Russian Federation and its predecessor, the USSR, have a long-standing practice of provisionally applying treaties so as to give rise to legally enforceable rights and obligations. Thirty-two international treaties entered into by the Russian Federation, including the ECT, are today provisionally applicable. The Russian Federation's suggestion that provisional application is some kind of legal anomaly, without legal effect, has no basis whatsoever and must fail.\n\n15. *The plain language of Article 45 of the ECT provides for* *automatic provisional application of the Treaty unless a* *specific signatory decides to opt out from such provisional application* : Article 45(1) of the ECT establishes the principle of provisional application, while the remainder of Article 45 sets out its operation. In particular, under Article 45(2), any signatory that is not able to accept provisional application can decide to opt out from such provisional application at the time of signature by making a declaration to that effect. This interpretation is based on the plain language of Article 45 of the ECT, and is confirmed by its context and the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty. The Russian Federation's interpretation, which would dissociate Article 45(1) from Article 45(2) so as to create two separate regimes in which a signatory State may choose whether or not it is bound by provisional application depending on whether or not it is party to a dispute with an investor, is entirely unsubstantiated. The Russian Federation's interpretation further ignores the fundamental safeguard of reciprocity contained in Article 45(2)(b) of the ECT and, if given effect, would mean that a signatory State can invoke all rights under the Treaty while escaping any obligations by merely relying on the \"inconsistency clause\" in Article 45(1). Such a position is untenable and must be rejected.\n\n16. *Subsidiarily, the need for a declaration under Article 45(1):* In any event, even assuming that the interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT as proposed by the Russian Federation were the correct interpretation, which the Claimants deny, a declaration is still needed in order for a signatory State to opt out of provisional application under Article 45(1). This is clear from the text of Article 45, and the circumstances of its negotiation and conclusion. It is further confirmed by the fact that all signatory States that expressed concerns regarding provisional application made a declaration with a view to avoiding the application of the Treaty, be it on the basis of Article 45(2) or Article 45(1). Therefore, even under the Respondent's own interpretation, a declaration is needed for a signatory State to opt out of provisional application on the basis of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of Article 45 of the ECT. As the Russian Federation has not notified its counterparties of any inconsistency of the Treaty with its Constitution, laws or regulations, under either paragraph, it cannot claim that it is not bound by the Treaty.\n\n17. *In any event, the ECT is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation:* Even assuming that the interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT as proposed by the Russian Federation were the correct interpretation, which the Claimants deny, and that a declaration in relation to Article 45(1) is not required, contrary to the Claimants' submissions, the ECT is not inconsistent with the Russian Federation's Constitution, laws or regulations. Russian law fully recognizes the principle of provisional application, and there is no inconsistency between the substantive provisions of the Treaty and Russian law either. To the contrary, at all times\u2014during the negotiation of the ECT, at the time of its proposed ratification by the Duma, and subsequently\u2014the Russian Federation has maintained and represented that both the mechanism of provisional application and the provisions of the Treaty are consistent with its Constitution, laws and regulations.\n\n18. It follows that, under Articles 45 of the ECT, the Russian Federation is bound by the Treaty.\n\nIV. The Claimants Qualify as Protected Investors Under the ECT\u2014 Article 1(7)\n\n19. The Russian Federation contends that the Claimants are not protected Investors under the ECT, relying on a host of allegations including that the Claimants are allegedly shell companies owned or controlled by Russian nationals. The Russian Federation's arguments are misplaced and must fail.\n\n20. *The* definition *of Investor under the ECT:* Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT defines \"Investor\" as, with respect to a Contracting Party, \"a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party\".\n\n21. *The Claimants are organized in accordance with the law* *applicable* in Contracting *States:* The Claimants are companies organized in accordance with the law applicable in Cyprus, in the cases of Hulley and VPL, and the Isle of Man, in the case of YUL, and therefore meet the requirements of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT.\n\n22. *Express* treaty *language cannot be overridden by alleged general principles of law:* The Russian Federation does not dispute that the Claimants are companies organized in accordance with the law applicable in Contracting States. It claims, however, that the Claimants' nationality should be ignored based on vague and unsubstantiated principles of international law. There is no basis in international law for ignoring the corporate nationality of the Claimants. The language of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT is clear and determinative in this regard and, contrary to the Respondent's submission, it is not for this Tribunal to ignore the express language of the Treaty itself. In any event, reference to the state of incorporation is the most common method of defining the nationality of corporate entities under modern BITs and international law.\n\n23. It is clear from the foregoing that the Claimants are protected Investors under the ECT and the Respondent's attempts to suggest otherwise must fail.\n\nV. The Claimants Have a Protected Investment under the ECT\u2014 Article 1(6)\n\n24. The Russian Federation contends that the Claimants do not have protected Investments under the ECT alleging, amongst other things, that the Claimants did not inject any foreign capital into the Russian Federation in connection with their acquisition of Yukos shares. The Russian Federation's arguments are without merit and must fail.\n\n25. *The* definition *of an Investment under the ECT:* \"Investment\" is defined in Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT as \"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes [...] a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise\".\n\n26. *The Claimants own shares in Yukos:* As shareholders of Yukos at all relevant times for the purposes of these arbitrations, the Claimants directly own protected Investments and therefore meet the requirements of Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.\n\n27. *The Russian Federation's unpersuasive argument on the alleged lack of \u2018injection of foreign capital':* It cannot be disputed that the Claimants have directly owned Yukos shares at all material times. This, in fact, is not disputed by the Respondent. The Claimants therefore hold protected Investments within the definition provided by Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT. The language of Article 1(6)(b) is clear and determinative in this regard and the Russian Federation's attempt to insert additional requirements regarding \"origin of capital\" or \"injection of foreign capital\" finds no support in the text of the definition of Investment, nor in the context in which the term is defined.\n\n28. The Claimants undeniably hold protected Investments under the ECT, and the Russian Federation's numerous and unsubstantiated attempts to override the plain language of the Treaty must be rejected.\n\nVI. The Conditions for a Denial of the Benefits of Part III of the ECT to Each of the Claimants are not Met\n\n29. The Russian Federation argues that the Claimants should be denied the benefits of Part III of the ECT on the basis of Article 17, and that these arbitrations are nothing but a domestic dispute between Russian nationals and the Russian Federation. As shown below, the cumulative conditions for a denial of the benefits of Part III of the ECT are not met and each of the Claimants fully benefits from the protection of the Treaty.\n\n30. *Article 17 is a reservation of right which must be exercised:* Article 17 provides that each Contracting Party \"reserves the right\" to deny the benefits of Part III. It follows from the plain meaning of these words that each Contracting Party has a right under Article 17(1) of the ECT to deny a covered investor the benefits of Part III; but as long as that right has not been exercised the investor benefits from the protection of Part III of the ECT. That the right to deny the benefits of Part III is an option that needs to be exercised by a Contracting Party is confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty. Further, if a Contracting Party is to exercise its reserved right under Article 17(1) of the ECT, it must do so by a clear and unambiguous act. Contrary to the Respondent's contention, Article 17(1) of the ECT does not therefore operate automatically. As the Russian Federation did not exercise its reserved right to effectively deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT to each of the Claimants, Article 17(1) does not apply in these arbitrations.\n\n31. *Once exercised, the right of denial only operates prospectively:* In any event, even assuming that the Russian Federation has effectively exercised its reserved right to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT to each of the Claimants in its First Memorial of February 28, 2006, which the Claimants deny, the Russian Federation does not challenge that such exercise can only operate prospectively and cannot have a retroactive effect, *i.e.* it can only have effect on new wrongful acts occurring after the date on which the reserved right has been effectively exercised, as opposed to the mere continuation of previous wrongful acts.\n\n32. *The Claimants are not owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third State:* In any event, even assuming that the Russian Federation has effectively exercised its reserved right to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT to each of the Claimants, which the Claimants deny, Article 17(1) of the ECT still cannot apply because the cumulative conditions for the Russian Federation to exercise its right under Article 17 are not met, *i.e.* the Claimants are not owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third State. Hulley is a wholly-owned subsidiary of YUL, a company incorporated in the Isle of Man. YUL, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GML Limited, a company incorporated in Gibraltar. GML Limited is owned by Palmus Trust Company Limited (Guernsey) (as trustee for the Palmus Trust) and Rysaffe Trustee Company (C.I.) Limited (as trustees for the remaining Guernsey Trusts). Likewise, VPL is owned by Chiltern Trust Company Limited (Jersey) (as trustee of the Veteran Petroleum Trust). The Claimants are therefore not owned by Russian nationals. Nor are they controlled by Russian nationals since control in each of the Trusts resides with the relevant trustees for the benefit of Russian nationals as regards the Guernsey Trusts and for the benefit of YUL and former Yukos employees as regards the Veteran Petroleum Trust. As a result, the Claimants are not \"owned or controlled\" by Russian nationals.\n\n33. *The Russian Federation is not a third State under the ECT:*\n\nEven assuming that the Claimants are owned or controlled by Russian nationals, which the Claimants deny, the Russian Federation is not a \"third State\" under the ECT. It is plain that \"third State\" in Article 17(1) refers to a non-Contracting Party under the ECT and this is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, as well as the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT. By contrast, when contracting States intend to exclude the benefits of an investment protection regime to entities controlled by nationals of the host State, they so provide expressly. This was not done by the ECT drafters. The Russian Federation, which is bound by the ECT, cannot therefore claim to be a \"third State\" for the purposes of Article 17(1).\n\n34. It results from the above that the cumulative conditions for the application of Article 17 of the ECT are not met and the Respondent's objection must fail.\n\nVII. The Russian Federation's Other Unavailing Objections\u2014 Articles 26 and 21\n\nA. The Claimants' *Jus Standi*\n\n35. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants lack *jus standi* because they are supposedly enforcing a claim that properly belongs to Yukos.\n\n36. This is plainly wrong as a matter of fact. The Claimants do not purport to enforce rights belonging to Yukos but are enforcing their own rights arising under the ECT as shareholders.\n\n37. The Respondent's objection is also wrong as a matter of law. The distinction between the rights of a shareholder arising under an investment treaty and the rights that belong to the local company is well-established in international law. The Russian Federation's attempt to rely on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) of the ECT to argue that shareholders lack standing under Russian law to bring claims for injuries to companies in which they own shares is equally misplaced. As demonstrated above, the Russian Federation's \"inconsistency clause\" theory is without merit because both the principle of provisional application and the provisions of the Treaty are consistent with Russian law. Even assuming that Russian law is somehow relevant, which the Claimants deny, it is difficult to see how the alleged lack of a statutory right under Russian law could deprive the Claimants of standing under the ECT, except to demonstrate just how outlandish and all-encompassing the Respondent's theory of Article 45(1) is.\n\n38. The Respondent's objection is ill-founded and must fail.\n\nB. Fork-in-the-Road\u2014Article 26\n\n39. The Russian Federation contends that there exist a very large number of cases that have been brought by or on behalf of Yukos or by the \"Russian oligarchs\" themselves in the Russian courts and the ECHR in which the actions complained of in these arbitrations were subjected to judicial review. On that basis, the Russian Federation contends the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide the Claimants' claims pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT. The Respondent's contention is entirely groundless and must fail.\n\n40. None of the proceedings relied on by the Russian Federation satisfy any of the cumulative conditions set out in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, the so-called fork-in-the-road provision: (i) the Claimants in these arbitrations are not parties to any of the proceedings cited by the Russian Federation; (ii) none of the proceedings cited by the Russian Federation concern an alleged breach of Part III of the ECT; and (iii) the Claimants have not submitted these claims to any \"previously agreed dispute settlement procedure\" or to the Russian courts.\n\n41. The Russian's Federation's objection based on Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT is manifestly without merit and must fail.\n\nC. Taxation Measures\u2014Article 21\n\n42. The Russian Federation contends that the Claimants' claims are premised on Taxation Measures and therefore fall within the exemption of Article 21(1) of the ECT. The Respondent's objection based on the taxation provision of the ECT, which it now appears to raise as an objection to jurisdiction, fails in a number of respects.\n\n43. *The Respondent's jurisdictional objection is time-barred:* For the first time in its Reply, the Russian Federation sought to state a jurisdictional objection based on Article 21(1), contending that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the phrase \"nothing in this Treaty\" in that provision allegedly excludes the Russian Federation's \"offer to arbitrate [in] Article 26\" of the ECT. To the extent that the Respondent's objection based on Article 21(1) of the ECT is stated as a jurisdictional objection, it is time-barred under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules which provides that an objection to jurisdiction is to be made no later than in the statement of defence.\n\n44. *Article 21 applies to the enactment of tax \"provisions\":*\n\nFurther, in any event, even assuming that the Russian Federation is entitled to base a preliminary objection on Article 21 of the ECT, which the Claimants deny, it does not apply here. It is clear that under Article 21 of the ECT a Taxation Measure, as this term is specifically defined in paragraph (7), is an actual \"provision\" relating to taxes, be it found in domestic law or in a tax treaty, nothing else. Article 21 therefore preserves the liberty of each Contracting State to enact legislation and regulations relating to taxes and the Respondent's numerous attempts to distort and expand the scope of this definition to enforcement actions find no support in the text of the Treaty itself. Because the Russian Federation's right to enact tax \"provisions\" is not at issue in these arbitrations, Article 21(1) of the ECT does not apply to the Claimants' claims.\n\n45. *Articles 13 and 10 expressly apply to Taxation Measures:*\n\nEven assuming that Taxation Measures have the meaning given to them by the Respondent, which the Claimants deny, the Russian Federation conveniently ignores that the Treaty's substantive investment protections contained in Articles 13, 10(2) and 10(7) apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties by virtue of Articles 21(5) and 21(3), respectively, and that expropriatory or discriminatory actions are sanctioned under the Treaty even where they relate to Taxation Measures.\n\n46. *Conduct under the guise of taxation not covered:* In any event, assuming that Taxation Measures have the meaning given to them by the Respondent, which the Claimants deny, the actions complained of by the Claimants do not fall within the scope of Article 21 because they are not genuine Taxation Measures. Indeed, the Russian Federation's actions were not a genuine exercise of the Russian State's prerogative to impose taxes, but merely a pretext for the Russian Federation's expropriation of Yukos' assets to the benefit of State-owned entities. Further, the Russian Federation feigns to ignore that a significant part of the acts complained of by the Claimants have no relation whatsoever to taxation.\n\n47. The Russian Federation's objection based on Article 21 of the ECT is therefore ill-founded and must fail.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Russian Federation requests that the Tribunal issue an award:\n\n(a) determining that it lacks jurisdiction to entertain the claims brought by Claimant;\n\n(b) in the alternative, determining that all claims brought by Claimant are inadmissible;\n\n(c) in the alternative, determining that all claims relating to Taxation Measures other than those, if any, based solely on taxes are inadmissible;\n\n(d) in the alternative, determining that all claims relating to taxes, if any, must be referred to the competent authorities pursuant to Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the Treaty;\n\n(e) ordering Claimant to pay all of the Russian Federation's costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees; and\n\n(f) granting any further relief against Claimant that the Tribunal deems fit and proper.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal:\n\n(a) to render an award determining that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought by Claimant and that such claims are admissible\n\n(b) to order Respondent to pay all of Claimant's costs, including its legal fees and expenses; and\n\n(c) To order any other relief that may be appropriate.\n\n**V. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe procedural law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the procedural provisions of the ECT (particularly Article 26), the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and, because The Hague is the place of arbitration, any mandatory provisions of Dutch arbitration law. This Interim Award is made pursuant to Article 1049 of the *Netherlands Arbitration Act 1986*.\n\n76.\n\nThe substantive law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the substantive provisions of the ECT, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties3 (\" **VCLT** \"), and applicable rules and principles of international law. In addition to the foregoing sources, the national law of the Russian Federation is relevant with regard to certain issues, as is the national law of the places in which Claimants and/or related entities are incorporated or established.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Vienna, 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331.\n\n77.\n\nThroughout this Interim Award, the Tribunal refers to and analyzes specific provisions of the ECT. For ease of reference, the key relevant provisions are also collected and reproduced below, in the order that they appear in the Treaty:\n\n**Article 1\u2014Definitions**\n\n[...]\n\n(6) Investment\" means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:\n\n(a) tangible and intangible, and moveable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;\n\n(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;\n\n(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment;\n\n(d) Intellectual Property;\n\n(e) Returns;\n\n(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.\n\n[...]\n\n(7) \"Investor\" means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state,\" a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 17\u2014Non-Application of Part III in Certain Circumstances**\n\nEach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized;\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 21\u2014Taxation**\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n(2) Article 7(3) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income or on capital, except that such provision shall not apply to:\n\n(a) an advantage accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii); or\n\n(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes, except where the measure of a Contracting Party arbitrarily discriminates against Energy Materials and Products originating in, or destined for the Area of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under Article 7(3).\n\n(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that such provisions shall not apply to:\n\n(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic Integration Organization; or\n\n(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes, except where the measure arbitrarily discriminates against an Investor of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under the Investment provisions of this Treaty.\n\n(4) Article 29(2) to (6) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income or on capital.\n\n(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where non-discrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the nondiscrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the expiry of the six-month period;\n\n(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.\n\n(6) For the avoidance of doubt, Article 14 shall not limit the right of a Contracting Party to impose or collect a tax by withholding or other means.\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Article:\n\n(a) The term \"Taxation Measure\" includes:\n\n(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and\n\n(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\n\n(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.\n\n(c) A \"Competent Tax Authority\" means the competent authority pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorized representatives.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"tax provisions\" and \"taxes\" do not include customs duties.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 26\u2014Settlement of Disputes Between an Investor and a Contracting Party**\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:\n\n[...]\n\n(b) a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (hereinafter referred to as \"UNCITRAL\")\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 45\u2014Provisional Application**\n\n(1) Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n(2) (a) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) any signatory may, when signing, deliver to the Depository a declaration that it is not able to accept provisional application. The obligation contained in paragraph (1) shall not apply to a signatory making such a declaration. Any such signatory may at any time withdraw that declaration by written notification to the Depository.\n\n(b) Neither a signatory which makes a declaration in accordance with subparagraph (a) nor Investors of that signatory may claim the benefits of provisional application under paragraph (1).\n\n(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any signatory making a declaration referred to in subparagraph (a) shall apply Part VII provisionally pending the entry into force of the Treaty for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its laws or regulations.\n\n(3) (a) Any signatory may terminate its provisional application of this Treaty by written notification to the Depository of its intention not to become a Contracting Party to the Treaty.

A signatory shall be removed from the list in Annex PA effective upon delivery to the Depository of its request therefor.\n\n**VI. SUMMARY OF WITNESSES' TESTIMONY**\n---------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Parties submitted extensive evidence relevant to the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility. Respondent submitted statements or opinions from 19 witnesses, while Claimants submitted opinions from four witnesses. In all, the Tribunal has reviewed over 795 pages of written testimony, as well as hundreds of exhibits.\n\n79.\n\nThe purpose of the present section of the Tribunal's Interim Award is to provide an overview of the witnesses' evidence. The following is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it serves to provide a summary of the vast evidentiary universe on the basis of which the Tribunal has reached its conclusions with respect to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the evidence of those witnesses that were cross-examined as well as those witnesses who submitted written statements but were not called to the hearing. With respect to this latter category, the Tribunal has kept in mind that these witnesses were not subject to any cross-examination.\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S WITNESSES**\n-----------------------------\n\n81.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimants called five of Respondent's 19 witnesses. They were:\n\n1) Professor Suren Avakiyan\n\n2) Mr. Sydney Fremantle\n\n3) Mr. Anatoly Martynov\n\n4) Mr. Martin Mann, QC\n\n5) Professor Daniel Berman\n\n82.\n\nRespondent's other witnesses, who did not appear for cross-examination, were:\n\n6) Dr. Marat Baglay\n\n7) Professor Martti Koskenniemi\n\n8) Professor Alexey Kostin\n\n9) Professor Yevgeny Sukhanov\n\n10) Professor Gerhard Hafner\n\n11) Professor Igor Lukashuk\n\n12) Mr. S.V. Vasilyvev, on behalf of the Russian Ministry of Justice\n\n13) Professor Georg Nolte\n\n14) Professor Angelika Nussberger\n\n15) Professor Alain Pellet\n\n16) Mr. Stephen Knipler\n\n17) Professor Myron Nordquist\n\n18) Professor Andrey Lisitsyn-Svetlanov\n\n19) Professor Stef van Weeghel\n\n83.\n\nThe following summary will first address the testimony of Respondent's witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal, in order of appearance. This is followed by a review of the evidence from Respondent's witnesses who did not appear.\n\n**1. Professor Suren Avakiyan**\n-------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nProfessor Avakiyan is the head of the Department of Constitutional and Municipal Law of the Faculty of Law of the Moscow State University of M.V. Lomonosov.\n\n85.\n\nIn his Expert Opinion,4 Professor Avakiyan explains the relationship between the 1993 *Constitution of the Russian Federation* (\" **Constitution** \") and international treaties of the Russian Federation. He concludes that the Russian Federation may not conclude international treaties whose provisions contradict the Constitution and would require its amendment. Professor Avakiyan explains that any treaty that annuls, modifies, or adds provisions to Russian legislation must be ratified in order to become effective. He then explains the ratification process for international treaties in the Russian Federation.\n\nProfessor Suren Avakiyan, *Expert Opinion on the Constitutional Legal Aspects of the Conclusion and Application of International Treaties of the Russian Federation*, 21 February 2006.\n\n86.\n\nProfessor Avakiyan summarizes his conclusions as follows: (a) a federal law on ratification gives an international treaty the force of law in the territory of the Russian Federation; (b) in the absence of relevant domestic rules implementing an international treaty that has been ratified and has become effective, the rules of the treaty apply directly; and (c) the application, prior to its ratification, of an international treaty that is subject to ratification contradicts the Constitution.\n\n87.\n\nWith respect to the ECT, Professor Avakiyan testifies that its application is impossible without simultaneous and numerous amendments to Russian legislation. Pursuant to the Constitution, the ECT is subject to ratification by the Federal Assembly; provisional application of the ECT and, in particular, of its dispute-resolution provisions without such ratification would be inconsistent with the Constitution.\n\n88.\n\nIn his Second Opinion,5 Professor Avakiyan comments on the Opinion of Claimants' expert, Mr. Gladyshev, dated 29 June 2006. In particular, Professor Avakiyan points out that, in his view, the 1995 *Federal Law on International Treaties* of the Russian Federation (\" **FLIT** \") does not allow provisional application of the ECT in the present case, because the ECT was not submitted to the Duma within the six-month deadline established in Article 23(2) of the FLIT.\n\nProfessor Suren Avakiyan, *Expert Comments regarding Expert Opinion of V. Gladyshev dated June 29, 2006*, 19 January 2007.\n\n89.\n\nProfessor Avakiyan appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 17 November 2008.\n\n90.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Professor Avakiyan was taken through the various instruments in the Russian Federation relating to international treaties. Professor Avakiyan stated his belief that international treaties that are subject to ratification should never be applied provisionally. He asserted that Article 23 permits provisional application, but only where a treaty is consistent with and does not require amendments to Russian legislation. He testified that Article 23 of the FLIT should be amended in order to clarify this limitation and avoid any ambiguities.\n\n91.\n\nOn redirect examination, Professor Avakiyan stated that there was no contradiction between Article 45(1) of the ECT and Article 23 of the FLIT. If the Russian Federation wished to apply the ECT to the extent that it did not conflict with Russian legislation, then the ECT needed to be ratified within the required period. He added that those who had signed the ECT had not complied with the provisions of law governing treaty ratification. He went on to say that the ECT contained a large number of provisions that conflicted with Russian legislation, and that therefore the ECT could not apply provisionally save for those few provisions that did not contradict Russian legislation, such as those establishing the logistical procedures for the Secretariat.\n\n**2. Mr. Sydney Fremantle**\n---------------------------\n\n92.\n\nMr. Fremantle retired from the British Civil Service in November 1994, where he had been head of the International Energy Unit in the Department of Trade and Industry for the previous ten years. In this capacity he participated in the negotiations of the Agreement on the International Energy Programme and represented the United Kingdom on, *inter alia*, the International Energy Agency's Governing Board and the European Commission's High Level Energy Group. He participated in preparatory work leading to the creation of the ECT, although he retired about two months before actual signature of the ECT, with some residual involvement through working groups.\n\n93.\n\nIn his Opinion,6 Mr. Fremantle first sets out the working procedures for the ECT negotiations. Mr. Fremantle testifies that while the ECT drew on precedents such as many bilateral investment treaties (\" **BIT** s\"), the North American Free Trade Agreement (\" **NAFTA** \"), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (\" **GATT** \"), there were deliberate departures from the standard provisions of such texts.\n\nMr. Sydney Fremantle, *Opinion Concerning the Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty*, 21 January 2007.\n\n94.\n\nThe conclusions in Mr. Fremantle's Opinion are: (a) Article 45(1) imposes provisional application upon those signatories who have not made a declaration under Article 45(2); (b) the \"to the extent\" clause in Article 45(1) is an integral qualification of the obligation to apply the ECT provisionally; (c) no further action is necessary to qualify the obligation; (d) Article 45(2) enables a signatory to avoid all obligations of the ECT (excluding Part VII) even if not consistent with its internal laws; (e) reciprocity was irrelevant to negotiation of the ECT and impossible to achieve; and (f) transparency would have been of little value to the investor and would add nothing to Article 20 ECT.\n\n95.\n\nMr. Fremantle appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 17 and 18 November 2008.\n\n96.\n\nMr. Fremantle was cross-examined on the \"boldness\" of certain of his statements regarding international law, given that he is not a lawyer. He explained that his opinions were guided by information obtained as a participant in negotiations. He acknowledged that after presentation of the draft to the plenary his own role was less authoritative, but he attended certain plenary sessions until retirement in December 1994 and kept binders of papers in order to write a book.\n\n97.\n\nUpon being shown unredacted versions of documents on which he had relied, Mr. Fremantle confirmed names of those delegations, including Austria, Russia, and the European Union, referred to in his Opinion as having constitutional or other problems making provisional application difficult. Mr. Fremantle testified about his perception of the positions of various delegations on provisional application.\n\n98.\n\nMr. Fremantle further testified that there was a sense of urgency in finalizing the ECT, in the belief that it would help overcome the Russian energy crisis. Urgency was also the motivation behind splitting the treaty into the present ECT, dealing with investments, and a later document (never completed) covering the pre-investment stage. He further agreed that provisional application was also due to a sense of urgency.\n\n99.\n\nMr. Fremantle acknowledged that the ECT established formal reciprocity\u2014protecting the investors of each State party in turn. However, he asserted that while Russia was applying the treaty provisionally, Russian investors could bring claims against other member States even if, due to legal and constitutional inconsistencies, Article 45(1) of the Treaty prevented other investors from invoking the ECT against Russia. Mr. Fremantle was of the view that Russia was applying the ECT provisionally.\n\n100.\n\nMr. Fremantle testified that transparency in identifying inconsistent laws was not possible in relation to Article 45(1) and was \"abandoned\" by the delegates of Working Group II. He acknowledged that Japan continued to seek some transparency discipline as late as February 1994, but abandoned the idea of specifying all inconsistent laws by March 1994.\n\n101.\n\nOn re-examination, Mr. Fremantle described the trade-off between achieving a comprehensive Treaty and having it apply quickly. He explained that because of concerns over inconsistency between the Treaty and domestic laws, some countries would not have been willing to sign the Treaty until conflicting laws had been repealed. Thus, the abandonment of transparency was one of the trade-offs enabling the widespread signature of the ECT.\n\n**3. Mr. Anatoly Martynov**\n---------------------------\n\n102.\n\nMr. Martynov is the head of a private Russian company providing consultancy on trade policy issues. During the period 1992-1994, he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation, as the head of the Legal and Treaty Department. In that capacity, he participated in the negotiations on the ECT and the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation, signed in June 1994 (\" **P&C Agreement** \").\n\n103.\n\nMr. Martynov's evidence was given in support of Respondent's contention that without express consent resulting from ratification of the ECT or from specific Russian legislation, the Russian Federation cannot be involved in dispute settlement through international arbitration.\n\n104.\n\nIn his Statement,7 Mr. Martynov recalls that he and the Russian delegation considered there were two options under Article 45 of the ECT regarding provisional application for States intending to sign the ECT between 17 December 1994 and 16 June 1995:\n\n\u2022 to agree to apply the ECT provisionally under Article 45(1), relying on the limitations imposed in that sub-paragraph by the words \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations\"; or\n\n\u2022 at the moment of signature of the ECT, to deliver a declaration under Article 45(2) of the ECT, that the State is unable to accept its provisional application.\n\nMr. Anatoly Martynov, *Witness Statement concerning the Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty*, 14 December 2006.\n\n105.\n\nMr. Martynov recalls that the Russian delegation considered it possible to propose to the Russian Government provisional application under Article 45(1), relying on the words \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" He explains that this position was motivated by the fact that at the time Russia's economy was in a process of transition, necessitating considerable modification of Russian legislation. The limitation in Article 45(1) would therefore ensure that Russia's obligations under the ECT would be consistent with both existing and future Russian legislation before ratification of the ECT.\n\n106.\n\nMr. Martynov also states that the Russian delegation had a clear understanding that Russia would not be able to apply the international dispute resolution provisions of the ECT. In this regard, he notes that because Russia continues to adhere to the concept of absolute State immunity\u2014as reflected in both the old and new Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation\u2014Russian consent is required in order to be able to bring proceedings against the Russian Federation. He concludes that without express consent resulting from ratification of the ECT or from specific Russian legislation, the Russian Federation cannot be involved in dispute settlement through international arbitration.\n\n107.\n\nLastly, Mr. Martynov asserts that the P&C Agreement was negotiated before the ECT, covered much of the same subject matter and \"anticipated the conclusion of the ECT.\"\n\n108.\n\nMr. Martynov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 19 November 2008.\n\n109.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Mr. Martynov affirmed that he participated in negotiations for the ECT. He further acknowledged that he had been appointed by the Minister for Foreign Economic Relations to be a member of the Russian delegation, which was comprised of representatives of five Russian Ministries. With regard to the negotiation process, he testified that each Ministry would develop its own opinion on an issue, to be submitted to the representative of the Ministry of Energy (as coordinator of the Russian delegation) and coordinated into one draft, except where an issue fell under the competence of the Russian Government, in which case an opinion would be submitted to and approved by the Government. Mr. Martynov testified that draft and final written instructions were generated after each conference or working group session, but that he did not keep copies of the classified reports of the delegations to the Ministry in Moscow generated on issues within his and his Ministry's competence, though he assumed that they were kept at the relevant Ministry or department, or destroyed.\n\n110.\n\nMr. Martynov was then also questioned about the international arbitration provision in Article 26 of the ECT, the difference in meaning between Russian \"arbitrazh\" courts, which are part of the court system, and private courts of arbitration outside the State judicial system. Mr. Martynov confirmed that the *Law on Foreign Investments* referred to resolution of disputes between a foreign investor and the Russian Federation before a non-government body, outside the State judicial court system, for which consent is required.\n\n**4. Mr. Martin Mann, QC**\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nMr. Mann has been in independent practice as a commercial chancery barrister since 1970 and is one of the joint heads of the chambers at XXIV Old Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, London. Mr. Mann provided a First Opinion concerning the Auriga-type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust,8 as well as a First Opinion concerning the Veteran Petroleum Trust (\" **VP Trust** \").9 He also provided a Second Opinion on each of these two categories of trust.10\n\nMr. Martin Mann, QC, *Opinion re Auriga Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust*, 22 January 2007.\n\nMr. Martin Mann, QC, *Opinion re the Veteran Petroleum Trust*, 27 January 2007.\n\nMr. Martin Mann, QC, *Second Opinion re Auriga Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust*, 21 July 2008; *Second Opinion re the Veteran Petroleum Trust*, 21 July 2008.\n\n112.\n\nIn his First Opinion concerning the Auriga-type Trusts and others, Mr. Mann maintains that (a) the trustees of these trusts have no \"control\" over these trusts and have, at most, illusory powers over the GML Limited (\" **GML** \") shares, (b) the trustees did not become beneficial owners of the GML shares, and (c) the trusts in respect of these shares were incompletely constituted and ineffective. Mr. Mann refers to (a) the extensive powers and unfettered discretion of the Protectors in the Auriga-type Trusts and the Palmus Trust; (b) the scope of the Anti-Bartlett provisions in the trust documents; and (c) the Call Options granted to GML in respect of the GML shares settled into the Auriga-type Trusts and the Southern Cross Trust. Finally, Mr. Mann refers to the so-called rule in *Saunders v. Vautier11* in support of the proposition that the trust can be terminated, even though there exist \"discretionary objects,\" and that this affects the trustees' ownership and control of the GML shares.\n\n*Saunders v. Vautier* (1841) 41 Eng. Rep. 482 (Ch.).\n\n113.\n\nIn his First Opinion regarding the VP Trust, Mr. Mann's interpretation of the trust and related documents leads him to the following conclusions:\n\n\u2022 YUL and Yukos can jointly instruct the trustee to vote and/or retransfer the Yukos shares at their discretion and, similarly, can jointly instruct the trustee to retransfer the VPL Shares.\n\n\u2022 Neither VPL nor the trustee is the beneficial owner of the Yukos shares.\n\n114.\n\nIn his Second Opinion regarding the Auriga-type Trusts, in reply to the first written Opinion of Claimants' expert, Mr. Green, QC, Mr. Mann concedes that the trusts are valid by reference to the general law and standard forms and precedents, but opines that the trusts have an impact on control over the GML shares. He asserts that the proper way to address the \"control\" issue is through the following question:\n\nDo the rights within any given trust give the trustee meaningful power through its holding of GML shares over the way in which GML's affairs including its daily business are conducted?\n\n115.\n\nMr. Mann then addresses several key related points:\n\n\u2022 The Protector is not a fiduciary and is not subject to the control of the court in exercising powers that, as in the case of these trusts, he can exercise in his own interests.\n\n\u2022 As a result of the Call Option agreements, the trustees of the Auriga-type Trusts and the Southern Cross Trust can exercise the voting rights attached to the GML shares only in accordance with GML's directions.\n\n\u2022 It is probable that a court would hold that a transfer of shares, bereft of all the rights normally attached to them, does not carry the beneficial interest.\n\n116.\n\nIn his Second Opinion regarding the VP Trust, Mr. Mann makes the following points:\n\n\u2022 The trust purported to be established for the Mezzanine Amount is invalid as being in relation to a future interest, termed in English law an \"expectancy,\" which, under English law, the Court will only enforce if the intended transfer is a transfer for value, which was not the case with the VP Trust.\n\n\u2022 The rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* therefore applies in relation to the Yukos shares, because there are no others, besides YUL, with enforceable rights to the Yukos shares and the fruits of those shares.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Green's \"theories\" regarding impediments to the exercise of the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* are incorrect. In particular:\n\n(a) there is no implied agreement not to terminate the VP Trust;\n\n(b) the Canadian case of *Buschau & National Trust Company v. Rogers Communications Inc.*12 is irrelevant and distinguishable from the facts in this case, and runs counter to the public policy considerations in *Saunders v. Vautier* ; and\n\n(c) the trustee's indemnity rights do not preclude termination of the VP Trust.\n\n*Buschau & National Trust Company v. Rogers Communications Inc.,* [2006] 1 S.C.R. 973, 2006 SCC 28 (Can.).\n\n117.\n\nMr. Mann appeared before the Tribunal for examination and cross-examination on 19 November 2008. In respect of the VP Trust, he opined that the trust over the Mezzanine Amount is unenforceable because the interest in this case\u2014the expectation that there will be a capital gain out of which a portion can be carved out for the Russian Service Provider to donate\u2014is merely a speculation or hope.\n\n118.\n\nIn respect of the Auriga-type Trusts, Mr. Mann testified that the trustees would tend to follow the settlor's wishes concerning the distribution of the trust property. Mr. Mann also explained that, in his opinion, the Anti-Bartlett provisions in the trusts are not standard.\n\n**5. Professor Daniel Berman**\n------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nProfessor Berman is an international tax lawyer with over 20 years experience in the U.S. Government and the private sector. Since July 2008 he has been professor of tax law at Boston University Law School. At the time of preparing his Opinion, Professor Berman was a partner in the law firm of Thelen Reid Brown Raysman & Steiner.\n\n120.\n\nIn his Opinion,13 Professor Berman asserts that much of the language of Article 21 of the ECT was inserted at U.S. insistence to conform to U.S. BIT practice, referring in particular to the 1984 U.S. Model BIT.\n\nProfessor Daniel Berman, *Opinion on the Scope of the Term \"Taxation Measures\" in the Energy Charter Treaty*, 22 January 2007.\n\n121.\n\nProfessor Berman attended an Administration Briefing on the ECT on 1 November 1994 (\" **Briefing** \"), conducted by officials of the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, Treasury and Energy and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives. Professor Berman explains that the discussion of tax issues at the Briefing, which was led by an official named Ann Fisher (from the Office of Tax Policy of the Department of the Treasury), did not include any suggestion that \"tax measures\" as defined in the ECT could give rise to rights and obligations under the ECT that were broader or differed in any way from those that could arise from the corresponding definition in U.S. BITs and other trade and investment agreements. He asserts that such a difference surely would have been highlighted at the Briefing.\n\n122.\n\nProfessor Berman concludes based on his professional experience in public and private practice, as well as the Briefing he attended and subsequent conversations he had with Ms. Fisher in December 2006, that the definition of \u2018Taxation Measures' in the ECT should be interpreted to include any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice related to the imposition, administration, or enforcement of taxation.\n\n123.\n\nProfessor Berman appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 19 November 2008. During a short direct examination he modified his written opinion by noting that the references therein to the U.S. Model BIT should properly have been cited as the NAFTA.\n\n124.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Professor Berman acknowledged that his involvement with the ECT was limited to attending the Briefing in 1994 and to participating in some calls with treasury officials.\n\n125.\n\nProfessor Berman stated his belief that the negotiations of the tax provisions of the ECT were conducted in English, though his knowledge was based on what Ms. Fisher had told him. He had not reviewed the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and was not familiar with notes prepared by the French delegation in French.\n\n126.\n\nWhen it was recalled that the United States had not signed the ECT, Professor Berman nevertheless maintained that the intention of the party that drafted the provision, even if it did not ultimately become a Contracting Party, should still be given great weight in the interpretation of such a treaty provision.\n\n127.\n\nUpon re-examination, Professor Berman explained why U.S. policy had been developed to contain a very broad carve-out for tax measures in relation to trade and investment treaties.\n\n**6. Dr. Marat Baglay**\n-----------------------\n\n128.\n\nDr. Baglay is a former judge of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation.\n\n129.\n\nDr. Baglay's Opinion14 was given in support of Respondent's contention that any provisional application of the ECT would violate several provisions of the Russian Constitution. His Opinion addresses the supremacy of the Constitution, the powers of the parliament and government under the system of separation of powers, the provisional application of international treaties and the provisional application of the ECT.\n\nDr. Marat Baglay, *Opinion on Provisional Application of International Treaties according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation*, 26 February 2006.\n\n130.\n\nAccording to Dr. Baglay, a non-ratified international treaty may not be legally applied without the adoption of relevant federal law. Such an application would violate Russian constitutional law, including the principle of separation of powers. If a federal executive body were entitled to bind the Russian State through the provisional application of treaties, it would assume legislative powers that have not been granted to this body by the Constitution. Consequently, provisional application of a rule-setting international treaty that is not validly ratified is contrary to the Russian Constitution.\n\n131.\n\nFurthermore, Dr. Baglay considers that the ECT, which has not yet been ratified, remains subject to the control of the Constitutional Court. As such, the Constitutional Court has the authority to determine, upon a proper request, the ECT's compliance with the Russian Constitution, including, in particular, the question of whether the provisional application of Parts III and V of the ECT is compatible with the Russian Constitution.\n\n**7. Professor Martti Koskenniemi**\n-----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nProfessor Koskenniemi is Academy Professor with the Academy of Finland. He is also the Director of the Erik Castr\u00e9n Institute of International Law and Human Rights (Helsinki) as well as a Hauser Global Professor of Law at the New York University Law School. He has been a member of the International Law Commission (\" **ILC** \") since 2002 and has worked for the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs as Counselor for Legal Affairs and as Director of the Division of International Law.\n\n133.\n\nProfessor Koskenniemi's Opinion15 covers the provisional application of treaties in the Finnish legal system, and what is meant by the provisional application of the ECT being subject to a State's \"constitution, laws or regulations.\"\n\nProfessor Martti Koskenniemi, *Expert Opinion on the Provisional Application of International Treaties in the Finnish Constitutional Law Context, especially with regard to the Energy Charter Treaty*, 27 October 2006.\n\n134.\n\nProfessor Koskenniemi notes that the President of Finland expressly authorized the provisional application and the signature of the ECT on 8 December 1994. The ECT was accepted by Parliament and ratified by the President on 11 July 1997. The ECT entered into force in Finland on 16 April 1998. In the Government's report to Parliament on Finland's treaty policy of 7 February 1997, it was noted that Finland had been applying the ECT provisionally since December 1994. According to Professor Koskenniemi, Finland relied on Article 45(1) in accepting provisional application since Article 37(3) of the ECT, which limited the budgetary authority of Parliament, was contrary to Finnish law.\n\n135.\n\nProfessor Koskenniemi then turns to his interpretation of Article 45(1) of the ECT. As to the object and purpose of provisional application, he opines that when States agree on provisional application, they do so in order to take immediate action in support of the objective of the treaty. Provisional application institutes a transitory system, bridging the temporal gap between the signature of a treaty and its entry into force. This means that clauses on provisional application are regular treaty clauses, in that they establish obligations on treaty parties to do what is required so as to facilitate the commencement of the operation of the main treaty. Clauses on provisional application are also exceptional, in that they temporarily suspend the normal rules on the submission of treaties to the regular constitutional procedure on ratification, acceptance and approval.\n\n136.\n\nTurning specifically to the ECT, Professor Koskenniemi observes that given the purpose of clauses providing for provisional application, the well-established rule of international law that a State may not invoke its domestic law as justification for failure to perform an international treaty obligation, does not override the express wording of Article 45(1) of the ECT which makes provisional application subject to the domestic law of the signatory State. When a State agrees on the temporary application of a treaty so as to prepare its entry into force, it is understandable that such application is subject to domestic laws and regulations. Professor Koskenniemi notes that collapsing the distinction between the regular operation of the treaty and its provisional application fails to give meaning to the distinction made in the treaty itself and undermines the fundamental principles of the treaty system on an international and a domestic level.\n\n137.\n\nUnder the ECT, States have two choices. Under Article 45(1), a State can choose the regular system of applying the treaty provisionally in a manner not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations. Alternatively, under Article 45(2), a State can opt out of provisional application altogether by making the required declaration.\n\n138.\n\nProfessor Koskenniemi disagrees with Claimants' expert, Professor Crawford, that the second choice is the \"obvious mechanism by which a signatory may avoid provisional application.\" The first choice follows the normal practice of States as regards provisional application and is a balance between the need to prepare the entry into force of the treaty and the need to protect domestic constitutional rules on the division of powers in treaty matters. He also disagrees with the interpretation of Claimants' other expert, Professor Reisman, of treating Articles 45(1) and 45(2) as a single system of provisional application. The provisions indicate no procedural linkage and are understood by the Contracting Parties to operate independently of each other.\n\n**8. Professor Alexey Kostin**\n------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nProfessor Kostin is a lawyer in Russia. He is a senior professor and the head of the Private International and Civil Law Department of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.\n\n140.\n\nProfessor Kostin's Opinion16 was offered in support of the position, that under Russian legislation, claims of a public nature cannot be referred to arbitration and that a specific agreement to arbitrate between the actual disputing parties is also required.\n\nProfessor Alexey Kostin, *Opinion on Certain Issues of Arbitrability*, 21 February 2006.\n\n141.\n\nAccording to Professor Kostin, only disputes arising from civil law may be referred to arbitration according to relevant Russian legislation on international arbitration. He cites paragraphs 2 and 4 of the *Russian Law on International Commercial Arbitration* of 1993 and Article 1(2) of the *Russian Federal Law on Arbitral Tribunals* in the Russian Federation.\n\n142.\n\nCiting several Russian scholars, Professor Kostin states that the reference to civil law in these statues means that disputes relating to public law cannot be referred to arbitration. Professor Kostin considers that while a federal law may exempt certain civil law issues from the general scope of \"civil law\" arbitration, a federal law may not add disputes arising from relationships regulated by other branches of law, such as public law, to its scope.\n\n143.\n\nProfessor Kostin considers that public law issues such as taxation, enforcement of tax regulations, expropriation and criminal matters would not be subject to arbitration under Russian law unless they could be qualified as civil law disputes.\n\n144.\n\nMoreover, Russian legislation requires a written agreement to arbitrate between the Parties. Professor Kostin emphasizes that there are not, nor have there ever been, deviations from this approach.\n\n**9. Professor Yevgeny Sukhanov**\n---------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nProfessor Sukhanov is the head of the Civil Law Department of the Law Faculty of the M.V. Lomosonov Moscow University.\n\n146.\n\nIn his Opinion,17 Professor Sukhanov addresses the question of \"whether a shareholder has a right under current Russian law to bring claim(s) against persons (or entities) that have caused damage to the joint stock company, in which he or it is a shareholder.\"\n\nProfessor Yevgeny Sukhanov, *Opinion on the Issue of Possibility of a Shareholder's Claims against CounterParties of the Joint-Stock Company in Connection with Damage Caused by the Latter to the Company*, 22 February 2006.\n\n147.\n\nAfter discussing the applicable legal rules, Professor Sukhanov explains that while shareholders have the right of claim in respect of the joint-stock company in which they participate, they have no rights in respect of property which belongs to the joint-stock company itself. The rules of tort law cannot be applied in this situation because the damage is inflicted to the property of the joint-stock company and not to the property of its shareholders. Consequently, the right to bring a claim for the protection of its interests is enjoyed only by the joint-stock company itself.\n\n148.\n\nProfessor Sukhanov notes that under Russian law, shareholders are entitled to bring claims in connection with their ownership against persons other than the joint-stock company itself in three exceptional cases, none of which applies in the situation under review.\n\n149.\n\nAccordingly, Professor Sukhanov concludes, shareholders to joint-stock companies cannot bring claims against third parties that have caused damage to the joint-stock company in which they participate.\n\n**10. Professor Gerhard Hafner**\n--------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nProfessor Hafner is a professor of Public International Law and European Law at the Law Faculty of the Vienna University.\n\n151.\n\nIn his Opinion,18 Professor Hafner addresses (a) the legal effect of the Austrian declaration that it cannot apply the ECT on a provisional basis, and (b) the question of whether Austria was under an obligation to make a declaration in order to avail itself of the \"to the extent clause\" in Article 45(1) of the ECT.\n\nProfessor Gerhard Hafner, *Legal Opinion*, 30 December 2006.\n\n152.\n\nHe concludes: (a) Article 45(1) of the ECT provides that provisional application of the ECT upon signature becomes effective only insofar as the domestic legal order of the signatory does not contradict the provisions of the ECT; (b) a signatory may rely on the \"to the extent clause\" in Article 45(1) of the ECT without making a declaration; (c) Austria's declaration in relation to Article 45(1) of the ECT is declaratory in nature; (d) Article 45(2) of the ECT provides a regime of provisional application that is separate and distinct from that of Article 45(1); and (e) the exclusion of provisional application pursuant to Article 45(2) of the ECT requires a declaration by the signatory, which has constitutive effect.\n\n**11. Professor Igor Lukashuk**\n-------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe late Professor Lukashuk was the Director of the Centre for International Legal Analysis of the Centre for the State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow and a member of the ILC.\n\n154.\n\nIn his Opinion,19 Professor Lukashuk noted that the ECT was not submitted to the Duma for ratification within a six-month period and that the Duma never ratified the ECT. Moreover, the application of the Treaty requires amendments of existing laws or the adoption of new federal laws. Consequently, pursuant to Article 15(1) of the FLIT, ratification is required.\n\nProfessor Igor Lukashuk, *Opinion on Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty*.\n\n155.\n\nIn Professor Lukashuk's opinion, pursuant to international and domestic law, the ECT cannot be applied in the Russian Federation even on a provisional basis to the extent that it contradicts the Russian Constitution, laws and regulations, and that only the Russian courts are competent to decide the issues submitted by Claimants.\n\n**12. Mr. S.V. Vasilyvev, on behalf of the Russian Ministry of Justice**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nIn his Report,20 the Deputy Minister of Justice of the Russian Federation, Mr. S.V. Vasilyev, confirms that the Russian Federation signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, that the Government sent the Treaty to the Duma for ratification on 26 August 1996 and that the Duma had not yet ratified the Treaty.\n\nDeputy Minister S.V. Vasilyvev, *Report of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation*, 12 December 2006 *.*\n\n157.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Justice considers that the ECT should not be applied provisionally in the Russian Federation because Article 45 of the ECT provides for its provisional application only in accordance with national law and the ECT was not ratified by the Duma or sent to the Duma within the six-month term established by law.\n\n**13. Professor Georg Nolte**\n-----------------------------\n\n158.\n\nProfessor Nolte is a professor of comparative public law, international law and European law at the University of Munich. He is also a member of the European Commission for Democracy through Law of the Council of Europe.\n\n159.\n\nProfessor Nolte's Opinion21 addresses (a) the relationship between Article 45(1) and Article 45(2) of the ECT, and (b) the question of how German law does not allow for the provisional application of an arbitration clause such as the one contained in Article 26 of the ECT.\n\nProfessor Georg Nolte, *Opinion concerning Provisional Application of Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty from an International and German Constitutional Law Perspective*, 31 October 2006.\n\n160.\n\nProfessor Nolte submits that the purpose of Article 45(1) is to act as a general safeguard clause that prevents the provisional application of the ECT from affecting domestic law, while the purpose of Article 45(2) is to allow States \"not able to accept provisional application\" to put their non-application beyond dispute.\n\n161.\n\nProfessor Nolte submits that the text of Article 45, as well as its object and purpose, all support the notion that Articles 45(1) and 45(2) are separate protective measures. He argues that, from the language of the Treaty and the negotiating history, it is clear that the signatory States included Article 45(2) so as to provide protection for parties that would be unable to provisionally apply the treaty for political or other reasons. Professor Nolte gives several examples of State practice of ECT signatory States in support of his conclusions.\n\n162.\n\nProfessor Nolte then discusses the relationship between German law and the ECT to illustrate conflicts between domestic law and the Treaty's provisions.\n\n163.\n\nProfessor Nolte proceeds to discuss \"areas reserved for legislation\" on institutional grounds, invoked when certain administrative institutions are established or expanded. It is generally understood that this extends to changes to the judiciary. It can be implied that any change to the German judicial system\u2014specifically arbitration proceedings available under the ECT\u2014could not be effected without parliamentary approval.\n\n164.\n\nHaving opined that an arbitration mechanism cannot be created in Germany without parliamentary approval, Professor Nolte contends that there are no domestic laws available under German law that could serve as a basis for arbitration under Article 26 ECT.\n\n165.\n\nProfessor Nolte concludes that German constitutional law does not allow for the provisional application of the arbitration mechanism in Article 26 ECT without parliamentary authorization. Since Article 45(1) ECT provides for consideration of domestic legal impediments, such a position is in conformity with the regime of provisional application under the ECT.\n\n**14. Professor Angelika Nussberger**\n-------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nProfessor Nussberger is a professor of law and the Director of the Institute of Eastern European Law at the University of Cologne.\n\n167.\n\nIn her Opinion,22 Professor Nussberger discusses the change in the legal order that has taken place in the Russian Federation since end of the Soviet Era and as a result of the adoption of the 1993 Russian Constitution.\n\nProfessor Angelika Nussberger, *Opinion concerning the Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty by the Russian Federation*, 17 January 2007.\n\n168.\n\nAmong other things, Professor Nussberger notes that the Constitution is silent with regards to the provisional application of treaties and the VCLT stops short of regulating the status of provisionally applied treaties as a matter of Russian domestic law. However, Article 23(1) of the FLIT permits provisional application, as long as the treaty is submitted to the Duma within six months for ratification. As the ECT was sent to the Duma for ratification after the expiry of the six-month period, and the Duma has not passed a law on ratification or a law extending provisional application, the continued provisional application of the ECT constitutes a breach of Russian domestic law.\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Professor Nussberger, the ECT is different from other treaties that the Russian Federation applies provisionally because its provisional application is restricted by Article 45(1), which provides for the precedence of national law.\n\n170.\n\nProfessor Nussberger states that provisional application of the ECT violates both the vertical and horizontal separation of powers. First, as a treaty that must be ratified, the provisional application of the ECT cannot continue after six months without the consent of the Duma in the form of a law of ratification. Second, the ECT cannot be applied provisionally insofar as the provisional application would be incompatible with Chapter 7 of the Constitution, which provides that the executive cannot regulate the judicial settlement of disputes as the ECT's arbitration clause seeks to do.\n\n**15. Professor Alain Pellet**\n------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nProfessor Pellet, a professor of law at Paris X-Nanterre University, is a member and former Chairman of the ILC.\n\n172.\n\nProfessor Pellet's Opinion23 discusses the provisional application of a treaty under French constitutional law.\n\nProfessor Alain Pellet, *Legal Opinion on the Provisional Application of a Treaty under French Constitutional Law (Taking the Example of the Energy Charter Treaty)*, 13 December 2006.\n\n173.\n\nProfessor Pellet explains that under the French Constitution, the Executive Branch has the power to conclude treaties pursuant to Article 52(1) of the Constitution. However, some categories of treaty, enumerated in Article 53 of the Constitution, must be ratified or approved by virtue of a statute adopted by Parliament. These include treaties that, among other things, modify provisions that are matters for statute, commit the finance of the State, relate to international organizations, or are commercial in nature.\n\n174.\n\nThe ECT was signed by France in the name of the President on 17 December 1994. Its ratification was authorized by Parliament on 27 May 1999. During the ratification process of the ECT, neither the French Parliament nor the Government specified the reasons for referring the matter to Parliament. In Professor Pellet's opinion, this silence cannot hide the fact that this was \"not a pure discretionary choice but a legal obligation,\" because (a) the ratification of this treaty has affected certain \"provisions which are matter for statute law\" according to Article 53; (b) the ECT falls into the category of \"treaties or agreements relating to international organization\" because it establishes an international organization; (c) the ECT commits the finance of the State; and (d) the ECT is a \"commercial treaty\" within the meaning of Article 53.\n\n175.\n\nProfessor Pellet states that, in France, the provisional application of treaties is only possible when the treaty's subject-matter falls within the power of the Executive Branch or, when Parliament has authorized it in advance. Professor Pellet considers that it is not the mere inclusion of an arbitration mechanism in a treaty that prevents provisional application of the treaty by France. Where, however, the arbitration mechanism itself touches upon one of the subject matters reserved under Article 34 of the Constitution to the legislative branch\u2014such as by exempting foreign investors from the jurisdiction of the domestic courts\u2014ratification pursuant to Article 53 of the Constitution is required.\n\n176.\n\nHe submits that, by signing the ECT, France only accepted the provisional application of the ECT's provisions to the extent that they did not conflict with its Constitution, in accordance with Article 45(1) of the ECT. Professor Pellet concludes that only the few provisions of the ECT that do not fall under Article 53 of the Constitution may have been applied on a provisional basis before its ratification by France.\n\n**16. Mr. Stephen Knipler**\n---------------------------\n\n177.\n\nMr. Knipler has been a Senior Tax Counsel (International) for the Australian Tax Office since 21 March 2002, after having had responsibility for the past 24 years for participating on behalf of Australia in the negotiation of tax provisions in international treaties, in particular the ECT.\n\n178.\n\nIn his Statement,24 Mr. Knipler asserts that he attended the ECT negotiations concerning tax provisions held in Brussels in 1994 and was closely involved in the negotiations concerning taxation issues, particularly in the drafts of what became Article 21 of the Treaty. Mr. Knipler states that the ECT tax provisions were negotiated solely in English.\n\nMr. Stephen Knipler, *Witness Statement*, 22 January 2007.\n\n179.\n\nDuring the course of the ECT negotiations, the Australian delegation had a clear mandate to ensure that the ECT did not cover any measures related to taxation, including measures relating to imposition, administration, collection or enforcement.\n\n180.\n\nAt the conclusion of negotiations, Mr. Knipler was satisfied that Article 21 was consistent in its content and effect with the instructions given to the Australian delegation and confirms that is reflected in the final text of the ECT.\n\n**17. Professor Myron Nordquist**\n---------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nProfessor Nordquist is a professor of international law and the Associate Director of the Centre for Oceans Law and Policy at the University of Virginia School of Law.\n\n182.\n\nProfessor Nordquist's Opinion25 addresses the assertion of Claimants and their expert, Mr. Gladyshev, that the Russian Federation's practice with respect to certain maritime agreements is consistent with the view that the Russian Federation consented to be bound under international law to the provisional application of the compulsory dispute settlement provisions of Article 26 of the ECT. Professor Nordquist considers that this assertion is factually and legally erroneous, and that there is no legal support for the notion that the Russian Federation agreed to the provisional application of a dispute resolution procedure requiring compulsory arbitration at the request of a private party.\n\nProfessor Myron Nordquist, *Expert Witness Statement*, 19 January 2007.\n\n183.\n\nAccording to Professor Nordquist, while the Russian Federation accepted \"provisional arrangements\" under the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, this is not the same as provisional application under Article 25 of the VCLT.\n\n184.\n\nSimilarly, the Exchange of Notes between the United States and the Soviet Union in connection with the maritime boundary agreement for the Bering Sea on 1 June 1990 (\" **Bering Sea MBA** \") is a source of authority under international law to set up a \"provisional arrangement of a practical nature.\" The practice of both the Russian Federation and the United States is uniformly consistent with the establishment of provisional arrangements and uniformly inconsistent with the provisional application of the Bering Sea MBA itself. Contrary to what was asserted by Claimants, neither the Bering Sea MBA nor the Exchange of Notes in connection with the Bering Sea MBA called for provisional application of the agreement.\n\n185.\n\nProfessor Nordquist disagrees with Mr. Gladyshev's assertion that a 2001 submission by the Russian Federation to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf demonstrates that Russia is provisionally applying the Bering Sea MBA. He argues that the public information available on the Russian submission clearly does not refer to the agreement as being provisionally applied, nor does it refer to a maritime boundary as having been established by such an agreement, whether as a result of provisional application or otherwise.\n\n186.\n\nProfessor Nordquist doubts the legal and factual credibility of Mr. Gladyshev's contention that the Russian Federation acquiesced in the issuance of oil exploration licenses by the United States in the Navarin Basin located in the Bering Sea\u2014and that these \u2018claims' were subsequently withdrawn under the Bering Sea MBA.\n\n187.\n\nFinally, Professor Nordquist asserts that no American President would claim competence to bind the U.S. Government to compulsory dispute resolution with a private party on the basis of provisional application of a treaty, without ratification pursuant to the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate, nor would the Senate tolerate such a claim. As a result, even if the Bering Sea MBA were an example of provisional application, it would not be evidence of State practice corroborative of provisional application of compulsory dispute resolution.\n\n**18. Professor Andrey Lisitsyn-Svetlanov**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nProfessor Lisitsyn-Svetlanov is the Director of the Institute of State and Law of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the author of a number of works on the legal regulation of foreign investment in the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union.\n\n189.\n\nIn his Opinion,26 Professor Lisitsyn-Svetlanov asserts that a \"foreign investment\" under Russian law must involve an injection of foreign capital.\n\nProfessor Andrey Lisitsyn-Svetlanov, *Legal Opinion*, 22 February 2006.\n\n190.\n\nRussian investment laws were promulgated with the purpose of granting certain benefits to foreign investors in exchange for obtaining new funds from abroad and essential expertise. In respect of such foreign funds and expertise, the relevant statutes commonly provided that these should be \"injected\" by foreign investors into the local economy. In the Russian language, \"to inject\" means to bring something new into something that already exists. It is the injection and contribution of something new that is a characteristic feature of an investment, as differentiated from a general foreign trade transaction.\n\n**19. Professor Stef van Weeghel**\n----------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nProfessor van Weeghel is a professor of international tax law at the University of Amsterdam and is a tax partner at Stibbe.\n\n192.\n\nIn his Opinion,27 Professor van Weeghel reaches three main conclusions about Claimants and taxation law.\n\nProfessor Stef van Weeghel, *Expert Witness Report*, 29 January 2007.\n\n193.\n\nFirst, Hulley was not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits contained in the Cyprus-Russia double taxation convention (\" **Cyprus-Russia DTC** \") in respect of the Yukos dividends because (a) Hulley had a permanent establishment in Russia under Article 10(4) of the Cyprus-Russia DTC) because it either had a place of management in Russia, or it had an agent in Russia; and (b) those dividends were attributable to the permanent establishment in Russia.\n\n194.\n\nSecond, VPL was not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits contained in the Cyprus-Russia DTC because it was not the beneficial owner of the Yukos dividends within the meaning of Article 10(2) of the Cyprus-Russia DTC).\n\n195.\n\nThird, the Yukos holding structure is a sham or otherwise abusive under general principles of international tax law and designed specifically to avoid taxation obligations. Therefore rights to tax benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTC should be denied.\n\n196.\n\nAccording to Professor van Weeghel, tax authorities do not always have to accept artificial legal constructions. Anti-abuse doctrines to counter artificial legal constructions have developed in and are common to many countries including the Russian Federation and Cyprus. He refers to the example of a Swiss Federal Court denying the benefits of a double taxation treaty to a Danish company in circumstances analogous to the Yukos holding structure.\n\n197.\n\nProfessor van Weeghel refers to international efforts to control the use of tax havens and notes that the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices in its 2000 Progress Report identified 35 tax havens which included Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Jersey, and the British Virgin Islands. Professor van Weeghel examines the Yukos holding structure, and notes that the bottom of the structure is the successful and profitable Russian oil company developing and exploiting natural energy resources in Russia, while at the top of the structure is a small number of Russian individual shareholders. He concludes that it is \"hardly perceivable\" that the Russian individual shareholders, in setting up the Yukos holding structure, had any other goal in mind than low taxation and lack of transparency in respect of ownership of Yukos shares. Such a structure would normally fall within the scope of international efforts to counter the harmful use of tax havens.\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' WITNESSES**\n---------------------------\n\n198.\n\nAs noted, Claimants submitted four expert legal opinions. At the hearing, Respondent called two of Claimants' experts for cross examination\u2014Mr. Vladimir Gladyshev and Mr. Brian Green, QC. Professor James Crawford, SC and Professor W. Michael Reisman were not called to the hearing. The following summary of Claimants' witness evidence follows the order outlined above.\n\n**1. Mr. Vladimir Gladyshev**\n-----------------------------\n\n199.\n\nMr. Gladyshev is a Russian attorney in Moscow, who has been in private practice since 1994. From 1981 to 1989 he worked in the Treaty and Legal Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and between 1989 and 1994 was posted to the Madrid Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (\" **USSR** \"). He was not directly involved in the negotiation of the ECT.\n\n200.\n\nIn his First Opinion,28 Mr. Gladyshev makes the following main contentions. First, the Russian Federation's long-standing practice shows that it favors the provisional application of treaties and recognizes that the treaties it applies on a provisional basis impose binding obligations on the Russian Federation. Second, the Russian Government declared to the Duma, during the ratification process, that the ECT is consistent with Russian law. In accordance with the rules of international law and its own treaty practice, the Russian Federation has applied the ECT as a binding instrument and has relied on its terms. Third, Mr. Gladyshev contends that the ECT is in fact consistent with Russian law.\n\nMr. Vladimir Gladyshev, *Opinion concerning the Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty by the Russian Federation*, 29 June 2006.\n\n201.\n\nTo reach these conclusions, Mr. Gladyshev discusses the rules of customary international law, the FLIT (which permits the provisional application of treaties), Russian legal scholarship and Russian treaty and judicial practice, citing examples of other treaties to which Russia is party. Attached to his opinion is a list of 45 treaties that he contends are currently being applied by the Russian Federation on a provisional basis, amidst a list of 390 treaties signed by the USSR/Russian Federation that were applied\u2014or are being applied\u2014on a provisional basis prior to ratification.\n\n202.\n\nIn support of his assertion that the Russian Federation has repeatedly accepted the binding nature of provisionally applied treaties, Mr. Gladyshev cites a number of examples, the most salient of which is the Bering Sea MBA. It was signed on 1 January 1990, and has been provisionally applied since 15 June 1990, in accordance with the express terms of the Exchange of Notes between the United States and Russian Federation, as evidenced by (a) the Russian Government's express reference to the boundaries as defined in the Bering Sea MBA as the outer limits of its continental shelf; (b) the United States' enforcement of the Bering Sea MBA against Russian shipping vessels on multiple occasions, without protest from the Russian Federation; and (c) the Russian Government's acquiescence in the issuance by the United States of licenses to companies for oil exploration in areas to which Russia's earlier claim was withdrawn in the Bering Sea MBA.\n\n203.\n\nMr. Gladyshev's Second Opinion29 reiterates his view that the Russian Federation repeatedly accepted the binding nature of provisionally applied treaties in general and applied the ECT, in particular, as a binding instrument. He contends that the fact that the ECT was not submitted to the Duma for ratification within the six-month period set out in Article 23(2) of the FLIT has no effect on Russia's continuing application of the Treaty. Attached to his Second Opinion is a list of treaties that were provisionally applied, submitted to the Duma after the six-month period and subsequently ratified.\n\nMr. Vladimir Gladyshev, *Second Opinion concerning the Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty by the Russian Federation,* 2 May 2007.\n\n204.\n\nMr. Gladyshev appeared before the Tribunal on 20 November 2008. Under crossexamination Mr. Gladyshev testified that although he had not been involved in the negotiation of the ECT, he had been involved in negotiation of Russia's other treaties and regularly applies international law in his practice.\n\n205.\n\nIn response to questions on the FLIT, Mr. Gladyshev affirmed that it prescribes procedures for the ratification of treaties, but that some treaties do not require ratification. Shown several examples of treaties that he had cited in support of Russian practice on provisional application, he maintained that the fact that Russia had signed such treaties supported his contention, regardless of whether Russia had ever applied the provisional application clause. He acknowledged further that, of the treaties listed in Attachment 2 to his opinion, except for the ECT, none provided for investor-State arbitration.\n\n206.\n\nIn a series of questions on Russian constitutional law and the separation of powers, Mr. Gladyshev maintained that the operation of the separation of powers for treatymaking in Russia is prescribed not only in the Russian Constitution, but in the FLIT, such that there is no category of treaty that cannot be applied provisionally. Questioned further on the distinction between the Soviet approach and that of the Russian Federation, he resisted characterizing the Soviet State as dualist and the Russian Federation as monist, and reasserted that agreement on the provisional application of the ECT amounted to a treaty concluded by the Russian Federation.\n\n207.\n\nWhen questioned about resolutions of the Supreme Court of Russia, Mr. Gladyshev acknowledged that he was familiar with Resolutions 5 and 8. After being shown a statement by Professor Igor Lukashuk that the Russian courts are bound by a Supreme Court decree according to which only ratified treaties can take priority over contrary rules of law, Mr. Gladyshev contended that this includes provisionally applied treaties, invoking Professor Lukashuk's own book, *The Norms of International Law in the Russian Legal System*.\n\n208.\n\nWhen questioned on the text of Article 45(1) of the ECT, Mr. Gladyshev agreed that his Opinion did not discuss whether his list of treaties had such an \"inconsistency clause,\" which he attributed to his belief that international law does not include a regime for such \"inconsistency clauses.\" He restated his opinion that the Russian State took the view that Article 45(1) did not apply to Russia and that the ECT was consistent with its laws.\n\n**2. Mr. Brian Green, QC**\n--------------------------\n\n209.\n\nMr. Green is a specialist trusts practitioner at the English Bar. He has been in this practice since 1981, and was appointed a QC in 1997. He practices out of Wilberforce Chambers, Lincoln's Inn, London. Mr. Green provided a first and second opinion on the Auriga-type Trusts, and a first and second opinion on the VP Trust.\n\n210.\n\nIn his First Opinion regarding Auriga-type Trusts,30 Mr Green stated that these trusts are routine examples of offshore trusts, substantially similar to the Jersey standard form. An analysis of the salient features of each trust would show a coherent set of trusts operating for the benefit of all or any of the beneficiaries for the duration of the relevant trust period. He defines \"control\" over the GML shares as \"control\" over those rights attaching to the GML shares that allow \"control\" to be exercised over GML, and concludes that the trustees have control over the GML shares. Mr. Green opines as follows in relation to the key related issues:\n\n\u2022 The Protector's powers, far from being entirely at his discretion, must be exercised in a fiduciary manner and for the benefit of the beneficiaries.\n\n\u2022 The Anti-Bartlett provisions, exempting the trustee from a duty to perform certain actions, must be distinguished from provisions that would take away from the trustee the right to do so.\n\n\u2022 The Call Option agreements proceed on the explicit basis that legal and beneficial ownership of the GML shares will remain in the trustees pending \"Completion,\" and do not involve any transfer of property to the security holder (*i.e.*, GML itself).\n\n\u2022 The rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* has no application to the trust here, since the class of beneficiaries is open.\n\nMr. Brian Green, QC, *Opinion re Auriga-Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust*, 4 May 2007.\n\n211.\n\nIn his First Opinion regarding the VP Trust,31 Mr. Green opines that Mr. Mann's interpretation of the trust and related documents is incorrect, and offers the following conclusions based on his analysis of the issues:\n\n\u2022 The provisions of the trust instrument clearly show that the trustee is vested with ownership and control over the VPL shares.\n\n\u2022 The fact that the trustee is required to act in accordance with the instructions of a Voting Committee in exercising any voting powers attaching to the Yukos shares does not interfere with the trustee's ownership and control over the VPL shares.\n\n\u2022 The provisions requiring the trustee to sell the Yukos shares as directed by the Russian Service Provider (\" **RSP** \") do not equate with the RSP owning or controlling the Yukos shares.\n\n\u2022 The trust appears as an arrangement referred to in the UK as an \"unapproved profit sharing scheme.\"\n\n\u2022 Successive interests are created in the Yukos shares, which are in the nature of fixed-interest trusts. The beneficiaries are YUL and the veteran employees of Yukos.\n\n\u2022 The rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* is inapplicable to the Yukos shares; as for the VPL shares, there are several impediments to the exercise by YUL of any rights under the rule.\n\nMr. Brian Green, QC, *Opinion re the Veteran Petroleum Trust*, 4 May 2007.\n\n212.\n\nIn his Second Opinion regarding the Auriga-type Trusts,32 Mr. Green states that, the trusts being typical and valid trusts as regards the GML shares, it cannot seriously be argued that the terms of the trusts have the extraordinary effect that ownership or control of the trust assets resides other than in the trustees. He makes the following principal points:\n\n\u2022 As regards the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier*, even when the principle is potentially applicable, it does not justify the conclusion that the GML shares (or any other trust property) is owned or controlled by anyone other than the respective trustees unless and until the principle is effectively invoked.\n\n\u2022 The security interest created by the Call Option agreements is at most in the nature of a charge and not a mortgage. A charge does not involve any transfer of property to the security holder, much less does it involve the chargee becoming the legal owner of such shares.\n\n\u2022 In relation to Protector control, Mr. Green observes that the Protectors have no consent power as regards the exercise by the trustee of the voting rights over GML shares.\n\n\u2022 Finally, Mr. Green maintains that Mr. Mann has failed to establish that the beneficial interest in the GML shares was retained by the settlor/first-named Protector.\n\nMr. Brian Green, QC, *Second Opinion re Auriga-Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust*, 30 September 2008.\n\n213.\n\nIn his Second Opinion regarding the VP Trust,33 Mr. Green opines as follows on the additional points raised by Mr. Mann:\n\n\u2022 Reliance on the \"expectancy\" principle is erroneous, as the question here involves whether a party (YUL), being the present owner of present property (the Yukos shares), was able to assign such present (not expectant) property to a trustee, to hold the same on trust. The trust over the Mezzanine Amount is therefore valid and enforceable, and the beneficiaries are the veteran employees of Yukos.\n\n\u2022 There remain significant impediments to the exercise by YUL of the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* in relation to the VPL Shares, namely: (a) no unilateral right to terminate the trust; (b) inapplicability of the rule in relation to a pension trust fund (*i.e.*, the *Rogers Communications Inc.* case); and (c) the trustee's indemnity rights take priority over YUL/Yukos' rights.\n\n\u2022 Finally, even when the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* is potentially available, that principle does not enable beneficiaries to control the trustee or to claim ownership of the trust property so long as the trust is ongoing.\n\nMr. Brian Green, QC, *Second Opinion re the Veteran Petroleum Trust*, 30 September 2008\n\n214.\n\nMr. Green appeared at the hearing for cross-examination on 20 November 2008. His oral testimony addressed the following points, among others:\n\n\u2022 Explaining the inclusion of the International Red Cross in discretionary trusts, Mr. Green testified that it is the normal practice in properly-drafted trusts to ensure that the equitable interests under the trusts are completely disposed of, so that there is no beneficial vacuum at the end of the trust pursuant to which the property, no matter how remote, might be said to fall back into the estate of the settlor.\n\n\u2022 Normally, a letter of wishes is designed to communicate to the trustees the settlor's aspirations at the time that the letter is written as to the way in which the beneficial enjoyment of the trust property might devolve over time. It is general in its terms and makes clear that it is only of precatory effect.\n\n\u2022 In the Southern Cross Trust, any beneficiary can let the trustees know that he no longer wishes to be a beneficiary. Unlike English law, Guernsey law does not require that disposing of anything like an equitable interest should be in writing. Therefore, it is possible for the trustees to have removed Mr. Khodorkovsky without clear written instructions.\n\n\u2022 The Call Option agreements gave each of the individual participants comfort as regards the other. They gave GML a mechanism to remove an individual participant if it decided in the future that a particular participant was no longer desirable. This is not uncommon in partnership or joint venture agreements of the present kind.\n\n**3. Professor James Crawford, SC**\n-----------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nProfessor Crawford, SC, is the Whewell Professor of International Law at the University of Cambridge and a member of Matrix Chambers.\n\n216.\n\nProfessor Crawford's First Opinion34 addresses Respondent's arguments that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and that Claimants lack standing. Professor Crawford concludes: (a) provisional application of a treaty is a genuine form of application and provisionally applied treaty provisions may have legal effect; (b) accordingly, by accepting provisional application of the ECT, Respondent accepted the obligations of Parts III and V of the Treaty; (c) in particular, given that the arbitration clause of the ECT was being provisionally applied by Respondent, Notices of Arbitration filed by qualified investors perfected an agreement to arbitrate which was, and remains, independent of the continued provisional application of the ECT itself; and (d) on the facts as stipulated, the dispute settlement provisions of the ECT apply to Claimants.\n\nProfessor James Crawford, SC, *Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues,* 22 June 2006.\n\n217.\n\nWithin an overview of the modes of consent under the law of treaties, Professor Crawford reviews the drafting history of Article 25 of the VCLT and highlights two amendments that confirm that provisionally applied treaties have legal effect. During the Vienna Conference, the draft text was modified to include Article 35(2), which provides specific rules for the termination of a provisionally-applied treaty. Additionally, the draft text was modified to replace the words \"enter into force provisionally\" with \"apply provisionally,\" a change intended to make clear that \"provisionally\" referred to the time of the treaty's application, rather than its legal force or effectiveness during that time period. Professor Crawford further rejects Respondent's position that the *pacta sunt servanda* rule in Article 26 of the VCLT only applies to a treaty in force: the VCLT plainly intended provisional application to fall within the framework of that rule.\n\n218.\n\nAfter reviewing State practice in connection with provisional application, including the examples of the GATT and the privatization of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, Professor Crawford concludes that a claim based on provisional application is \"a form of consent widespread in recent treaties, including the ECT itself, and it involves a mode of application of the treaty to the extent stipulated in it.\"\n\n219.\n\nWith respect to Respondent's interpretation of Articles 45(1) and 45(2), Professor Crawford states that the correct construction is that Article 45(1) provides the general rule to accommodate constitutional or other requirements of participating States, and Article 45(2) provides a mechanism under which the rule is to operate. He states that Respondent's position does not make sense given the reciprocity limitation in Article 45(2)(b). A declaration under Article 45(2)(a), by virtue of the operation of Article 45(2)(b), would maintain parity between States, whereas the operation of Article 45(1), according to Respondent's construction\u2014which might occur only after a dispute had arisen\u2014would be unilateral in its effect. States are not to be taken to have negotiated such anomalous situations unless there is a clear indication to that effect.\n\n220.\n\nProfessor Crawford states that, assuming that Article 45(1) could operate independently of Article 45(2), the internal law of a State must be clear as to its exclusionary effect to avoid the provisional application of a treaty. Professor Crawford states that it cannot be assumed that the mere existence of a constitutional requirement of ratification is inconsistent with provisional application and international law has traditionally been reluctant to allow internal limitations to affect treaty provisions. Article 46 of the VCLT\u2014which permits the invalidation of consent to a treaty entered into in violation of internal law\u2014has an \"exceptional character\" and is rarely applicable, and more importantly that its scope does not cover provisional application, but only definitive acceptance.\n\n221.\n\nIn connection with Article 17 of the ECT, Professor Crawford emphasizes the notification requirement, and observes that tribunals have been clear that notification by the State seeking to deny advantages to investors must be unambiguous. Professor Crawford acknowledges the practical difficulty of notifying offshore companies of the exercise of the Article 17 right but asserts that this is why Article 17(1) allows States to issue, by clear statement, denials respecting the whole class of investors and potential investors. Though international law provides no formal notice requirements in such a situation, the principle is evident in the depositary requirements under Article 80 of the VCLT. To constitute notice under Article 17(1), a clear statement by the Government of Respondent published with an appropriate authority\u2014such as the Energy Charter Secretariat\u2014would be required. Even if the statement in Respondent's pleadings was sufficient, the withdrawal from the arbitration clause would have no retroactive effect.\n\n222.\n\nIn response to Respondent's objection that Claimants are shell companies, Professor Crawford observes that the ECT requires only that the \"investor\" be organized under the laws of a Contracting State. Companies incorporated in Contracting Parties are embraced by the definition, regardless of the nationality of shareholders, the origin of investment capital or nationality of the directors or management. In several cases where companies have been registered in tax shelters, arbitral tribunals made no further enquiry to uncover their \"real\" nationality or found it unnecessary to go beyond the terms of the treaty definition of \"investor.\"\n\n223.\n\nIn his Further Opinion35, Professor Crawford sets out his position on the applicability of *pacta sunt servanda* to provisionally applied treaties and provides detailed responses to and comments on the witness statement of Mr. Fremantle and the expert opinions of Professors Hafner, Koskenniemi, Lukashuk, Nolte and Pellet.\n\nProfessor James Crawford, SC, *Further Opinion on Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues*, 3 May 2007.\n\n224.\n\nIn connection with Professor Koskenniemi's opinion, Professor Crawford disagrees that provisional application should be interpreted in a \"limitative way.\" Provisional application has legal effect because it is what the parties have agreed. Interpretative presumptions are beside the point when the terms of the parties' agreement are as explicit as Article 45 of the ECT.\n\n225.\n\nWith respect to Professor Koskenniemi's opinion that the executive ought not to be able to bind a State internationally in contravention of its domestic constitutional law, Professor Crawford asserts that the position of international law is that treaties can be entered into by more or less formal means; it is\u2014within broad limits\u2014for the State itself to ensure compliance with its constitutional requirements, which Article 45(2) allows them to do freely. Further, there is no rule that treaties cannot have effect before ratification, since there is no rule requiring ratification. Finally, it is necessary to look at the effect on third parties acting in good faith. The Russian Federation consented to provisional application and gave no reason for investors to doubt the effectiveness of its consent.\n\n226.\n\nTurning to Professor Lukashuk's opinion, Professor Crawford disagrees with the opinion that provisional application applies in accordance with the State's \"constitutional processes.\" The VCLT does not condition the validity of the legal effect of treaty commitments upon compliance with constitutional processes. He further comments thatunless a treaty provides otherwise, it is for the State to ensure that it complies with any internal constitutional processes in accepting provisional application.\n\n227.\n\nFinally, Professor Crawford addresses the scope of *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*. *Travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* include evidence of the conference or other meetings where the treaty text was discussed, including proposals communicated, but not private statements or recollections. Professor Crawford regards the following evidence as based upon false *travaux* and as effectively inviting the Tribunal to engage in \"an investigation *ab initio* of the supposed intentions of the parties [to the Treaty]\": (a) Professor Berman's reference to congressional briefings and his personal knowledge of the facts; (b) Mr. Fremantle's reliance on certain non-comprehensive papers and his memory of negotiations; (c) Mr. Knipler's reference to the \"mandate\" of the Australian delegation and his personal satisfaction regarding compliance with the Australian delegation's instructions; and (d) Mr. Martynov's \"clear understanding that Russia would not be able to apply provisionally those provisions [...] that related to a settlement of disputes by international arbitration\" though there is no record of this. Professor Crawford confirms that interpretation of a treaty is a matter of law, not of fact, and that much of Respondent's witnesses' testimony is fundamentally inadmissible. Resort to the *travaux* is a subsidiary means of resolving \"ambiguities or uncertainties or, in exceptional cases, to correct an interpretation which is \u2018manifestly absurd or unreasonable.'\"\n\n**4. Professor W. Michael Reisman**\n-----------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nProfessor Reisman is currently the Myres S. McDougal Professor of International Law at Yale Law School, where he has been a member of the faculty since 1965. He has been elected to the Institut de Droit International.\n\n229.\n\nProfessor Reisman's Opinion36 addresses the ECT's provisional application regime under Article 45, the denial of benefits regime under Article 17, and the meaning of \"investment\" in the Treaty and its binding effect on Russia.\n\nProfessor W. Michael Reisman, *Opinion concerning Arbitral Jurisdiction under the European Energy Charter Treaty with Respect to the Russian Federation in the Yukos Case*, 28 June 2006.\n\n230.\n\nWhen a treaty contains a provisional application clause, it imposes obligations on a State by virtue of that State's participation in the adoption of the treaty. According to Professor Reisman the law of provisional application operates according to the twin principles of drafting freedom and State consent; a provisionally-applicable treaty constitutes a binding and enforceable legal instrument between States.\n\n231.\n\nProfessor Reisman asserts that Article 45 of the ECT establishes two different regimes for provisional application. The first regime\u2014consisting of Articles 45(1), 45(2)(a), 45(2)(b) and 45(3))\u2014is for the ECT as a whole. The second regime\u2014consisting of Article 45(2)(c)\u2014applies exclusively to Part VII of the ECT.\n\n232.\n\nThe first regime, which includes the dispute settlement obligations in Part V based on alleged breaches of the investment-protection obligations set forth if Part III, applies automatically to every signatory State, without possibility of reservation, subject \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" The only time a signatory can claim that such provisional application is inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations, is at the moment of signature. At that time, a State that resists provisional application must deliver a declaration that it is not able to accept the provisional application because of the inconsistency that doing so would create with its constitution, laws or regulations. Other provisions of the ECT make it clear that this is the intended meaning of the text. Moreover, the bulk of the practice with respect to Article 45 confirms that this is the understanding of the parties.\n\n233.\n\nAccordingly, Professor Reisman states, it is not permissible for a signatory, which had not previously exercised the option of making a declaration at the moment of signing, to invoke subsequently its constitution, laws or regulations as a justification for dishonoring its commitment to apply the ECT provisionally.\n\n234.\n\nProfessor Reisman opines that the ECT's provisional application regime applies to Russia. When Russia signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, it did not make a declaration under Article 45(2)(a). Neither did Russia make a declaration, accepting *arguendo* its interpretation of Article 45(1). Notably, Russia consistently held itself out as a member of the ECT and has actively participated in the Conference and Charter mechanisms under Part VII.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to Professor Reisman, the ECT is not a political treaty. Russia's allegation that the *pacta sunt servanda* rule is not applicable to a treaty that is applied on a provisional basis is not correct. All agreements concluded between States are subject to this rule with the possible exception of a *modus vivendi* ; the ECT is not a *modus vivendi* and was moreover registered as a treaty with the Secretary of the United Nations. Further, the fact that the ECT's provisional application regime provides for a precise mode of termination indicates that its binding nature.\n\n236.\n\nHe also notes that Russia cannot claim that the provisional application of the ECT would violate the Russian Constitution, and the provisional application regime is not in manifest violation of Russian law. As provided by Article 46 of the VCLT, the violation must be a manifest, in other words, a violation of internal law regarding the competence to conclude treaties that is objectively evident to any other State. There was no such manifest violation here and Russia cannot advance this claim after allowing third parties to rely on its own assurances.\n\n237.\n\nProfessor Reisman opines that the arbitration provisions of the ECT are not inconsistent with Russian laws and regulations. It is an undisputed principle of international law that international obligations prevail over provisions of domestic law and that a State cannot invoke domestic provisions to avoid its international obligations. This same principle is applicable in international investment arbitration.\n\n238.\n\nProfessor Reisman then considers whether Claimants may avail themselves of the protections and benefits of the ECT in view of Article 17. According to Professor Reisman, Article 17 does not operate automatically. The right given by Article 17 to each Contracting Party to deny the advantages of Part III is an executory rather than an executed right; it must be exercised by way of a positive action by a State wishing to benefit from it, until which time the designated class of investors or investments benefit from Part III. Once the right to deny benefits of Part III has been exercised by a Contracting Party, the effect operates prospectively from the date of the exercise of the right.\n\n239.\n\nAccording to Professor Reisman, Russia is a Contracting Party to the ECT. While Russia has not yet ratified the ECT and the ECT has therefore not literally entered into force for Russia, to exclude Russia and similarly-situated States from the definition of \"Contracting Party\" would eviscerate the provisional application regime and the provisional application obligations of Article 45. The result would be \"manifestly absurd\" and \"unreasonable\" in the sense of Article 32(b) of the VCLT.\n\n240.\n\nProfessor Reisman states that citizens or nationals of a Contracting Party are not covered by Article 17. Article 17(1) permits a Contracting Party to deny the advantages of Part III to a legal entity organized under the laws of a Contracting Party but owned or controlled by nationals of a third State if that entity \"has no substantial business activities in the area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.\" ECT case-law supports the position that Article 17(1) does not apply to legal entities owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a Contracting Party. Had the drafters of the ECT intended to permit a Contracting Party to deny the advantages of Part III to entities owned or controlled by its nationals but organized according to the laws of another Contracting Party, Article 17(1) would not limit the denial option to entities owned or controlled by \"citizens or nationals of a third state.\" Russia is a Contracting Party, not a third State.\n\n241.\n\nProfessor Reisman then turns to the question of whether the ECT requires the investment to have a cross-border origin. He considers that the requirements for \"Investment\" have been met. Russia argues that when ascertaining the international character of an investment, the origin of the capital is relevant and decisive. There are however only four requirements that must be fulfilled in order for an \"Investment\" to qualify under the ECT: (a) \"every kind of asset, including shares and stocks;\" (b) \"owned or controlled\"; (c) \"directly or indirectly\"; (d) by an Investor as defined by the ECT. All four requirements are satisfied in this case: the investment is in the form of shares of the Yukos Oil Corporation; the Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim stipulate that Claimants own the shares of Yukos. The ECT does not distinguish between \"real owners\" or otherwise and disregards the nationality of the investors beyond the requirement that it be a national of a Contracting Party. Also, it is a recognized principle of investment law that claims by shareholders are separate and independent from the claims of the corporate entity. Nor is control a legally-relevant factor. Modern investment law, with which the ECT is consistent, does not require the ownership of a majority of the shares, but allows minority and non-controlling shareholders to bring a claim to an international tribunal.\n\n242.\n\nIn a letter dated 14 March 2007, Professor Reisman confirms that he received and read Respondent's Reply and its appended expert opinions and that he does not wish to change his opinion.\n\n**VII. ISSUES FOR ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nBased on the Parties' written and oral submissions, the following issues arise for analysis and decision by the Tribunal:\n\nA. Does the provisional application of the ECT in the Russian Federation, as defined by Article 45, provide a basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the merits of the claims in this arbitration?\n\n1.

DOES THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF THE ECT IN THE RUSSIANFEDERATION, AS DEFINED BY ARTICLE 45, PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OVER THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMS IN THIS ARBITRATION?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe central issue in this phase of the arbitration is the interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT, concerning the meaning of provisional application of the Treaty as provided for in that Article.\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it helpful to quote again the terms of Article 45 of the ECT, which provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n(1) Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n(2) (a) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) any signatory may, when signing, deliver to the Depository a declaration that it is not able to accept provisional application. The obligation contained in paragraph (1) shall not apply to a signatory making such a declaration. Any such signatory may at any time withdraw that declaration by written notification to the Depository.\n\n(b) Neither a signatory which makes a declaration in accordance with subparagraph (a) nor Investors of that signatory may claim the benefits of provisional application under paragraph (1).\n\n(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any signatory making a declaration referred to in subparagraph (a) shall apply Part VII provisionally pending the entry into force of the Treaty for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its laws or regulations.\n\n(3) (a) Any signatory may terminate its provisional application of this Treaty by written notification to the Depository of its intention not to become a Contracting Party to the Treaty. Termination of provisional application for any signatory shall take effect upon the expiration of 60 days from the date on which such signatory's written notification is received by the Depository.\n\n(b) In the event that a signatory terminates provisional application under subparagraph (a), the obligation of the signatory under paragraph (1) to apply Parts III and V with respect to any Investments made in its Area during such provisional application by Investors of other signatories shall nevertheless remain in effect with respect to those Investments for twenty years following the effective date of termination, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (c).\n\n(c) Subparagraph (b) shall not apply to any signatory listed in Annex PA. A signatory shall be removed from the list in Annex PA effective upon delivery to the Depository of its request therefor.\n\n246.\n\nSpecial attention is drawn to the phrase at the end of Article 45(1), which reads \"... to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" The Tribunal will refer to this phrase as the \" **Limitation Clause** \" of Article 45(1).\n\n247.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that Respondent signed the ECT on 17 December 1994 and made no declaration at that time or at any time thereafter under Article 45(2) or, for that matter, under Article 45(1). It is also common ground that Respondent is not among the signatories, listed in Annex PA of the ECT, that do not accept the provisional application obligation of Article 45(3)(b). Respondent submits to the Tribunal that the dispute settlement provisions in Part V of the ECT are not binding on the Russian Federation because they are inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the Russian Federation and hence trigger the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1). Respondent therefore submits that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the claims in this arbitration. Claimant counters that the Russian Federation cannot limit provisional application of the ECT without a declaration under Article 45(2) (or at least under Article 45(1)) and that, in any event, the obligations in Part V of the ECT are not inconsistent with the Constitution or laws of the Russian Federation.\n\n248.\n\nThus, the following issues arise for analysis and decision by the Tribunal:\n\na) Must the declaration referred to in Article 45(2) be made in order for a signatory to benefit from the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1)? In other words, in the language of Claimant's submission, is the declaration provided for in Article 45(2) the \"mechanism\" through which the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) is implemented?\n\nb) If the answer to issue (a) is no, is some form of prior declaration or notice to the other ECT signatories nevertheless required under Article 45(1) in order for a signatory to be able to invoke the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1)?\n\nc) If the answer to (b) is no, what effect should be given to the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1)? In order to determine this question, the Tribunal must answer the preliminary issue of whether the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) represents an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition, that is\u2014whether it concerns the inconsistency of *the principle* of provisional application with the Constitution, laws or regulations of Respondent, or whether it requires a \"piecemeal\" approach which requires the analysis of the consistency of *each provision of the ECT* with the Constitution, laws and regulations of Respondent. Depending on its answer to this preliminary question, the Tribunal must determine either (i) whether the principle of provisional application *per se* is consistent with the Constitution, laws and regulations of Respondent, or (ii) whether particular inconsistencies between specific provisions of the ECT (those of Part V in particular) and the Constitution, laws and regulations of Respondent preclude the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the merits of the claim in this arbitration.\n\n**2. Is a Declaration Required under Article 45(2)?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn this subsection, the Tribunal turns its attention to the first issue which it has identified, namely whether the declaration referred to in Article 45(2) must be made in order for a signatory to benefit from the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1). Since Respondent did not make such a declaration, an affirmative answer to this question would dispose of the Article 45 issue in favour of Claimant.\n\n**a) Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n250.\n\nRespondent argues that Articles 45(1) and 45(2) represent, respectively, two separate regimes on provisional application. The difference between Articles 45(1) and 45(2), submits Respondent, is that the former applies only in case of inconsistency between the treaty provisions and a signatory's constitution, laws or regulations, whereas a signatory may also avail itself of the latter provision and thus declare that it is unwilling\u2014for political or other reasons\u2014including inconsistency, to apply the ECT provisionally. This gives rise, Respondent argues, to the fundamental difference in procedural regimes: Article 45(2) calls for an express declaration whereas none is required as regards 45(1). Respondent submits that its interpretation of the relationship between Articles 45(1) and 45(2) is supported by the unambiguous wording of Article 45(2), by the ECT drafting history (the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*) and by the State practice of the ECT's signatories.\n\n251.\n\nAccording to Claimant and its expert witnesses (Professors James Crawford and Michael Reisman), it is clear, pursuant to applicable principles of international law and the plain meaning of the provisions, that Article 45(1) establishes the *principle* of provisional application whereas Article 45(2) establishes the *procedure* according to which a signatory State may opt out of the concept of provisional application agreed in Article 45(1). Claimant argues, moreover, that Article 45(2) establishes the legal regime resulting from a State's decision to withdraw from provisional application. Claimant affirms that it is only this interpretation which ensures reciprocity for States that choose to rely on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1), via the safeguard of Article 45(2)(b). Article 45(2)(b), it is recalled, states:\n\nNeither a signatory which makes a declaration in accordance with subparagraph (a) nor Investors of that signatory may claim the benefits of provisional application under paragraph (1).\n\n252.\n\nClaimant also notes that the Russian Federation made a declaration under Article 6(2)(a) of the Amendment to the Trade-Related Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty (the \" **Trade Amendment** \"), rather than rely on the limitation clause of Article 6(1) of the Trade Amendment, which mirrors Article 45(1) of the ECT, by providing for provisional application of the Trade Amendment subject to a limitation clause. Claimant submits that the Russian Federation, being familiar with the mechanism and operation of provisional application, would have made a declaration under Article 45(2) if it had a problem with the provisional application of the Treaty.\n\n253.\n\nIn its Second Memorial, Respondent emphasizes that Article 45(2) of the ECT is an \"all or nothing proposition with respect to the substantive provisions of the Treaty,\" distinct from Article 45(1) of the ECT, which calls for an analysis of inconsistency between each provision of the Treaty and Russian law. Respondent highlights the plain meaning of Article 45(2), which is introduced by the word \"notwithstanding,\" and which provides that any signatory \"may\" deliver a declaration. This evidences, Respondent argues, that the declaration under Article 45(2) is independent of Article 45(1) and, as opposed to Article 45(1), is optional. In support of its interpretation of Article 45, Respondent refers to the expert opinions of Sydney Fremantle, the chairman of Working Group II,37 and Professors Hafner, Koskenniemi, Nolte and Pellet.\n\nUnder the auspices of the European Energy Charter Conference, Working Group II was charged with preparing and negotiating the Treaty during the period 1990 to 1994.\n\n254.\n\nIn its Second Memorial, Respondent also relies, among others, on the following arguments:\n\n\u2022 Six States that expressly relied on Article 45(1) in their declarations did not make a declaration under Article 45(2), namely Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal and Turkey.\n\n\u2022 Three other States made no declaration at all, but relied on the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1), namely Finland, France and Germany.\n\n\u2022 European Union (\" **EU** \") authorities, through a joint \"Statement by the Council, the Commission and the Member States on Article 45 of the European Energy Charter Treaty\" approved in December 1994 (\" **1994 EU Joint Statement** \"), have relied on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) in concluding that there is no obligation to enter a declaration of non-application under Article 45(2).38\n\n\u2022 Article 45(1) is a standard inconsistency clause, similar to such clauses found in a number of other treaties; Respondent avers that treaties providing an exception to provisional application generally do not include a mechanism for a signatory to avail itself of the exception.\n\n\u2022 The issue of reciprocity of rights and obligations in relation to Article 45(1) was raised and dismissed during the ECT negotiations as being both an impossible and an undesirable objective; furthermore, treaty practice demonstrates that reciprocity is rarely applied in the context of provisional application.\n\n\u2022 The link drawn by Claimant between Article 6(2)(a) of the Trade Amendment and Article 45(2) is \"absurd\": Lithuania, like Russia, only made a declaration under Article 6 of the Trade Amendment and not under Article 45(2).\n\n\"Statement by the Council, the Commission and the Member States on Article 45 of the European Energy Charter Treaty,\" *in \"A\" Item Note from the Permanent Representatives Committee to the Council of the European Union*, Doc. 12165/94, 14 December 1994, Annex I, p. 3, Exhibit R-352.\n\n255.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Claimant submitted a number of arguments, including the following:\n\n\u2022 Applicable rules of treaty interpretation, particularly Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, lead to the conclusion that Article 45(1) establishes the principle of provisional application while Article 45(2) provides the procedural mechanism for a State to opt out of such provisional application.\n\n\u2022 Article 45(2)\u2014and, specifically, paragraph (b) thereof\u2014ensures reciprocity of the rights granted and the obligations undertaken by virtue of provisional application, an important safeguard, confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, that necessarily applies to any State's derogation from provisional application.\n\n\u2022 The Russian Federation is not among the following States which have, in some way, refused provisional application of the ECT:\n\no the twelve States that availed themselves of the opting-out mechanism pursuant to a declaration under Article 45(2)(a);39 or\n\no the six States that declared, in one way or another, that they would not apply the ECT provisionally in accordance with Article 45(1).40\n\n\u2022 As regards the three States\u2014Finland, Germany and France\u2014which, according to Respondent, purportedly relied on the inconsistency clause of Article 45(1) in not applying the ECT or provisions thereof without making any declaration, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* do not establish that any one of these States ever took the view that it had an issue of \"inconsistency\" that would create an obstacle to provisional application of the ECT.\n\n\u2022 The 1994 EU Joint Statement is similarly of no avail, as its purpose was to enable the Communities, on the basis of the proposed interpretation of Article 45, to apply the Treaty provisionally within the limits of their competence. This is confirmed by the Council decisions of 15 December 1994 on the provisional application of the Treaty by the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, respectively, providing that each Community would apply the Treaty \"to the extent that the Community has *competence* for the matters governed by the Treaty\" [emphasis added].41 The transparency requirement of Article 45 was thus satisfied, since this \" *declaration*,\" made at the time of the signature of the Treaty by the Communities, allowed the provisional application of the Treaty by the Communities within the *limits* of their competence.\n\nAustralia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Iceland, Japan, Lichtenstein, Malta, Norway, Poland, Switzerland and Turkmenistan.\n\nAustria, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal and Turkey.\n\n*See* Council decision of 15 December 1994 on the provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty by the European Community (94/998/EC), Official Journal of the European Communities, 31 December 1994, Annex C-1010; Council decision of 15 December 1994 approving the provisional application of the ECT by Decision of the Commission on behalf of the European Atomic Energy Community (94/067/Euratom), Official Journal of the European Communities, 31 December 1994, Annex C-1009.\n\n256.\n\nDuring oral argument, Respondent reiterated its written arguments that Articles 45(1) and 45(2) represent separate and different regimes. Respondent focused on the plain and ordinary meaning of the provisions, particularly the use of the adverb \"[n]otwithstanding\" at the beginning of Article 45(2), as well as the extensive *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* demonstrating that Article 45(2) was drafted because of the specific concerns of several countries regarding political obstacles to provisional application. Respondent also highlighted the 1994 EU Joint Statement, in which the Council, the Commission and the Member States of the EU agreed, according to Respondent, that Article 45(1) does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the signatories and that \"on the basis of this interpretation of Article 45(1) to the ECT, a signatory is not bound to enter a declaration of non-application, as is provided for in Article 45(2) of the ECT.\" Finally, with the help of a comparative timeline of ECT negotiations and political events in Russia, Respondent sought to demonstrate that, while the ECT was being negotiated, the Russian Federation was undergoing dramatic political and constitutional change which, Respondent argues, made it very difficult for Russia to be able to take a firm stand on the inconsistency of provisional application under the ECT.\n\n257.\n\nDuring the oral hearing, Claimant challenged Respondent's arguments. It referred to the clear language of Articles 45(1) and 45(2) and submitted that, whereas Article 45(1) contains \"the obligation\" to apply the ECT provisionally, Article 45(2) is the mechanism which allows a State to opt out of that obligation on grounds of inconsistency or for any other reason. Claimant also sought to demonstrate, by highlighting testimony from the cross-examination of Mr. Fremantle, that the negotiating countries did place emphasis on the importance of reciprocity. Finally, according to Claimant, a careful analysis of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* confirms that Article 45(2) was conceived as the necessary mechanism for the implementation of the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1).\n\n258.\n\nIn its oral reply submissions, Respondent addressed mainly the issues of reciprocity and transparency. It submitted that the parties had agreed upon a formal concept of reciprocity in relation to Article 45(1), namely that \"[e]ach signatory assume[d] the obligation to apply the Treaty to the extent not inconsistent with its domestic law.\"42 Respondent again highlighted the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*. Respondent sought to demonstrate that Article 45(2) was not inserted to provide a transparency discipline to countries relying on Article 45(1), but rather to allow a separate regime for certain countries to be able to opt out of provisional application for reasons other than legal or constitutional inconsistency.\n\nHearing Transcript, 1 December 2008, p. 4:9-11.\n\n259.\n\nIn rebuttal, Claimant countered in relation to the reciprocity issue (again by reference to Mr. Fremantle's testimony) and argued that the State practice of countries like Austria did not support Respondent's reliance on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) because those countries were transparent in putting other countries and their investors on notice that they could not and would not apply the ECT provisionally. Claimant argued that Respondent's analysis of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* was misleading since it was not presented in chronological order. Again, Claimant sought to demonstrate, by reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, that the negotiators had inserted in Article 45(2) a mechanism to implement the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1). As for the 1994 EU Joint Statement, Claimant argued that, on its face, the document shows that the EU was not convinced of the interpretation of Article 45(1) on which it was basing its position. In any event, Claimant maintained, the EU has no or very little competence in relation to Part III of the ECT (on investment promotion and protection). Finally, Claimant contrasted the transparency of the European Community, which declared that it was applying the ECT \"... to the extent that it has competence for the matters governed by the Treaty,\" with the conduct of the Russian Federation, which \"let the world think that [it was] applying the Treaty provisionally.\"43\n\nHearing Transcript, 1 December 2008, p.144:14-16.\n\n**b) Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe applicable rules of treaty interpretation, as codified by the VCLT, read as follows:\n\n*Article 31\u2014General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Article 32\u2014Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n261.\n\nEach side deployed arguments based on the ordinary meaning of Article 45, on State practice and on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*.\n\n262.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal begins by considering the language of Article 45 and its ordinary meaning in its context and in the light of the Treaty's object and purpose. After having considered the totality of the evidence and reviewed the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal has little difficulty in concluding that Respondent's thesis and interpretation of Articles 45(1) and 45(2) are to be preferred over those of Claimant. Article 45(1), while establishing a binding obligation for each signatory to apply the ECT provisionally, on its face limits the scope of that obligation through the Limitation Clause beginning with \"to the extent.\" Nothing in the language of Article 45 suggests that the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) is dependent on the mandatory making of a declaration under Article 45(2). To the contrary, as argued by Respondent, the use of the word \"may\" rather than \"shall\" in relation to the making of a declaration makes clear that a declaration under Article 45(2)(a) is permissive, not obligatory. Furthermore, the use of the word \"[n]otwithstanding\" to introduce Article 45(2) plainly suggests that the declaration in Article 45(2)(a) can be made whether or not there in fact exists any inconsistency between \"such provisional application\" of the ECT and a signatory's constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n263.\n\nClaimant argues that paragraph (1) of Article 45 sets out the principle of provisional application, and that paragraph (2) sets out the mechanism which must necessarily be invoked by a signatory to opt out of provisional application. As Respondent points out, however, it is not uncommon for a limitation clause of the kind included in Article 45(1) to be self-executing. Indeed, Article 45(2)(c), which claws back the provisional application of Part VII of the Treaty for a signatory that has made an opt-out declaration under Article 45(2)(a), contains a similar limitation clause which, on its face, is selfexecuting and clearly does not require a declaration.\n\n264.\n\nIn sum, the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Articles 45(1) and 45(2), when read together, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that the *declaration* which is referred to in Article 45(2) is a declaration which is not necessarily linked to the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1).\n\n265.\n\nFurther support for the Tribunal's conclusion is provided by the State practice of some of the other signatories to the ECT. In particular, the Tribunal notes that while twelve States did make a formal declaration under Article 45(2) opting out of provisional application, six States (Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal and Turkey) relied on the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1), or the ability to opt out of provisional application for inconsistency with the domestic regime, *without delivering a formal declaration* to the Depository under Article 45(2). While the Tribunal accepts Claimant's point that four of these countries made some form of declaration prior to signing the Treaty (Austria, Italy, Romania and Portugal), both Luxembourg and Turkey relied on Article 45(1) when they signed the ECT without submitting any kind of declaration.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant made extensive reference to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* in an attempt to support its argument that there was a linkage between Article 45(1) and Article 45(2)(a). Claimant highlighted the chronology of the development of Article 45 and pointed to the many proposals and counter proposals of the negotiating parties which, it argued, demonstrate the linkage. The Tribunal acknowledges that the preparatory work of the Treaty could lead to a finding of linkage between Articles 45(1) and 45(2).\n\n267.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal recalls that, according to the VCLT's principles of treaty interpretation, Article 32 provides supplementary means of interpretation. Under Article 32 of the VCLT, recourse may be had to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* :\n\nin order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that its interpretation of Article 45 resulting from the application of the general rule of interpretation leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Nor has the Tribunal found that its interpretation of Article 45 according to Article 31 of the VCLT \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\"; quite the contrary. The Tribunal recognizes that, in practice, tribunals and other treaty interpreters may consider the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* whenever they are pleaded, whether or not the text is ambiguous or obscure or leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result. But, in the present case, the Tribunal concludes that the plain and ordinary meaning to be given to these two treaty provisions, read together, demonstrates that there is no linkage between them. It is thus the terms of the Treaty as finally adopted that govern.44\n\nAs Professor Reisman notes: \"Article 32 provides only a supplementary means of interpretation. Parties to a dispute are first obliged to construe the ordinary meaning of the text in application of Article 31.\" Professor W. Michael Reisman, *Opinion concerning Arbitral Jurisdiction under the European Energy Charter Treaty with Respect to the Russian Federation in the Yukos Case*, 28 June 2006, para. 15. He further cites *Methanex Corp. v. United States*, First Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 7 August 2002 (UNCITRAL). Professor Crawford, for his part, affirms that *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* \"cannot contradict the actual language of the treaty (absent manifest absurdity).\" Professor James Crawford, SC, *Further Opinion on Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues*, 3 May 2007, para. 34. *See also*, *e.g.*, *Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain*, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1995, p. 6 (applying Article 31 of the VCLT and discussing the proper role of *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*).\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its conclusion is in harmony with the conclusion reached by the ICSID tribunal in the *Kardassopoulos*.45 In a passage which the Tribunal finds apposite to the present case, that tribunal reasoned as follows:\n\nThere is no necessary link between paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 45. A declaration made under paragraph (2) may be, but does not have to be, motivated by an inconsistency between provisional application and something in the State's domestic law; there may be other reasons which prompt a State to make such a declaration. Equally, a State whose situation is characterised by such inconsistency is entitled to rely on the proviso to paragraph (1) without the need to make, in addition, a declaration under paragraph (2). The Tribunal is therefore unable to read into the failure of either State to make a declaration of the kind referred to in Article 45(2) any implication that it therefore acknowledges that there is no inconsistency between provisional application and its domestic law.46\n\n*Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 July 2007.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 228.\n\n**3. Is a Declaration Required under Article 45(1)?**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nHaving concluded that the regimes limiting or excluding provisional application in Articles 45(1) and 45(2) are independent of one another, the Tribunal now addresses the question whether some form of prior declaration or notice to the other signatories is nevertheless required under Article 45(1) in order for a signatory of the ECT to be able to later invoke the Limitation Clause. Since it is common ground between the Parties that Respondent did not make such a prior declaration or give prior notice, an affirmative answer to this question would dispose of the Article 45 issue in favour of Claimant.\n\n**a) Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIn its First Memorial, Respondent argues that no declaration is required pursuant to Article 45(1). In support of its position, Respondent highlights the case of Luxembourg. In Luxembourg, the bill submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval of the ECT stated explicitly as follows:\n\nThe adoption of this Treaty being based on Article 37 of the constitution of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, there will be no provisional application of this Treaty in Luxembourg up until its due and proper ratification.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n272.\n\nLuxembourg was not included on the Energy Charter Conference Secretariat's preliminary list of signatories that indicated either that they would not apply the Treaty provisionally in accordance with Article 45(1) or that they made or intended to make a declaration under Article 45(2)(a). Respondent concludes:\n\nThus, the language of the Treaty itself, its negotiating history, and the practice of signatories demonstrates conclusively that provisional application of the Treaty is subject to a signatory's constitution, laws and regulations pursuant to Article 45(1) of the Treaty, regardless of whether the signatory made a declaration pursuant to Article 45(2).\n\n273.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Claimant argues that, even if Article 45(1) operates independently of Article 45(2), both provisions nevertheless require an express declaration of some kind. The rationale for the requirement, argues Claimant, is transparency: no State is supposed to know or should be required to know another State's internal legal constraints. Finally, Claimant also refers to State practice:\n\nAs regards the ECT, all signatories that have declined to apply the Treaty on a provisional basis have made a declaration to that effect. The Russian Federation, however, has not made any declaration, at any time, in any manner and on any basis with respect to the provisional application of the ECT.\n\n274.\n\nIn its Second Memorial, Respondent again highlights the example of Luxembourg. In addition, invoking the expert opinions of eminent Finnish, German and French jurists, Respondent asserts that Finland, Germany and France each relied on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) because of an inconsistency between its internal laws and the obligation of provisional application without making a declaration.\n\n275.\n\nIn response, Claimant argues in its Rejoinder that the fundamental principles of transparency and reciprocity in modern international law dictate that other signatories be put on timely notice of legal barriers to provisional application:\n\nFor the sake of transparency and predictability, it is only legitimate that States, when negotiating an instrument as important as the ECT and a binding mechanism as important as provisional application, are informed at the time of signature of their counterparts' unwillingness (for political reasons or otherwise) or inability (for constitutional reasons or otherwise) to apply to the Treaty on a provisional basis.\n\n276.\n\nThe importance of these principles, Claimant submits, is illustrated by Article 45(3)(b) of the ECT, which states that, in the event that a signatory terminates provisional application, the signatory's obligation to apply Parts III and V of the ECT with respect to any investment made during such provisional application shall nevertheless remain in effect for twenty years following the effective date of termination.\n\n277.\n\nClaimant, as evidence of transparency, notes that six States flagged their respective concerns with provisional application under Article 45(1) during the negotiations, namely Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Japan, Norway and Romania. As regards Finland, Germany and France, which Respondent refers to as examples of countries that remained silent yet relied on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1), Claimant submits that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* do not establish that any of these countries ever took the view during the negotiations that they had an issue of \"inconsistency\" that would create an obstacle to the provisional application of the ECT. Claimant adds that, while emphasis was placed during the negotiations of the ECT on the need for States wishing to opt out of provisional application to inform the other parties prior to signature,47 it is noteworthy that the Russian Federation was not among the delegations which stated that provisional application was not acceptable to them; to the contrary, Claimant asserts, the Russian Federation emphasized the importance of provisional application throughout the negotiations.\n\n*See* Energy Charter Secretariat Note, 28 April 1994, Exhibit R-355.\n\n278.\n\nRespondent's position on this issue was well summarized in its Pre-Hearing Skeleton Argument:\n\nAt least six States separately stated that they considered themselves entitled to rely on the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) without making an opt-out declaration. A Joint Statement of the EU Member States, the Council and the Commission of the European Union is to the same effect. The informal transparency declarations made by several States, relied on by Claimants, are unavailing. While some States did make transparency declarations, none of the transparency declarations was ever delivered to the Treaty Depository, as required by Article 45(2)(a), and several States which expressly relied on Article 45(1), including Germany, France, Spain, and Luxembourg, never made transparency declarations. Though not legally relevant, the Russian Federation's failure to make a transparency declaration is not surprising, given the extraordinarily rapid pace of legal and constitutional change in Russia in the period in question. Under the chaotic circumstances then prevailing, no detailed analysis of the Treaty's consistency with Russian law could fairly be expected.\n\n279.\n\nIn oral argument, Respondent further developed each one of the points dealt with in the previous paragraph.\n\n280.\n\nIn response, Claimant pointed to the tables created by the ECT Secretariat concerning the position of signatories that did not intend to apply the ECT provisionally. Both the original list dated 19 December 199448 and the updated list dated 1 March 199549 identify certain signatories which intended not to apply the ECT provisionally \"in accordance with Article 45(1)\" and others as having made a declaration that they would not apply the ECT provisionally \"in accordance with Article 45(2)(a).\" Claimant's submission, in respect of these lists, is that even those countries which relied only on Article 45(1) nevertheless responded to the ECT Secretariat's request that their position in relation to provisional application be made clear to all the other signatories of the Treaty.\n\nAnnex C-1003.\n\nAnnex C-1004.\n\n281.\n\nClaimant also made the related argument that the Russian Federation should be estopped today from claiming constitutional or other legal impediments to provisional application because, not only did it give no notice of inconsistency under Article 45(1), it had, rather, throughout the negotiation of the ECT, consistently been a strong proponent of provisional application and an ardent advocate of a robust regime.\n\n**b) Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision on this issue turns on the distinction which must be made between what may have been said to be desirable during the negotiations and what, eventually, became legally required in the Treaty. The evidence which Claimant has adduced makes it abundantly clear that, during the negotiations, a number of States stressed the importance of transparency when discussing the inconsistency provision of what eventually became Article 45(1). The Tribunal notes in this connection that the six delegations (Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Japan, Norway and Romania) that had flagged their problems with provisional application during the negotiations ended up filing or making some form of declaration. It is equally clear that the Secretariat encouraged signatories to be transparent in relation to provisional application and the obligations which flowed from such provisional application and, in this connection, tracked the signatories' intentions vis-\u00e0-vis provisional application under either Articles 45(1) or 45(2). The Tribunal accepts that, throughout the ECT negotiations, great emphasis was put on transparency by different actors, including the Russian Federation.\n\n283.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that, at the end of the day, when the negotiations were concluded and the ECT signed by the Russian Federation, Article 45(1) did not expressly require any form of declaration or notification in order to allow a signatory to invoke the Limitation Clause. Transparency did not trump the clear inconsistency provision of Article 45(1). Applying the rules of interpretation of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, which were quoted earlier, the Tribunal cannot read into Article 45(1) of the ECT a notification requirement which the text does not disclose and which no recognized legal principle dictates.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes, based on the ordinary meaning of Article 45(1) in its context, and subject to considerations of estoppel (addressed below), that the Russian Federation may, even after years of stalwart and unqualified support for provisional application and, until this arbitration, without ever invoking the Limitation Clause, claim an inconsistency between the provisional application of the ECT and its internal laws in order to seek to avoid the application of Part V of the ECT.\n\n285.\n\nIn closing its analysis on this issue from the point of view of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal notes Claimant's argument that the object and purpose of the ECT, namely investment promotion and protection, requires the Tribunal to read a notification requirement into Article 45(1). The Tribunal cannot accept this argument. The evidence, particularly the testimony of Mr. Fremantle, which it accepts on this point, demonstrates that the negotiating parties were driven by their objective to have as many signatories as possible apply the ECT provisionally from the very beginning.50 The relative flexibility of Article 45(1), interpreted in accordance with its terms as not requiring any notification or declaration, certainly serves this purpose.\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 18 November 2008, p. 163:7-15. The Tribunal also notes Professor Crawford's statement that one of the main functions of provisional application of treaties generally is \"giving immediate effect to treaty provisions because of their importance or urgency.\" Professor James Crawford, SC, *Further Opinion on Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues*, 3 May 2007, para. 22.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal noted above that its conclusion on the interpretation of Article 45(1) was subject to considerations of estoppel. Indeed, Claimant argued that the Russian Federation should be estopped from seeking to rely on the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) due to its long-standing and unqualified support for the provisional application of the ECT during the negotiations. Respondent replied that the conditions for the existence of a situation of estoppel are not met in this case because, according to the *North Sea Continental Shelf Cases*, Claimant, to succeed with its estoppel argument, would need to establish more than mere support by the Russian Federation during the negotiations of the Treaty for the provisional application of the ECT.\n\n287.\n\nRespondent referred the Tribunal to the following passage from the judgment of the International Court of Justice (\" **ICJ** \") in the *North Sea Continental Shelf Cases* :\n\n[I]t appears to the court that only the existence of a situation of estoppel could suffice to lend substance to [the contention that the Federal Republic was bound by the Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf] [...], - that is to say if the Federal Republic were now precluded from denying the applicability of the conventional r\u00e9gime, by reason of past conduct, declarations, etc., which not only clearly and consistently evidence acceptance of that r\u00e9gime, but also had caused Denmark or the Netherlands, in reliance on such conduct, detrimentally to change position or suffer some prejudice.51\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*North Sea Continental Shelf Cases* (*Germany v. Denmark* / *Germany v. Netherlands*), ICJ Judgment of 20 February 1969, ICJ Reports 1969, p.3, Exhibit R-415, p.26, para. 30.\n\n288.\n\nApplying the standard thus established by the ICJ, the Tribunal concludes that the present case does not satisfy the conditions for the existence of a situation of estoppel. The Tribunal finds that the estoppel argument fails principally because Respondent's support for provisional application of the ECT during the negotiations, even if it could be considered \"consistent,\" never \"clearly\" excluded the possibility that Respondent was in fact relying on its interpretation of the operation of the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) which would in any event exclude or limit provisional application of the Treaty.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore now turns to the issue of what effect should be given to the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) of the ECT.\n\n**4. What Effect Should Be Given to the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1)?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) All-or-Nothing vs. \"Piecemeal\" Approach**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Respondent may rely on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) even though it has neither made a declaration under Article 45(2) nor served any prior notice under Article 45(1). Thus, the Tribunal must determine what effect should be given to the Limitation Clause itself and it now turns its attention to that issue.\n\n291.\n\nIt is helpful to recall the text of Article 45(1):\n\nEach signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n292.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal must address the preliminary question of what triggers the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1). The Parties' positions differ. According to Respondent, the clause requires a \"piecemeal\" approach which calls for the analysis of the consistency of each provision of the ECT with the Constitution, laws and regulations of the Russian Federation. According to Claimant, the inquiry is an \"all-or-nothing\" exercise which requires an analysis and determination of whether the principle of provisional application *per se* is inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation. The Parties' arguments will now be summarized.\n\n**(i) Parties' Submissions**\n----------------------------\n\n293.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1), by giving priority to the Constitution, ensures that provisional application of the ECT does not infringe upon the prerogatives of the Legislature (in Russia, the State Duma): any particular provision of the ECT thus applies on a provisional basis, Respondent submits, only if it is either (a) in conformity with existing legislation, (b) within the exclusive competence of the Executive or (c) approved by the Duma.\n\n294.\n\nIn its written submissions, Respondent argues that the plain language of Article 45(1), its context, the Treaty's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, the circumstances at the time of the Treaty's conclusion and State practice in the application of the Treaty all support the conclusion that the applicability of the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) must be examined on a provision-by-provision basis. Specifically, Respondent submits as follows:\n\n\u2022 In common usage, confirmed by standard dictionary definitions, \" to the extent that \" refers to the \"scope\" or the \"width\" of provisional application. \" To the extent that \" is precisely the language used when drafters of a clause in a treaty or a statute wish to make clear that a provision is to be applied only insofar as what then follows is the case. If the drafters had intended that the Treaty would be provisionally applied in whole or not at all, Article 45(1) would have instead provided for the Treaty's provisional application \"if\" such provisional application is not inconsistent with a signatory's domestic laws. In addition, the drafters of the Treaty, adds Respondent, could not seriously have intended that a signatory's provisional application of the entire Treaty could in principle be inconsistent with a signatory's \"regulations.\"\n\n\u2022 The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* confirm that the negotiating States expected that provisional application would differ from country to country based on different domestic inconsistencies and that even relatively minor regulations could result in the non-application *pro tanto* of an inconsistent Treaty provision. Respondent concludes that even a signatory which had no objection in principle to provisional application would only have to apply the Treaty's investment protection provisions to the extent they were not inconsistent with the signatory's own constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n\u2022 State practice is fully in accord with Respondent's interpretation. Respondent refers to the 1994 EU Joint Statement to the effect that Article 45(1), \"defining the conditions and limits for the provisional application of the ECT by the Signatories [...] does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the Signatories.\" With specific reference to the Russian Federation, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom stated as recently as 7 February 2006 in the House of Commons that Article 45 of the Treaty \"places some obligations on the Russian Federation, but only to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations\" [emphasis added].52\n\n*See* House of Commons Hansard Written Answers, pt. 3, Column 1045 W et seq., Exhibit R-365.\n\n295.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Claimant presents a comprehensive rebuttal of Respondent's arguments, starting with the argument based on the plain meaning of the words used in the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1). Claimant notes that the express limitation of Article 45(1) is: \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with [each signatory's] constitution, laws or regulations.\" According to Claimant, therefore, what must be consistent with a signatory's domestic law is \"such provisional application.\" In other words, Claimant asserts, each signatory agrees to be bound by the Treaty if the principle of provisional application is consistent with its domestic law. If, on the other hand, a signatory's domestic law does not allow it to be bound by way of provisional application, it may decline to assume any international obligations under the Treaty.\n\n296.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that Article 45(1) allows for a \"piecemeal\" assessment of inconsistency between particular provisions of the ECT and a signatory's domestic law, which could lead to provisional application of some but not all provisions of the Treaty, Claimant argues that neither Respondent nor its experts provide any justification for the basis on which the text of Article 45 would make a distinction between a \"partial\" application under Article 45(1) and an \"all or nothing\" application under Article 45(2)(a). To the contrary, Claimant observes, both provisions refer to \"provisional application\" without further qualification: consistency of \"provisional application\" with a signatory's internal law under Article 45(1), and opting out of \"provisional application\" under Article 45(2)(a).\n\n297.\n\nIndeed, Claimant argues that Respondent's interpretation, even if admissible under the most basic principles of treaty law\u2014which, Claimant argues, do not permit domestic law to take priority over international obligations\u2014requires a rewriting of Article 45 to accord with Respondent's submission. According to Claimant, Respondent's interpretation would require the Tribunal to accept the equivalent of the following revision: \"Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that ~~such provisional application is~~[the Treaty's provisions are] not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" Respondent's interpretation, Claimant argues, would add an entirely new concept\u2014inconsistency with the substantive provisions\u2014that finds no basis in the text of the Treaty.\n\n298.\n\nClaimant also refers to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty. Claimant notes that the initial exception to the obligation to apply the Treaty provisionally was introduced by the U.S. delegation in the following terms:\n\nThe signatories agree to apply this Agreement provisionally following signature, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with their national laws pending its entry into force in accordance with Article 40 above.\n\nClaimant submits, in this respect, that the language \"such provisional application,\" which was never modified afterwards, reflected the requirement of consistency between \"provisional application\" *per se* and the signatories' internal laws and not consistency between \"the provisions of the Treaty\" and the signatories' internal laws.\n\n299.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that the concept of \"inconsistency\" under Article 45 must necessarily relate only to the principle of provisional application and not to the Treaty's substantive provisions, because Part VI of the Treaty, entitled \"Transitional Provisions,\" already addressed the issue of granting signatories sufficient time to adapt the particulars of their legal regime to the framework of the Treaty. Article 32 of the ECT provides as follows:\n\n(1) In recognition of the need for time to adapt to the requirements of a market economy, a Contracting Party listed in Annex T may temporarily suspend full compliance with its obligations under one or more of the following provisions of this Treaty [...]\n\nClaimant notes that the Russian Federation filed notifications with respect to Article 6(2) and Article 20(3) and was thus listed in Annex T of the \"Contracting Parties entitled to transitional arrangements.\"\n\n300.\n\nDuring the hearing, each side presented a focused version of its arguments on this point, in large measure emphasizing differences on what each considered the proper ordinary meaning to attribute to the language used in Article 45(1).\n\n**(ii) Tribunal's Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n301.\n\nHaving reviewed the totality of the evidence and considered the written and oral arguments of both Parties, the Tribunal finds that the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 45(1), in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, favours Claimant's interpretation. In the Tribunal's opinion, by signing the ECT, the Russian Federation agreed that the Treaty *as a whole* would be applied provisionally pending its entry into force unless *the principle* of provisional application itself were inconsistent \"with its constitution, laws or regulations.\"\n\n302.\n\nAgain, the starting point for the Tribunal must be the words used in Article 45(1). The Limitation Clause states that each signatory agrees to apply the Treaty provisionally \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\" Respondent and Claimant focus on different parts of this clause in support of their respective positions:\n\n\u2022 Respondent argues that \" \u2018 [t]o the extent that ' is precisely the language used when drafters of a clause in a treaty or a statute wish to make clear that a provision is to be applied only insofar as what then follows is the case.\" Respondent adds that had the drafters intended the Treaty to be provisionally applied in whole or not at all, Article 45(1) would have instead provided for the Treaty's provisional application \"if\" such provisional application is not inconsistent with a signatory's domestic laws.\n\n\u2022 Claimant, by contrast, emphasizes the use of the terms \"such provisional application\" in the Limitation Clause: \"to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with [each signatory's] constitution, laws or regulations.\" According to Claimant, therefore, what must be consistent with a signatory's domestic law is \"such provisional application.\" In other words, Claimant asserts, each signatory agrees to be bound by the Treaty if *the principle* of provisional application is consistent with its domestic law.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that neither party has properly parsed the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1). While each party has provided a starting point for the analysis, neither has carried it through to its conclusion:\n\n\u2022 Considering Respondent's argument first, the Tribunal agrees that the phrase \"to the extent that \" is often the language used when drafters of a clause in a treaty or a statute wish to make clear that a provision is to be applied only insofar as what then follows is the case. Far from being determinative of the meaning of the Limitation Clause, however, the use of the introductory words \"to the extent that\" requires the Tribunal to examine carefully the words that follow, namely \"that such provisional application is not inconsistent with [each signatory's] constitution, laws or regulations.\"\n\n\u2022 Turning to Claimant's argument about the meaning of these words, the Tribunal finds that Claimant does not provide sufficient support for its interpretation of the phrase \" such provisional application \" as necessarily referring to the principle of provisional application. Article 45(1) does not refer anywhere to the principle of provisional application, but rather to \"[e]ach signatory agree[ing] to apply this Treaty provisionally...\"\n\n304.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the key to the interpretation of the Limitation Clause rests in the use of the adjective \" such \" in the phrase \" such provisional application.\" \"Such,\" according to Black's Law Dictionary (Seventh Edition), means \"that or those; having just been mentioned.\" The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary (Tenth Edition) defines \"such\" as \"of the character, quality, or extent previously indicated or implied.\" The phrase \"such provisional application,\" as used in Article 45(1), therefore refers to the provisional application previously mentioned in that Article, namely the provisional application of \"this Treaty.\"\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, therefore, that the meaning of the phrase \"such provisional application\" is context-specific, in that its meaning is derived from the particular use of provisional application to which it refers. In Article 45(1), the particular use of provisional application to which it refers is provisional application of \"this Treaty.\" Accordingly, Article 45(1) can therefore be read as follows:\n\n(1) Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that the provisional application of this Treaty is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n306.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal refers to the Limitation Clause in Article 45(2)(c), which reads:\n\n(c) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any signatory making a declaration referred to in subparagraph (a) shall apply Part VII provisionally pending the entry into force of the Treaty for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its laws or regulations.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nIn this context, the phrase \"such provisional application\" necessarily has a different meaning, referring to the provisional application of only Part VII of the Treaty.\n\n307.\n\nIn order to interpret the meaning of the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1), and thereby determine the scope of Respondent's obligation under Article 45(1), the Tribunal must therefore determine what is meant by \"the provisional application of this Treaty,\" for it is the inconsistency of \"such provisional application\" which determines the scope of Respondent's obligation under Article 45(1).\n\n308.\n\nThere are two possible interpretations of the phrase \"the provisional application of this Treaty\": it can mean either \"the provisional application of the entire Treaty\" or \"the provisional application of some parts of the Treaty.\" The Tribunal finds that, in context, the former interpretation accords better with the ordinary meaning that should be given to the terms, as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT. Indeed, without any further qualification, it is to be presumed that a reference to \"this Treaty\" is meant to refer to the Treaty as a whole, and not only part of the Treaty.\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its finding on the scope of provisional application in Article 45(1) is entirely consistent with the decision on jurisdiction rendered in the *Kardassopoulos* case. In the relevant passages of that decision, to which the Tribunal subscribes, that tribunal wrote:\n\n205. Article 45(1) does not say in terms what it meant by saying that each signatory agreed to \"apply this Treaty provisionally.\" The meaning of that concept is thus to be determined by (i) an interpretation of that phrase, and (ii) the generally accepted meaning of the notion of the provisional application of a treaty.\n\n206. As noted in the earlier section of this decision, the general rule for the interpretation of a treaty is set out in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n207. The treaty's context includes in particular the text of the treaty taken as a whole, including its preamble (Article 31(2)). Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention further provides that together with the context:\n\n\"There shall be taken into account [...] any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\"\n\n208. This includes relevant rules of general customary international law.\n\n209. Applying the ECT provisionally is used in contradistinction to its entry into force: \"[...] agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force [.. Provisional application is therefore not the same as entry into force. But the ECT's provisional application is a course to which each signatory \"agrees\" in Article 45(1): it is (subject to other provisions of the paragraph) thus a matter of legal obligation. The Tribunal cannot therefore accept Respondent's argument that provisional application is only aspirational in character.\n\n210. It is \"this Treaty\" which is to be provisionally applied, *i.e.,* the Treaty as a whole and in its entirety and not just a part of it; and use of the word \"application\" requires that the ECT be \"applied.\" Since that application is to be provisional \"pending its entry into force\" the implication is that it would be applied on the same basis as would in due course result from the ECT's (definitive) entry into force, and as if it had already done so.\n\n211. It follows that the language used in Article 45(1) is to be interpreted as meaning that each signatory State is obliged, even before the ECT has formally entered into force, to apply the whole ECT as if it had already done so.\n\n[...]\n\n219. There is, nevertheless, in the Tribunal's view a sufficiently well-established practice of provisional application of treaties to generate a generally accepted understanding of what is meant by that notion. Where what is in issue is, as in the present case, the provisional application of the whole treaty, then such provisional application imports the application of all its provisions as if they were already in force, even though the treaty's proper or definitive entry into force has not yet occurred.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination also becomes obvious when the alternative phrases are inserted into Article 45(1), leading to a choice between the following alternative interpretations:\n\nEach signatory agrees to apply this entire Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that the provisional application of the entire Treaty is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nOR\n\nEach signatory agrees to apply some parts of this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that the provisional application of some parts of the Treaty is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n311.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, there is no basis to conclude that the signatories would have assumed an obligation to apply only part of the Treaty provisionally, without making such partial provisional application explicit. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) contains an \"all-or-nothing\" proposition: either the entire Treaty is applied provisionally, or it is not applied provisionally at all.\n\n312.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal concludes that the determination of this \"all-or-nothing\" question depends on the consistency of the principle of provisional application with a signatory's domestic law. The alternative\u2014that the question hinges on whether, in fact, each and every provision of the Treaty is consistent with a signatory's domestic legal regime\u2014would run squarely against the object and purpose of the Treaty, and indeed against the grain of international law.\n\n313.\n\nUnder the *pacta sunt servanda* rule and Article 27 of the VCLT, a State is prohibited from invoking its internal legislation as a justification for failure to perform a treaty. In the Tribunal's opinion, this cardinal principle of international law strongly militates against an interpretation of Article 45(1) that would open the door to a signatory, whose domestic regime recognizes the concept of provisional application, to avoid the provisional application of a treaty (to which it has agreed) on the basis that one or more provisions of the treaty is contrary to its internal law. Such an interpretation would undermine the fundamental reason why States agree to apply a treaty provisionally. They do so in order to assume obligations immediately pending the completion of various internal procedures necessary to have the treaty enter into force.\n\n314.\n\nAllowing a State to modulate (or, as the case may be, eliminate) the obligation of provisional application, depending on the content of its internal law in relation to the specific provisions found in the Treaty, would undermine the principle that provisional application of a treaty creates binding obligations.\n\n315.\n\nProvisional application as a treaty mechanism is a question of public international law. International law and domestic law should not be allowed to combine, through the deployment of an \"inconsistency\" or \"limitation\" clause, to form a hybrid in which the content of domestic law directly controls the content of an international legal obligation. This would create unacceptable uncertainty in international affairs. Specifically, it would allow a State to make fluctuating, uncertain and un-notified assertions about the content of its domestic law, after a dispute has already arisen. Such a State, as Claimant argues, \"would be bound by nothing but its own whims and would make a mockery of the international legal agreement to which it chose to subject itself.\" A treaty should not be interpreted so as to allow such a situation unless the language of the treaty is clear and admits no other interpretation. That is not the case with Article 45(1) of the ECT.\n\n316.\n\nIn respect of the relationship between international obligations and domestic law in the treaty context, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Professor Crawford on \"a strong presumption of the separation of international from national law\":\n\nThe fact is, nonetheless, that international tribunals are reluctant to allow States to plead their internal law as a basis for avoiding what would otherwise appear to be their treaty commitments, and that reluctance extends to cases such as the present. It reflects a strong underlying value against self-judgement and a strong presumption of the separation of international from national law. Article 27 VCLT (and the corollary, Articles 3 and 32 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility) are routinely cited across a range of contexts. Even where there is an express treaty exception for domestic legal requirements, that is not treated as a self-judging or \"automatic\" reservation, and it has to be explained to the satisfaction of the international tribunal \u2014 which retains its *Kompetenz-Kompetenz* \u2014 what the domestic requirement means, why it applies and how far it goes.53\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nProfessor James Crawford, SC, *Further Opinion: Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues*, 3 May 2007, para. 15.\n\n317.\n\nTurning specifically to the ECT and the meaning of Article 45(1), Professor Crawford observes as follows:\n\nThe negotiating parties having opted for an unusually strong system of immediate provisional application of the ECT (while allowing States to opt out of it and take the consequences of doing so under Article 45(2)(b)), I do not accept that they intended to allow ready evasion of the regime.54\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 23.\n\n318.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal accepts the testimony of Professor Reisman on this issue. In his Opinion dated 28 June 2006, Professor Reisman writes:\n\nHence, whatever the mode by which provisional application is achieved, \"it can hardly be challenged that provisional application is based on the mutual consent of states.\"55 The alternative view, \"that provisional application is based on a unilateral declaration of intent by contracting parties to *de facto* apply a treaty subject to existing constitutional and legislative possibilities,\" is untenable insofar as \"[t]he adoption of such a view could seriously impair the legal effects of provisional application as national law may prevail over the treaty.\"56 That result would be inconsistent with Article 27 of the Vienna Convention.57\n\nRen\u00e9 Lefeber, \"The Provisional Application of Treaties,\" *in* Jan Klabbers (ed.) *Essays on the Law of Treaties* pp.81, 89 (1998).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nVCLT, Article 27 (\"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\").\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds pertinent to its conclusion the writings of Mr. Osminin, who participated in the drafting of the Russian FLIT and in the negotiation of numerous international treaties entered into by the Russian Federation. He writes as follows:\n\n[T]he principle that \"obligations must be observed\" (*pacta sunt servanda*) extends also to provisionally applied treaties. In this respect the legal consequences of the provisional application of a treaty are the same as the legal consequences of its entry into force. [...] The regime of provisional application presupposes that the obligations arising from the provisionally applied treaty will be complied with in full until the treaty enters into force, or until its provisional application is terminated by mutual agreement of the States among which the treaty is being applied provisionally, or until the State notifies the other States provisionally applying the treaty of its intention not to become a party to the treaty.\"58\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nB.I. Osminin, *Adoption and Implementation of Treaty Obligations by States* (2006), p. 319, Annex C-267.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that its interpretation of the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) is based on its specific language in its context. The Tribunal recognizes, as do Claimant's experts, Professors Crawford and Reisman, that parties negotiating a treaty enjoy drafting freedom and could (using clear and unambiguous language) overcome the \"strong presumption of the separation of international from national law.\" Indeed, parties to a treaty are free to agree to any particular regime. This would include a regime where each signatory could modulate (or eliminate) its obligation of provisional application based on consistency of each provision of the treaty in question with its domestic law. For the reasons set out above, however, agreement to such a regime would need to be clearly and unambiguously expressed, a standard which Article 45(1) does not meet.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation of Article 45(1) is also supported by State practice. As already noted in an earlier section, six States (Austria, Luxembourg, Italy, Romania, Portugal and Turkey) relied expressly on the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1). An analysis of the statements or declarations made by these States confirms that each one of them relied on Article 45(1)\u2014sometimes alone and sometimes in conjunction with Article 45(2))\u2014for the non-application of the *entire* Treaty under the provisional application regime. Respondent itself has described these six signatories as States who \"consider themselves unable to apply and have not applied any provision of the Treaty on a provisional basis.\" Not one of these six States, in other words, relied on the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) for the interpretation now posited by Respondent, namely the selective or partial provisional application of the ECT based on the non-application of only those individual provisions that are claimed to be inconsistent with a signatory's domestic law.\n\n322.\n\nSimilarly, in the lists it maintained to keep track of the intentions of the signatories, the ECT Secretariat identified the States that intended to rely on Article 45(1) as intending to do so in order to avoid provisional application of the Treaty altogether. Thus, the preliminary list of signatories prepared by the ECT Secretariat, dated 19 December 1994, described signatories intending to rely on Article 45(1) as States \"which will not apply the Treaty provisionally in accordance with Article 45(1)\"59 [emphasis added]. This preliminary list identified Austria, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Turkey. The updated list prepared by the ECT Secretariat, dated 1 March 1995, described the same category of signatories in exactly the same way, as States \"which will not apply the Treaty provisionally in accordance with Article 45(1)\"60 [emphasis added]. In addition to the countries already identified on the list dated 19 December 1994, this list included Hungary61 and Luxembourg.\n\nAnnex C-1003.\n\nAnnex C-1004.\n\nHungary ultimately made an opt-out declaration under Article 45(2)(a) of the ECT.\n\n323.\n\nRespondent refers to France, Finland and Germany in order to support its position that some signatories of the ECT in fact do rely on the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) in order to limit or reduce the scope of their provisional application obligation under the Treaty. To make its point, Respondent relies on expert reports in respect of each country, submitted respectively by Professors Pellet, Koskenniemi and Nolte.\n\n324.\n\nIn their respective reports, Professors Pellet, Koskenniemi and Nolte focus on the separation of powers and the treaty-making process in France, Finland and Germany, respectively. The Tribunal notes that Professors Koskenniemi and Nolte, in addition, opine in their reports on the provisional application regime of the ECT. Respondent has not, however, provided any evidence that France, Finland or Germany represented to its counterparts, at the time of the negotiation of the Treaty, that it understood Article 45(1) as meaning that it could rely at any time on this provision in order to single out for exclusion individual ECT provisions that were \"inconsistent\" with its domestic law, or that its obligations under the ECT would be restricted in any manner.\n\n325.\n\nRespondent also seeks support for its interpretation of Article 45(1) from the interpretation given to Article 45(1) by the Council, Commission and Member States of the European Union. In connection with the EU Council's decisions approving the provisional application of the ECT by the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, the following joint statement by the Council, Commission and the Member States (the 1994 EU Joint Statement) was entered into the minutes:\n\nArticle 45(1) of the European Energy Charter Treaty should be interpreted as defining the conditions and limits for the provisional application of the ECT by the Signatories:\n\n(a) it does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the Signatories;\n\n(b) on the basis of this interpretation of Article 45(1) to the ECT, a Signatory is not bound to enter a declaration of non-application, as is provided for in Article 45(2) ECT;\n\n(c) this interpretation allows the Community to limit the provisional application to the matters which fall under its competence.\n\n326.\n\nRespondent points to the 1994 EU Joint Statement as an example of State practice supporting an interpretation of Article 45(1) that would allow the partial provisional application of the ECT, in this case limited to those matters falling within the competence of the European Community.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this argument unpersuasive:\n\n\u2022 First, even if the 1994 EU Joint Statement could be said to support Respondent's position, the weight of State practice, as demonstrated above, supports Claimant's position\u2014namely that the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) has been used as the basis for opting out of the provisional application of the Treaty altogether.\n\n\u2022 Second, and even more important, the Tribunal does not find that the 1994 EU Joint Statement supports Respondent's position. The 1994 EU Joint Statement does not say, and cannot be read as meaning, that certain elements of the ECT will not be provisionally applied by the European Community because they are inconsistent with the Community's internal legal order. The 1994 EU Joint Statement, rather, says that Article 45(1) \"does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the Signatories.\" On this basis, the 1994 EU Joint Statement concludes that the European Community can safely sign the ECT, and accept the obligation of provisional application, without taking on any obligation to do anything that is beyond its competence. This is therefore not so much an example of partial provisional application of the ECT due to inconsistency with the EC's legal order, as it is an example of the EC's partial jurisdiction for the provisional application of the whole ECT\u2014meaning, necessarily, that some parts of the ECT simply cannot be provisionally applied by the EC.\n\n\u2022 Third, the 1994 EU Joint Statement entered into the minutes has no legal or binding value, as opposed to the Council decisions themselves. The Tribunal notes that the preamble of the Council decision in respect of the provisional application of the ECT by the European Community does not refer to Article 45(1) of the ECT or the notion of partial provisional application due to inconsistency. Rather, the Council decision focuses on the partial competence of the European Community for the matters covered by the provisional application of the Treaty:\n\nWhereas the provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty will help attain the objectives of the European Community;\n\nWhereas the European Community has competence for parts of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n[...]\n\nThe European Community shall apply on a provisional basis f rom the time of signature the Energy Charter Treaty to the extent that it has competence for the matters governed by the Treaty.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n\u2022 Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Council Legal Service considered the interpretation of Articles 45(1) and (2) included in the 1994 EU Joint Statement to be \"restrictive and possibly unilateral\" and cautioned that the interpretation could \"create a problem of transparency in relation to other negotiating Parties.\"62\n\nReport from the Presidency to the Permanent Representatives Committee, 8 December 1994, Annex C-921, at p.4 n. 6, *in fine*.\n\n328.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusion on the interpretation of Article 45(1), the Tribunal does not find it necessary to consider the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* concerning the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1).\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Article 45(1) requires an analysis and determination of whether the principle of provisional application *per se* is inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation. If it is not inconsistent, then this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear Claimant's claims under Article 26 of the Treaty, which would apply provisionally in the Russian Federation in accordance with Article 45(1). It is to that issue that the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**b) Is the Principle of Provisional Application Inconsistent with Russian Law?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThere is no significant debate between the Parties on the issue of whether the principle of provisional application *per se* is inconsistent with the Constitution, law or regulations of the Russian Federation. Claimant asserts that the principle is not inconsistent with Russian law, citing ample legislative and doctrinal authorities in support of its submission, and concludes on that basis that the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) is unavailable to the Russian Federation. Respondent does not seriously challenge the authorities cited by Claimant on this point. Respondent's principal argument against provisional application of the ECT, as seen earlier, is based on the interpretation of Article 45(1), not on the assertion that provisional application *per se* is unknown or unrecognized by Russian law.\n\n331.\n\nAlthough the issue therefore does not raise much controversy, the Tribunal nevertheless confirms that Claimant has demonstrated to the Tribunal's satisfaction that the principle of provisional application of treaties is recognized in the Russian Federation, as it was in the Soviet Union.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis commences with the applicable legislation of the Russian Federation. Article 23(1) of the FLIT provides clear and unequivocal confirmation of Claimant's submission:\n\n1. An international treaty or a part thereof may, prior to its entry into force, be applied by the Russian Federation provisionally if the treaty itself so provides or if an agreement to such effect has been reached with the parties that have signed the treaty.\n\n333.\n\nArticle 23(2) of the FLIT then provides that decisions on the provisional application of a treaty shall be made by the body that signs the treaty, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11 of the FLIT. Article 11 of the FLIT, in turn, specifies that the President of the Russian Federation has the authority to negotiate and sign international treaties that are being concluded on behalf of the Russian Federation.\n\n334.\n\nAlthough Professor Avakiyan, one of Respondent's experts, was asked to opine on provisional application, he made no reference to these provisions of the FLIT in his first written opinion. Under cross-examination, Professor Avakiyan acknowledged the legislative basis for provisional application of international treaties in the Russian Federation under the FLIT, and also acknowledged that the FLIT is in conformity with the Constitution and the principle of separation of powers of the Russian Federation.63 Indeed, during oral submissions, Respondent's counsel stated clearly that \"Russian law is of course familiar with the concept of provisional application, and that was never in dispute.\"64\n\nHearing Transcript, 17 November 2008, p. 46:10-16. His own personal opinion was that treaties that have provisions that are inconsistent with Russian law should never be provisionally applied, and that Article 23 of the FLIT, which permits such provisional application, should therefore be amended in order to clarify this limitation. *Ibid.* at pp. 39:22 to 40:5.\n\nHearing Transcript, 26 November 2008, p. 143:5-7.\n\n335.\n\nClaimant's expert on Russian law, Mr. Gladyshev, opined that Article 15(4) of the Constitution gives priority to all international treaties of the Russian Federation over domestic law, whether such treaties are ratified or whether \"the parties agreed to have provisional application of an international treaty as a binding instrument, as they did in the case of the Energy Charter Treaty.\"65\n\nHearing Transcript, 20 November 2008, p. 83:12-15; *see* generally *ibid*. at pp. 81:20 to 83:22.\n\n336.\n\nThe question regarding the principle of provisional application under Russian law was answered perhaps most clearly in the response of the Russian Federation to a question posed in the context of a study commissioned by and prepared for the Committee of Legal Advisers on Public International Law of the Council of Europe in 2001:\n\n*15. Is the provisional application of a treaty before its entry into force possible in your legal system and under what conditions?*\n\nYes, if a treaty itself so provides or signatory states so agreed.66\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nAnnex C-315.\n\n337.\n\nIn his written expert opinions, Mr. Gladyshev referred to the long tradition of provisional application in the treaty practice of the Russian Federation and, previously, of the USSR According to Mr. Gladyshev\u2014and this was not challenged by Respondent\u2014there are currently some 45 treaties being applied provisionally by the Russian Federation.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has no difficulty in concluding that the principle of provisional application is perfectly consistent with the Constitution, laws and regulations of the Russian Federation. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the whole of the ECT applied provisionally in the Russian Federation until such provisional application was terminated, in accordance with the notification that the Russian Federation made on 20 August 2009, pursuant to Article 45(3)(a) of the Treaty, of its intention not to become a Contracting Party to the Treaty. Article 45(3)(a) provides that: \"Termination of provisional application for any signatory shall take effect upon the expiration of 60 days from the date on which such signatory's written notification is received by the Depository.\" The 60-day period expired on 19 October 2009.\n\n339.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Article 45(3)(b) of the Treaty, investment-related obligations, including the obligation to arbitrate investment-related disputes under Part V of the Treaty, remain in force for a period of 20 years following the effective date of termination of provisional application. In the case of the Russian Federation, this means that any investments made in Russia prior to 19 October 2009 will continue to benefit from the Treaty's protections for a period of 20 years\u2014 *i.e.*, until 19 October 2029. As a result, the Tribunal finds that the provisional application of the ECT, including the continuing provisional application of Article 26 in this case, does provide a basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the merits of this claim.\n\n340.\n\nThere remains an issue which, although not controlling in this arbitration, needs nevertheless to be addressed, in the opinion of the Tribunal, in the present Interim Award. The Tribunal refers to the temporal aspect of the Limitation Clause: at what moment in time (or over what period) should a signatory's domestic legal regime be examined in order to determine whether the principle of provisional application is consistent with its laws?\n\n341.\n\nAccording to Respondent, which made the argument in relation to its theory of inconsistency under Article 45(1), there is no temporal restriction in Article 45(1). Respondent thus argues that \"the inconsistency clause in Article 45(1) is not limited to inconsistencies existing at the time of the signature of the Treaty.\"67\n\nHearing Transcript, 26 November 2008, p. 175:5-8.\n\n342.\n\nClaimant's argument on the temporal issue was made in paragraph 232 of its Counter-Memorial:\n\n[T]he coming into existence of the Russian Federation's international obligations under the ECT by virtue of its provisional application was subject to the consistency of such provisional application with Russian law at the time the Russian Federation signed the Treaty.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the determination as to whether or not the principle of provisional application is consistent with the constitution, the laws or the regulations of the host State in which the Investment is made must be made in the light of the constitution, laws and regulations *at the time of signature* of the ECT.\n\n344.\n\nAny other interpretation would allow a State to modify its laws after having signed the ECT in order to evade an obligation that it has assumed by agreeing to provisional application of the Treaty. The Tribunal cannot accept such an interpretation.\n\n345.\n\nIn connection with this temporal issue, the Tribunal notes the representations of the Government of the Russian Federation in the Explanatory Note which it submitted to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation when the ECT was submitted for ratification (\" **ECT Explanatory Note** \"). The following extract from the Note suggests that the time of signature of the Treaty was also the reference point for the Government's assessment of consistency of the \"provisions on provisional application\" with the internal legal regime:\n\nPrior to the entry into force of the ECT, the majority of the Contracting Parties agreed to apply the treaty on a provisional basis. In this respect, it was decided that such provisional application of the ECT would be implemented to the extent that it would not be inconsistent with the constitution, laws and regulations of the country in question.\n\nAt the time for the signing of the ECT, its provisions on provisional application were in conformity with the Russian legal acts. For that reason, the Russian side did not make declarations as to its inability to accept provisional application (such declarations were made by 12 of the 49 ECT signatories).\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n**c) Are the Provisions of the ECT Relating to Dispute Resolution Inconsistent with Russian Law?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's conclusion with respect to the interpretation of Article 45(1), there is no need, in principle, to address Respondent's submission that the provisions of the ECT relating to dispute resolution are themselves inconsistent with Russian law.\n\n347.\n\nHowever, since both sides made extensive submissions to the Tribunal with respect to the so-called \"piecemeal\" approach and because, as will be seen, the Tribunal's analysis and findings with respect to the consistency with Russian laws and Constitution of these provisions of the ECT relating to dispute resolution lead the Tribunal to the same conclusion, the Tribunal has nevertheless decided to set out its analysis under this alternative approach.\n\n348.\n\nAt the outset, however, the Tribunal wishes to state that, as established in the previous section of this Interim Award, Article 45(1) is solely concerned with the consistency of the principle of provisional application with the constitution, laws or regulations of the host State at the time of signature. That is the Tribunal's interpretation of the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1). Once such consistency is established, the Limitation Clause cannot be invoked subsequently to argue inconsistency between the host State's domestic law and specific elements of the ECT, be it the dispute-resolution provisions in Part V of the ECT or the material rules for the protection of investments in Part III of the ECT.\n\n349.\n\nWith this important clarification in mind, the Tribunal will now analyze the dispute-resolution mechanism for investment disputes between investors and the host State, as defined in Articles 1(6), 1(7) and 26 of the ECT, and determine whether or not they are consistent with the Constitution, laws and regulations of the Russian Federation.\n\n**(i) Parties' Submissions**\n----------------------------\n\n350.\n\nUnder Article 26(1) of the ECT, this Tribunal has jurisdiction over \"disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III [of the Treaty].\" Disputes that are not settled amicably may, at the option of the Investor, be submitted to international arbitration. \"Investor\" is defined in Article 1(7). \"Investment\" is defined in Article 1(6).\n\n351.\n\nIn its First Memorial, Respondent submits principally that, in Russia, the power to provide for mandatory dispute resolution in an international forum is vested in the Legislature and that applying Article 26 on a provisional basis as a result of the signature of the ECT by the Executive, before ratification of the Treaty by the Legislature, violates the fundamental principle of the separation of powers under the Constitution.\n\n352.\n\nIn its Skeleton Argument submitted to the Tribunal prior to the hearing, Respondent summarized its inconsistency argument based on the principle of separation of powers as follows:\n\nThe Russian Constitution is based on the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law. Each branch of State power exercises its power independently, and no branch may usurp the power of another branch. The Russian Constitution specifically preserves the prerogatives of Russia's Federal Assembly (parliament) in the treaty-making process\u2014law-making treaties must be ratified by the adoption of a federal law by both the Duma and the Federation Council\u2014and prohibits the Government from legislating through the conclusion and implementation of international treaties that amend or complement federal laws. This ratification requirement is an emanation of the principle of separation of powers established in Article 10 of the Constitution, and is reflected in Article 15(1)(a) of the Federal Law on International Treaties. Under the latter Article, all treaties whose implementation requires \"the amendment of existing or the adoption of new federal laws, and also those establishing rules that are different from those provided for by law,\" are subject to ratification.68\n\n*See* Skeleton Argument, para. 19.\n\n353.\n\nRespondent argues that the arbitration of this dispute in an international forum violates the principle of separation of powers because the Tribunal's jurisdiction is based on Article 26 of the ECT\u2014a provision of a treaty that has not been ratified\u2014whereas, under Russian law, disputes arising from sovereign acts or omissions, including claims for damages for expropriation, may not be submitted to arbitration absent a legislative enactment (including ratification of the ECT) that provides for arbitration.\n\n354.\n\nRespondent also argues that, under Russian law, disputes arising from public and administrative law relationships, such as disputes concerning taxation, enforcement of tax liens, nationalization or criminal-law matters, are not arbitrable. Finally, Respondent submits that arbitration without privity (*i.e.*, arbitration with an investor based on an open offer to arbitrate by the host State, as is the case in Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT) is not recognized under Russian law.\n\n355.\n\nIn its Skeleton Argument, Respondent explained:\n\nDisputes involving the lawfulness of expropriation, taxation measures, bankruptcy, and other regulatory matters are within the exclusive jurisdiction of Russia's courts, and may not be submitted to arbitration. The Russian Federation's Civil Procedure Code, Arbitrazh Procedure Code and Tax Code confirm the exclusive jurisdiction of Russian courts over these issues, and prohibit their arbitration. Claimants' request for damages is based on allegedly illegal sovereign acts of various Russian authorities, none of which under Russian law may be submitted to arbitration, unless a specific law provides otherwise. The Energy Charter Treaty, an unratified treaty, is not such a law.\n\n356.\n\nIn response, Claimant submits in its Counter-Memorial that there is no inconsistency between the provisional application of the ECT, including its dispute-resolution mechanism, and Russian law. In support of its argument, Claimant cites, in particular, the ECT Explanatory Note, which includes an unqualified statement that the provisional application of the ECT was consistent with \"Russian legal acts.\"69\n\n*See* Annex C-143.\n\n357.\n\nClaimant also argues that investor-State arbitration provisions similar to Article 26 of the ECT can be found in various BITs concluded by the Russian Federation, which have been deemed consistent with its laws. Finally, Claimant notes that Respondent's objection to the arbitrability of the subject-matter of Claimant's claims under Russian law is inconsistent with the fact that the Russian Federation has committed itself to submitting such disputes to arbitration in the 38 BITs to which it is a Party that have entered into force.\n\n358.\n\nIn its Second Memorial, Respondent reiterates that many of the ECT's provisions are inconsistent with its Constitution, laws or regulations. It refers to:\n\n\u2022 investor-State arbitration in the absence of a ratified treaty, noting that the Russian Federation's invariable practice is to have every BIT which it signs subject to ratification;\n\n\u2022 the fact that according an EU shell company, such as any one of the three Claimants, the benefit of Part III of the ECT is not in harmony with Article 30 of the P&C Agreement;70\n\n\u2022 the fact that according standing to Yukos' shareholders as \"investors\" is an inadmissible derivative claim unknown to Russian law; and\n\n\u2022 the fact that protecting an \"investment\" which was made without the injection of any foreign capital is contrary to Russian law, according to the expert opinion of Professor Andrey Lisitsyn-Svetlanov.\n\n*See* Exhibit R-286. Respondent submits that the P&C Agreement applies in the instant case as it provides for a framework for investment protection and energy cooperation of which the ECT forms part and, by its very terms (Article 105), prevails over the latter up until the day the ECT has entered into force.\n\n359.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Claimant notes, in particular, that Respondent's position in this arbitration does not accord with the statements made by the Russian Government in the ECT Explanatory Note and in the explanatory notes submitted to the Duma in the context of the ratification of other BITs.71 In none of those documents, Claimant avers, does the Russian Government state that ratification is required because the respective BITs contradict Russian law. At most, ratification is said to be required for the BITs in question because the treaties add something different to the Russian legal framework. Claimant further notes that none of these BITs include a provisional application regime.\n\n*See* Exhibits R-402 through R-406.\n\n360.\n\nDuring the hearing, Respondent's counsel argued that the claims in this arbitration were (a) non-arbitrable under Russian law, (b) within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Russia, and (c) advanced by parties without standing under Russian law.\n\n361.\n\nThere were several arguments advanced by Respondent in relation to inarbitrability. It asserted that:\n\n\u2022 arbitration is permissible under Russian law only in private-law relationships;\n\n\u2022 the subject-matter of arbitration under Russian law is limited to the sphere of civil-law relationships and therefore cannot extend to disputes arising from public-law relationships, including tax matters;72 and\n\n\u2022 in addition, under Russian law, it is impossible to submit for consideration by an arbitral tribunal \"those disputes for the recovery of damages that arose as a result of illegal actions of State bodies and officials in their exercise of public-law functions.\"73\n\n*See Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation of 14 November 2002*, Article 3(3), Exhibit R-173; *Arbitrazh Procedure Code of the Russian Federation of 24 July 2002*, Article 4(6), Exhibit R-172; *Tax Code of 31 July 1998*, Article 138(1), Exhibit R-877.\n\nO.

In support of its argument, Respondent refers to the expert opinion of Professor Yevgeny Sukhanov, who writes:\n\n[I]nfliction of damages upon the property of a joint stock company represents infliction of damages upon that particular owner and not its shareholders, whose property is segregated from the property of the company. Consequently, the right to bring a judicial claim for the protection of its interests in such situation is enjoyed only by the joint stock company itself, as an independent owner of its property, and not by its shareholders.78\n\nRespondent also refers to decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, which establish that a shareholder cannot file a claim for violation of the company's rights.\n\nProfessor Yevgeny Sukhanov, *Opinion on the Issue of Possibility of a Shareholder's Claims against CounterParties of the Joint-Stock Company in Connection with Damage Caused by the Latter to the Company*, 22 February 2006, Section IV, para. 6.\n\n364.\n\nRespondent concludes that the Executive Branch of the Russian Government cannot modify these various arbitrability, jurisdictional or standing norms, by signature of the ECT, without violating the Constitution. It is Respondent's position that, because the ECT's dispute resolution provisions are inconsistent with these various provisions of Russian law, the ECT is one of those types of treaties which in accordance with Article 15(1)(a) of the FLIT must be subject to ratification:\n\n15(1) The following international treaties of the Russian Federation shall be subject to ratification:\n\na) treaties whose implementation requires the amendment of existing or the adoption of new federal laws, as well as those establishing rules that are different from those provided for by law.\n\n365.\n\nDuring the hearing, Claimant argued and sought to demonstrate that the substantive provisions of the ECT are not inconsistent with Russian law.\n\n366.\n\nIn relation to investor-State arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT, Claimant cites Article 9 of the Russian Federation *Law on Foreign Investments of 4 July 1991* and Article 10 of the Russian Federation *Law on Foreign Investment in the Russian* *Federation of 9 July 1999*. Article 9 of the 1991 Law sets out the \"procedure for settling disputes.\" It provides, in relevant part, that \"disputes of foreign investors and enterprises with foreign investment with State bodies of the Russian Federation... are subject to settlement in courts of the Russian Federation or, on agreement between sides, in a Court of Arbitration \" [emphasis added]. Article 10 of the 1999 Law provides, in turn, as follows:\n\nAny dispute involving a foreign investor and related to the investment and business activities of such investor in the Russian Federation shall be settled in compliance with the international treaties of the Russian Federation and federal laws in a court, an arbitration court or international arbitration (arbitration tribunal).\n\n[emphasis added],\n\nClaimant thus submits that investor-State arbitration such as that provided for in Article 26 of the ECT is authorized by Russian law, subject only to establishing that the Russian Federation has consented to the arbitration.\n\n367.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the 1991 and 1999 Foreign Investment Laws also establish that the definitions of investor and investment in the ECT are entirely consistent with Russian law. Claimant cites Articles 1 and 2 of the 1991 Law (defining foreign investor and foreign investment, respectively) and the definition of both terms in Article 2 of the 1999 Law. Consistency is also confirmed, submits Claimant, by the statement of the Government in the ECT Explanatory Note to the Duma that the ECT is consistent with the provisions of the existing law on foreign investment and \"does not require the acknowledgement of any concessions or the adoption of any amendments to the abovementioned Law.\"\n\n368.\n\nOn the issue of arbitrability, Claimant refers the Tribunal to Article 16 of the *Civil Code* of the Russian Federation, which provides that civil-law rights include the right to seek compensation for the illegal acts of a State. According to Claimant, therefore, even assuming Respondent's argument about the arbitrability issue is correct, the type of claim before this Tribunal would be considered arbitrable in Russia. Claimant relies primarily, however, on Article 9 of the 1991 *Law on Foreign Investment*, under which, it says, investment disputes are clearly arbitrable. But, arbitrability, Claimant recognizes, does not automatically allow a claim to be submitted to an arbitral tribunal. Consent of both parties is required. Consent, Claimant submits, is clearly provided in the present case by Articles 26(3)(a) and 26(4) of the ECT, which are applied provisionally in the Russian Federation based on the signature of the Treaty by the Russian Government.\n\n369.\n\nFinally, in response to Respondent's argument that these claims are impermissible derivative actions, unknown to Russian law, Claimant submits that it is not claiming in the name of Yukos, but rather is seeking compensation on its own behalf for loss of the value of the shares it owns in Yukos.\n\n**(ii) Tribunal's Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n370.\n\nAfter having considered the totality of the Parties' submissions and having deliberated, the Tribunal concludes that Article 26 of the ECT is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation. The terms of the Russian Federation's *Law on Foreign Investment* (both the 1991 and 1999 versions) are crystal clear. Investor-State disputes such as the present one are arbitrable under Russian law. The Tribunal recalls the key provisions of the law which inform its conclusion. Article 9 of the 1991 Law provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nDisputes of foreign investors and enterprises with foreign investment with state bodies of the Russian Federation, enterprises, public organizations and other juridical persons of the RSFSR, disputes among investors and enterprises with foreign investment on matters linked with their economic activities, as well as disputes between participants of an enterprise with foreign investment and the enterprise itself are subject to settlement in courts of the Russian Federation or, on agreement between sides, in a Court of Arbitration.79\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nArticle 10 of the 1999 Law provides, in relevant part:\n\nAny dispute involving a foreign investor and related to the investment and business activities of such investor in the Russian Federation shall be settled in compliance with the international treaties of the Russian Federation and federal laws in a court, an arbitration court or international arbitration (arbitration tribunal).\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Martynov explained that the use of \"Court of Arbitration\" in this English translation of the law was meant to refer to a non-governmental dispute resolution mechanism, such as a privately constituted arbitration tribunal, as opposed to the Russian arbitration or arbitrazh courts, which are part of the judiciary. *See* Hearing Transcript, 19 November 2008, p. 31:7-21.\n\n371.\n\nFurthermore, the definitions of \"foreign investor\" and \"foreign investment\" in both the 1991 and 1999 versions of the *Law on Foreign Investment* are consistent with the definitions of \"Investor\" and \"Investment\" in Article 1 of the ECT. The 1991 Law defines the terms, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nArticle 1\n\n*Foreign Investors*\n\nForeign investors in the RSFSR may include:\n\n- foreign juridical persons, including, specifically, any companies, firms, enterprises, organizations or associations, set up and entitled to make investments in conformity with the legislation of the country where they are located;\n\n[...]\n\nArticle 2\n\n*Foreign Investment*\n\nAll types of property and intellectual assets, invested by foreigners in business ventures and other types of activity with the aim of deriving profit (income) shall be deemed foreign investment.\n\nSimilar definitions are found in Article 2 of the 1999 Law:\n\n*\"Foreign investor\"* shall mean: foreign legal entities, the civil legal capacity of which shall be determined by the laws of the jurisdiction of their incorporation and which have the right to invest on the territory of the Russian Federation under the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation; [...]\n\n*\"Foreign investment\"* shall mean the investment of foreign capital in objects of business activity on the territory of the Russian Federation in the form of objects of civil rights belonging to a foreign investor, unless such objects are excluded from the turnover or are restricted in the Russian Federation pursuant to federal laws, including money, securities (denominated in foreign currency or in the currency of the Russian Federation), other property, property rights, exclusive rights to the results of intellectual activities (intellectual property) which can be evaluated in a monetary form, and services and information.\n\n372.\n\nOn the issue of standing, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant is claiming for violation of its own rights under the ECT, not the rights of Yukos. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant's characterization of its claim, which is not a derivative action, but an action for the direct loss by Claimant of its shares and their value.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the definitions in the P&C Agreement are not relevant to the analysis of the ECT, since the definitions in Article 30 of the P&C Agreement are expressly limited to be \"for the purpose of this agreement [ *i.e.*, the P&C Agreement, not the ECT].\"\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusions are confirmed by the representations of the Government of the Russian Federation in the Explanatory Note which it submitted to the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation when the ECT was submitted for ratification. The following extracts from the Note are particularly relevant:\n\nPrior to the entry into force of the ECT, the majority of the Contracting Parties agreed to apply the treaty on a provisional basis. In this respect, it was decided that such provisional application of the ECT would be implemented to the extent that it would not be inconsistent with the constitution, laws and regulations of the country in question.\n\nAt the time for the signing of the ECT, its provisions on provisional application were in conformity with the Russian legal acts. For that reason, the Russian side did not make declarations as to its inability to accept provisional application (such declarations were made by 12 of the 49 ECT signatories).\n\n[...]\n\nThe provisions of the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation.\n\n[...]\n\nThe legal regime of foreign investments envisaged under the ECT is consistent with the provisions of the existing Law of the RSFSR on Foreign Investments in the RSFSR, as well as with the amended version of the Law currently being discussed in the State Duma, and does not require the acknowledgement of any concessions or the adoption of any amendments to the abovementioned Law. The ECT is also consistent with the provisions of Russian bilateral international treaties on the promotion and protection of investment.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n375.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Professor Avakiyan, one of Respondent's expert witnesses, confirmed that he agreed with the contents of the Explanatory Note cited in the previous paragraph.80 The Tribunal's conclusion on the consistency of Article 26 of the ECT with Russian law is also supported by the writings of Professor Yershov, who was a member of the Russian delegation to the ECT negotiations. During parliamentary hearings concerning the ECT, Professor Yershov submitted a paper in which he noted the following:\n\nFrom the standpoint of Russian interests, the compromise achieved in developing the ECT language guarantees Russia a solution to a critical foreign trade problem: receipt and codification of a liberal nondiscriminatory trade policy regime for an EMP exporter otherwise unattainable in such a short time. In exchange for this, under the ECT, Russia grants foreign investors an energy investment regime acceptable to them that does not require any concessions on Russia's part beyond the framework of current law.81\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nHearing Transcript, 17 November 2008, p. 12:15-17.\n\nYu. A. Yershov, \"Dogovor k Energeticheskoi Khartii [The Energy Charter Treaty],\" *reproduced in* (2001) 1(1) *Ekologiya -- XXI Vek [Ecology -- XXI Century]* pp. 23-42 at 25, Annex C-153.\n\n376.\n\nAs to the BIT practice of the Russian Federation, in the Tribunal's opinion, it is of little assistance to either Party. On the one hand, Claimant refers to the many BITs entered into by the Russian Federation that provide for investor-State arbitration, inviting the conclusion that investor-State arbitration is not inconsistent with Russian law. As Respondent has pointed out, however, the BITs in force in the Russian Federation have all been ratified, thus eliminating any concern with provisions in the BITs that might be different from the underlying Russian legislation. The ratified BITs therefore do little to advance Claimant's position.\n\n377.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent seeks support for its position by pointing out that some of the explanatory notes submitted to the Duma in connection with the ratification of BITs have made it explicit that the BIT in question is subject to ratification because it contains a provision for the settlement of investor-State disputes through international arbitration.82 As Claimant points out, however, none of the BITs in question contains a provisional application regime such as that found in Article 45(1) of the ECT. Ratification by the State Duma is thus required in order for the Russian Federation to express its consent to arbitration.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Explanatory Note on the Issue of Ratification of the Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Argentina on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, Exhibit R-402.\n\n378.\n\nAt this point, the Tribunal recalls again its fundamental finding on the meaning and interpretation of Article 45(1): irrespective of any inconsistencies that might exist between Article 26 of the ECT and Russian law, Article 26 of the ECT, as well as other provisions of the Treaty, apply provisionally and the Russian Federation has therefore consented to international arbitration.\n\n379.\n\nPursuing nevertheless its detailed analysis of Article 26, in particular, through the prism of the FLIT, the Tribunal will now seek to answer the question whether the signature of a treaty which contains a provisional application clause is sufficient to establish the consent of the Russian Federation to international arbitration of disputes arising under the Treaty.\n\n380.\n\nRespondent argues that the consent required in order to give Article 26 binding effect can only be expressed by the legislative branch of the State (*i.e.*, the Duma) through the mechanism of ratification of the ECT. This was the gist of the testimony of Mr. Martynov, one of Respondent's expert witnesses. He testified that consent to arbitration under the ECT required ratification of the Treaty by the State Duma.83 Respondent also argues that, pursuant to Article 39 of the ECT, \"the Treaty is expressly subject to ratification,\" and that \"States, such as Respondent, that have not ratified the Treaty have not expressed their consent to be bound by the Treaty.\"\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 19 November 2008, Day 3, p. 42:18-22.\n\n381.\n\nIn response, Claimant asserts that it \"never suggested that the Treaty was not \u2018subject to ratification.'\" Claimant argues, however, that Article 39 cannot render ineffective the Treaty's regime of provisional application, which is set out in Article 45. Claimant refers to the FLIT in support of its position that consent to be bound by the provisions of a treaty can be granted by the Government's signature of a treaty that provides for the provisional application of its terms. Claimant cites, in particular, Article 6 of the FLIT, which sets out how \"consent\" of the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty may be expressed, as well as Article 2, which defines \"ratification,\" \"signature\" and \"conclusion.\" These key provisions of the FLIT read as follows:\n\nArticle 2 Use of terms\n\nFor the purposes of this Federal Law:\n\n[...]\n\nb) \"ratification,\" \"approval,\" \"acceptance,\" and \"accession\" mean in each case a form whereby the Russian Federation expresses its consent to be bound by an international treaty;\n\nc) \"signature\" means either a stage in the conclusion of a treaty, or a form of expressing consent of the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty, if the treaty provides that signature shall have that effect, or it is otherwise established that the Russian Federation and the other negotiating States were agreed that signature should have that effect, or the intention of the Russian Federation to give that effect to the signature appears from the full powers of its representative or was expressed during the negotiation;\n\nd) \"conclusion\" means the expression of consent of the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty;\n\n[...]\n\nArticle 6 Expression of consent of the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty\n\n1. Consent of the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty may be expressed by means of :\n\nsignature of the treaty;  \n exchange of the documents forming the treaty;  \n ratification of the treaty;  \n approval of the treaty;  \n acceptance of the treaty;  \n accession to the treaty; or  \n any other manner of expressing consent on which the contracting parties have agreed.\n\n2. Decisions to grant consent for the Russian Federation to be bound by an international treaty shall be made by state organs of the Russian Federation in accordance with their competence as defined by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, this Federal Law and other legislative acts of the Russian Federation.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n382.\n\nThese provisions of the FLIT are very clear. There is no room for ambiguity. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Russian Federation has consented to be bound\u2014 albeit provisionally\u2014by Article 26 of the ECT by its signature of the ECT. Article 45(1) of the ECT establishes beyond the shadow of a doubt, and notwithstanding Article 39 of the ECT, that the Russian Federation and other signatories agreed that their signature of the Treaty would have the effect of expressing the consent of the Russian Federation (and each other signatory) to be provisionally bound by its terms.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 11 of the FLIT provides that the decision to sign a treaty is a decision which rests with the Executive:\n\n1. Decisions to negotiate and to sign international treaties of the Russian Federation shall be made:\n\na) with respect to treaties to be concluded on behalf of the Russian Federation, by the President of the Russian Federation, but with respect to treaties to be concluded on behalf of the Russian Federation on matters under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Russian Federation, by the Government of the Russian Federation;\n\nb) with respect to treaties to be concluded on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation, by the Government of the Russian Federation.\n\n2. Decisions to negotiate and to sign international treaties of the Russian Federation on matters under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Russian Federation shall be made by the President of the Russian Federation if circumstances so require.\n\nMoreover, as we saw earlier, Article 23(1) of the FLIT makes it clear that provisional application is permissible under the legislation of the Russian Federation. Therefore, the obligation assumed by the Russian Federation to be bound, prior to ratification, by the dispute settlement provisions (including international arbitration) of a provisionally applied treaty such as the ECT, and the consent expressed therein, are not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation, and the Tribunal so finds.\n\n384.\n\nRespondent argues that a treaty must be ratified by the Russian Federation, and therefore be in force, in order to establish the consent of the Russian Federation to an arbitration provision of the treaty. As shown above, however, under the FLIT, ratification is not the only means by which the Russian Federation can express its consent to the terms of a treaty: signature can express consent where the treaty, such as the ECT, so provides, as it does by specifying in Article 45 the obligations not of a party to the treaty but of a \"signatory.\"\n\n385.\n\nThat there is a distinction between consenting to be bound provisionally by the treaty and, on the other hand, the treaty being \"in force\" for a State is also clear from the definition of \"Contracting Party\" in Article 1(2) of the ECT. As used in the ECT, \"Contracting Party\" means \"a state or Regional Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.\" [emphasis added] The use of the conjunction \"and\" between the clauses \"which has consented to be bound by this Treaty\" and \"for which the Treaty is in force\" means that there must be circumstances, in the eyes of the parties to the ECT, including the Russian Federation, where a State for which the ECT is not \"in force,\" has nevertheless consented to be bound by its terms.\n\n386.\n\nThere is one last argument of Respondent which the Tribunal finds important to address. Article 23(2) of the FLIT requires that a treaty subjECT to provisional application must be submitted to and ratified by the State Duma within six months from its signature and the start of its provisional application. It is common ground between the Parties that the ECT which was signed on 17 December 1994 has never been ratified by the State Duma. Respondent submits that since the six-month period had long expired, any continued provisional application of the ECT would have been inconsistent with Russian law.\n\n387.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the six-month limit is merely an internal requirement; failure to respect that procedure does not in and of itself automatically terminate provisional application. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion based first on the plain meaning of Articles 23(2) and 23(3) of the FLIT. According to Article 23(2), where a treaty provides for provisional application, \"this treaty shall be submitted to the State Duma within six months from the start of its provisional application.\" Article 23(3) provides, however, that provisional application of a treaty by the Russian Federation \"shall be terminated upon notification to the other States that apply the treaty provisionally of the intention of the Russian Federation not to become a party to the treaty.\" The Russian Federation gave no such notification until 20 August 2009, when it notified the Depository of the ECT, the Portuguese Republic, pursuant to Article 45(3)(a) of the Treaty, of its intention not to become a Contracting Party to the Treaty. Article 45(3)(a) provides that \"Termination of provisional application for any signatory shall take effect upon the expiration of 60 days from the date on which such signatory's written notification is received by the Depository.\" The 60-day period expired on 19 October 2009.\n\n388.\n\nAccordingly, from the date of signature of the ECT on behalf of the Russian Federation, 17 December 1994, until 18 October 2009, the ECT was provisionally binding upon the Russian Federation. That conclusion is in accord with the terms of Article 25(2) of the VCLT. Furthermore, as explained above,84 pursuant to Article 45(3)(b) of the Treaty, any investments made in Russia prior to 19 October 2009 will continue to benefit from the Treaty's protections for a period of 20 years, *i.e.*, until 19 October 2029. Therefore, the Russian Federation's 20 August 2009 notification does not affect the analysis and conclusion of this Tribunal.\n\n*See* paras. 34, 338.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is further supported by the following documentary evidence emanating from Respondent:\n\n\u2022 The opinion on the draft Federal Law \"On Amending and Supplementing the Federal Law \u2018On International Treaties of the Russian Federation',\" attached to the letter of the President of the Russian Federation dated 28 May 2001 (No. PR-966),85 which states: \"The legal limits for the termination of provisional application are clear (Article 23(3) of the Federal Law and Article 25 of the VCLT). Provisional application of an international treaty is terminated by agreement of the parties, or by the coming into force of the treaty, or by the communication of State to the other States provisionally applying the treaty of its determination not to become a party to the treaty.\"\n\n\u2022 The Russian Note dated 8 July 1997,86 which provides expressly that \"timely submission of the treaty to the State Duma (according to the time limits specified in the Law) has no automatic consequences on its provisional application. If six months from the beginning of provisional application have expired and the State Duma has not discussed the issue of this treaty, its provisional application continues until the relevant decision is taken by State Duma.\"87\n\n\u2022 The Russian statement to the Energy Charter Conference (RP-3516),88 in which the Russian delegation informed all delegations that \"the Russian Federation has yet to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty but, as a signatory Country, it implements the Treaty from the day it entered into force.\"\n\n\u2022 The website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation which contains an information bulletin on the ECT dated 25 November 2005 that \"the Russian Federation applies [the ECT] on a provisional basis in accordance with Part II of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) and Section II of the Federal Law on International Treaties of the Russian Federation of June 16, 1995.\"89\n\nAnnex C-145.\n\nAnnex C-925.\n\nRespondent contests the origin of the Russian Note. *See* Transcript of Procedural Hearing, 8 May 2008, pp. 81-95. The Tribunal notes, however, that Respondent has not tendered affidavits or sworn statements from the persons who attended the meeting of 8 July 1997 on behalf of the Russian Federation, which would support its position. *See* Transcript of Procedural Hearing, 8 May 2008, pp. 95-96.\n\nAnnex C-1020.\n\nAnnex C-9. This information bulletin appeared on the website as recently as 23 May 2007. *See* Annex C-1143.\n\n390.\n\nWith respect to Article 23(3) of the FLIT, there is no evidence before the Tribunal that, before 20 August 2009, the Russian Federation notified the Depositary and the other States that apply the Treaty, provisionally or otherwise, of its intention not to become a party to the ECT. The Russian Federation may have made it known earlier that it did not plan to ratify the ECT, but it nevertheless continued to apply it provisionally while omitting formally and officially to notify other signatories of its intentions not to ratify the Treaty until 20 August 2009. It appears that the Russian Federation remains\u2014or remained\u2014a Member of the Energy Charter Conference \"in which ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty is still pending...\"90 and a national of the Russian Federation remains\u2014or remained\u2014Deputy Secretary-General of the Energy Charter Secretariat. The Russian Federation has participated in the meetings of the Energy Charter Conference, pursuant to Article 34 of the ECT, and in particular the quinquennial review of the Treaty provided for in sub-paragraph 7. The Russian Federation cannot be heard, during the pendency of these proceedings, to claim the benefits of provisional application of the ECT while disclaiming the obligations which that status imposes. Therefore, the Russian Federation was bound by the obligation to arbitrate investor-State disputes pursuant to Part V of the ECT as of the date of the filing of Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and remains so bound, despite the fact that, on 20 August 2009, it notified the ECT Depository of its intention not to become party to the ECT. As set out above,91 this conclusion is also dictated by Article 45(3)(b) of the Treaty.\n\nEnergy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents: A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation* (2004), p. 17.\n\n*See* para. 388.\n\n391.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that its conclusion on the meaning of the concept of provisional application and the distinction to be drawn between consent to be bound by the treaty and the treaty being in force, is entirely consistent with the decision on jurisdiction rendered in the *Kardassopoulos* case. In the relevant passages of that decision to which the Tribunal subscribes, that tribunal wrote:\n\n211. It follows that the language used in Article 45(1) is to be interpreted as meaning that each signatory State is obliged, even before the ECT has formally entered into force, to apply the whole ECT as if it had already done so.\n\n212. This interpretation of the significance of Article 45(1) is consistent with Article 45(3). That provision refers to the possibility that a signatory may terminate its provisional application of the Treaty by giving written notification to the Depositary that it does not intend to become a Contracting Party to the ECT: that provision applies to provisional application pursuant to Article 45(1). When such notification is given Article 45(3)(b) provides that\n\n\"[T]he obligation of the signatory under paragraph (1) to apply Parts III and V with respect to any investments made in its Area during such provisional application by Investors of other signatories shall nevertheless remain in effect with respect to those Investments for twenty years following the effective date of termination [...].\"\n\n213. This provision confirms that Parts III (concerning investment promotion and protection) and V (concerning dispute settlement) apply during the period of provisional application, and that the operation of those Parts gives rise to an \"obligation.\"\n\n[...]\n\n219. There is, nevertheless, in the Tribunal's view a sufficiently well-established practice of provisional application of treaties to generate a generally accepted understanding of what is meant by that notion. Where what is in issue is, as in the present case, the provisional application of the whole treaty, then such provisional application imports the application of all its provisions as if they were already in force, even though the treaty's proper or definitive entry into force has not yet occurred.\n\n[...]\n\n223. For all the foregoing reasons the Tribunal is satisfied that, properly interpreted in accordance with international law, the language used in Article 45(1) is to be interpreted as meaning that each signatory State is obliged, even before the ECT has formally entered into force, to apply the whole ECT as if it had already done so, and that the language used in Article 1(6), particularly its use of the term \"entry into force,\" is to be interpreted as meaning the date on which the ECT became provisionally applicable for Georgia and Greece.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis leads it to conclude that Article 26 of the ECT is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws or regulations of the Russian Federation. Although, as noted at the outset of this section, this analysis was not essential in view of the Tribunal's dispositive interpretation of Article 45(1), it does sustain the Tribunal's decision.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n393.\n\nAs noted at the outset of this chapter of the Tribunal's Interim Award, the interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT, concerning the scope of provisional application, is the central issue before the Tribunal in this phase of the arbitration.\n\n394.\n\nIn this chapter, the Tribunal has found that:\n\na) The regimes of provisional application in Article 45(1) and 45(2) are separate, and the Russian Federation can benefit from the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) even though it made no declaration under Article 45(2);\n\nb) The Russian Federation can invoke the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1) even though it made no prior declaration nor gave any prior notice to other signatories that it intended to rely on Article 45(1) to exclude provisional application;\n\nc) The Limitation Clause of Article 45(1) negates provisional application of the Treaty only where the principle of provisional application is itself inconsistent with the constitution, laws or regulations of the signatory State; and\n\nd) In the Russian Federation, there is no inconsistency between the provisional application of treaties and its Constitution, laws or regulations.\n\n395.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that the ECT in its entirety applied provisionally in the Russian Federation until 19 October 2009, and that Parts III and V of the Treaty (including Article 26 thereof) remain in force until 19 October 2029 for any investments made prior to 19 October 2009. Respondent is thus bound by the investor-State arbitration provision invoked by Claimant.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal is comforted in its decision by its further finding that, had it been an essential consideration under the Limitation Clause of Article 45(1)\u2014which it is not\u2014 Article 26 of the ECT itself, as well as Articles 1(6) and 1(7), are consistent with Respondent's Constitution, laws and regulations.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over the merits of this claim, subject to the other objections addressed in the other chapters of this Interim Award.\n\n398.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes again that although it considered the question of consistency of particular provisions of the ECT (notably Article 26) with Respondent's domestic legal regime, it will not be admissible for Respondent to argue in any merits phase92 of the present arbitration that certain provisions of the ECT, including the provisions of Part III, cannot be applied provisionally because they are inconsistent with Respondent's Constitution, laws or regulations. The Tribunal's interpretation of the Limitation Clause in Article 45(1), coupled with its finding that the principle of provisional application *per se* is consistent with the domestic legal regime of the Russian Federation, results necessarily in the conclusion that each and every provision of the ECT applied provisionally in the Russian Federation.\n\nThroughout the present Interim Award, and for obvious reason, the Tribunal will continue to refer to \"any merits phase\" of this arbitration. In the *dispositif* of this Interim Award, the Tribunal will use the appropriate description dictated by its conclusion in respect of jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n**B. IS CLAIMANT A PROTECTED INVESTOR WITH AN INVESTMENT UNDER THEECT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n399.\n\nIn the previous chapter, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Article 26 of the Treaty applies provisionally in the Russian Federation, and that the Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over the merits of this claim, subject to the other objections raised by Respondent. The first set of such objections, which the Tribunal now addresses, relates to the requirements for jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* found in Article 26.\n\n400.\n\nArticle 26 provides, in relevant part, that investor-State arbitration pursuant to subparagraph 4 (including arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to sub-paragraph 4(b)) is available for \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III [...].\"\n\n401.\n\nIn the previous chapter of this Interim Award, the Tribunal has found that, for purposes of Article 26, the Russian Federation is bound as if it were a Contracting Party. Respondent, however, objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the grounds that Claimant is not \"an Investor of another Contracting Party\" and/or that the dispute does not relate to \"an Investment\" of such an Investor.\n\n402.\n\nIn the sections that follow, the Tribunal analyzes each one of these issues in turn.\n\n**2. Does Claimant Qualify as a Protected \"Investor\" under Article 1(7)?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nIn Article 1(7) of the Treaty, \"Investor\" is defined to mean:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state,\" a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party.\n\n404.\n\nClaimant was incorporated in the Isle of Man on 24 September 1997. The company was originally named Credof Limited, changing its name to Yukos Universal Limited on 9 January 1998. As certified by the General Registry of the Isle of Man on 4 November 1999 and by the Financial Supervision Commission of the Isle of Man on 23 June 2005, Claimant was duly incorporated and in existence under the laws of that jurisdiction as at the date of its Notice of Arbitration (3 February 2005).\n\n405.\n\nThe United Kingdom signed the ECT in December 1994 and ratified it on 16 December 1997. The United Kingdom has extended such ratification to the Isle of Man, which is a Crown Dependency. Claimant is accordingly a company organized in accordance with the laws applicable in a Contracting Party to the ECT.\n\n**a) Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n406.\n\nRespondent does not dispute these basic facts, which, on their face, lead to the conclusion that Claimant qualifies as an \"Investor\" under Article 1(7) of the Treaty. Rather, Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that the terms of Article 1(7), as *lex specialis*, displace consideration of applicable rules and principles of international law bearing upon the exercise of treaty interpretation. These general principles of international law, which Respondent submits are applicable, require the Tribunal to go beyond the facts relating to Claimant's formal incorporation in order to determine whether Claimant qualifies as an Investor for purposes of Article 1(7) of the ECT.\n\n407.\n\nRespondent refers in this respect to various instruments of international law, such as Article 9 of the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection or the Draft Articles on International Responsibility of the State for Injuries Caused in its Territory to the Person or Property of Aliens, as well as to the P&C Agreement, and argues that on the basis of these instruments, Claimant does not qualify as an \"Investor\" for the purposes of Article 1(7) of the ECT. In particular, Respondent asserts that Claimant does not qualify for protection under the ECT since it is a shell company beneficially owned and controlled by Russian nationals and, as such, by nationals of the host State.\n\n408.\n\nIn response, Claimant submits that Respondent is \"engaging... in a tortuous and innovative process of re-writing the Treaty.\" Claimant asserts that \"there is no basis for interpreting Article 1(7) in any way other than pursuant to its plain, express terms, which look only to the Claimant's country of incorporation.\" Claimant concludes that general principles of international law cannot override the \"simple, determinative definition\" of Article 1(7) of the Treaty.\n\n409.\n\nIn support of its position, Claimant refers to the opinion of Professor Crawford, who writes:\n\nNo doubt reference to substantive principles of international law may have a role in treaty interpretation. But international law does not prescribe any rule for qualifying entities as investors for the purposes of treaty arbitration, still less any peremptory rule. The plain meaning of a treaty's terms may be taken to reflect the parties' intentions.93\n\nClaimant also refers to the decisions of arbitral tribunals that have considered this issue and have rejected attempts to introduce limitations or exceptions not provided for in the language of the Treaty under consideration. Claimant refers specifically to *Plama v.* *Bulgaria*,94*Petrobart v. The Kyrgyz Republic*,95*Saluka Investments BV (the Netherlands)* *v. The Czech Republic,96* and *Tokios Tokel* *e* *s v. Ukraine97*\n\nCrawford Opinion of 22 June 2006, at para. 125.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005, (2005) 20:1 *ICSID Review* 262.\n\n*Petrobart Limited v. The Kyrgyz Republic*, Arbitration No. 126/2003, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award of 29 March 2005, available on http://ita.law.uvic.ca.\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, UNCITRAL, *available at* : http://www.pca-cpa.org/upload/files/SAL-CZ%20Partial%20Award%20170306.pdf.\n\n*Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 April 2004, *available at:* http://icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n410.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that Respondent's reliance on international instruments other than the ECT, which contain language different from the ECT, is also unavailing. Claimant states that \"the Respondent cannot rely on the language contained in irrelevant international instruments to provide for the additional requirements and exceptions that the Respondent now seeks to insert into the ECT.\"\n\n**b) Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n411.\n\nAs noted earlier in the present Interim Award, according to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted first on the basis of its plain language. On its face, Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT contains no requirement other than that the claimant company be duly organized in accordance with the law applicable in a Contracting Party. The Tribunal agrees with Professor Crawford that in order to qualify as a protected Investor under Article 1(7) of the ECT, a company is merely required to be organized under the laws of a Contracting Party. As Professor Crawford rightly points out:\n\nThe Treaty imposes no further requirements with respect to shareholding, management, *si\u00e8ge social* or location of its business activities (...). Companies incorporated in Contracting Parties are embraced by the definition, regardless of the nationality of shareholders, the origin of investment capital or the nationality of directors or management.98\n\nProfessor James Crawford, SC, *Energy Charter Treaty Arbitration: Jurisdiction Issues,* 22 June 2006, para. 126.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal is not unmindful of Respondent's assertions concerning ownership and control of Claimant. The proper context in which to examine these assertions, however, is in the analysis of Article 17 of the Treaty, according to which ownership or control of a claiming party by citizens or nationals of a third State may, if certain other conditions are met, entitle a responding State to deny the benefits of Part III of the Treaty to the claiming party. The Tribunal will address Respondent's ownership and control argument in the next chapter of this Interim Award.\n\n413.\n\nHere, however, the Tribunal is dealing not with Article 17 but with Article 1(7). The Tribunal is bound to interpret the terms of the ECT, including Article 1(7), not as they might have been written but as they were actually written. Article 1(7) is more comprehensively and neutrally cast than, for example, Article 21 of the ILC Draft Articles on International Responsibility of the State for Injuries Caused in its Territory to the Person or Property of Aliens. Article 1(7) provides that, \"Investor\" means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n[...]\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\nClaimant was organized \"in accordance with the law applicable\" in a Contracting Party. Claimant accordingly qualifies as a company so organized in the instant case. The Tribunal is not entitled, by the terms of the ECT, to find otherwise.\n\n414.\n\nIn so concluding, the Tribunal follows the holding of the Partial Award in *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* of 17 March 2006. That tribunal, of which the late Sir Arthur Watts was the distinguished chairman, held:\n\n240.The Tribunal has some sympathy for the argument that a company which has no real connection with a State party to a BIT, and which is in reality a mere shell company controlled by another company which is not constituted under the laws of that State, should not be entitled to invoke the provisions of that treaty. Such a possibility lends itself to abuses of the arbitral procedure, and to practices of \u2018treaty-shopping' which can share many of the disadvantages of the widely criticized practice of \u2018forum shopping'.\n\n241.However that may be, the predominant factor which must guide the Tribunal's exercise of its functions is the terms in which the parties to the Treaty now in question have agreed to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction. In the present context, that means the terms in which they have agreed upon who is an investor who may become a claimant entitled to invoke the Treaty's arbitration procedures. The parties had complete freedom of choice in this matter, and they chose to limit entitled \u2018investors' to those satisfying the definition set out in Article 1 of the Treaty. The Tribunal cannot in effect impose upon the parties a definition of \u2018investor' other than that which they themselves agreed. That agreed definition required only that the claimant-investor should be constituted under the laws of (in the present case) The Netherlands, and it is not open to the Tribunal to add other requirements which the parties could themselves have added but which they omitted to add.99\n\n*See also Petrobart Limited v. The Kyrgyz Republic*, Arbitration No. 126/2003, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Award of 29 March 2005, available on http://ita.law.uvic.ca.\n\n415.\n\nThe Tribunal knows of no general principles of international law that would require investigating how a company or another organization operates when the applicable treaty simply requires it to be organized in accordance with the laws of a Contracting Party. The principles of international law, which have an unquestionable importance in treaty interpretation, do not allow an arbitral tribunal to write new, additional requirements\u2014 which the drafters did not include\u2014into a treaty, no matter how auspicious or appropriate they may appear.100\n\n*See* *Acquisition of Polish Nationality*, Advisory Opinion (1923), PCIJ ser. B, No. 7, p. 20 (\"To impose an additional condition for the acquisition of Polish nationality, a condition not provided for in the Treaty..., would be equivalent not to interpreting the Treaty, but to reconstructing it.\") Exhibit C-144. Respondent argues, in the alternative, that the general rules and principles of international law are an integral part of Russian domestic law, pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Constitution, and that an interpretation of Article 1(7) of the Treaty that \"dispense[d]\" with such rules would therefore be inconsistent with Russian law, triggering the inconsistency clause of Article 45(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal cannot accept this argument, however, in light of its decision on the proper interpretation of Article 45(1) (*See* Chapter A, above.)\n\n416.\n\nIndeed, in similar circumstances, other arbitral tribunals have held the opposite: they have emphasized that the reference to the State of incorporation is the most common method of defining the nationality of a company and that, in any event, once a treaty makes that choice in specific and unambiguous terms, any other method of assessing the company's nationality is ruled out.101 Specifically with regard to Article 1(7) of the ECT, the arbitral tribunal held in the case of *Plama v. Bulgaria* that to qualify as an investor it was sufficient for a company to be organized in accordance with the law applicable in Cyprus, irrespective of who might own or control the Investor.102\n\n*See* *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 April 2004, *available at* http://icsid.worldbank.org, paras. 28-29 (with a dissenting opinion by Prosper Weil).\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005, (2005) 20:1 *ICSID Review* 262, para. 128.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly holds that Claimant, being a company organized in accordance with the laws of the Isle of Man, qualifies as an Investor for the purposes of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT.\n\n**3. Does Claimant \"Own or Control\" a Protected \"Investment\" under Article 1(6)?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nIn Article 1(6) of the Treaty, \"Investment\" is defined to mean:\n\n[...] every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:\n\n(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;\n\n(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and associated with an Investment;\n\n(d) Intellectual Property;\n\n(e) Returns;\n\n(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.\n\n[...]\n\n419.\n\nClaimant owns 5,340,995 shares of Yukos, representing 2.25 percent of the share capital of the company.\n\n**a) Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n420.\n\nAs in connection with the question of whether Claimant qualifies as an \"Investor,\" Respondent does not dispute the basic fact that Claimant is the nominal owner of shares of Yukos. Rather, Respondent argues that:\n\nIn the absence of a specific Treaty provision defining the quality of ownership and control, the quality of ownership and control needs to be determined pursuant to the applicable rules and principles of international law. In addition, under the rules of treaty interpretation, Article1(6) of the Treaty itself needs to be interpreted in accordance with general international law.103\n\nOn the basis of this premise, Respondent asserts that:\n\nGeneral international law ignores nominal or record ownership in favour of real or beneficial ownership in order to determine the nationality of a claim.104\n\nRespondent's First Memorial, para. 84.\n\n*Ibid*. at para. 85.\n\n421.\n\nBecause Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev have admitted that they are the beneficial owners of Yukos and its assets, argues Respondent, Claimant cannot be the true owner of the Yukos shares that Claimant claims it owns.\n\n422.\n\nRespondent further asserts that the nominal ownership by Claimant of the Yukos shares does not qualify as an \"Investment\" because no injection of foreign capital into the Russian Federation took place as a result of its acquisitions. Respondent submits that Russian law requires that a foreign investment be acquired with capital of foreign origin, and that Respondent can rely on Russian law requirements in connection with the interpretation of Article 1(6) of the Treaty by operation of the inconsistency clause of Article 45(1).\n\n423.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that Claimant was not the owner of any Yukos shares during certain periods from 2000 to 2003 and that Claimant failed to show that it paid for the reacquisition of the Yukos shares it now nominally owns.\n\n424.\n\nClaimant responds, as in the case of whether it qualifies as an \"Investor,\" that the determination of whether Claimant holds a qualified \"Investment\" must begin with an examination of the language of the ECT. Considering the express terms of Article 1(6) of the Treaty, Claimant asserts that it holds a qualified \"Investment\" because it owns Yukos shares and has done so at all relevant times for purposes of this arbitration.\n\n425.\n\nPointing to various bank statements, Claimant asserts that it has owned Yukos shares continuously since early 2000, \"long before the events giving rise to this arbitration began,\" and in particular on all dates relevant to this arbitration, including when it delivered to Respondent the Notification of Claim under the ECT (2 November 2004) and when Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim was filed (3 February 2005). Thus, Claimant argues, under any measure of the relevant date for purposes of jurisdiction, \"the Claimant was unquestionably a Yukos shareholder as of the relevant date, and thus holds a qualified \u2018Investment' pursuant to Article 1(6).\"\n\n426.\n\nFurther, Claimant argues that nothing in the language of the ECT requires a showing of anything more than legal ownership to establish a qualified \"Investment.\" Claimant points out that it is sufficient to show that the asset under consideration is owned or controlled, making other purported requirements \"superfluous and unnecessary\" if ownership is established. As for the type of ownership required, Claimant asserts that there is no basis for Respondent's argument that beneficial ownership is necessary. Claimant argues that this is contrary to the plain language of the ECT, which provides for a very broad, simple definition of \"Investment\" that includes legal ownership.\n\n427.\n\nDrawing support from the expansive definition of \"Investment,\" Claimant asserts that \"how the Claimant acquired its Yukos shares\u2014including the \u2018origin of capital', whether it made an \u2018injection' of \u2018foreign capital', and whether it paid for the shares with cash or some other consideration\u2014has no bearing on the Tribunal's determination whether the Claimant holds a qualified \u2018Investment.'\" Claimant argues that no authority exists to support Respondent's argument in respect of the necessity for injection of foreign capital, and cites the decision in *Tokios Tokel* *e* *s v. Ukraine* in support of its own position.\n\n428.\n\nClaimant also points to various public statements by then President Vladimir Putin in which he stressed that \"repatriation\" or \"return\" of Russian capital from countries like Germany and Cyprus was \"a very good sign\" and \"a good signal.\"105\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin, Speech at the Energy Conference, London, 26 June 2003, *available at* the President of Russia's official website at http://www.kremlin.ru, Annex C-1437. President Vladimir Putin, Answers to Questions from the Participants in the Business Meeting of the APEC Members, Shanghai, 19 October 2001, *available at* http://www.kremlin.ru, Annex C-1436.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, although insisting that it is not required by the ECT and not relevant therefore to the issue of jurisdiction, Claimant asserts, by reference to various agreements regarding acquisition of Yukos shares, that it did in fact legally acquire and pay for its Yukos shares in 1999 and 2000. Claimant alleges that it paid more than US$ 142 million in total for the acquisition of shares in 1999 and 2000. Claimant states that it need not prove that it paid for each purchase or reacquisition of Yukos shares involved in the hundreds of further transactions made after 2000.\n\n**b) Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n430.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal finds that the ECT, by its terms, applies to an \"Investment\" owned nominally by a qualifying \"Investor.\" Respondent's submission that simple legal ownership of shares does not qualify as an Investment under Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT finds no support in the text of the Treaty. The breadth of the definition of Investment in the ECT is emphasized by many eminent legal scholars.106 As defined in Article 1(6) of the ECT, an \"Investment\" includes \"every kind of asset\" owned *or* controlled, directly or indirectly, and extends not only to shares of a company but to its debt (Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT), to monetary claims and contractual performance as well as \" any right conferred by law \" (Article 1(6)(f) of the ECT, emphasis added). The Tribunal recalls again that, according to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty is to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms. The Tribunal reads Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT as containing the widest possible definition of an interest in a company, including shares (as in the case at hand), with no indication whatsoever that the drafters of the Treaty intended to limit ownership to \"beneficial\" ownership.\n\n*See* Craig Bamberger, \"An Overview of the Energy Charter Treaty,\" pp. 8-9, *in* Thomas Walde (ed.), *The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade* (1996); Thomas Walde, \"International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty,\" pp. 271-273, *in* Thomas Walde (ed.), *The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade* (1996); Esa Paasivirta, \"The Energy Charter Treaty and Investment Contracts: Towards Security of Contracts,\" pp. 356-358, *in* Thomas Walde (ed.), *The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade* (1996).\n\n431.\n\nNor can the Tribunal accept Respondent's argument based on an alleged gap in ownership of Yukos shares by Claimant during certain periods from 2000 through 2003. The record shows that as many as 59,095,252 Yukos shares were held by Claimant from 28 March 2000 to 23 July 2002.107 Overlapping with this period, an additional 2,100,000 shares of Yukos were held by Claimant from 8 July 2002 to 9 January 2004.108 The record also shows that Claimant has owned Yukos shares continuously since that period, and thus on all dates relevant to this arbitration.109 In addition, the record establishes that the shares were legally acquired and paid for from late 1999 onwards, as evidenced by documents in the record.110\n\nAnnexes C-1207, C-1162 and C-1163.\n\nAnnexes C-1208, C-1185 and C-1186.\n\nAnnexes C-1206 to C-1209; and Annexes C-1211 to C-1212.\n\n*See* Annexes C-1162 to C-1203 and C-1205.\n\n432.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's argument that an \"Investment,\" to qualify under the ECT, requires an injection of foreign capital. Indeed, as already explained above, the definition of investment in Article 1(6) of the ECT does not include any additional requirement with regard to the origin of capital or the necessity of an injection of foreign capital. Specifically, paragraph 3 of the ECT Understandings, relating to Article 1(6) of the ECT, is of no assistance to Respondent, as it refers to the \"control\" facet of Article 1(6), not \"ownership.\" The Tribunal refers, again, to the reasoning of the tribunal in the *Saluka* Award: \"the predominant factor which must guide the Tribunal's exercise of its functions is the terms in which the parties to the Treaty now in question have agreed to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\" The Tribunal cannot in effect impose upon the parties a definition of \"Investment\" other than that which the parties to the ECT, including Respondent, have agreed.\n\n433.\n\nRespondent in its written pleadings argued that the ECT is a treaty whose purpose is to promote foreign investment in the energy sector. The Introduction to the ECT prepared by the Energy Charter Secretariat provides, under the heading, \"Investment,\" that \"[t]he Treaty ensures the protection of foreign energy investments... By accepting the Treaty, a state takes on the obligation to extend national treatment, or most-favoured nation treatment (whichever is more favourable), to nationals and legal entities of other Signatory states who have invested in its energy sector.\"111 Various provisions of the Treaty, such as those of Article 9, which speak of investments in the areas of other Contracting Parties, particularly those with economies in transition, and Article 10, which speaks of each Contracting Party encouraging \"Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area,\" show that the Treaty was written in contemplation of international investment, notably of investment by investors of developed States in economies in transition. It was not written in contemplation of investments by Russian nationals resident in Russia of capital generated in Russia. (At the same time, as the Tribunal has just pointed out,112 Claimant has referred to statements of President Putin welcoming the repatriation of capital controlled by Russians which has been placed abroad.)\n\nEnergy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents: A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation* (2004), p. 14.\n\n*See supra*, para. 428.\n\n434.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted earlier, these conflicting contentions of the Parties go to the heart of the present dispute. The Tribunal accepts that the ECT is directed towards the promotion of foreign investment, especially of investment by Western sources in the energy resources of the Russian Federation and other successor States of the USSR. The Treaty is meant, as specified in the Secretariat's Introduction, to ensure \"the protection of foreign energy investments.\" If the States that took part in the drafting of the ECT had been asked in the course of that process whether the ECT was designed to protect\u2014and should be interpreted and applied to protect\u2014investments in a Contracting State by nationals of that same Contracting State whose capital derived from the energy resources of that State, it may well be that the answer would have been in the negative, not only from the representatives of the Russian Federation but from the generality of the delegates. The ultimate source of the investments at issue in the instant cases may be Russian. The fortunes of the \"oligarchs\"\u2014a term constantly employed in the pleadings of Respondent which the Tribunal for its part repeats without pejorative intent\u2014may derive from investments by Russians in Russian resources.\n\n435.\n\nBut, as the Tribunal noted earlier,113 the Tribunal is bound to interpret the terms of the ECT not as they might have been written so as exclusively to apply to foreign investment but as they were actually written. They are more comprehensively and neutrally cast. Specifically, Article 1(6) provides that, \"\u2018Investment' means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor....\" Article 1(7) provides that \"Investor\" means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n[...]\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\nClaimant is organized \"in accordance with the law applicable\" in the Isle of Man and owns shares of Yukos. Thus, Claimant owns an \"Investment\" protected by the ECT and the Tribunal so finds. The Tribunal is not entitled, by the terms of the ECT, to find otherwise.114\n\n*See supra*, para. 413.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Secretariat's Introduction to the Treaty was \"included for convenience and must not be read as part of any official document or as an interpretation of any provisions therein.\" Energy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents: A Legal Framework for International Energy Cooperation* (2004), p. 11 (para. 2 of \"Explanatory Note\").\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware of Respondent's argument that Claimant in this arbitration has \"unclean hands\" and that Claimant's corporate personality should be disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise.\" The Tribunal recalls that it addressed these issues in its Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3 on 8 September and 31 October 2006. Specifically, the Tribunal then decided to defer consideration of Respondent's arguments concerning the \"unclean hands\" of Claimant or Claimant being an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise\" to any merits phase of this arbitration. Accordingly, by finding, as it does, that Claimant qualifies as an Investor owning or controlling an Investment for the purposes of Articles 1(7) and (6) of the ECT, the Tribunal does not dispose of the issues argued by Respondent concerning the \"unclean hands\" of Claimant and Claimant being an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise,\" which it will address during any merits phase of this arbitration.\n\n**C. ARE THE CLAIMS BARRED BY THE \"DENIAL-OF-BENEFITS\" PROVISION(ARTICLE 17) OF THE ECT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n437.\n\nHaving concluded, in the previous chapter, that Claimant is a protected Investor with an Investment under the ECT, the Tribunal now turns to Respondent's argument that the benefits of Part III of the Treaty have been denied to Claimant by operation of Article 17 of the ECT.\n\n438.\n\nPart III of the ECT comprises the Treaty's substantive articles on \"Investment Promotion and Protection.\" Most notably they prescribe, in Article 10, the standards of treatment, \"the conditions,\" that each Contracting Party shall accord to \"Investors of Other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.\" \"Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment... constant protection and security...,\" managerial control and observance of \"any obligations\" a Contracting Party has entered into with an Investor as well other treatment no less favorable than that required by international law. Article 13 provides that Investments shall not be nationalized or expropriated except under prescribed conditions.\n\n439.\n\nArticle 17 of the ECT, the final article of Part III, provides for \"Non-Application of Part III in Certain Circumstances.\" It specifies that:\n\nEach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized...\n\n440.\n\nThe foregoing \"denial-of-benefits\" clause has been a focus of conflicting arguments of the Parties. The Tribunal summarizes and evaluates those arguments in the sections that follow.\n\n441.\n\nHowever, insofar as those arguments are deemed to address the question of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to pass upon the merits of the claims of Claimant, they are not on point. That is because Article 17 specifies\u2014as does the title of that Article\u2014that it concerns denial of the advantages of \"this Part,\" *i.e.*, Part III of the ECT. Provision for dispute settlement under the ECT is not found in \"this Part\" but in Part V of the Treaty. Whether or not Claimant is entitled to the advantages of Part III is a question not of jurisdiction but of the merits. Since Article 17 relates not to the ECT as a whole, or to Part V, but exclusively to Part III, its interpretation for that reason cannot determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain the claims of Claimant.\n\n442.\n\nThe holding of the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* is on point:\n\nArticle 26 provides a procedural remedy for a covered investor's claims; and it is not physically or juridically part of the ECT's substantive advantages enjoyed by that investor under Part III. [...] This limited exclusion from Part III for a covered investor, dependent on certain specific criteria, requires a procedure to resolve a dispute as to whether that exclusion applies in any particular case; and the object and purpose of the ECT, in the Tribunal's view, clearly requires Article 26 to be unaffected by the operation of Article 17(1).115\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 February 2005, (2005) 20:1 *ICSID Review* 262, para. 148.\n\n443.\n\nThis Tribunal finds the reasoning of the *Plama* tribunal on this point convincing and adopts it. At the same time, the Tribunal takes note of the fact that the Parties have treated the application of Article 17 as a question of admissibility, not jurisdiction,116 on which they differ. Accordingly, the Tribunal will pass upon the arguments of the Parties and determine the issue of the application of Article 17 definitively in this phase of the arbitration.\n\n*See* First Memorial, Section III.C; Counter-Memorial, Section VII.C; Second Memorial, Section XIV; Rejoinder, Section IV.B.\n\n444.\n\nFirst, in Section 2, the Tribunal addresses the general issue of whether there is a notification requirement in Article 17 and whether Respondent satisfied any such requirement. Then, in Section 3, the Tribunal considers whether the substantive conditions for the application of Article 17(1) have been met.\n\n**2. Notification Requirement**\n-------------------------------\n\n**a) Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n445.\n\nRespondent maintains in this phase of the arbitration that, even if it has any obligations towards Claimant under the ECT (which Respondent contests) it is entitled to deny the advantages of them to Claimant by reason of Article 17(1), and that it has done so. Respondent recalls that the terms of Article 17 derive from the \"denial-of-benefits\" clauses of bilateral investment treaties of the United States of America. While some but not all of these clauses require prior consultation and notification before invocation, as does NAFTA, Respondent notes that:\n\n[N]o such notification and consultation requirement or other formal requirements are included in Article 17 of the Treaty. Thus, a company that is owned or controlled by nationals of a third State, and *a fortiori* by nationals of the host State, does not enjoy any benefits under Part III of the Treaty if it lacks substantial business activities in the Contracting Party in which it is organized.117\n\nFirst Memorial, para. 121.\n\n446.\n\nIn order to benefit from Treaty protections, Respondent contends, a company that comes within the scope of Article 17 must obtain a commitment from the host State that it will be treated as a protected investor. No such commitments have been obtained. On the contrary, Russia has, contemporaneously with negotiation of the ECT, ratified and proclaimed the P&C Agreement, which stipulates that companies having only a registered office in a State Party are not considered companies of that State unless \"its operations possess a real and continuous link\" with the latter's economy. The Russian Federation was not and is not in a position to know when, if ever, an investment is to be made within its territory or if a controlling investor even exists outside Russia, says Respondent, adding: \"This is patently so where as here the controlling Russian oligarchs have employed dozens if not hundreds of offshore tax haven companies and ever shifting structures specifically designed to disguise ownership and control, evade taxes and launder money.\"118\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 125.\n\n447.\n\nRespondent concludes: \"For all the above reasons, Article 17(1) of the Treaty denies, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has denied, and the Russian Federation hereby denies any and all benefits of Part III of the Treaty to the Russian oligarchs themselves, and to each and every one of their offshore shell companies and structures.\"119\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 126.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant replies that Article 17 specifies that each Contracting Party \"reserves the right to deny the advantages\" of Part III. Thus the \"right to deny\" must be exercised \"but until such time as this right has been effectively exercised,\" the investor benefits from the protection of Part III of the Treaty. Claimant disputes the reliance of the Russian Federation on the P&C Agreement, \"a wholly irrelevant instrument in this arbitration.\"120 It maintains that the purported denial of benefits by the Russian Federation quoted in the foregoing paragraph\u2014which is defective, Claimant says, because it does not expressly identify the particular Claimant companies (but refers just to \"Russian oligarchs\" and \"offshore shell companies\")\u2014rather demonstrates Respondent's recognition that Article 17 requires an exercise of the reserved right. The reason for that exercise is to ensure legal certainty for investors in the ECT area. It quotes the Expert Opinion of Professor James Crawford:\n\nTo place on an individual investor the task of obtaining express assurance as to the extension of advantages would change the ECT from a general framework for investment in the energy sector to an invitation to establish, case-by-case, bilateral relations between investors and the host State. This was plainly not the intention.121\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 278.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 281(citing para. 118 of the Expert Opinion).\n\n449.\n\nClaimant relies also on the jurisdictional holding of the arbitral tribunal in the case of *Plama v. Bulgaria:*\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the existence of a \"right\" is distinct from the exercise of that right. [...] [A] Contracting Party has a right under Article 17(1) ECT to deny a covered investor the advantages of Part III; but it is not required to exercise that right; and it may never do so. The language of Article 17(1) is unambiguous; and that meaning is consistent with the different state practices of the ECT's Contracting States under different bilateral investment treaties: certain of them applying a generous approach to legal entities incorporated in a state with no significant business presence there (such as the Netherlands) and certain others applying a more restrictive approach (such as the USA). The ECT is a multilateral treaty with Article 17(1) drafted in permissive terms, not surprisingly, in order to accommodate these different state practices....122\n\n*Ibid*. at para. 282 (citing para. 155 of the *Plama* decision).\n\n450.\n\nMoreover:\n\n[A] putative covered investor has legitimate expectations of such advantages until that right's exercise. A putative investor therefore requires reasonable notice before making any investment in the host state whether or not that host state has exercised its right under Article 17(1) ECT. [...] [T]he object and purpose of the ECT suggest that the right's exercise should not have retrospective effect.123\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 283 (citing paras. 161-162 of the *Plama* decision).\n\n451.\n\nRespondent counters that the ECT and P&C Agreement, contrary to Claimant's contentions, are not independent of each other, but cover much of the same ground. The P&C Agreement, upon its ratification, was published in the Russian Federation's Official Gazette and the official gazettes of the EU Member States. Investors must be deemed to be on notice of it, argues Respondent. In Article 30(h), the P&C Agreement denies benefits to companies incorporated in an EU Member State that do not have their principal place of business or central administration in such State and whose operations do not \"possess a real and continuous link with the economy\" of one of the EU Member States.\n\n452.\n\nRespondent also maintains that the *Plama* case is \"weak authority with respect to its treatment of denial of benefits clauses\" and \"is suspect in its reasoning.\"124 It argues that:\n\nThe *Plama* standard, if accepted, would also impose an impossible standard for States, particularly for States in transition to a free market economy. The *Plama* standard converts something that the investor knows with certainty, whether it has substantial business in the State of incorporation and whether it is owned or controlled by third or host State nationals, into a burden to make such a determination with respect to a potential investor that a host State cannot know or determine.125\n\nSecond Memorial, paras. 340, 342.\n\n*Ibid*. at para. 343.\n\n453.\n\nRespondent concludes:\n\nAt bottom, this is a domestic dispute involving enforcement of Russian taxes. [...] Accepting the Russian Federation's interpretation of Article 17(1) and of the interrelationship between Article 17(1) and Article 30(h) of the EU-Russia Partnership Agreement would constitute a principled basis, supported by the language of the two treaties, for distinguishing essentially domestic disputes from disputes involving genuine investors of Contracting Parties into the Russian Federation.126\n\n*Ibid*. at para. 344.\n\n454.\n\nClaimant contends that the reserved right to deny under Article 17(1) must be exercised. Article 17(1) could have been otherwise drafted, as is Article VI of the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services, to state that the advantages of Part III \"shall be denied\" to \"a juridical person owned or controlled by persons of a non-Member State constituted under the laws of a Member State, but not engaged in substantive business operations in the territory of Member States.\" But the drafters of the ECT, submits Claimant, deliberately chose to provide for a reserved, optional right in Article 17(1), a right that must be exercised to take effect, and only prospectively. Russia's reliance on the P&C Agreement is unavailing, argues Claimant, because it defines a \"Community company\" or a \"Russian company\" for the purpose of that Agreement itself (\"for the purpose of this Agreement\"); the ECT makes no reference to that Agreement while it does refer to other \"related instruments.\"\n\n455.\n\nFinally, at the stage of oral argument, the above contentions were canvassed anew by both Parties.\n\n**b) Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n456.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the position of Claimant on the interpretation and application of Article 17(1) to the instant case is more persuasive than that of Respondent. Article 17(1) does not deny *simpliciter* the advantages of Part III of the ECT\u2014as it easily could have been worded to do\u2014to a legal entity if the citizens or nationals of a third State own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business in the Contracting Party in which it is organized. It rather \"reserves the right\" of each Contracting Party to deny the advantages of that Part to such an entity. This imports that, to effect denial, the Contracting Party must exercise the right. Has the Russian Federation done so, either by concluding the P&C Agreement with the EU or by the passage in its pleading quoted at the end of paragraph 447 above? Not in the Tribunal's view.\n\n457.\n\nThe P&C Agreement makes no reference to the ECT and the ECT makes no reference to it. They cover some common ground, and the P&C Agreement does require that benefiting companies have their principal place of business in and possess a real and continuous link with the economy of an EU State. But the lack of any reference to the ECT in the P&C Agreement and the lack of any reference to the P&C Agreement in the ECT defeats reliance upon Article 30(h) of the P&C Agreement as constituting the required exercise of a right under Article 17(1) of the ECT.\n\n458.\n\nIn any event, if the passage in Respondent's First Memorial quoted above in paragraph 447 is construed as an exercise of the reserved right of denial, it can only be prospective in effect from the date of that Memorial. To treat denial as retrospective would, in the light of the ECT's \"Purpose,\" as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty (\"The Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field...\") be incompatible \"with the objectives and principles of the Charter.\" Paramount among those objectives and principles is \"Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments\" as specified by the terms of Article 10 of the Treaty. Retrospective application of a denial of rights would be inconsistent with such promotion and protection and constitute treatment at odds with those terms.\n\n459.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds, on the basis of the evidence before it, that Respondent has not denied and cannot now be heard to deny, and will not be able to deny to Claimant in any merits phase of these proceedings, the advantages and the benefits of Part III of the ECT on the basis of Article 17.\n\n**3. Substantive Conditions**\n-----------------------------\n\n460.\n\nIt is convenient here to revisit the text of Article 17(1), which specifies that:\n\nEach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized [...]\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nIt is apparent from the wording of Article 17(1) that two additional cumulative substantive conditions must be met before the \"denial-of-benefits\" clause can be exercised in respect of any particular legal entity. First, such legal entity must be owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a third State; second, the legal entity must have no substantial business activities in the place in which it is organized.\n\n461.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's conclusion, explained in the previous section, that Respondent cannot invoke Article 17(1) due to its failure to give notice to Claimant that it was doing so, there is no need, in principle, to address Respondent's submissions that these substantive conditions for the application of Article 17(1) have been satisfied. However, since the Tribunal was briefed extensively on the issues of ownership and control, and on the issue of whether Russia is a \"third state\" for purposes of Article 17(1), the Tribunal has decided to set out its analysis and conclusions in respect of these issues. The Tribunal also addresses in this section Respondent's alternative contention that Claimant is owned and/or controlled by Israeli nationals, it being undisputed that Israel is a \"third state\" for purposes of Article 17(1). Since Claimant has conceded that it conducts no substantial business activities in the Isle of Man, the Tribunal does not need to address that issue.\n\n**a) Ownership and Control of Claimant**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Factual Background**\n--------------------------\n\n***(1) Claimant and its Affiliates***\n-------------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nThe organizational chart in the Appendix to this Interim Award illustrates the ownership structure of Claimant and its affiliates.127\n\nAppendix: Yukos Holding Structure after 20 October 2003 (based on charts submitted by both Parties in November 2008 as demonstrative exhibits for the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Admissibility).\n\n463.\n\nThe following facts, illustrated in the chart in the Appendix, were not contested:\n\n\u2022 Claimant owns 50,340,995 shares (or 2.25 percent) of Yukos, and is itself wholly-owned by GML.\n\n\u2022 GML was incorporated in September 1997, and was originally named Flaymon Limited (it changed its name to Group Menatep Limited in December 1997, and then to GML Limited in November 2005). GML is a company registered in Gibraltar, whose principal business is to conduct investing activities through various wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\n\u2022 The shares of GML are held by the following seven trusts created in Guernsey in 2003 and 2005 (the \" **Guernsey Trusts** \"), in stakes ranging from 7.3 percent to 52.3 percent:\n\no The Auriga Trust established on 20 October 2003 by Mr. Mikhail Brudno, the former President of the Yukos Refining and Marketing Division. Mr. Brudno and his family are named Beneficiaries.128 The Auriga Trust holds 7.3 percent of GML.\n\no The Draco Trust, established on 20 October 2003 by Mr. Vladimir Dubov. Mr. Dubov and his family are named Beneficiaries. The Draco Trust holds 7.3 percent of GML.\n\no The Mensa Trust, established on 20 October 2003 by Mr. Platon Lebedev, a director of Yukos Universal Ltd. Mr. Lebedev and his family are named Beneficiaries. The Mensa Trust holds 7.3 percent of GML.\n\no The Tucana Trust, established on 20 October 2003 by Mr. Vasily Shakhnovksy, the former President of Yukos Moscow. Mr. Shakhnovsky and his family are named Beneficiaries. The Tucana Trust holds 7.3 percent of GML.\n\no The Pictor Trust, established on 20 October 2003 by Mr. Leonid Nevzlin. Mr. Nevzlin and his family are named Beneficiaries. The Pictor Trust holds 8.6 percent of GML.\n\no The Southern Cross Trust, established on 26 March 2005. Its Settlor was the Pavo Trust (itself established on 20 October 2003). The original beneficiaries were Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Nevzlin and Mr. Nevzlin's issue born before expiry of the trust period. Mr. Khodorkovsky was removed as a beneficiary on 3 October 2005. The Southern Cross Trust holds 9.9 percent of GML.\n\no The Palmus Trust, established on 5 March 2003. Its Settlor was the Palmus Foundation of Lichtenstein. Mr. Khodorkovsky, Deputy Chairman of Yukos until 2003, was a Beneficiary until 26 April 2005. The Palmus Trust holds 52.3 percent of GML, and thus the majority stake in GML.\n\nCapitalized terms used herein, unless otherwise clear from the context, are defined in the respective constitutive documents of the Trusts (known as \"Settlements\" or, in the case of the Southern Cross Trust, the \"Declaration of Discretionary Trust\").\n\n464.\n\nThe main issue before the Tribunal in the present section of its Interim Award is whether this ownership structure leads to the conclusion that citizens or nationals of a \"third state\" (*i.e.*, the Settlors/Beneficiaries of the Guernsey Trusts) own or control Claimant. Before summarizing the Parties' submissions, a more detailed review of the Guernsey Trusts is required. This review will make it easier for the Tribunal to then consider the Parties' submissions, carry out its analysis and draw its conclusions.\n\n***(2) The Guernsey Trusts***\n-----------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Auriga Trust, the Draco Trust, the Mensa Trust, the Tucana Trust, and the Pictor Trust were all constituted on 20 October 2003. They share identical structures and key features (the \" **Auriga-type Trusts** \"). These are distinct from the Southern Cross Trust (a later-established trust whose assets were appointed out of the Pavo Trust, a trust 129 originally settled by Mr. Khodorkovsky at the same time as the Auriga-type Trusts)129 and the Palmus Trust (an earlier-established trust with the majority stake of GML shares). The Tribunal will now review each \"type\" of trust in turn.\n\nNo constitutive documents for the Pavo Trust were disclosed, but certain information about the Pavo Trust was available from documents relating to the Southern Cross Trust.\n\n*(a) Auriga-type Trusts*\n------------------------\n\n466.\n\nThe key common features of the Auriga-type Trusts, other than the common date of settlement, are as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Trustee is Rysaffe Trustee Company (C.I.) Limited (\" **Rysaffe** \"), which is a fiduciary services trust company in Guernsey (Channel Islands) licensed by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.\n\n\u2022 The Trustees, in each case, designated a nominee in the British Virgin Islands (\" **BVI** \") to be the registered owner of the GML shares in the Trust Fund. The nominees are, respectively, Auriga Nominees Limited (BVI), Draco Nominees Limited (BVI), Mensa Nominees Limited (BVI), Pictor Nominees Limited (BVI) and Tucana Nominees Limited (BVI).\n\n\u2022 Each trust was settled by an individual shareholder of GML.130\n\n\u2022 In each case, the Beneficiaries are defined in the Third Schedule of the Settlement and include the Settlor and ten other persons, understood to be members of the Settlor's family, with the International Committee of the Red Cross (the \" **Red Cross** \") being named as a residual beneficiary.\n\n\u2022 Initially, $1,000 was settled into each Trust, and each Trust expressly contemplated the further settlement of GML securities into trust.\n\n\u2022 In each case, GML shares on which GML itself has a call option were subsequently settled into trust.131\n\n\u2022 Each trust is constituted as a discretionary trust, but a Protector is required to consent to important decisions (see next paragraph) and nominate any additional Beneficiaries.\n\n\u2022 In each case, the Settlor is appointed First Protector.\n\n\u2022 The First Protector, *i.e*., the Settlor, is empowered to appoint two Panels, known as the First Panel and the Second Panel, as well as a Confirmator. The First Panel is empowered to appoint a new Protector when the existing Protector dies, wishes to retire or becomes \"incapacitated.\" The Confirmator is called upon to certify that the Protector understands the nature of documents he may execute and that he is acting free from undue influence and not under duress. The Second Panel is empowered to appoint a new Confirmator in case of death or retirement of the Confirmator or when the Trustee determines that the Confirmator refuses or is unable to act.\n\n\u2022 In each case, the First Protector nominated GML to be the First and Second Panels and no further nominations have been made to these positions.\n\n\u2022 In each case, the Protector has power to release or, to any extent, restrict the future exercise of any powers vested in a Protector.\n\nMr. Brudno in respect of the Auriga Trust; Mr. Dubov in respect of the Draco Trust; Mr. Lebedev in respect of the Mensa Trust; Mr. Nevzlin in respect of the Pictor Trust; Vasily Shakhnovsky in respect of the Tucana Trust\n\nEach of Messrs. Brudno, Dubov, Lebedev and Shakhnovsky settled 348,101 shares of GML into trust; Mr. Nevzlin settled 411,393 shares of GML into trust. Each of these individuals, on 24 May 2003, had granted GML a call option in respect of their respective shareholdings. On 20 October 2003 (*i.e.*, contemporaneously with the settlement of the Auriga-type Trusts), the call option deeds were novated so that the Trustees and their nominee companies stepped into the shoes of the individual shareholders. GML consented to the transfer of the shareholdings to the nominee companies. The call options, which are expressly unconditional, irrevocable and continue to be capable of being exercised until the dissolution of GML, are expressly governed by English law.\n\n467.\n\nThe respective Settlements state that the Trustees have \"absolute and uncontrolled\" powers and discretions, subject to exercising them in the \"most expedient [way] for the benefit of all or any of the beneficiaries\" (Clause 11). At the same time, prior or simultaneous Protector consent is required for the exercise of the following powers (Clause 20 and Seventh Schedule of the Settlement, in each case):\n\n\u2022 the power to appoint an expiry date for the Trust (in default of appointment, the perpetuity period is 100 years);\n\n\u2022 the overriding power to reappoint the trust assets on new trusts for the benefit of all or any one or more of the Beneficiaries (Clause 5);\n\n\u2022 the power to exclude a Beneficiary from the Beneficiary class (Clause 7);\n\n\u2022 the power to add additional beneficiaries (Clause 8), nominations for same being made by the Protector and certified by the Confirmator;\n\n\u2022 the power to change the proper law of the Settlement (Clause 9);\n\n\u2022 the power to delegate the powers or discretions imposed on or given to the Trustees (Clause 12);\n\n\u2022 the power to restrict or release the future exercise of powers by the Trustees (Clause 13);\n\n\u2022 the power to amend the administrative provisions of the Settlement (Clause 24); and\n\n\u2022 the power to deal in or dispose of GML securities (save by way of transfer to nominees for the Trustee or in response to the exercise by GML of its call option over the shares transferred into trust).\n\n468.\n\nClause 14 sets out the circumstances under which new and/or additional Trustees may be appointed, and how Trustees can be removed. By Clause 14 and the Fourth Schedule of the Settlement, the following have the power to appoint new or additional Trustees (in descending order of priority):\n\n\u2022 the Protector;\n\n\u2022 the surviving or continuing Trustees;\n\n\u2022 the Trustee or Trustees desiring to be discharged;\n\n\u2022 the Liquidator or personal representative of the last surviving trustee; and\n\n\u2022 the Royal Court of Guernsey (or court of the relevant forum, if it has changed in accordance with Clause 9).\n\n469.\n\nArticles 4 and 5 of the First Schedule, in each case, contain what are commonly known in trust-law terms as Anti-Bartlett provisions.132 These provide that:\n\n\u2022 the Trustee is not bound to interfere in the business of any company in which the trust is interested; and\n\n\u2022 the Trustee is not bound to obtain information regarding any such company.\n\nIt is the Trustees' duty where they hold *controlling* shareholding in a private company to ensure that they have a sufficiently detailed flow of information concerning the running of the company's affairs to be able to intervene in its activities if and when considered appropriate. The leading case is *Bartlett v. Barclays Bank Ltd. (No. 1)* [1980] Ch. 515, pp. 533-534: hence the reference to the Anti-Bartlett provisions, being provisions modifying the general law requirements of the *Bartlett* case.\n\n*(b) Southern Cross Trust*\n--------------------------\n\n470.\n\nThe structure of the Southern Cross Trust is as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Declaration of Discretionary Trust is dated 26 April 2005 (the \" **Southern Cross Declaration** \").\n\n\u2022 The Trustee is Rysaffe.133 \u2022 The initial trust fund was $1,000,000.\n\n\u2022 The original Beneficiaries were Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Nevzlin and Mr. Nevzlin's issue born before expiry of the trust period.\n\n\u2022 The trust period is to run until 16 October 2103 or such earlier date as the Trustee may designate by deed.\n\n\u2022 The power to appoint new or additional Trustees is vested in the following (in order of priority): (a) the surviving or continuing Trustees; (b) the Trustee or Trustees desiring to be discharged; (c) the liquidator or personal representative of the last surviving Trustee; and (d) the Royal Court of Guernsey (or court of the relevant forum, if the clause permitting a change in the proper law of the trust has been operated).\n\nRysaffe designated Southern Cross Nominees Limited (BVI), a company in the British Virgin Islands, to be the registered owner of the GML shares in the Trust Fund.\n\n471.\n\nBy deed dated 26 April 2005 (*i.e.*, on the same day the Southern Cross Trust was constituted), 474,685 shares in GML (with unpaid dividends thereon), on which GML had a call option, were appointed out of the Pavo Trust134 and into the Southern Cross Trust.\n\nThe Pavo Trust had been established at the same time as the Auriga-type Trusts (*i.e.*, on 20 October 2003) and, indeed, appears to have been similar if not identical in structure to the Auriga-type Trusts. The settlor of the Pavo Trust was Mr. Khodorkovsky, and the GML shares that had been settled into the Pavo Trust had originally been owned by Mr. Khodorkovsky. As was the case with all of the Auriga-type Trusts, prior to the settlement of the Pavo Trust, GML had been granted an option to purchase these shares by deed dated 24 May 2003; the Call Option Deed was subsequently novated on 20 October 2003 (to recognize the transfer of the obligations from Mr. Khodorkovsky to Pavo Trust) and again on 30 September 2005 (to recognize the transfer of the obligations from the Pavo Trust to the Southern Cross Trust).\n\n472.\n\nMr. Khodorkovsky was removed as a Beneficiary on 3 October 2005.\n\n473.\n\nThe Southern Cross Trust differs from the Auriga-type Trusts in that:\n\n\u2022 there is no Protector;\n\n\u2022 there is no Confirmator; and\n\n\u2022 the Southern Cross Declaration does not expressly contemplate the future transfer of GML securities into trust, and thus there are no specific prohibitions or restrictions on dealing with such securities.\n\n474.\n\nOn the other hand, the Southern Cross Declaration has Anti-Bartlett provisions identical to those found in the Auriga-type Trusts. That is to say, the Trustee is not bound to interfere in the business of any companies in which the Trust invests; nor is it bound to obtain information relating to such business.\n\n*(c) Palmus Trust*\n------------------\n\n475.\n\nThe original structure and key features of the Palmus Trust are as follows:\n\n\u2022 It was created by a Settlement on 5 March 2003 (the \" **Palmus Settlement** \").\n\n\u2022 The Settlor was the Palmus Foundation of Liechtenstein.\n\n\u2022 The Trustee is Palmus Trust Company Limited (a Guernsey company).135\n\n\u2022 The trust is for the First Beneficiary (Mr. Khodorkovsky) during the Initial Period (which was to expire upon death or incapacity of the First Beneficiary, if earlier than the expiry date of the trust).\n\n\u2022 The perpetuity period is 100 years, subject to the Trustee's power to appoint an earlier date by deed.\n\n\u2022 Subject to the trusts in favour of the First Beneficiary, trust assets are to be held during the trust period for such members of the class of beneficiaries (other than the First Beneficiary) as the First Beneficiary might appoint (Clause 4.2).\n\n\u2022 Upon expiry of the trust, its assets are to be held on trust for the First Beneficiary if still living (Clause 4.4).\n\n\u2022 The residual beneficiary is the Red Cross.\n\n\u2022 Initially, $10,000 was settled into the trust, and the trust expressly contemplated the further settlement of GML securities (Schedule 8(ix)).\n\n\u2022 2,499,999 shares of GML (unencumbered by any call options) were settled into the trust by the Palmus Foundation on 8 March 2003.136\n\n\u2022 The trust is constituted as a discretionary trust but, as in the case of Auriga-type Trusts, Protector consent is required for the exercise of certain powers by the Trustees and the nomination of additional Beneficiaries has to be done by the Protector.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Khodorkovsky was appointed First Protector.\n\n\u2022 The First Protector nominates the Panel, whose function is to appoint successor Protectors.\n\n\u2022 Successor Protectors may be appointed only where the existing Protector dies, wishes to retire or becomes \"incapacitated.\" \"Incapacitated\" is a defined term, as for the Auriga-type Trusts, and the consequences of a return to capacity are the same.\n\n\u2022 The First Protector nominates the Confirmator, whose function and powers are the same as in the Auriga-type Trusts, save that in the case of the Palmus Trust it is the retiring Confirmator who appoints a successor (there is no Second Panel).\n\n\u2022 A BVI company was appointed Confirmator on 3 April 2003; it appointed another BVI company successor when it retired, on 26 August 2004.\n\n\u2022 The Protector has the same power as in the Auriga-type Trusts to release or to restrict the future exercise of any powers vested in a Protector.\n\nBy contrast to the other Guernsey Trusts, the Palmus Trustees did not designate a nominee.\n\nBy contrast to the GML shares settled into the Auriga-type Trusts, the GML shares settled into the Palmus Trust were not subject to any call option granted to GML.\n\n476.\n\nThe extent of required Protector consent under the Palmus Trust is similar to that existing under the Auriga-type Trusts, except that:\n\n\u2022 in the case of the Palmus Trust, the Trustee is specifically prohibited from \"selling\" GML securities without the consent of the Protector (the terms of the Auriga-type Trusts prohibit dealing in general in such shares); and\n\n\u2022 there is no exception to this prohibition.\n\n477.\n\nThe power to appoint new or additional Trustees under the Palmus Trust is exactly the same as it is under the Auriga-type Trusts.\n\n478.\n\nThe Palmus Trust has Anti-Bartlett provisions identical to those found in the Auriga-type Trusts.\n\n479.\n\nOn 3 April 2003 the First Beneficiary (*i.e.*, Mr. Khodorkovsky) exercised his power of appointment arising under Clause 4.2 of the Palmus Declaration to appoint a Secondary Beneficiary, who will have an interest in possession in the trust fund during the Secondary Period. The Secondary Period runs from the expiry of the Initial Period until:\n\n\u2022 death or incapacity of the Secondary Beneficiary;\n\n\u2022 return to capacity of the First Beneficiary (in case of his incapacity); or \u2022 expiry of the trust period.\n\n480.\n\nThe Secondary Beneficiary will be the first person in the following list who is living and not \"incapacitated\" on expiry of the Initial Period:\n\n\u2022 Mikhail Brudno \u2022 Vladimir Dubov \u2022 Alexey Golubovich \u2022 Leonid Nevzlin \u2022 Platon Lebedev \u2022 Vasily Shakhnovsky\n\n481.\n\nUpon expiry of the Secondary Period, the trust fund is to be held in trust for the First Beneficiary (Mr. Khodorkovsky) if he is still living and not \"incapacitated\" as if the Initial Period had recommenced.\n\n482.\n\nBy two deeds dated 26 April 2005, Mr. Khodorkovsky was removed as a beneficiary and Mr. Nevzlin was substituted within the terms of the original settlement as First Beneficiary.\n\n**(ii) Parties' Submissions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***(1) Ownership***\n-------------------\n\n483.\n\nRespondent submits that ownership of GML (and thus of GML's wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Claimant) has remained essentially unchanged over the period 1999 to the present. In particular, Respondent asserts that Mr. Khodorkovsky and/or Mr. Lebedev have owned, either in person or through the Guernsey Trusts, 59.5 percent of the shares of GML. In the broader context to which Respondent repeatedly refers, the trustees of the Guernsey Trusts (or their nominees in the British Virgin Islands) are nominal owners only, the economic interest of the ownership of GML having always remained with the \"Russian oligarchs.\"\n\n484.\n\nIn its Second Memorial, Respondent impugns the structure of the Guernsey Trusts more directly, referencing the First Opinion submitted by its expert, Mr. Martin Mann, QC. Based on the opinion of Mr. Mann, Respondent asserts that the Trustees' powers are so circumscribed in the respective Settlements and Declaration, that the trusts were \"incompletely constituted and ineffective\" and the Trustees never became \"beneficial owners\" of the shares of GML settled into those trusts.\n\n485.\n\nIn response, Claimant asserts that its parent company, GML, has been owned since 20 October 2003 by the Guernsey Trusts.137 More particularly, Claimant posits that GML is owned as follows: 2,499,999 shares (52.3 percent) by Palmus Trust Company Limited (Guernsey) as trustees of the Palmus Trust; 474,685 shares (9.9 percent) by Southern Cross Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee for Rysaffe as trustee of the Southern Cross Trust; 411,393 shares (8.6 percent) by Pictor Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee on trust for Rysaffe as trustee of the Pictor Trust; 348,101 shares (7.3 percent) by Mensa Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee on trust for Rysaffe as trustee of the Mensa Trust; 348,101 shares (7.3 percent) by Auriga Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee on trust for Rysaffe as trustee of the Auriga Trust; 348,101 shares (7.3 percent) by Tucana Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee on trust for Rysaffe as trustee of the Tuncana Trust; and 348,101 shares (7.3 percent) by Draco Nominees Limited (BVI) as nominee on trust for Rysaffe as trustee of the Draco Trust.\n\nThis shareholding has since been modified only as to the transfer of the shareholding of Pavo Nominees Limited (BVI) to Southern Cross Nominees Limited (BVI), and the sale of 221,519 shares representing 4.4 percent of the share capital of GML by Carina Nominees Limited (BVI) to GML. Annex C-195.\n\n486.\n\nIn support of its position, and in response to the first opinion of Mr. Mann, Claimant relies on the expert opinion of Mr. Brian Green, QC. In his first opinion, Mr. Green opines, based on a detailed review of the respective Settlements and of the Southern Cross Declaration, that the Guernsey Trusts are \"routine examples of offshore trusts.\" An analysis of the salient features of each trust demonstrates, he writes, a coherent set of trusts operating for the benefit of all or any of the beneficiaries for the duration of the relevant trust period. He concludes that the trusts in question are real and valid, and that the restrictions on sale or other disposition of the GML shares held in trust do not affect the trustees' ownership of those shares.\n\n487.\n\nAs to the issue of \"beneficial ownership\" within the trust structure, Mr. Green reasons as follows (at paragraphs 24 and 25 of his First Opinion):\n\n24. (1) Where there is no trust, legal and beneficial ownership tend to go hand in hand.\n\n(2) Where there is a trust, trustees hold the rights attaching to their legal ownership of property on trust for their beneficiaries. \"Beneficial ownership\" therefore tends to follow \"equitable ownership.\"\n\n(3) However, where the equitable interests under a trust are limited to membership of a class of objects of discretionary powers (as in the present case), so that members of the class are not \"equitable owners\" of the trust property, such objects are not the \"beneficial owners\" of the trust property either. Particularly so where (as in the present case) the class of objects is open, there being powers to add members to the discretionary class.\n\n25. (1) The rights attaching to legal ownership of property will carry with them the rights to the fruits of, and to the exercise of powers relating to, the property in question. Thus, to take the example of shares with which this case is concerned, it is the trustees who would generally be entitled:\n\n(a) to receive dividends and other distributions in respect of the shares;\n\n(b) to receive the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the shares (and thus to take the benefit of any capital growth in their value in the meantime); and\n\n(c) to exercise the voting rights attaching to such shares.\n\nA company (e.g. GML) cannot refuse to account to the trustees in respect of a dividend on the basis that the trustee will hold the dividend for the benefit of the beneficiaries.\n\n(2) These rights are indicia of what would be described as \"beneficial ownership\" if the person holding such rights were not a trustee.\n\n(3) Whilst the trustees are not as a matter of strict definition \"beneficial owners\" (because they are trustees), nevertheless their \"ownership\" carries with it the right to assert like ownership rights to those which would be enjoyed by a beneficial owner.\n\n(4) In a case such as the present, the Trustees are the only persons having the present right to assert such ownership rights as are catalogued at paragraph 25(1)(a) to (c) above.\n\n***(2) Control***\n-----------------\n\n488.\n\nSince either ownership or control of Claimant could meet the requirements of this facet of Article 17 of the ECT, the Parties and their respective experts also focused their submissions on \"control.\" In respect of \"control,\" the Tribunal notes that, in his Second Opinion, Mr. Mann states clearly that he was not contesting \"the trite and the obvious, *i.e.*, that the trusts are valid, by reference to the general law and the standard forms and precedents.\"138 Mr. Mann then posits that, in his view, the \"relevant question\" is \"how the trusts impact control over the GML shares.\"\n\nMr. Martin Mann, QC, *Second Opinion re Auriga Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the* *Pavo Trust*, 21 July 2008 (hereinafter \"Mann, Second Opinion\"), Section D, para. 1.3.\n\n489.\n\nIn relation to control of Claimant, Respondent stresses the following facts:\n\n\u2022 Claimant has at all times been 100 percent owned by GML.\n\n\u2022 Claimant's Articles of Association require that all decisions be taken by GML.\n\n\u2022 Until they were amended on 16 March 2007, GML's Articles of Association provided, at Article 42, that key decisions regarding any subsidiary, including Claimant, could not be taken without the prior written consent of shareholders of GML holding a majority of the issued shares carrying a right to vote at general meetings.\n\n490.\n\nPrior to the transfer of the GML shares into the Guernsey Trusts on 20 October 2003, GML was directly owned by Mr. Khodorkovsky (9.5 percent), Mr. Nevzlin (8 percent), Mr. Lebedev (7 percent), Mr. Doubov (7 percent), Mr. Brudno (7 percent), Mr. Shakhnovsky (7 percent) and by the Palmus Foundation, which GML described as a \"special structure\" (50 percent).139 Respondent asserts that disclosures made on the GML website (since removed) explained that Mr. Lebedev had the decisive vote in decisions of GML (at the time known as Group Menatep) as regards voting the controlling block of shares of Yukos held directly and indirectly by Yukos Universal Limited. Respondent concludes that \"[i]t is indisputable therefore that before the transfer of the GML Limited shares into Guernsey trusts, the control of Claimant was vested with the Russian oligarchs.\"140\n\nThis was disclosed, at the time, in a document explaining \"decision-making process of Group Menatep,\" namely a note authored by Anton Drel and Andrei Dontsov, who were reportedly legal advisors of GML Limited. Group Menatep Limited, *Information for the Management of OAO NK* \u2018Yukos' at 4 (2002) (Exhibit R-4).\n\nSecond Memorial, para. 265.\n\n491.\n\nRespondent argues that the transfer of the GML shares into trusts on 20 October 2003, after the arrest of Mr. Lebedev by Russian authorities on 3 July 2003, demonstrates that the trusts were used by the \"Russian oligarchs\" as a way to maintain control over their GML shares through an opaque ownership structure in an effort to evade the Russian authorities.\n\n492.\n\nIn his First Opinion, Mr. Mann concludes that the effect of the provisions in the Settlements of the Auriga-type Trusts and the Palmus Trust giving the Protector control over the exercise of certain of the Trustees' powers and the power to appoint new or additional trustees, is to render the Trustees' roles within the trusts \"wholly illusory.\" On the basis of this opinion, Respondent submits that the trustees exert no control over the GML shares, and that the \"Russian oligarchs\" therefore continue to control Claimant (through GML) just as they did before the Guernsey Trusts were inserted into the ownership structure.\n\n493.\n\nClaimant does not contest that GML was controlled by Mr. Lebedev and others, as outlined on the Group Menatep website, prior to the transfer of the GML shares into the Guernsey Trusts. Rather, relying on the expert opinions of Mr. Green, Claimant submits that within the legitimate trust structure established by Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev and other \"oligarchs\" control resided at all times with the Trustees.\n\n494.\n\nAs for Respondent's submission with respect to the timing of the creation of the trusts, Claimant answers that planning for the trusts was underway well before the events of July 2003. Respondent points to letters of reference of 6 December 2002 from UBS AG to each of the future settlors of the Auriga-type Trusts.141 These letters state that each of the future settlors had informed UBS prior to that date that he was \"in the process of establishing a trust on the Isle of Guernsey (Channel Islands).\" Claimant also notes that the other Guernsey Trust, the Palmus Trust, was created on 5 March 2003. Claimant submits that the trusts were not created in pursuance of \"treaty shopping\" but for legitimate considerations of wealth preservation.\n\n*See* Annex C-1242.\n\n495.\n\nIn reply to Mr. Mann's conclusions on the issue of control, Claimant relies on the expert opinion of Mr. Green. In his First Opinion, Mr. Green defines his terms of reference with respect to \"control\" as follows:\n\n(2) (a) As regards \"control,\" I understand the question for me to be \"who within any given Trust controls the GML shares?\" in the context of the particular question before this Tribunal of \"who controls GML?\"\n\n(b) I understand, therefore, that \"control\" of the GML shares for these purposes is concerned with \"control\" over those rights attaching to the GML shares that allow \"control\" to be exercised over GML.\n\n496.\n\nMr. Green then reaches the following conclusion:\n\n166. In conclusion, recognising that the meaning of Article 17 of the ECT is a matter of ECT law, I understand that the present enquiry as to who \"controls\" the GML shares is concerned with \"control\" of the voting (and other rights) attaching to the GML shares that allow \"control\" to be exercised over GML.\n\n167. On this basis, it is clear that it is the Trustees who have control of the GML shares for present purposes, as they have both:\n\n(1) the power (free from any need to obtain Protector consent); and\n\n(2) the duty to properly consider whether or not\n\nto vote (or otherwise exercise) the rights attaching to the GML shares.\n\n497.\n\nIn answer, Mr. Mann states that Mr. Green's proposition does not answer the \"control\" issue \"very precisely.\" In Mr. Mann's opinion, the control issue is more accurately defined by posing the following question:\n\nDo the rights within any given trust give the trustee meaningful power through its holding of GML shares over the way in which GML's affairs including its daily business are conducted?\n\n498.\n\nIn his reply, Mr. Green opines that the trustees do have \"meaningful control\" over the voting rights attaching to the GML shares. \"No other party does,\" he says.\n\n499.\n\nThe experts deal with several specific issues of trust law in reaching their respective conclusions. Some of the issues that were thoroughly and exhaustively debated in their respective written opinions as well as during their oral evidence include:\n\n\u2022 the proper construction of trust instruments, including what constitutes admissible context for the interpretation of their provisions;\n\n\u2022 the effect of the provisions in the respective Settlements granting significant powers of consent (and therefore veto) to the Protector over the exercise by the Trustees of some of their powers under the trust documents, and, in that context, whether the Protector exercises its powers as a fiduciary or purely in its personal interest;\n\n\u2022 the nature and effect of the Anti-Bartlett provisions on the Trustees' ability to control the rights attaching to the GML shares;\n\n\u2022 the effect of GML's call options over the GML shares held in trust (except the Palmus Trust) on the Trustees' control over those shares; and\n\n\u2022 the *Saunders v. Vautier* principle, according to which the beneficiaries of any given trust (if ascertained and of full age and capacity) may all come together and terminate the trust, and the application of that principle to the trusts in the present case.\n\n**(iii)Tribunal's Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n***(1) Introduction: Establishing the Framework for Analysis***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nAs noted earlier,142 the Tribunal's decision concerning the notification requirement in Article 17 renders the \"ownership/control\" issue moot for purposes of the admissibility objection raised by Respondent on the basis of the denial-of-benefits provision. The Tribunal considers that it is nevertheless its duty to set out its decision on ownership/control of Claimant, not only because of the substantial effort and resources the Parties expended in order to present the relevant facts, arguments and expert opinions on this issue, but also because it recognizes that the Guernsey Trusts (and the ownership/control structure more generally) may well feature in Respondent's arguments and allegations in any merits phase of this arbitration.143\n\n*See supra* at para. 461.\n\n*See* Respondent's First Memorial, Factual Appendix, pp. 103-131.\n\n501.\n\nThus, the Tribunal will commence its analysis by recalling the framework that Mr. Mann and Mr. Green each urged on the Tribunal for the determination of a key issue, the power given to third parties over the exercise by the Trustees of their discretionary powers.\n\n502.\n\nMr. Mann presents his view of the appropriate framework in his Second Opinion. After setting out various categories within which powers granted to third parties may fall (fiduciary power, beneficial or personal power, either of such powers with more or less constraints attached thereto), Mr. Mann writes as follows:\n\n2.9 Powers given to third parties may fall within any one of these categories and if they include a cluster of powers some may fall within all or one or more of these categories. Into which category a particular power falls depends upon the true construction of the trust instrument.\n\n2.10 Each case is therefore to be decided against the background of its own circumstances and by reference to the particular terms of the trust instrument. It is the intention of the settlor at the time of the settlement which has to be discerned.\n\n2.11 Ascertaining the true construction of a document is not simply a matter of construing the meaning of words. It is a common sense process which includes taking into account admissible contextual background. The context or matrix which, in my opinion, I should take into account in this case includes that these trusts formed part of a series of transactions designed to ensure that the original owners would be able to retain total control over the shares transferred into trust despite the existence of those trusts.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n503.\n\nTellingly, in the next paragraph of his opinion, Mr. Mann states that the evidence for \"this\"\u2014 *i.e.*, the evidence for the allegation that the trusts were part of a series of transactions designed to ensure that the original owners retain control\u2014is to be found in the witness statement of Mr. Neil McLarnon, which was attached as Appendix 3 to Mr. Mann's Second Opinion.\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, however, its decision in Procedural Order No. 8 of 5 August 2008, as follows:\n\n14. The Tribunal orders that the McLarnon Witness Statement, including Exhibit NSP1, be excluded from the evidentiary record and no reference to or reliance on that Witness Statement be permitted in the Mann Opinion and in these arbitrations generally.\n\n505.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has not considered the evidence in the witness statement of Mr. McLarnon, nor has Mr. Green seen or considered it.144\n\nMr. Green states: \"I understand that the final sentence of para. 2.11 and para. 2.12 are to be regarded as struck out of Mr Mann's Second Opinion. For the record, I have never seen Mr McLarnon's witness statement, and so have never been influenced by it.\" Mr. Brian Green, QC, *Second Opinion re Auriga-Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo Trust*, 30 September 2008 (hereinafter \"Green, Second Opinion\"), para. 67.\n\n506.\n\nThe fact that the first element of Mr. Mann's contextual background was excluded from the evidentiary record weakens considerably Mr. Mann's conclusion on this seminal issue.\n\n507.\n\nHowever, the evidence in the McLarnon Witness Statement is not the only evidence that Mr. Mann relies on for his interpretation of the effect of the various powers given to third parties on control of the GML shares held in trust (and thus of Claimant). In the subsequent paragraph of his Second Opinion, Mr. Mann asserts that:\n\n2.13 There are also a good many solid pointers within the four corners of the trust deeds to the protectors' powers of veto under all of the trust deeds in which protector control is a relevant consideration having been inserted in order to protect settlors' selfish interests in maintaining control over the GML shares.\n\nAmong the \"pointers\" within the \"four corners\" of the trust deeds to which Mr. Mann alludes are the Anti-Bartlett provisions, the Protector's power of veto in relation to certain powers of the Trustees being expressed to be \"absolute and uncontrolled\" and various other elements. These will be discussed in turn below.\n\n508.\n\nNor does Respondent rely solely on Mr. Mann and an interpretation of the trust documents to argue that the \"Russian oligarchs\" maintained *de facto* control over GML and its subsidiaries, including Claimant. For example, Respondent quotes from a report in the Financial Times of an interview with Tim Osborne on 18 June 2004. According to the Financial Times, Tim Osborne \"stressed that he and his fellow directors took their instructions from the trustees of Menatep\u2014proxies for Mr. Khodorkovsky and his partners.\"\n\n509.\n\nIn this jurisdictional phase of the arbitration and with an evidentiary record which is manifestly less than complete, in part because of the Tribunal's decision in its Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3, the Tribunal will not today inquire into whether, as alleged by Respondent,145 Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev or other former shareholders of GML may have retained control over the shares transferred into trust as part of a structure they may have established or used at various points for fraudulent or criminal purposes, including tax evasion and money laundering, *i.e*., as the instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise\" or with \"unclean hands,\" issues which the Tribunal has decided to defer to any merits phase of this arbitration pursuant to its Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3 of 8 September and 31 October 2006, respectively.\n\nRespondent's First Memorial, Factual Appendix, pp. 105-115.\n\n510.\n\nThe Tribunal will however determine certain issues which arise within the more narrow framework adopted by Mr. Green in his presentation of the questions of trust law raised in this case. In his Second Opinion, Mr. Green sets out his view of the appropriate framework as follows:\n\n66. [...]\n\n(1) The Trust deeds are evidently professionally drafted and (as is apparently conceded) routine.\n\n(2) As *ICS v West Bromwich* confirms, whatever the settlors may have subjectively understood the provisions of the Trust deeds to mean is neither here nor there.\n\n(3) It is an objective reading of such deeds which is required - it is to be assumed that the settlors intended them to mean what they say, and their meaning can only be derived from the words used, construing such words with a legally literate eye - the background law of trusts clearly providing admissible context as regards the interpretation of legalistically framed provisions in a professionally drafted document intended to have legal effect.\n\n511.\n\nIt is thus within this framework of the trust documents themselves, interpreted in accordance with the applicable law of trusts, that the Tribunal will address the issues of ownership and control. The Tribunal will first address the validity and effectiveness of the Guernsey Trusts. The Tribunal will then address the four key issues relating to ownership and control of the GML shares that the Parties' experts debated under Guernsey law: (a) whether the Protectors under the Auriga-type Trusts and the Palmus Trust are required to exercise their powers as fiduciaries; (b) whether the Anti-Bartlett provisions in the Guernsey Trusts affect the respective Trustees' powers; (c) whether the Call Options encumbering the GML shares settled into the Auriga-type Trusts and the Southern Cross Trust affect the analysis of ownership or control; and (d) whether the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* affects the Trustees' ownership and control over the GML shares.\n\n***(2) Validity and Effectiveness of the Guernsey Trusts***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nThe first fundamental issue of trust law is whether the Guernsey Trusts are valid and effective, and therefore invest their respective Trustees with ownership of the assets on trust. On this crucial point where, initially, Respondent challenged the validity of the Trusts, it subsequently acknowledged that they were valid and effective under the law governing such trusts. This shift is well illustrated by reference to the two expert opinions of Mr. Mann.\n\n513.\n\nIn his First Opinion, Mr. Mann posits that (a) the trustees of these trusts have no \"control\" over the trusts and have, at most, illusory powers over the GML shares, (b) the trustees did not become beneficial owners of the GML shares, and (c) the trusts in respect of these shares were incompletely constituted and ineffective. In response to Mr. Mann's First Opinion, Mr. Green demonstrates that the Auriga-type Trusts and the Palmus Trust, albeit in the Protector-consent form, were established by reference to standard trust forms,146 including with regard to the Protector and his powers.147 The form of the Southern Cross Trust, which has no office of Protector in its structure, is even less controversial in the opinion of Mr. Green.\n\n*See* Form 50 in Volume 40(3), *Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents* (2006).\n\nMr. Brian Green, QC, *Opinion re Auriga-Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo* *Trust*, 4 May 2007 (hereinafter \"Green, First Opinion), p. 13.\n\n514.\n\nIn his Second Opinion, Mr. Mann appears to retract from his earlier position and stated that it was \"trite and obvious\" that \"the trusts are valid, by reference to the general law and the standard forms and precedents.\"148\n\nMann, Second Opinion, Section D, para. 1.3\n\n515.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Green and accordingly finds that the Auriga-type Trusts, the Palmus Trust and the Southern Cross Trust are standard examples of trusts established in an offshore jurisdiction, Guernsey, and that they are valid and effective under its laws.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with Mr. Green that the Protector's powers as defined in the Auriga-type Trusts and in the Palmus Trust do not create a mechanism which differs in any meaningful way from the typical Protector consent trust under Jersey and Guernsey laws.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Guernsey Trusts are valid and effective, as a matter of Guernsey trust law, and vest ownership and control to the Trustees within the framework of the trust instruments. The Tribunal now proceeds to consider the key issues that Respondent argued affected ownership and control of the GML shares under Guernsey law.\n\n***(3) Is the Protector a Fiduciary?***\n---------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses first the question whether the Protector under the Auriga-type Trusts and the Palmus Trust must act as a fiduciary. In his First Opinion, Mr. Mann points out that the Protector may act as he wishes and that \"there is no rule of law which impresses a protector with fiduciary duties.\"149 Conversely, he opines that the powers of the Trustee to interfere with the wishes of the Settlor, the Protector or the Beneficiaries are illusory as \"the protectors can with impunity veto any important decision made by the trustees, without any fear at all of their conduct being successfully challenged.\"150 In response, Mr. Green opines that a Protector's powers, far from being entirely at his discretion, must be exercised in a fiduciary manner and for the benefit of the Beneficiaries.\n\nMr. Martin Mann, QC, *Opinion re Auriga Type Trusts, the Palmus Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Pavo* *Trust*, 22 January 2007 (hereinafter \"Mann, First Opinion\"), para. 5.2.2.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 5.3.3.\n\n519.\n\nIn his Second Opinion, Mr. Mann agrees that the Protectors \"are fiduciaries as regards their duties to the beneficiaries and can be controlled by the court if they act arbitrarily.\"151 This, however, he adds, does not apply to powers which the Protector can 152 exercise in his own interests. The issue being \"fraught with uncertainty,\"152 Mr. Mann concludes that it must be decided on a case by case basis with reference to the particular terms of the trust instrument. In his view, the Trustee's lack of power to interfere in the management of GML and the Protector's veto powers, as drafted, lead to the conclusion that they were meant to be unfettered, in order to allow the Settlor to retain \"control\" of the GML shares.\n\nMann, Second Opinion, para. 2.1.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 2.4.\n\n520.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Green was cross-examined at length on this issue. With regard to the Protector's powers in the Auriga-type Trusts (and Palmus Trust) to remove the Trustee, Mr. Green categorically stated that the power had to be exercised in a fully fiduciary manner and that it could not be used \"for a self-serving or self-seeking purpose. It can't be sold. It is there for the protection of the Trust, for the interests of the Trust, which means for the interests of the beneficiaries of the Trust.\"153 In other words, in Mr. Green's view, the extended powers given by the trust instruments (except in the case of the Southern Cross Trust), particularly the power of appointment and removal of Beneficiaries \"... need to be exercised single-mindedly in the interests of the beneficiaries.\"154\n\nHearing Transcript, 20 November 2008, p. 217:19-22.\n\nHearing Transcript, 20 November 2008, p. 218:23-25.\n\n521.\n\nHaving reviewed the trust instruments and considered the expert opinions as well as the oral testimony of Mr. Mann and Mr. Green, the Tribunal finds the evidence of Mr. Green more compelling than Mr. Mann's. It is clear that the Protector's powers are not entirely discretionary: they must be exercised in a fiduciary manner and for the benefit of the Beneficiaries.\n\n***(4) The Anti-Bartlett Provisions***\n--------------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nAll of the Guernsey Trusts contain Anti-Bartlett provisions. As explained above, these provisions state that the Trustee is not bound to interfere in the business of any company in which the Trust is interested and the Trustee is not bound to obtain information regarding any such company.\n\n523.\n\nIn his First Opinion, Mr. Mann posits that the Trustee, under the Anti-Bartlett provisions, has no power to appoint, elect or remove the directors of GML. Furthermore, the Trustee being relieved from any duty to exercise any rights and powers which it would normally be expected to exercise in a general meeting, such as appointing directors or, more importantly, declaring the payment of dividends, Mr. Mann concludes that the Beneficiaries could not enforce any such duties against the Trustee, and that, therefore, the power of applying the income of the Trust for the benefit of the Beneficiaries is illusory.\n\n524.\n\nIn response, Mr. Green notes that (a) none of the provisions exclude the exercise by the Trustees of the powers enjoyed by them as shareholders of GML, and (b) they expressly recognize that the Trustees retain voting powers. These provisions conform to the \"usual form\" Anti-Bartlett clauses. Mr. Green observes that these provisions, exempting the Trustee from a *duty* to perform certain actions, must be distinguished from provisions that would take away from the Trustee the *right* to do so. Not imposing a *duty* to act insulates the Trustee from liability but does not mean he has been deprived of the *right* to act.\n\n525.\n\nOn this issue, the Tribunal finds Claimant's expert more convincing than Respondent's. The Anti-Bartlett provisions are primarily meant to exclude liability in the event that the Trustee fails to take certain steps with regard to Trust property. When the Trust owns shares, provisions exempting the Trustee from the duty to interfere with the management or to seek information in respect of the company's affairs do not import that the Trustee loses the right to do so. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Anti-Bartlett provisions in the various trust instruments do not support a finding that the Trustee has relinquished \"ownership\" or \"control\" over Trust property.\n\n***(5) The Call Options***\n--------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Call Options encumbering the GML shares settled into the Auriga-type Trusts and the Southern Cross Trust. As a result of these options, states Mr. Mann, the Trustees of these trusts can only exercise the voting rights attached to the GML shares in accordance with GML's directions. Mr. Mann also asserts that it is probable that a court would hold that a transfer of shares, bereft of all the rights normally attached to them, does not transfer the beneficial interest.\n\n527.\n\nMr. Green disagrees. In his opinion, the Call Option Deeds proceed on the explicit basis that legal and beneficial ownership of the GML shares will remain in the Trustees pending \"Completion.\" The security interest created by the Call Option Deed is at most in the nature of a charge and not a mortgage. A charge does not involve any transfer of property to the security holder, much less does it involve the chargee becoming the legal owner of such shares.\n\n528.\n\nHaving reviewed and analysed the trust instruments and the related Call Option Deeds, the Tribunal finds that the Call Options do not in any way alter the fundamental principle established in the trust instruments that the Trustees of the Trusts are the \"owners\" of the GML shares. No transfer of property will have occurred unless and until the option is exercised, but until it is (and it may never be) all property remains with the grantor of the option. As to the issue of \"control\" over the GML shares, the Tribunal finds that the Call Option Deeds at hand do not justify a conclusion that, for the purposes of Article 17(1) of the ECT, \"control\" of the GML shares would lie with the Settlors of the Auriga-type Trusts or the Southern Cross Trust. Indeed, the Call Option Deeds, as novated, enable the Directors of GML to remove shares from the \"control\" of the various Trusts; if anything, they tend to insulate GML from the Settlors of the relevant Trusts.\n\n529.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Call Options do not affect its determination that, under the trust instruments, the Trustees own and control the GML shares.\n\n***(6) The Rule in*** **Saunders v. Vautier**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nFinally, in his First Opinion, Mr. Mann refers to the so-called rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* in support of the proposition that the trusts can be terminated, even though there exist \"discretionary objects,\" and that this affects the Trustees' ownership and control. Mr. Green disagrees: he asserts that even if the principle were potentially applicable, which Mr. Green contests, due to the fact that the class of Beneficiaries is open, it does not justify the conclusion that the GML shares (or any other trust property) is owned or controlled by anyone other than the respective Trustees unless and until the principle is effectively invoked.\n\n531.\n\nWhen he was cross-examined on this issue, Mr. Green pointed out that in Guernsey, the rule in *Saunders v*. *Vautier* was legislated in Article 48(3) of the 1989 Guernsey Trust Law.155 This provision of Guernsey law makes it possible for all the beneficiaries of a Guernsey trust to come together, terminate the trust and distribute the trust property. Whilst pointing out that if asked to do so, the Trustee could refuse, and that he would need, strictly speaking, the consent of the Red Cross, Mr. Green opined that the possibility for the Settlors and their families (if they constitute *all* the Beneficiaries) to terminate the Trust \"doesn't in any way entrench on the proposition that you have a valid and completely constituted trust under which the trustees are the owners of the property and have all the rights of control which come from their ownership.\"156\n\nExhibit R-542.\n\nHearing Transcript, 20 November 2008, p. 125:11-14.\n\n532.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the determining factor is that the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier* was *not* exercised. Its mere existence does not lead to the conclusion that because Article 48(3) of the 1989 Guernsey Trust Law *may* be invoked at some later point in time, the Trustee is not the \"owner\" or in \"control\" of the assets settled into the Trust under Guernsey law.\n\n533.\n\nOn a related point, the existence of letters of wishes, if any, or the expression of desires by the Settlor, may indeed result in the Trustee doing what he is advised the Settlor would wish him to do. But both legal experts agree that such letters of wishes or expressions of desires by the Settlor are precatory in nature and do not bind the Trustee in any way.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the rule in *Saunders v. Vautier*, in the circumstances of this case, does not affect its determination that the Trustees own and control the GML shares.\n\n***(7) Conclusion***\n--------------------\n\n535.\n\nFinally and before summarizing its conclusion in respect of the trust issues in the instant case, the Tribunal notes that transferring ownership of assets to a trustee pursuant to a trust instrument is a centuries-old institution of the English common law. Settling certain properties into a trust, thus transferring legal ownership to the trustee and adopting provisions with regard to the beneficiaries\u2014including leaving their establishment at the trustee's discretion, subject to the powers of a protector as the case may be\u2014is a well-established legal institution at common law, which is recognized internationally today pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and their Recognition of 1 July 1985. The Tribunal sees no reason to unsettle a centuries-old legal institution when the trust instruments at hand do not depart from standard forms used in countless other similar settlements. To do so would put into question the validity of the very concept of trusts at a time when their recognition goes well beyond the common-law countries. Indeed, in recent years, trusts have found a significant measure of acceptance in some civil law jurisdictions, although there is no evidence before the Tribunal that they are accepted instruments in Russian law. This is a question which will remain open for argument in any merits phase of this case in connection with Respondent's contentions about Claimant's \"unclean hands\" and about Claimant being the instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise.\"\n\n536.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds as follows in relation to Claimant:\n\n\u2022 Claimant is wholly-owned by GML (Gibraltar), which in turn is owned by the seven Guernsey Trusts (*i.e.*, by the respective Trustees of the Guernsey Trusts).\n\n\u2022 Each of Southern Cross Trust, Auriga Trust, Draco Trust, Mensa Trust, Pictor Trust, and Tucana Trust (in each case, through its Trustee, Rysaffe) controls a minority stake in GML; as such, none of these Trusts can be said to control GML.\n\n\u2022 The Palmus Trust (*i.e.*, the Palmus Trust Company Limited (Guernsey) as Trustee of the Palmus Trust) controls a majority stake of 52.3 percent in GML, and therefore could be said to control GML, as the trust property, in accordance with the terms of the Palmus Settlement and applicable Guernsey law.\n\n537.\n\nAs a result of these findings, the Tribunal concludes that GML (of Gibraltar) and/or the Palmus Trust Company Limited (of Guernsey) own and control Claimant. Both GML and Palmus Trust Company are UK nationals, since both Gibraltar and Guernsey are covered territories by virtue of the UK's declarations under the ECT. Accordingly, they are not \"nationals of a third state.\" Therefore, Article 17(1) does not apply to Claimant.\n\n**b) Is the Russian Federation a Third State?**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nIn the previous section, the Tribunal found that, for purposes of Article 17 of the ECT, Claimant was owned and controlled by entities that are not nationals or citizens of third States. That could be the end of the Tribunal's analysis of different issues which arise from the wording of Article 17. However, as the Tribunal noted at the outset of the last section of the present Interim Award, Respondent argued that control of Claimant resided with individuals of Russian nationality. On this basis, in order to benefit from Article 17, Respondent argues that the Russian Federation is a \"third state\" for purposes of Article 17. Although the Tribunal's conclusions in the previous section render this issue moot, the Tribunal nevertheless considers that, in the context of all issues which have arisen and which may arise later, it should proceed with a review of the Parties' submissions on this point and thus present its analysis and conclusions.\n\n**(i) Parties' Submissions**\n----------------------------\n\n539.\n\nThe Parties differ over whether, under Article 17(1), the Russian Federation is or can be treated as a \"third state.\"\n\n540.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant is an entity owned or controlled by citizens or nationals of a \"third state\" and has no substantial business in the Contracting Party in which it is organized. What is the \"third state\"?\n\n541.\n\nRespondent initially argued that it is the Russian Federation. The term, \"third state,\" is not defined in the Treaty. However, Article I of the ECT, \"Definitions,\" provides, in (7):\n\n\"Investor\" means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state,\" a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party.\n\n542.\n\nRespondent argues that the term, \"third state,\" while not defined in the Treaty, is used in a manner that does not exclude the possibility that a third State may be a Contracting Party or signatory (Respondent being the latter), and cites in support of this conclusion the terms of ECT Article 7(10)(a)(i), which, in defining \"transit,\" specify \"so long as either the other state or the third state is a Contracting Party.\" Respondent also argues that the reference to a third State in Article 17(1) \"applies *a fortiori* to nationals of the host State.\" It observes that the usage of the ECT does not show that the term \"third state\" precludes reference to the host State. If it is accepted that a Contracting Party may be equated with a third State, then, in pursuance of Article 17(1), Respondent may deny the advantages of Part III to Claimant, since in point of fact\u2014Respondent maintains\u2014 Russian nationals control Claimant, which has no substantial business activities in the State of its incorporation.\n\n543.\n\nClaimant challenges this reasoning. It argues that it is plain on its face that Article 17(1) distinguishes between a Contracting Party and a third State, as do other provisions of the Treaty; there is no equation. The singular transit provision of Article 7(10)(a)(i) is distinguishable. Article 2(1)(h) of the VCLT defines a third State as \"a State not a party to the treaty.\" The Russian Federation, while not a Contracting Party, is a signatory of the ECT, and applied the Treaty provisionally in accordance with Article 45; it had not terminated provisional application pursuant to Article 45(3) by the time of the filing of the Notice of Arbitration in these proceedings. The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT demonstrate that the term \"third state\" was substituted for the term \"non-Contracting Party\" not to change the substance, nor to vary the meaning, but to render it in more appropriate style. In its Rejoinder, Claimant contends, among other arguments, that, if the drafters of the ECT intended to apply the optional exclusion of Article 17 to nationals of the host State and not limit it to nationals of third States, they would have so provided, but did not. The ECT's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* show that the term \"third state\" cannot be equated with the host State. Respondent itself has recognized that nationals of the host State are not nationals of a third State by contending that: \"If Treaty benefits may be denied to third State nationals, *a fortiori* they may be denied to host State nationals.\"\n\n**(ii) Tribunal's Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n544.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Respondent's contentions on this count are unconvincing. The Treaty clearly distinguishes between a Contracting Party (and a signatory), on the one hand, and a third State, which is a non-Contracting Party, on the other. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that, on their face, several provisions distinguish between a Contracting Party and third State (for example, Articles (1)(7), 10(3) and 10(7), and 17) and that there is no equation in the ECT between a Contracting Party and a third State. This conclusion is further supported by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, which demonstrate that the term \"third state\" was substituted for the term \"non-Contracting Party.\"\n\n545.\n\nThe transit provision of Article 7(10)(a)(i) is clearly distinguishable. That provision defines \"transit\" as\n\n(i) the carriage through the Area of a Contracting Party, or to or from port facilities in its Area for loading or unloading, of Energy Materials and Products originating in the Area of another state and destined for the Area of a third state, so long as either the other state or the third state is a Contracting Party;\n\nIn this particular context, the term \"third state\" is used simply to designate the third of the three States necessarily involved in the transit relationship, and not a category of States distinct from Contracting Parties. The French version of the Treaty uses the term \"troisi\u00e8me Etat\" in Article 7(10)(a)(i), but \"Etat tiers\" elsewhere in the Treaty, clearly supporting the distinct meaning of the term in the different contexts.\n\n546.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concludes that the Russian Federation, for purposes of Article 17 of the ECT, is not a third State.\n\n**c) Can the Russian Federation Invoke Ownership or Control of Claimant by Israeli Nationals in Order to Take Advantage of Article 17(1)?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Parties' Submissions**\n----------------------------\n\n547.\n\nApparently without relinquishing the foregoing line of argument concerning Russia as a third State, at the oral hearings, Respondent advanced the further argument that it is entitled to deny the advantages of Part III of the Treaty to Claimant because it is now controlled by nationals of a third State, Israel (where certain of the former \"Russian oligarchs\" now reside) and has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized. Counsel of the Russian Federation observed that leading \"oligarchs\" reside in Israel, have done so for some five years, and apparently have adopted Israeli citizenship as under Israeli law they could easily do. They thus imputed that the claims of Claimant could be denied pursuant to Article 17(1).\n\n548.\n\nClaimant's counsel strenuously resisted any such imputation.\n\n549.\n\nThey recalled that Respondent's pleadings from the outset up to the oral hearings have repeatedly described Claimant as in reality being owned or controlled by Russian nationals. They questioned whether Russia's counsel was authorized to raise this \"moving target\" but, if they were, Claimant maintained that Respondent was \"stuck\" with its characterization in its written pleadings of Claimant being owned or controlled by Russian nationals.\n\n550.\n\nClaimant further argued that Respondent is estopped from characterizing the \"oligarchs\" as Israeli. Claimant points out that the Russian Federation has issued international arrest warrants for the \"oligarchs\" that describe them as nationals of the Russian Federation and has repeatedly described them as Russian nationals in its pleadings *.* It cannot now be heard to denominate the \"oligarchs\" as Israeli nationals in derogation of those descriptions. Moreover, according to Claimant, if the \"oligarchs\" have taken refuge in Israel and assumed Israeli nationality, not only does that not deprive them of Russian nationality but they have done so only because of the wrongs that they have suffered at the hands of the Russian Federation. Respondent is not entitled to assert rights springing from those wrongs.\n\n**(ii) Tribunal's Decision**\n----------------------------\n\n551.\n\nBecause the dates on which some of the \"oligarchs\" moved to Israel were not clearly established,157 this confrontation raises the question of whether the rule of nationality of claims in international law means that nationality is adjudged as of the date of the filing of the claim, or as of a later date, such as that of the judgment. The Award in the NAFTA case of *Loewen v. United States of America* accepted the judgment day standard.158 That holding has been the subject of criticism.159 It is not generally sustained by the study of diplomatic espousal undertaken in recent years by the International Law Commission of the United Nations, whose Special Rapporteur, Professor John Dugard, has concluded that the date of the filing of the claim should govern rather than the judgment day.160 This Tribunal is not disposed to apply the judgment day standard in the light of the authorities and considerations assembled by Dugard, and in view of the fact that this proceeding in any event is not an exercise in the diplomatic espousal by a State of the claims of its national but a Treaty-authorized proceeding brought directly against a State by an entity which qualifies as an Investor of another Contracting Party. Thus the pertinence of rules of diplomatic protection to these proceedings is not to be assumed.\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 27 November 2008, pp. 117-129; nor was it agreed which Party would have the burden of proof on this issue (*see* Hearing Transcript, 1 December 2008, pp. 114-116).\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

It simply asserts, without any examination whatsoever of authority (despite the fact that counsel referred the tribunal to the relevant authorities), that under customary international law \"there must be continuous national identity from the date of the events giving rise to the claim... through to the date of the resolution of the claim.\").\n\n*See, e.g.,* ILC, Fifty-fifth session, *Fourth report on diplomatic protection by John Dugard, Special Rapporteur,* UN Doc.

The authorities are inconclusive and the response of States, while small, favours the date of the presentation of the claim. In these circumstances the Commission must be guided by principle and policy in the exercise of its choice. Principle supports the date of the presentation of the claims as this most favours the interests of the individual. So too does policy, if we equate policy with fairness. Many years may pass between the presentation of a claim and its final resolution and it is unfair to deny the individual the right to change nationality, through marriage or naturalization, during this period. Moreover, the date of presentation is significant as it is the date on which the State of nationality shows its clear intention to exercise diplomatic protection. \"Different policy considerations apply where the national on whose behalf the claim is brought acquires the nationality of the respondent State after the presentation of the claim as occurred in *Loewen*... In such circumstances fairness dictates that the date of the award be selected as *dies ad quem*, as the contrary position would, in the words of *Loewen,* \u2018produce a result so unjust that it could be sustained only be irrefutable logic or compelling precedent, and neither exists.' It is therefore proposed that the Commission retain the official date of presentation of the claim as the *dies ad quem* for the continuous nationality rule but that an exception be made for the case in which the national on whose behalf the claim is brought acquires the nationality of the respondent State after the presentation of the claim. Here the date of the resolution of the claim is the *dies ad quem.* \") (*See also* para. 56, with respect to claims on behalf of corporations). *See also* *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v.

At the hearing, Respondent referred to various newspaper clippings which predate February 2005 and which, according to Respondent, establish that the \"oligarchs\" who, it alleges, controlled Claimant (notably Messrs. Nevzlin, Brudno and Dubov) were already citizens of Israel at that time.161\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 27 November 2008, pp. 118-126.\n\n553.\n\nIn response, Claimant argues that Respondent is estopped from arguing that the \"oligarchs\" are Israeli because, if they are, their so being results from the wrongs of Respondent.162\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 1 December 2008, pp. 234-236.\n\n554.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot, in the present phase of this proceeding, address Claimant's estoppel argument, which, as Claimant itself put it, relies on \"wrongdoings of Russia which are at the heart of this arbitration.\"163\n\n*Ibid.* at p. 236:8-10.\n\n555.\n\nIf this issue were not moot (as it is, given the Tribunal's earlier rulings on notice and ownership/control), the Tribunal would defer its further consideration to the merits phase.

ARE ALL OR SOME OF THE CLAIMS BARRED BY THE \"TAXATION MEASURES\"CARVE-OUT (ARTICLE 21) OF THE ECT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n556.\n\nArticle 21 of the ECT provides as follows:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n(2) Article 7(3) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income or on capital, except that such provision shall not apply to:\n\n(a) an advantage accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii); or\n\n(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes, except where the measure of a Contracting Party arbitrarily discriminates against Energy Materials and Products originating in, or destined for the Area of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under Article 7(3).\n\n(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that such provisions shall not apply to:\n\n(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic Integration Organization; or\n\n(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes, except where the measure arbitrarily discriminates against an Investor of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under the Investment provisions of this Treaty.\n\n(4) Article 29(2) to (6) shall apply to Taxation Measures other than those on income or on capital.\n\n(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where non-discrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the nondiscrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the expiry of the six-month period;\n\n(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.\n\n(6) For the avoidance of doubt, Article 14 shall not limit the right of a Contracting Party to impose or collect a tax by withholding or other means.\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Article:\n\n(a) The term \"Taxation Measure\" includes:\n\n(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and\n\n(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\n\n(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.\n\n(c) A \"Competent Tax Authority\" means the competent authority pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorized representatives.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"tax provisions\" and \"taxes\" do not include customs duties.\n\n557.\n\nAs set out earlier in this Interim Award, the Parties' arguments in respect of this provision raise the following issues:\n\n(a) What is the scope of the carve-out for \"Taxation Measures\"?\n\n(1) What is the meaning of \"Taxation Measures\" as set out in Article 21(7)?\n\n(2) Does the carve-out operate to deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction over the covered matters, or does it merely modulate the obligations that can be enforced in an arbitration, thus going to admissibility/merits?\n\n(3) *If* the carve-out goes to jurisdiction, did Respondent timely raise the issue?\n\n(b) What is the scope of the claw-back for Article 13 (Expropriation)?\n\n(c) How should Claimant's claims be characterized for purposes of Article 21?\n\n558.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review the Parties' submissions on each one of these issues, before reaching its decision.\n\n**2. Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n**a) What is the Scope of the Carve-out for \"Taxation Measures\"?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) What is the Meaning of \"Taxation Measures\" as Set Out in Article 21(7)?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"Taxation Measures\" is not limited to specific provisions of legislation or tax treaties, but extends also to enforcement and collection measures, for example. In sum, Respondent submits that the carve-out in Article 21 extends broadly to all measures relating to taxation.\n\n560.\n\nRespondent submits that its interpretation of \"Taxation Measures\" is supported by the plain and ordinary meaning of Article 21(7), where the definition of \"Taxation Measures,\" Respondent notes, uses expansive terms such as \"includes,\" \"any\" and \"relating to.\" Respondent contends that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* demonstrate that \"includes,\" as used in Article 21(7), was meant to introduce an illustrative list not a closed definition. In support, Respondent invokes the position of France, for example, in the negotiations of the Treaty.\n\n561.\n\nRespondent also submits that Article 21(7) must be read together with other paragraphs of the same Article. In particular, Article 21(3) gives preferential treatment to \"any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes.\" The \"collection of taxes,\" submits Respondent, must therefore be a subset of the broader class of Taxation Measures. Further, Article 21(6) confirms, according to Respondent, that Taxation Measures include not only the collection of taxes, but also their imposition. This Article provides, \"For the avoidance of doubt, Article 14 [dealing with an Investor's right to transfer capital, returns and other payments] shall not limit the right of a Contracting Party to impose or collect a tax by withholding or other means.\"\n\n562.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that a broad carve-out in Article 21, for the full protection of the sovereign prerogative over taxes, tax collection and tax enforcement, accords with the object and purpose of the Treaty. It is also supported, notes Respondent, by the testimony of its witnesses, Messrs. Berman and Knipler.\n\n563.\n\nClaimant holds a different view. According to Claimant, \"Taxation Measures\" in Article 21 means the specific provisions in a country's tax legislation or in its tax treaties. Invoking, like Respondent, the plain and ordinary meaning of Article 21(7), Claimant focuses on the use of the words \"provision... of domestic law\" or \"convention... or... any other international agreement\" in the definition.\n\n564.\n\nFor Claimant, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* demonstrate that \"includes\" was meant to be inclusive, and interchangeable with \"means.\" Claimant relies on the position of Norway, which introduced the language during the negotiation of Article 21, as well as the position of Canada and France.\n\n565.\n\nAs for the evidence of Messrs. Berman and Knipler, Claimant submits that their respective testimony is irrelevant and unreliable.\n\n566.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should resolve any remaining ambiguity according to the principle that an exception in a treaty, such as the carve-out in Article 21(1), must be interpreted restrictively.\n\n**(ii) Does the Carve-out Operate to Deprive a Tribunal of Jurisdiction over the Covered Matters, or Does it Merely Modulate the Obligations that Can Be Enforced in an Arbitration, thus Going to Admissibility/Merits?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the carve-out in Article 21(1) deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction. Article 21(1) states: \" nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties\"; and \"In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency\" [emphasis added]. According to Respondent, the phrase \"nothing in this Treaty\" means, *inter alia*, that Article 26 jurisdiction is not applicable to an arbitration which is grounded in a taxation measure of the Russian Federation. Article 21 states clearly that it \"prevails\" over \"any other provision,\" which must mean, avers Respondent, that its carve-out in relation to Taxation Measures must defeat jurisdiction under Article 26 for any claims related to such Taxation Measures.\n\n568.\n\nClaimant responds that the carve-out goes to admissibility/merits. Claimant notes that disputes over the effect of Article 21(1) relate to the existence of rights and obligations (including under Part III of the Treaty) with respect to alleged Taxation Measures, and thus must fall within Article 26 of the Treaty (Dispute Settlement), because Article 26 defines arbitral jurisdiction by reference to \"an alleged breach of an obligation... under Part III\" [emphasis added].\n\n**(iii)If the Carve-out Goes to Jurisdiction, Did Respondent Timely Raise the Issue?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nRespondent argues that it satisfied the basic requirement under the UNCITRAL Rules, namely to state a clear objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as a general matter. Respondent contends that it put Claimant on notice that Article 21 was one of its preliminary concerns, even if initially stated as an admissibility objection.\n\n570.\n\nTo the extent the carve-out in Article 21 goes to jurisdiction, Claimant takes the position that Respondent failed to raise its objection as one pertaining to jurisdiction. As Respondent has conceded, and as is clear from the record, submits Claimant, Respondent initially raised Article 21 as an objection to admissibility.\n\n**b) What is the Scope of the Claw-back for Article 13 (Expropriation)?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nWhile Article 21(1) creates a carve-out from the protections of the Treaty \"with respect to Taxation Measures,\" Article 21(5), on the other hand, reinstates the protection against alleged expropriation by providing that \"Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\" What is the scope of this claw-back in case of an expropriation?\n\n572.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the scope of the \"claw-back\" in Article 21(5)\u2014which is defined by reference to \"taxes\"\u2014is not co-extensive with the carve-out of Article 21(1), which is defined by reference to \"Taxation Measures.\" Respondent submits that the claw-back extends only to \"taxes,\" which is a concept that is *narrower* than \"Taxation Measures,\" leaving Claimant unprotected for allegations of expropriation in relation to a category of measures that can be defined as \"Taxation Measures other than taxes.\" For Respondent, this category includes tax collection and enforcement measures, since these are Taxation Measures, but not taxes *per se*.\n\n573.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that, in any event, any claim that falls within the claw-back for allegedly expropriatory taxes must be submitted to the \"Competent Tax Authorities\" in the Russian Federation, pursuant to Article 21(5)(b).\n\n574.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the distinction drawn by Respondent between \"Taxation Measures\" and \"taxes\" is unavailing. Claimant submits that the claw-back for expropriation in Article 21(5) extends to any expropriation in relation to \"Taxation Measures,\" thus giving back to an Investor, in relation to expropriation, whatever protection may have been taken away by Article 21(1)\u2014including jurisdiction, if the carve-out is found by the Tribunal to have been formulated as a jurisdictional objection.\n\n575.\n\nIn support of its position, Claimant contends that while different words (\"tax\" and \"Taxation Measures\") are used in the English version of Article 21 of the ECT, the fact that they refer to the same concept is demonstrated by the French, German and Italian versions of Article 21. In those versions, all equally authentic, the words \"tax\" and \"Taxation Measure\" are used interchangeably. The interpretation of Article 21, avers Claimant, should thus be reconciled with the non-English versions.\n\n576.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant submits, Respondent's interpretation of Article 21(5) would result in a huge loophole for States wishing to expropriate assets of investors \"under the guise\" of Taxation Measures. Claimant asserts that such an interpretation would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, as it would destabilize the investment climate in host States.\n\n577.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that it cannot be required to submit its claims to the local Russian authorities before proceeding to international arbitration, since such a recourse would be entirely futile.\n\n578.\n\nIn respect of the different language versions of the Treaty, Respondent answers that the non-English versions of Article 21 should not be given much weight, because Article 21 was negotiated in English. Citing several authorities, Respondent submits that where multiple language versions of a treaty are being compared for the interpretation of a particular provision, the version in which the provision was negotiated should be given primacy.\n\n**c) How should the Claims be Characterized for Purposes of Article 21?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nRespondent submits that all of the claims in these proceedings relate to \"Taxation Measures\" other than \"taxes,\" and that therefore none of the exceptions enumerated in Article 21 is applicable to the claims asserted by Claimant.\n\n580.\n\nRespondent observes that according to Claimant's own factual matrix underpinning its allegations against the Russian Federation, the alleged breach of the ECT by Respondent started with \"tax audits\" and all of the claims asserted by Claimant are based, initially, on \"massive tax liabilities.\"164\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, 1 December 2008, pp. 59:18 to 61:25.\n\n581.\n\nIn response, Claimant's primary position is that since the claw-back of Article 21(5) for expropriation claims is co-extensive with the carve-out under Article 21(1), it does not matter how its claims are characterized. In the words of Claimant: \"no matter what the scope of the so-called exclusion in Article 21(1), it does not exclude any expropriation claims that are not reincorporated by Article 21(5).\"165\n\nRejoinder, para. 410.\n\n582.\n\nAlternatively, Claimant submits that the claims are not captured by the exclusion in Article 21(1) because they do not relate to *bona fide* \"Taxation Measures\" and/or they extend to matters beyond \"Taxation Measures\" such as expropriation through gross under-valuation, \"phoney bankruptcy\" and intimidation of management.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n583.\n\nAs the Tribunal has just noted, Claimant argues, *inter alia*, that its claims do not relate to *bona fide* \"Taxation Measures\" and also that its claims extend to matters beyond \"Taxation Measures\" and are thus not captured by Article 21, whatever its interpretation.\n\n584.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the background to, and motivation behind, the Russian Federation's measures that gave rise to the present arbitration, be they \"Taxation Measures\" or not, go to the heart of the present dispute.\n\n585.\n\nThe Tribunal will not rule on this crucial issue in a vacuum. Therefore, the Tribunal has decided to defer its definitive interpretation of Article 21, and its characterization of Claimant's claims for purposes of Article 21, to the next phase of the arbitration, when it will have a complete record on the nature of the claims themselves and a fuller understanding of the facts.\n\n586.\n\nFor greater certainty, the Tribunal notes that it is deferring as well the issue of whether Respondent's objection based on Article 21 goes to jurisdiction or admissibility and, if it goes to jurisdiction, whether it was made in a timely manner by Respondent.\n\n**E. ARE ALL OR SOME OF THE CLAIMS BARRED BY THE \"FORK-IN-THE-ROAD\"PROVISION (ARTICLE 26(3)(B)(I)) OF THE ECT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------\n\n587.\n\nArticle 26(3)(b)(i) contains the ECT's \"fork-in-the-road\" provision. It must be read together with the preceding paragraphs of Article 26:\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n588.\n\nIn accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(i), Annex ID lists the Contracting Parties that have conditioned their consent to the submission of a dispute under the Treaty to international arbitration on the condition that the Investor has not previously submitted the dispute to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute.\n\n589.\n\nThe Russian Federation, which appears on the list at Annex ID, argues that \"Claimant or persons who control Claimant or who are under common control with Claimant have previously submitted the matters complained of in the Statement of Claim to the Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights.\"166\n\nFirst Memorial, para. 88.\n\n590.\n\nRespondent submits that the term \"dispute,\" which is not a defined term under the Treaty, \"should be interpreted as a dispute between essentially the same parties relating to the same material facts or injuries that constitute the basis of the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal.\"167 Respondent submits that a more restrictive interpretation of \"dispute\" would defeat the object and purpose of this \"fork-in-the-road\" clause.\n\nFirst Memorial, para. 90.\n\n591.\n\nThe specific proceedings to which Respondent refers are, first, various proceedings commenced by Yukos in the Russian courts (including the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow region and the Constitutional Court) and, second, applications submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by Mr. Lebedev, Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos, respectively, in 2004. Respondent submits that the matters considered in these *fora* include some of the principal allegations made in the Statement of Claim in this arbitration.\n\n592.\n\nIn response, Claimant asserts that Respondent's position ignores the clear language of the ECT. Specifically, Claimant submits that Respondent is \"openly attempting to expand the scope of the exception found in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT,\" as follows **:**\n\n- *ratione personae,* to persons or entities not mentioned by the Treaty;\n\n- *ratione materiae,* to disputes other than disputes concerning an alleged violation of Part III of the Treaty;\n\n- *ratione temporis*, to disputes that would arise after the commencement of the arbitration.168\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 314.\n\n593.\n\nClaimant argues that, consistent with the guidance of arbitral tribunals in respect of fork-in-the-road provisions generally, an objection based on Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT must be based on a prior proceeding that satisfies the so-called \"triple identity\" test: identity of parties, cause of action and object of the dispute.169\n\nClaimant relies on the decisions in the following cases: *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004, Annex C-247 (available on http://ital.law.uvic.ca); *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/08, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, 42 ILM 788 (2003), para. 80, Annex C-242; *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, 43 ILM 262 (2004), para. 89, Annex C-243; *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, LP v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004, para. 98, Annex C-244.\n\n594.\n\nAddressing the specific legal proceedings invoked by Respondent in order to rely on the \"fork-in-the-road provision,\" Claimant asserts that it is not a party in any of the Russian Court proceedings cited by Respondent, nor in any of the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights, and that, in any event, none of them concerns an alleged breach of Part III of the ECT.\n\n595.\n\nClaimant therefore concludes that Respondent has failed to satisfy the triple identity test, and that its objection based on Article 26(3)(b)(i) must fail.\n\n596.\n\nRespondent counters that, while substantial authority does exist for the triple identity test, the \"fork-in-the-road\" objection should nevertheless be sustained in the context of this particular dispute, because \"Claimant is in effect requesting that this Tribunal sit above the Russian Supreme Court, the Russian Constitutional Court, and the various Russian courts of appeal that have heard and decided claims based on each of the allegations in the Statement of Claim.\"170\n\nSecond Memorial, para. 333.\n\n597.\n\nIn its final submission, Claimant submits that Respondent's response amounts to \"a total capitulation\" on this issue. Moreover, Claimant takes issue with its characterization of this Tribunal's mission, asserting that:\n\nThe Claimant is not seeking to appeal any decision of the Russian courts, or asking the Tribunal to determine whether those cases were rightly or wrongly decided as a matter of Russian law. Rather, the Claimant seeks compensation with respect to certain actions taken by the Russian State that violated the Claimant's rights under the Energy Charter Treaty.171\n\nRejoinder, para. 301.\n\n**2. Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n598.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent's arguments are unconvincing. Indeed, in its written submissions, Respondent did appear to concede that, as a general matter, there is ample authority for the application of a \"triple identity\" test in the context of a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision. To that extent, there is no question that the various Russian court proceedings and applications to the European Court of Human Rights cited by Respondent fail to trigger the \"fork-in-the-road provision\" of the ECT.\n\n599.\n\nThere remains Respondent's argument that the Tribunal should look beyond the triple identity test in this particular case, because the effect of the Tribunal accepting jurisdiction will be to create, in effect, a Tribunal that sits in judgment over the various Russian courts seized of the proceedings referred to by Respondent.\n\n600.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept this argument. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that by virtue of its claim under the ECT it does not appeal from any decision of the Russian courts or seek to have determined by the present Tribunal whether any of those cases was rightly or wrongly decided as a matter of Russian law. The purpose of the present claim, in contradistinction to any of the other proceedings referred to by Respondent, is to determine whether Respondent breached Claimant's rights under the ECT, an international treaty which it applied provisionally and pursuant to which, this Tribunal has found, Respondent has binding obligations by virtue of the application of Article 45.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n601.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISSES the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on Article 1(6) and 1(7), Article 17, Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Article 45 of the ECT;\n\n(b) DEFERS its decision on the objection to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on Article 21 of the ECT to the merits phase of the arbitration, consistent with paragraphs 583 to 586, above;\n\n(c) CONFIRMS that its decision on the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility involving the Parties' contentions concerning \"unclean hands\" and Respondent's contention that \"Claimant's personality must be disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a criminal enterprise\" is deferred to the merits phase of the arbitration, consistent with Procedural Order No. 3;\n\n(d) HOLDS that, subject to the preceding two sub-paragraphs, the present dispute is admissible and within its jurisdiction, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Russian Federation in connection with the merits of the present dispute;\n\n(e) RESERVES all questions concerning costs, fees and expenses, including the Parties' costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination; and\n\n(f) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within 60 days of receipt of this Interim Award."}, {"Title": "Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2012-01-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**In the case of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n--------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe applicant, OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS, was a publicly-traded private open joint-stock company incorporated under the laws of Russia. It was registered in Nefteyugansk, the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region, and at the relevant time was managed by its subsidiary, OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, registered in Moscow.\n\n7.\n\nThe applicant was a holding company established by the Russian Government in 1993 to own and control a number of stand-alone entities specialised in oil production. The company remained fully State-owned until 1995-1996 when, through a series of tenders and auctions, it was privatised.\n\n**A. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2000**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Tax assessment 2000*\n------------------------\n\n**(a) Original tax inspection**\n-------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nBetween 13 November 2002 and 4 March 2003 the Tax Inspectorate of the town of Nefteyugansk (\"the Tax Office\") conducted a tax inspection of the applicant company.\n\n9.\n\nAs a result of the inspection, on 28 April 2003 the Tax Office drew up a report indicating a number of relatively minor errors in the company's tax returns and served it on the company.\n\n10.\n\nFollowing the company's objections, on 9 June 2003 the Tax Office adopted a decision in which it found the company liable for having filed incomplete returns in respect of certain taxes.\n\n11.\n\nThe decision of the Tax Office was accepted and complied with by the company on 7 July 2003.\n\n**(b) Additional tax inspection**\n---------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 December 2003 the Tax Ministry (\"the Ministry\"), acting as a reviewing body within the meaning of section 87 (3) of the Tax Code, carried out an additional tax inspection of the applicant company.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 December 2003 the Ministry issued a report indicating that the applicant company had a large tax liability for the year 2000. The detailed report came to over 70 pages and had 284 supporting documents in annex. The report was served on the applicant company on the same date.\n\n14.\n\nThe Ministry established that in 2000 the applicant company had carried out its activities through a network of 22 trading companies registered in low-tax areas of Russia (\"the Republic of Mordoviya, the town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the Republic of Kalmykiya, the town of Trekhgornyy in the Chelyabinsk Region, the town of Lesnoy in the Sverdlovsk Region and the Evenk Autonomous District\"). For all legal purposes, most of these entities were set up as entirely independent from the applicant, i.e. as belonging and being controlled by third persons, although their sole activity consisted of commissioning the applicant company to buy crude oil on their behalf from the company's own oil-producing subsidiaries and either putting it up for sale on the domestic market or abroad, or first handing it over to the company's own oil-processing plants and then selling it. There were no real cash transactions between the applicant company, its oil-processing and oil-producing subsidiaries and the trading entities, and the company's own promissory notes and mutual offsetting were used instead. All the money thus accumulated from sales was then transferred unilaterally to the \"Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS\", a commercial entity founded, owned and run by the applicant company. Since at all relevant times the applicant company took part in all of the transactions of the trading companies, but acted as the companies' agent and never as an owner of the goods produced and processed by its own subsidiaries and since the compensation paid by the trading entities for its services was negligible, the applicant company's real turnover was never reflected in any tax documents and, consequently, in its tax returns. In addition, most of the trading companies were in fact sham entities, as they were neither present nor operated in the place of their registration. In addition, they had no assets and no employees of their own.\n\n15.\n\nThe Ministry found it established, among other things, that:\n\n(a) the actual movement of the traded oil was from the applicant company's production sites to its own processing or storage facilities;\n\n(b) the applicant company acted as an exporter of goods for the purpose of customs clearance, even though the goods had formally been owned and sold by sham companies;\n\n(c) through the use of various techniques, the applicant company indirectly established and, at all relevant times *de facto,* controlled and owned the sham entities;\n\n(d) all accounting operations of the companies were carried out by the same two entities, OOO \"YUKOS\" FBC and OOO \"YUKOS\" Invest, both dependant on or belonging to the applicant company;\n\n(e) the network of sham companies was officially managed by OOO \"YUKOS\" RM, all official correspondence, including tax documents, being sent from the postal address of OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, the applicant company's managing subsidiary;\n\n(f) the sham companies and the applicant company's subsidiaries entered into transactions with lowered prices for the purpose of reducing the taxable base of their operations;\n\n(g) all revenues perceived by the sham companies were thereafter unilaterally transferred to the applicant company;\n\n(h) statements by the owners and directors of the trading entities, who confessed that they had signed documents that they had been required to sign by the officials of the applicant company, and had never conducted any independent activity on behalf of their companies, were true;\n\n(i) and, lastly, that the sham companies received tax benefits unlawfully.\n\n16.\n\nHaving regard to all this, the Ministry decided that the activities of the sham companies served the purpose of screening the real business activity of the applicant company, that the transactions of these companies were sham and that it had been the applicant company, and not the sham entities, which conducted the transactions and became the owner of the traded goods. In view of the above, and also since neither the sham entities nor the applicant company qualified for the tax exemptions in question, the report concluded that the company, having acted in bad faith, had failed properly to reflect these transactions in its tax declarations, thus avoiding the payment of VAT, motorway tax, corporate property tax, tax for improvement of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities, tax in respect of sales of fuels and lubricants and profit tax.\n\n17.\n\nThe report also noted specifically that the tax authorities had requested the applicant company to facilitate reciprocal tax inspections of several of its important subsidiaries. Five of the eleven subsidiary companies refused to comply, four failed to answer, whilst two entities filed incomplete documents. It also specified that during the on-site inspection the applicant company failed to provide the documents requested by the Ministry concerning the transportation of oil.\n\n18.\n\nThe report referred, *inter alia*, to Articles 7 (3), 38, 39 (1) and 41 of the Tax Code, section 3 of Law no. 1992-1 of the Russian Federation (RF) of 6 December 1991 \"On Value-Added Tax\", sections 4 and 5 (2) of RF Law no. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 \"On motorway funds in the Russian Federation\", section 21 (\"Ch\") of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the basics of the tax system\", Article 209 (1-2) of the Civil Code, section 2 of RF Law no. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 \"On corporate property tax\", section 2 (1-2) of RF Law no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On corporate profit tax\", Decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of Russia of 25 July 2001 and Article 56 of the Tax Code.\n\n19.\n\nOn 12 January 2004 the applicant company filed its detailed thirty-page objections to the report. The company admitted that for a very short period of time it had partly owned three out of the twenty-two organisations mentioned in the report, but denied its involvement in the ownership and management of the remaining nineteen companies. They maintained this position about their lack of involvement in the companies in question throughout the proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nDuring a meeting between the representatives of the Ministry and the company on 27 January 2004, the applicant company's counsel were given an opportunity to state orally their arguments against the report.\n\n21.\n\nHaving considered the company's objections, on 14 April 2004 the Ministry adopted a decision establishing that the applicant company had a large outstanding tax liability for the year 2000. As the applicant company had failed properly to declare the above-mentioned operations in its tax declarations and to pay the corresponding taxes, in accordance with Article 122 (3) of the Tax Code the Ministry found that the company had underreported its tax liability for 2000 and ordered it to pay 47,989,241,953 Russian roubles (\"RUB\") (approximately 1,394,748,234 euros, (\"EUR\")) in tax arrears, RUB 32,190,599,501.40 (approximately EUR 935,580,142) in default interest and RUB 19,195,696,780 as a 40% penalty (approximately EUR 557,899,293), totalling RUB 99,375,538,234.40 (approximately EUR 2,888,227,669). The arguments contained in the decision were identical to those of the report of 29 December 2003. In addition, the decision responded in detail to each of the counter-arguments advanced by the company in its objections of 12 January 2004.\n\n22.\n\nThe decision was served on the applicant company on 15 April 2004.\n\n23.\n\nThe company was given until 16 April 2004 to pay voluntarily the amounts due.\n\n24.\n\nThe applicant company alleged that it had requested the Ministry to clarify the report of 29 December 2003 and that the Ministry had failed to respond to this request.\n\n**(c) Institution of proceedings by the Ministry**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nUnder a rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute between the tax authority and the taxpayer was insoluble, the Ministry did not wait until 16 April 2004.\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 April 2004 it applied to the Moscow City Commercial Court (\"the City Court\") and requested the court to attach the applicant company's assets as a security for the claim.\n\n27.\n\nBy decision of 15 April 2004 the City Court initiated proceedings and prohibited the applicant company from disposing of some of its assets pending the outcome of litigation. The injunction did not concern goods produced by the company and related cash transactions.\n\n28.\n\nBy the same decision the court fixed the date of the preliminary hearing for 7 May 2004 and invited the applicant company to respond to the Ministry's claims.\n\n29.\n\nOn 23 April 2004 the applicant company filed a motion in which it argued that the City Court had no territorial jurisdiction over the company's legal headquarters and requested that the case be referred to a court in Nefteyugansk, where it was registered.\n\n30.\n\nOn 6 May 2004 the Ministry filed a motion inviting the court to call the applicant company's managing subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva as a co-defendant in the case.\n\n**(d) Hearing of 7 May 2004**\n-----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAt the hearing the City Court examined and dismissed the applicant company's motion of 23 April 2004. Having regard to the fact that the applicant company was operated by its own subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva, registered and located in Moscow, the court established that the applicant company's real headquarters were in Moscow and not in Nefteyugansk. In view of the above, the court concluded that it had jurisdiction to deal with the case.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the applicant company appealed against this decision. The appeal was examined and dismissed by the Appeals Division of the Moscow City Commercial Court (\"the Appeal Court\") on 3 June 2004.\n\n33.\n\nThe City Court also examined and granted the Ministry's motion of 6 May 2004. The court ordered OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva to join the proceedings as a co-defendant and adjourned the hearing until 14 May 2004.\n\n34.\n\nAt the hearing of 7 May 2004 the applicant company lodged with the City Court a separate action against the tax assessment of 14 April 2004, seeking to have the assessment decision declared unlawful. The applicant company's brief came to 42 pages and had 22 supporting documents in annex. This action was examined separately and dismissed as unsubstantiated by the City Court on 27 August 2004. The judgment of 27 August 2004 was upheld on appeal on 23 November 2004. On 30 December 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts.\n\n**(e) Hearing of 14 May 2004**\n------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nIn the meantime the tax assessment case continued. On 14 May 2004 the City Court rejected the applicant company's request to adjourn the proceedings, having found that the applicant company's counterclaim did not require such adjournment of the proceedings concerning the Ministry's action.\n\n36.\n\nOOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva also requested that the hearing be adjourned as, it claimed, it was not ready to participate in the proceedings.\n\n37.\n\nThis request was rejected by the court as unfounded on the same date.\n\n38.\n\nAt the hearing the respondent companies also requested the City Court to vary their procedural status to that of interested parties.\n\n39.\n\nThe court rejected this request and, on the applicant company's motion of 15 April 2004, ordered the Ministry to disclose its evidence. The company's motion contained a lengthy list of specific documents which, it alleged, should have been in the possession of the Ministry in support of its tax claims.\n\n40.\n\nThe court then decided that the merits of the case would be heard on 21 May 2004.\n\n41.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the Ministry invited the applicant company to examine the evidence in the case file at its premises. Two company lawyers went to the Ministry on 18 May and four lawyers went on 19 May 2004.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the applicant company, the supporting material underlying the case was first provided to the company on 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed approximately 24,000 pages of documents. On 18 May 2004 the Ministry allegedly disclosed approximately a further 45,000 pages, and a further 2,000 pages on the eve of the hearing before the City Court, that is, on 20 May 2004.\n\n43.\n\nRelying on a record dated 18 May 20041, drawn up and signed by S. Pepelyaev and E. Aleynikova (Ministry representative A. Bondarev allegedly refused to sign it), the applicant company submitted that the documents in question had been presented in an indiscriminate fashion, in unpaginated and unsorted piles placed in nineteen plastic crates (ten of which contained six thousand pages each, with nine others containing some four thousand pages each). All of the documents were allegedly crammed in a room measuring three to four square metres, with two chairs and a desk. No toilet facilities or means of refreshment were provided.\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012 : the text was \"18 May 2008\"\n\n44.\n\nAccording to the Government, the documents in question (42,269 pages - and not 45,000 pages as claimed by the applicant- filed on 18 May 2004, and a further 1,292 - and not 2,000 pages as claimed by the applicant company, filed on 20 May 2004) were well-known to the applicant company; moreover, it had already possessed these accounting and legal documents prior to the beginning of the proceedings. The documents allegedly reflected the relations between the applicant company and its network of sham entities, and the entirety of the management and accounting activities of these entities had been conducted by the applicant company from the premises of its executive body OOO Yukos-Moskva, located in Moscow. All of the documents were itemised in the Ministry's document dated 17 May 2004 and filed in execution of the court's order to disclose the evidence.\n\n45.\n\nThe Government also submitted that the applicant company's lawyers could have studied the evidence both in court and at the Ministry's premises throughout May, June and July 2004.\n\n**(f) First-instance judgment**\n-------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe hearings on the merits of the case commenced on 21 May and lasted until 26 May 2004. It appears that the applicant company requested the court repeatedly to adjourn the proceedings, relying, among other things, on the lack of sufficient time to study the case file.\n\n47.\n\nThe Government submitted that the first day of the hearings, 21 May 2004, was devoted to hearing and resolving various motions brought by the applicant company and OOO Yukos-Moskva. On 24 May 2004, after hearing further motions by OOO Yukos-Moskva, the court proceeded to the evidence phase of the trial. The Tax Ministry then explained the evidence that it had submitted to the court. During this phase of the trial, which continued on 25 May 2004, the applicant company's representatives were able to ask questions, and the defendants made various motions. According to the Government, where the court found that the applicant company had not had an opportunity to review a particular document that the Ministry wished to refer to, the court refused to allow the document to be entered in the record. On 26 May 2004 the applicant company was afforded an opportunity to explain its evidence and to submit additional evidence. The applicant company chose instead to address questions to the Ministry. The applicant company concluded the first-instance hearing of the case with over three hours of pleadings, whilst the Ministry limited its pleadings to brief references to its own tax inspection report, the decision dated 14 April 2004 and the statement of claim.\n\n48.\n\nOn 26 May 2004, at the end of the hearings, the City Court gave its judgment in which, for the most part, it reached the same findings and came to the same conclusions as in the Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004. Having confirmed the factual findings of the decision of 14 April 2004 in respect of the relations and transactions between the sham companies and the applicant company with reference to sundry pieces of evidence, including the statements by the nominal owners of the trading companies, acknowledging to the true nature of their relations with the applicant company, the court then reasoned as follows:\n\n\"... Under section 3 of RF Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 'On value-added tax', part 2 of section 5 and section 4 of RF Law no. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 'On motorway funds in the Russian Federation', subpart 'ch' of section 21 of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 'On the basics of the tax system', the sale of goods (works and services) gives rise to an obligation to pay VAT, motorway users' tax, tax on the sale of oil and oil products and tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 38 of the Tax Code, objects of taxation may consist of the sale of goods (works and services), assets, profit, value of sold goods (works and services) or other objects having value, quantity or physical characteristics on the presence of which the tax legislation bases the obligation to pay tax.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 39 of the Tax Code, sales are defined as the transfer of property rights in respect of goods. Under subpart 1 and 2 of Article 209 of the Civil Code (taking into account Article 11 of the Tax Code) the owner of goods is the person who has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of his property, that is, the person who is entitled to carry out at his own discretion in respect of this property any actions which are not against the law and other legal acts and do not breach the rights and protected interests of other persons ...\n\nThe court established that the owner of the oil sold under contracts concluded with organisations registered in low-tax territories had been OAO Yukos. The respondents' arguments about the unlawfulness of the use of the notion of *de facto* owner (*\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a*) on the basis that, according to Article 10 (3) and Article 8 (1) part 3 of the Civil Code ... there existed a presumption of good faith on the part of parties involved in civil-law transactions and that therefore the persons indicated as owners in the respective contracts should be regarded as the owners, are baseless, because the above-mentioned organisations never acquired any rights of ownership, use and disposal in respect of oil and oil products (*\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0444\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0443 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043e*).\n\nOAO NK Yukos was therefore under an obligation to pay [the taxes], and this obligation has not been complied with in good time.\n\nArticle 41 of the Tax Code establishes that profit is an economic gain in monetary form or in kind, which is taken into account if it is possible to evaluate it and in so far as it can be assessed. Under subparts 1 and 2 of section 2 of RF Law no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 'On profit tax of enterprises and organisations' which was then in force, the object of taxation is the gross profit of the enterprise, decreased (or increased) in accordance with the provisions of the present section. The gross profit is the total of revenues (receipts) from the sale of products (works and services), main assets (including plots of land), other property belonging to the enterprise and the profit derived from operations other than sales, less the sum of expenses in respect of these operations. Since it follows from the case file that the economic profit from the sale of oil and oil products was perceived by OAO NK Yukos, it was incumbent on [the applicant company] to comply with the obligation to pay profit tax.\n\nSection 2 of RF Law no. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 'On corporate property tax' taxes the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts which are indicated on the taxpayer's balance sheet. It follows that the obligation to pay property tax was incumbent on the person who was legally responsible for reflecting the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts on its balance sheet. Since it follows from the materials of the case that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.\n\nThe court does not accept the respondent's arguments that the tax authorities lacked the power to levy taxes from OAO NK Yukos in respect of the sums ... perceived by other organisations. The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad-faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001. At the same time the bad faith of taxpayer OAO NK Yukos and the fact that the proceeds from transactions in oil and oil products were remitted to it is confirmed by the materials of the case file.\n\nThe court has also established that the use of tax benefits by organisations which were dependent on OAO NK Yukos and participated in the tax-evasion scheme set up by that company was unlawful.\n\nPursuant to Article 56 of the Tax Code, tax benefits are recognised as preferences provided for in the tax legislation for certain groups of taxpayers in comparison with other taxpayers, including the possibility of not paying a tax or of paying it at a lower rate.\n\nThe court believes that tax payers must use their right to such benefits in good faith.\n\nMeanwhile, it follows from the materials of the case that the taxpayers [concerned] used their right in bad faith.\n\nThe entities registered on the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya (OOO Yu-Mordoviya ..., ZAO Yukos-M ..., OAO Alta-Treyd ..., OOO Ratmir ..., OOO Mars XXII ...) applied benefits governed by Law of the Republic of Mordoviya no. 9-Z of 9 March 1999 'On conditions for the efficient use of the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya', which sets out a special taxation procedure for entities, for the purpose of creating beneficial conditions for attracting capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, developing the securities market and creating additional jobs. Under section 2 of that law, this special taxation procedure applies in respect of entities (including foreign entities operating through permanent representative offices established in the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya), established after the entry into force of the law (with the exception of entities conducting leasing activities, banks and other credit institutions) and whose business meets one of the following conditions: export operations, with the resulting quarterly earnings totalling at least 15% of the whole of the entity's earnings; wholesale trading of combustibles and lubricants and other kinds of hydrocarbons with the resulting quarterly earning totalling at least 70% of the whole of the entity's earnings; and other conditions enumerated in that law. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Law, the Government of the Republic of Mordoviya passed resolutions on the application of the special taxation procedure in respect of the mentioned entities and, consequently, on the application of the following tax rates: at the rate of 0% in respect of profit tax in so far as it is credited to the republican and local budgets of the Republic of Mordoviya; at the rate of 0% on motorway users' tax in so far as it is credited to the Territorial Road Fund of the Republic of Mordoviya; and at the rate of 0% on corporate property tax. Moreover, the above-mentioned entities were exempted by local government resolutions from payment of tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities.\n\nHowever, the special taxation procedure is provided for [by this law] for the purposes of creating favourable conditions in order to attract capital to the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, develop the securities market and create additional jobs. The entities which used those benefits did not actually carry out their activities on the territory of this subject of the Russian Federation, did not attract capital and did not facilitate the strengthening of the Republic's socio-economic potential, but, on the contrary, inflicted material damage through non-payment of taxes to the budget of the Republic, the local budget and the federal budget. Thus, the use of the tax benefits in respect of these entities was not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Mordoviya but pursued the aim of evading taxes on the production, refining and sales operations in respect of oil and oil products by OAO NK Yukos and is, as a consequence, unlawful.\n\nThe entity registered on the territory of the Republic of Kalmykiya (OOO Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya ...) did not pay profit tax, property tax, motorway users' tax, tax on the acquisition of vehicles and other taxes, under Law no. 12-P-3 of the Republic of Kalmykiya of 12 March 1999 'On tax benefits to enterprises investing in the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya', which establishes advantages in respect of taxes and duties for the ... taxpayers that invest in the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya and are registered as such enterprises with the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic of Kalmykiya. Moreover, the entity in question was exempt from the payment of local taxes and ... of profit tax to the consolidated budget.\n\nAt the same time, it follows from the presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers (Decisions no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 25 July 2001, no. 4-O of 10 January 2002 and no. 108-O of 14 May 2002, Rulings of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court no. 9408/00 dated 18 September 2001, no. 7374/01 of 18 June 2002, no. 6294/01 of 5 November 2002 and no. 11259/02 of 17 December 2002 and letter no. \u04215-5/\u0443\u043f-342 of the Deputy President of the Supreme Commercial Court of 17 April 2002) that, for the use of tax advantages to become lawful, the amount of advantages provided and the sum of investments made by the entity should be commensurate. Since the amounts of benefits declared for tax purposes by the above-mentioned entities and the sums of investment made are obviously not commensurate, application of the advantages is unlawful. The application of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Republic of Kalmykiya but pursues the aim of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of the operations of production, refining and sales of oil and oil products and, consequently, is unlawful.\n\nThe entity registered in the closed administrative territorial formation ('ZATO') town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region (OOO Yuksar ...) concluded a tax agreement on the provision of tax concessions with the Sarov municipal administration. The granting of additional tax advantages on the territory of the Sarov ZATO (Federal Nuclear Centre) in 2000 was regulated by the norms of Articles 21 and 56 of the Tax Code, section 58 of Law no. 227-FZ of 31 December 1999 'On the federal budget for the year 2000', section 5 of Law no. 3297-1 'On closed administrative territorial formations' of 14 July 1992, Item 2 of Paragraph 30 of Decree no. 222 of the Russian Government of 13 March 2000 'On measures for implementation of the Federal Law 'On the Federal Budget for 2000' and Regulations 'On the investment zone of the town of Sarov', approved by a Resolution of the Sarov Duma on 30 December 1999. According to the tax agreement, the Sarov administration confers advantages in respect of taxes payable into the Sarov budget to the entity in question in the form of a reduction in the share of taxes and other compulsory payments to the budget, up to 25% of the sums due in VAT, property tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, tax on vehicle owners, tax on the acquisition of vehicles, profit tax, tax on operations with securities and excise duties; in exchange, the entity undertakes to participate in investment projects (programmes) implemented in the Sarov investment zone or with its participation, aimed at raising additional budget receipts and solving the problems of Sarov's socio-economic development by transferring quarterly at least 1% of the sum of the tax advantages.\n\nAt the same time, according to Paragraph 1 of section 5 of the Federal Law no. 3297-1 'On closed administrative territorial formations' of 17 July 1992, additional benefits on taxes and duties are granted by the appropriate local government authorities to entities registered as taxpayers with the authorities of the closed administrative territorial formations in compliance with the above-mentioned law. Entities possessing at least 90% of their capital assets and conducting at least 70% of their activities on the territories of the closed administrative territorial formations (including the requirement that at least 70% of the average number of employees on the payroll must be made up of persons who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question and that at least 70% of the labour remuneration fund must be paid to employees who permanently reside on the territory of the formation in question) enjoy the right to obtain the benefits in question. Given that OOO Yuksar did not actually carry out any activity on the territory of Sarov, was not actually present on the territory of Sarov and that there were no assets and production facilities necessary for the procurement and storage of oil on the territory of Sarov, Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the given entity applied the tax advantages unlawfully.\n\nThus, the use of tax advantages by the given entity is not aimed at improving the economy of the Sarov ZATO but pursued the aimed of tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of its obligation to pay taxes on production and refining operations and the sale of oil and oil products and is, consequently, unlawful.\n\nEntities registered in the Trekhgornyy ZATO in the Chelyabinsk Region (OOO Kverkus ..., OOO Muskron ..., OOO Nortex ..., OOO Greis ... and OOO Virtus ...) concluded tax agreements with the administration of the town of Trekhgornyy, according to which entities were granted advantages in respect of profit tax, tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities, property tax, land tax, tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, tax on vehicle users, and tax on the acquisition of vehicles, provided that the entities remitted the sum of 5% of the total amount of tax advantages conferred, for implementation of the town's socio-economic programmes, to the Trekhgornyy administration... Reasoning from the contents and meaning of the tax agreements, it follows that their purpose was implementation of the particularly important socio-economic task of developing the educational, medical and housing spheres in the Trekhgornyy ZATO. At the same time, the sums which were transferred to the budget by the taxpayers in question were many times lower than the sums of the declared tax advantages (the sum of investments is around 0.006% of the sum of the advantages for each taxpayer). Thus, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of Trekhgornyy's economy. On the contrary, since the above-mentioned organisations did not in fact carry out any activities, were never located on the territory of Trekhgornyy, had no assets and none of the production facilities necessary to buy and store oil on the territory of Trekhgornyy, the application of tax advantages by the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 'On closed administrative territorial formations'.\n\nThe organisations registered in the Lesnoy ZATO in the Sverdlovsk Region (OOO Mitra ..., OOO Vald-oyl ..., OOO Bizness-oyl ...) concluded tax agreements on the granting of a targeted tax concession under which organisations were granted the concession in respect of profit tax, land tax, tax on the sales of fuel and lubricants, motorway users' tax, vehicle users' tax, tax on the acquisition of vehicles, tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities and property tax, whilst the organisations [in question] were under an obligation to transfer to ... the Lesnoy municipal administration sums amounting to 5% of the sums of the granted tax concessions, but no less than 6,000 roubles quarterly, for implementation of the town's socio-economic programmes. [However], the amounts received from the taxpayers are many times lower than the totals of the declared tax advantages. Accordingly, the investments made by the taxpayers did not influence the development of the economy of the town of Lesnoy because the above-mentioned organisations never carried out any activities on the territory of Lesnoy, were never in fact located on the territory of Lesnoy and had no assets and none of the production facilities required to sell and store oil on the territory of Lesnoy, [and thus] the application of the tax advantages in respect of the above-mentioned organisations is contrary to part 1 of section 5 of RF Law no. 3297-1 of 17 July 1992 'On closed administrative territorial formations'.\n\nThe organisation registered in the Evenk Autonomous District (OOO Petroleum-Treiding) without in fact carrying out any activity on the territory of the district in question and without in fact being located on the territory of the Evenk Autonomous District, abused its right granted by Law no. 108 of the Evenk Autonomous District of 24 September 1998 'On specific features of the tax system in the Evenk Autonomous District'. The mentioned organisation was registered in the given district solely for the purpose of acquiring the right to the tax concession that could be granted in the Evenk Autonomous District. The use of the tax benefits by the organisation in question is not aimed at strengthening of economy of the Evenk Autonomous District, but is instead aimed at tax evasion by OAO NK Yukos in respect of extraction and processing transactions and the sale of oil and oil products and is thus unlawful.\n\nThus, the use of tax concessions by the above-mentioned organisations is not aimed at strengthening the economy of the regions in which they were registered but is aimed at evading the taxes due in respect of the operations of extraction and processing transactions and the sale of oil and oil products by OAO NK Yukos and is thus unlawful. ...\"\n\n49.\n\nThe first-instance judgment also responded to the applicant company's submissions. As regards the argument that the Ministry's calculations were erroneous in that they led to double taxation and the failure to take account of the right to a refund of VAT for export operations, the court noted that, contrary to the applicant company's allegations, both the revenues and expenses of the sham entities had been taken into account by the Ministry so as to avoid double taxation. In addition, under Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On value-added tax\", in order to claim a refund of the VAT paid during export operations a taxpayer had to justify the claim in accordance with a special procedure and the applicant company had failed to apply for a refund either in 2000 or at any later date. As to the argument that the Ministry's claim was time-barred, the court refuted it with reference to Article 113 of the Tax Code and Decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of 21 July 2001. The court held that the rules on limitation periods were inapplicable in the case at issue as the applicant company had acted in bad faith. In response to the company's argument that the interdependency within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code was only relevant for the purposes of price correction under Article 40 of the Code, the court observed that the interdependency of the sham companies and the applicant company was one of the circumstances on the basis of which the tax authorities had proved that the tax offence had been committed by the applicant company in bad faith.\n\n50.\n\nAccordingly, by the judgment of 26 May 2004 the court upheld the decision of 14 April 2004, albeit slightly reducing the payable amounts by reference to the Ministry's failure to prove the relations of the applicant company with one of the entities mentioned in the decision of 14 April 2004. The court ordered the applicant company to pay RUB 47,989,073,311 (approximately EUR 1,375,080,541) in taxes, RUB 32,190,430,314 (approximately EUR 922,385,687) in default interest and RUB 19,195,606,923 (approximately EUR 550,031,575) in penalties, totalling RUB 99,375,110,548 (approximately EUR 2,847,497,802) and ordered its managing subsidiary OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva to comply with this decision. The judgment could be appealed against by the parties within a thirty-day time-limit.\n\n51.\n\nAt the hearings of 21 to 26 May 2004 the applicant company and its managing subsidiary were represented by eight counsel. The reasoned copy of the judgment of 26 May 2004 was produced and became available to the parties on 28 May 2004.\n\n**(g) Appeal proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 1 June 2004 OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva filed an appeal against the judgment of 26 May 2004.\n\n53.\n\nThe Ministry appealed against the judgment on 2 June 2004.\n\n54.\n\nOn 4 June 2004 the Appeal Court listed the appeals of OOO \"YUKOS\" Moskva and the Ministry to be heard on 18 June 2004.\n\n55.\n\nOn 17 June 2004 the applicant company filed its appeal against the judgment of 26 May 2004. The brief came to 115 pages and contained 41 documents in annex. The company complained, in particular, that the time for filing an appeal had been unlawfully abridged, in breach of its rights to fair and adversarial proceedings, that the first-instance judgment was ungrounded and unlawful, that the evidence in the case was unlawful, that the first-instance court had erred in interpretation and application of the domestic law, in that it had lacked legal authority to \"assign\" the tax liabilities of one company to another, and that the court's interpretation of the legislation on tax concessions had been erroneous. The company also argued that the lower court had wrongly assessed the evidence in the case and had come to erroneous factual conclusions in respect of the relationships between the applicant company and the sham companies, that in any event some of the operations of the sham companies had been unrelated to the alleged tax evasion and that the respective sums should not be \"assigned\" to the applicant company, and also that the case should have been tried in the town of Nefteyugansk, where the company was registered.\n\n56.\n\nThe Government submitted that the applicant company attempted to delay the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address. According to the applicant, the above allegation was unsubstantiated.\n\n57.\n\nThe appeal hearing in the case lasted from 18 to 29 June 2004.\n\n58.\n\nAt the beginning of the hearing on 18 June 2004 the applicant company requested the Appeal Court to adjourn the proceedings. The company considered that the hearing had been fixed for too early a date, before the expiry of the statutory time-limit for lodging appeals.\n\n59.\n\nThe court refused this request as unfounded.\n\n60.\n\nAt the hearings of 21 and 28 June 2004 the applicant company filed four supplements to its appeal. The company and its managing subsidiary were represented by ten counsel.\n\n61.\n\nUnder Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure the court fully re-examined the case presented by the Ministry rather than simply reviewing the first-instance judgment.\n\n62.\n\nAt the end of the hearing of 29 June 2004 the court delivered its judgment, in which it reached largely similar findings and came to the same conclusions as the first-instance judgment. The court dismissed the company's appeals as unfounded, but decided to alter the first-instance judgment in part. In particular, it declared the Ministry's claims in respect of VAT partly unfounded, reduced the amount of the VAT arrears by RUB 22,939,931 (approximately EUR 649,336) and quashed the corresponding penalty of RUB 10,334,226 (approximately EUR 292,520).\n\n63.\n\nThe court judgment, in its relevant parts, read as follows:\n\n\"... The parties declared under part 5 of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure that there was a need to verify the lawfulness and grounds of the first-instance judgment and to hold a fresh hearing of the case in full.\n\nThe Appeal Court has checked the lawfulness and grounds of the first-instance judgment pursuant to ... Article 268 ... of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure. ...\n\nThe Appeal Court does not accept the arguments of the respondents concerning erroneous interpretation and application of the norms of the substantive law by the first-instance court and concerning the factual incorrectness of that court's conclusions.\n\n[The court went on to review and confirm all factual findings made by the Ministry and the first-instance court in respect of the tax-evasion scheme set up by the applicant company.]\n\n... Bearing in mind the above-mentioned circumstances, the Appeal Court has established that the *de facto* owner of the oil was [the applicant company]. The acquisition of the oil and its transfer and subsequent sale was in reality carried out by [the applicant company] as the owner, which is proved by the control of [the applicant company] over all operations, and the actual movement of the oil from the extracting entities to processing entities or oil facilities controlled by [the applicant company], which is proved by the materials of the case.\n\n...\n\nThe [applicant company's] ownership of the oil is confirmed by the interdependence of the contracting parties, by the control that [the applicant company] had over them, by the registration of the contracting parties on territories with a low-tax regime, by the lack of activities by these entities at their place of registration, by the fact that the accounting operations for these entities was carried out by OOO Yukos-Invest or OOO Yukos-FBC, companies officially dependant on [the applicant company], by the fact that the accounting for these entities was filed from the addresses of [the applicant company] and OOO Yukos-Moskva, by the fact that their bank accounts were opened in the same banks owned by [the applicant company], by the presence and character of commercial relations between [the applicant company] and the dependent entities, and by the use of promissory notes and mutual offsetting between them.\n\nUnder the legislation then in force, such as section 3 of RF Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 'On value-added tax', part 2 of Section 5 and section 4 of RF Law no. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 'On motorway funds in the Russian Federation', subpart 'ch' of section 21 of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 'On the basics of the tax system', the sale of goods (works and services) gives rise to an obligation to pay VAT, motorway users' tax, tax on the sale of oil and oil products and the tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities.\n\nUnder part 1 of Article 39 of the Tax Code, sales are defined as the transfer of property rights in respect of goods. Under subpart 1 and 2 of Article 209 of the Civil Code (taking into account Article 11 of the Tax Code) the owner of goods is the person who has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of his property, that is, the person who is entitled to carry out at his own discretion in respect of this property any actions which are not against the law and other legal acts and do not breach the rights and protected interests of other persons...\n\nIt follows that the person who in fact has the rights of ownership, use and disposal of the property and who, in view of these rights, exercises in reality and at his discretion in respect of his property any actions, including transfers of property to other persons ... is the owner of this property.\n\nTherefore, OAO NK Yukos, being the *de facto* owner of the oil, was under an obligation to pay [the taxes], which has not been complied with in good time.\n\nAs was previously established, Article 41 of the Tax Code sets out that profit is an economic gain in monetary form or in kind, which is taken into account if it is possible to evaluate it and in so far as it can be assessed, and determined in accordance with the chapters 'Taxes in respect of the profits of natural persons', 'Taxes in respect of the profits of organisations', and 'Taxes in respect of the capital profits' of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation. Under subparts 1 and 2 of section 2 of RF Law no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 'On profit tax of enterprises and organisations' which was then in force, the object of taxation is the gross profit of the enterprise, decreased (or increased) in accordance with the provisions of the present section. The gross profit is the total of revenues (receipts) from the sale of products (works and services), main assets (including land parcels), other property of the enterprise and the profit derived from operations other than sales, less the sum of expenses in respect of these operations. The court established that the economic profit from the sale of oil and oil products was perceived by OAO NK Yukos, [and] it was incumbent on [the applicant company] to comply with the obligation to pay profit tax.\n\nSection 2 of RF Law no. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 'On corporate property tax' taxes the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts which are indicated on the taxpayer's balance sheet. It follows that the obligation to pay property tax was incumbent on the person who was legally responsible for reflecting the main assets, non-material assets, reserves and receipts on its balance sheet. Since it follows from the materials of the on-site tax inspection that OAO NK Yukos was under such an obligation, this taxpayer was also under an obligation to pay property tax.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of the RF in its decision of 25 July 2001 no. 138-0 stated that it followed from the meaning of the norm contained in part 7 of Article 3 of the Tax Code of the RF that there is a presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers. In order to refute this and establish the taxpayer's bad faith, the tax authorities have the right \u2013 in order to strike a balance between public and private interests \u2013 to carry out necessary checks and bring subsequent claims in commercial courts in order to guarantee the payment of taxes to the budget.\n\nIn view of the above, the tax authorities ... have the right to carry out checks with a view to establishing the *de facto* owner of sold property and the *de facto* recipient of the economic profit, and also with a view to establishing [the owner's] bad faith as expressed in use of the tax-evasion scheme. At the same time, the tax authorities establish the *de facto* owner with regard to the actual relations between the parties to the transaction, irrespective of whether the persons were declared as owners of the property in the documents submitted during the tax inspections.\n\nThe circumstances indicating that OAO NK Yukos had in fact the rights of ownership, use and disposal of its oil and oil products and, at its discretion, carried out in this connection any actions, including the sale, transfer for processing, etc., through specially registered organisations dependant on OAO NK Yukos is confirmed by the materials of the case.\n\n...\n\nIn view of the above, the court does not accept the respondent's arguments about the unlawfulness and the lack of factual basis of the decision to levy additional taxes from OAO NK Yukos as the *de facto* owner of the oil and oil products.\n\nThe respondent's argument that OAO NK Yukos had not perceived any economic profit from the application of benefits by the entities mentioned in the decision of the Ministry contradicts the materials of the case. The court had established that OAO NK Yukos received economic profit in the form of unilateral transfers of cash. OAO NK Yukos set up the Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO NK Yukos [to this end].\n\n...\n\nThe argument of OAO NK Yukos that the Ministry is levying taxes in respect of transactions \"within the same owner\" is unsupported, since the calculations of additional taxes (except for the property tax in respect of which [this is inapplicable]) also take into account the expenses connected with the acquisition of the oil and oil products.\n\nThe court does not accept the respondent's arguments that the tax authorities lacked the power to levy taxes from OAO NK Yukos in respect of the sums ... perceived by other organisations. The power of the tax authorities to bring proceedings in courts to ensure the payment of taxes to the budget in cases of bad-faith taxpayers is confirmed by decision no. 138-O of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, dated 25 July 2001. At the same time the bad faith of taxpayer OAO NK Yukos and the fact that the proceeds from transactions involving oil and oil products belonged to it is confirmed by the materials of the case file.\n\nThe circumstances of the ... acquisition and sale of the oil and oil products, taken in their entirety, as established by the Appeal Court, indicate the presence of bad faith in the actions of OAO NK Yukos, which was expressed in intentional actions aimed at tax evasion by the use of unlawful schemes. In accordance with part 2 of Article 110 of the Tax Code of the RF the tax offence is considered intentional if the person who has committed it knew about the unlawful character of the actions (inactions), wished them or knowingly accepted the possibility of the harmful consequences of such actions (inactions).\n\nSince OAO NK Yukos intentionally committed actions aimed at tax evasion, and its officers were aware of the unlawful character of such actions, wished or knowingly accepted the possibility of harmful consequences due to such actions, OAO NK Yukos must be held liable under part 3 of Article 122 of the RF Tax Code for the non-payment or incomplete payment of taxes due to the lowering of the taxable base or incorrect calculation of the tax or other unlawful actions (inactions) committed intentionally, in the form of a fine equivalent to 40% of the unpaid taxes.\n\n...\n\nHaving re-examined the case and verified the lawfulness and grounds of the first-instance judgment in full, having examined the evidence and having heard the arguments of the parties, the Appeal Court has come to the conclusion that the decision of the Ministry dated 14 April 2004 ... is in compliance with the Tax Code as well as with Federal laws and other laws on taxes...\n\nThe claims for payment of taxes, interest surcharges and fines made in the decision of the Ministry of 14 April 2004 ... are grounded, lawful and confirmed by the primary documents of the materials of the inspection submitted in justification to the court. ...\"\n\n64.\n\nThe appeal judgment also responded to the applicant company's other arguments. As regards the alleged breaches of procedure and the lack of time for the preparation of the defence at first instance, the court noted that it had examined this allegation and that there had been no violation of procedure at first instance and that, in any event, the applicant company had had ample opportunities to study the evidence relied on by the Ministry both at the Ministry's premises and in court. As regards the argument that the evidence used by the Ministry was inadmissible, the court noted that the materials of the case had been collected in full compliance with the requirements of the domestic legislation. The court also agreed with the first-instance court that the three-year statutory time-limit had been inapplicable in the applicant company's case since the company had been acting in bad faith.\n\n65.\n\nThe first-instance judgment, as upheld on appeal, came into force on 29 June 2004.\n\n66.\n\nThe applicant company had two months from the date of the delivery of the appeal judgment to challenge it in third-instance cassation proceedings (*\u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f*).\n\n**(h) Cassation proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n67.\n\nOn 7 July 2004 the applicant company filed a cassation appeal against the judgments of 26 May and of 29 June 2004 with the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit (\"the Circuit Court\"). The applicant company's brief came to 77 pages and had 6 documents in annex. The arguments in the brief were largely similar to those raised by the applicant company on appeal, namely that the judgment was unlawful and unfounded, that the entities mentioned in the report ought to have taken part in the proceedings, that the trial court had had insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant company and other entities were interrelated, that the evidence used by the trial court was unlawful, that the trial proceedings had not been adversarial and that the principle of equality of arms had been breached. In addition, the company alleged that it had had insufficient time to study the evidence and had been unable to contest the evidence in the case, that the Ministry had unlawfully applied to a court before the applicant company had had an opportunity to comply voluntarily with the decision of 14 April 2004, that the entities mentioned in the report had in fact been eligible for the tax exemptions, that the rules governing tax exemption had been wrongly interpreted, that the Ministry's claims had been time-barred, that the company had had insufficient time for the preparation of the appeal, and that the case ought to have been examined by a court in Nefteyugansk.\n\n68.\n\nA copy of the reasoned version of the appeal judgment of 29 June 2004 was attached to the brief.\n\n69.\n\nIt appears that on an unspecified date the Ministry also challenged the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004.\n\n70.\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the Circuit Court examined the cassation appeals and upheld in substance the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004.\n\n71.\n\nIn respect of the applicant company's allegations of unfairness in the appeal proceedings, the court noted that both defendant companies had had ample opportunities to avail themselves of their right to bring appeals within the statutory time-limit, as the appeal decision was not taken until 29 June 2004, which was more than thirty days after the date of delivery of the judgment of 26 May 2004. Furthermore, the court observed that the evidence presented by the Ministry and examined by the lower courts was lawful and admissible, and that it had been fully available to the defendant companies before the commencement of the trial hearings. The court also noted that on 14 May 2004 the City Court specifically ordered the Ministry to disclose all the evidence in the case, that this order had been complied with by the Ministry and that, despite the fact that the evidence was voluminous, the applicant company had had sufficient time to examine and challenge it repeatedly throughout the proceedings between May and July 2004.\n\n72.\n\nAs regards the applicant company's complaint that the Ministry had brought proceedings before the expiry of the time-limit for voluntary compliance with the decision of 14 April 2004, the court noted that the Ministry and lower courts had acted in compliance with Article 213 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure, as there were irreconcilable differences between the parties and, throughout the proceedings, the applicant company had had insufficient funds to satisfy the Ministry's claims.\n\n73.\n\nIn respect of the applicant company's argument that the case should have been tried by a court in Nefteyugansk, the court noted that the City Court had had jurisdiction over the case under Article 54 of the Civil Code and decision no. 6/8 of the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court and Supreme Commercial Court of 1 July 1996.\n\n74.\n\nOn the merits of the case, the court noted that the lower courts had reached reasoned conclusions that the applicant company was the effective owner of all goods traded by the sham companies registered in low-tax areas, that the transactions of these entities were in fact those of the applicant company, that neither the applicant company nor the sham entities were eligible for the tax exemptions and that the applicant company had perceived the entirety of the resulting profits. The court upheld the lower courts' conclusion that, acting in bad faith, the applicant company had failed properly to declare its transactions for the year 2000 and to pay corresponding taxes, including VAT, profit tax, motorway users' tax, property tax, the tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities and tax on the sale of fuel and lubricants.\n\n75.\n\nThe court noted some arithmetical mistakes in the appeal judgment of 29 June 2004, increasing the penalty by RUB 1,158,254.40 (approximately EUR 32,613) and reducing the default interest by RUB 22,939,931 (approximately EUR 645,917) accordingly.\n\n**(i) Constitutional review**\n-----------------------------\n\n76.\n\nOn an unspecified date the applicant company lodged a complaint against the domestic courts' decisions in its case with the Constitutional Court. It specifically raised the question of the lower courts' refusal to apply the statutory time-limit set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code.\n\n77.\n\nBy decision of 18 January 2005 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction. The court noted that the applicant company did not in fact challenge the constitutionality of Article 113 of the Code but rather insisted that this provision was constitutional and should be applied in its case. Therefore, the applicant company was not complaining about the breach of its rights by the above-mentioned provision and, accordingly, the court had no competence to examine the applicant company's claims.\n\n**(j) Supervisory review**\n--------------------------\n\n78.\n\nSimultaneously to bringing the cassation appeal, on 7 July 2004 the applicant company also challenged the judgments of 26 May and 29 June 2004 by way of supervisory review before the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia.\n\n79.\n\nOn 31 December 2004 the applicant company's case was accepted for examination by the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n80.\n\nBy a decision of 13 January 2005 the Supreme Commercial Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, decided to relinquish jurisdiction in favour of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court. Addressing one of the applicant company's arguments, the court noted that the lower courts had decided that the three-year statutory time-bar was inapplicable in the case at issue since the applicant company had been acting in bad faith. It further noted that such an interpretation of the rules governing the time-limits was not in line with the existing legislation and case-law and that therefore the issue should be resolved by the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n81.\n\nOn 19 April 2005 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court referred the above-mentioned issue to the Constitutional Court and adjourned the examination of the applicant company's supervisory review appeal pending a ruling by the Constitutional Court.\n\n82.\n\nBy a decision of 14 July 2005 the Constitutional Court decided that it was competent to examine the question of the compatibility of Article 113 of the Tax Code with the Constitution, having cited the application of an individual, one G. A. Polyakova, and the referral by the Supreme Commercial Court. At the same time, it noted specifically that it had no competence to decide individual cases and its ruling would only deal with the points of law *in abstracto*.\n\n83.\n\nIt appears that the legal issues raised by G. A. Polyakova and the applicant company were different. G. A. Polyakova was dissatisfied with the established court practice which required the tax authorities, rather than the courts, to hold a taxpayer liable for a tax offence within the three-year time-limit set out in Article 113 of the Code. On the facts of her individual case, the decision of the tax authorities was taken on time, whilst later the final decision by the courts was taken outside the specified time-limit. As regards the applicant company, it raised the same point which had been previously declared inadmissible by the Constitutional Court in its decision dated 18 January 2005, namely the refusal of the courts in its case to follow the established practice and to declare the claims of the authorities time-barred, as they related to the year 2000 and were set out in the decision to hold the applicant liable for a tax offence on 14 April 2004, that is, outside the three-year time-limit laid down by Article 113 of the Code.\n\n84.\n\nAs a result of its examination, the Constitutional Court upheld Article 113 of the Tax Code as compatible with the Constitution, having ruled that the legal provisions on the statutory time-limits ought to be applied in all cases without exception. The court made an abstract review of the provision in question and mentioned the \"principles of justice\", \"legal equality\" and \"proportionality\" in giving its own \"constitutional interpretation\" of Article 113. The court noted that the rule set out in Article 113 of the Code was too strict and failed to take into account various relevant circumstances and the actions of taxpayers, including those aimed at hindering tax control and delaying the proceedings. It further ruled that:\n\n\"... the provisions of Article 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in their constitutional and legal sense and in the present legal context do not exclude [the possibility] that, where the taxpayer impedes tax supervision and the conduct of tax inspections, the court may excuse the tax authorities' failure to bring the proceedings in time ...\"\n\n\"... In their constitutional and legal sense in the context of the present legal regulation... [these provisions] mean that the running of the statutory time-bar in respect of a person prosecuted for tax offences stops on the date of the production of the tax audit report in which the supported facts of the tax offences revealed during the inspection are mentioned and in which there are reference to the relevant articles of the Tax Code or - in cases where there was no need to produce such a report - from the moment on which the respective decision of the tax authority, holding a taxpayer liable for a tax offence, was taken. ...\"\n\n85.\n\nThree out of the nineteen judges filed separate opinions in this case.\n\n86.\n\nJudge V. G. Yaroslavtsev disagreed with the majority, having noted that the Constitutional Court acted *ultra vires* and openly breached the principle of lawfulness by creating an exception from the rule set out in Article 113 where there had previously been none.\n\n87.\n\nJudge G. A. Gadzhiev concurred with the conclusions of the majority but would have preferred to quash, rather than uphold, Article 113 of the Tax Code as unconstitutional and breaching the principle of equality.\n\n88.\n\nJudge A. L. Kononov dissented from the majority ruling, having considered that the Constitutional Court clearly had no competence to decide the matter and that indeed there had been no constitutional issue to resolve as, among other things, there had been no prior difficulties in application of Article 113 of the Tax Code and the contents of this provision had been quite clear. He also criticised the \"inexplicable\" way in which the Constitutional Court had first rejected the application by the applicant company and had then decided to examine the matter again. Judge Kononov further noted that the decision of the Constitutional Court was vague, unclear and generally questionable.\n\n89.\n\nThe case was then returned to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court.\n\n90.\n\nOn 4 October 2005 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court examined and dismissed the applicant company's appeal. In respect of the company's argument that the Ministry's claims were time-barred, the court noted that during the tax proceedings the company had been actively impeding the tax inspections. In view of this and given the Constitutional Court's ruling, the court concluded that since the Ministry's tax audit report in the applicant's case had been completed on 29 December 2003, that is, within the statutory three-year time-limit as interpreted in the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005, the case was not time-barred.\n\n*2. Enforcement measures relating to the 2000 Tax Assessment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nSimultaneously with the determination of the case before the courts in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2000, the parties also took part in various enforcement proceedings.\n\n**(a) Attachment of the applicant's property**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The City Court's decision of 15 April 2004*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nOn 15 April 2004 the City Court accepted for consideration the Ministry's action in respect of the year 2000 and attached certain of the applicant company's assets, excluding goods produced by the company and related cash transactions, as a security for the claims. The court also issued writs of execution in this respect (see paragraph 27). This decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 2 July 2004.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement of attachment by the bailiffs*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nBy a decision of 16 April 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in connection with the attachment.\n\n94.\n\nOn the same day they executed the attachment order by informing the applicant company and the holder of its corporate register, ZAO 'M-Reestr', of the decision of 15 April 2004.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to the Government, the applicant company impeded the execution of the writs issued by the court by hiding its corporate register from the bailiffs. In particular, they alleged that a few hours prior to the bailiffs' visit, the applicant company had cancelled its contracts with ZAO 'M-Reestr'. The register was then dispatched by ordinary post to a location in Russia so that, over the next weeks, it could not be physically found and the execution writs could not be enforced.\n\n*(iii) The company's offer of 22 April 2004*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nOn 22 April 2004 the applicant company filed its first court request to have the attachment of the entirety of its assets replaced by the attachment of shares belonging to it in OAO Sibirskaya neftyanaya kompaniya (\"the Sibneft company\", a major Russian oil company which had attempted unsuccessfully to merge with the applicant company in 2003), which were allegedly worth three times as much as the then liability. The applicant company also alleged that the attachment order adversely affected its proper functioning and invited the authorities to opt for less intrusive measures, insisting on the lack of any risk of asset-stripping.\n\n97.\n\nBy a decision of 23 April 2004 the City Court examined and dismissed this request as unfounded. The court found no evidence that the interim measures affected any of the company's production activities.\n\n98.\n\nOn 17 May 2004 the applicant company appealed against the decision of 23 April 2004.\n\n99.\n\nThe outcome of court proceedings in respect of the applicant company's appeal of 17 May 2004 is unclear.\n\n100.\n\nThe Government provided the following background information in connection with the company's offer of shares in Sibneft. The applicant company had attempted to merge with Sibneft in May-September 2003. As a result of the initial stages of the merger, the applicant company acquired 92% of Sibneft: 20% of these shares were bought for cash, whilst 57.5% were exchanged for 17.2% of the applicant company's newly issued shares and 14.5% were swapped for 8.8% of the applicant company's existing shares. In November 2003 it was announced publicly that, at the request of the former Sibneft owners, the parties had decided not to go ahead with the merger. In February 2004 the owners of Sibneft sued the applicant company in this connection, demanding cancellation of the operation whereby the applicant had issued 17.2% of shares. Among other things, on 14 February 2004 they obtained an attachment order in respect of the Sibneft shares remaining in the possession of the applicant company pending the proceedings. On 1 March 2004 the City Court decided to cancel the issue of 17.2% shares by the applicant company. The Government submitted that it was clear from the above-mentioned account that on 22 April 2004, the date on which the applicant company first made the offer of Sibneft shares, the owners of Sibneft already anticipated suing the applicant company again, this time demanding back the 57.5% of Sibneft shares swapped for the cancelled 17.2% of the applicant company's shares. At the same time, the fate of the remaining issues of Sibneft shares still in the possession of the applicant company was also uncertain.\n\n*(iv) The applicant company's request for an injunction against the attachment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nOn 23 April 2004 the City Court also examined the applicant company's request for an injunction order against the attachment and rejected it. The court noted that the attachment did not interfere with the company's day-to-day operations and it was a reasonable measure aimed at securing the Ministry's claims.\n\n102.\n\nOn 2 July 2004 the Appeal Court rejected the company's appeal and upheld the judgment.\n\n103.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company brought cassation proceedings in this respect.\n\n**(b) Enforcement of the Tax Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn the meantime, on 7 May 2004 the applicant company applied to the City Court with a separate action against the tax assessment of 14 April 2004, seeking its invalidation (see paragraph 34 and 35 above). The company also requested interim measures in this connection.\n\n105.\n\nFollowing the applicant company's request for interim measures, on 19 May 2004 the City Court stayed the enforcement of the Tax Ministry's decision of 14 April 2004, having noted that the Ministry could have enforced the decision in the part relating to taxes and default interests even without waiting for the outcome of the Ministry's claim (Article 46 of the Tax Code2). The court decided, however, that this might be detrimental to the applicant company and stayed the decision of 14 April 2004 accordingly.\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012 : the text was: \"Article 46 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure\"\n\n106.\n\nOn 27 May 2004 the applicant company made a public announcement that:\n\n\"... it [was] under an injunction prohibiting it from selling any of its property, including the shares owned by the company. Until the injunction is lifted, the Company is unable to sell its assets in order to obtain liquid funds. Consequently, if the Tax Ministry's efforts continue, we are very likely to enter a state of bankruptcy before the end of 2004\".\n\n107.\n\nIt appears that the City Court's decision of 19 May 2004 to stay the enforcement was appealed against by the Ministry. Having examined the Ministry's arguments at the hearing of 23 June 2004, the Appeal Court quashed the first-instance decision of 19 May 2004 as unlawful and rejected the applicant company's request for interim measures as unfounded.\n\n108.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company appealed against this decision before the Circuit Court.\n\n**(c) Enforcement of the judgments concerning the 2000 Tax Assessment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) First-instance judgment of 26 May 2004 and the appeal decision of 29 June 2004*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs mentioned above (paragraphs 46-66), by a judgment of 26 May 2004 the City Court found in favour of the Tax Ministry, upholding the Tax Assessment of 14 April 2004. The Tax Assessment was upheld by the Appeal Court with minor reductions and became enforceable on 29 June 2004.\n\n110.\n\nOn 30 June 2004 the Appeal Court issued the writ of enforcement in this respect. The applicant company was to pay RUB 47,958,133,380 (approximately EUR 1,358,914,565) in reassessed taxes, RUB 32,190,430,314 (approximately EUR 912,129,842) in interest surcharges and RUB 19,185,272,697 (approximately EUR 543,623,045) in penalties.\n\n*(ii) Enforcement proceedings in respect of the writ of 30 June 2004*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nOn 30 June 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings based on the above judgment and gave the applicant company five days to pay. The applicant company was informed that it would be liable to pay enforcement fees of 7%, totalling RUB 6,953,375,547 (approximately EUR 197,026,920), in the event of failure to honour the debt voluntarily. Upon the Ministry's application, the bailiffs issued sixteen orders freezing the cash held by the applicant company in its Russian bank accounts. The orders did not concern cash added to the accounts after 30 June 2004.\n\n*(iii) The applicant company's challenge to the decision of 30 June 2004*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nOn 7 July 2004 the applicant company challenged the bailiffs' decision of 30 June 2004.\n\n113.\n\nIt argued that the decision to open enforcement proceedings had been unlawful as it was in breach of the rules of bailiffs' territorial competence as the enforcement ought to have taken place in Nefteyugansk and not in Moscow, that the five-day term for voluntary compliance with the court decisions had been too short and that the cash-freezing orders had made such compliance impossible.\n\n114.\n\nOn 30 July 2004 the City Court examined and dismissed these claims as groundless. The court ruled that the bailiffs had acted lawfully and that the cash-freezing orders did not interfere with its ability or inability to honour its debts, as the applicant company had been free to dispose of any cash not in the frozen accounts and any cash added to those accounts after 30 June 2004.\n\n115.\n\nIt does not appear that the company brought appeal proceedings against this judgment.\n\n**(d) Seizure of 24 subsidiary companies and related proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn the meantime, on 1 July 2004 the bailiffs decided to seize 24 subsidiary companies belonging to the applicant company.\n\n117.\n\nThe applicant appealed against the decision in court.\n\n118.\n\nBy a first-instance judgment of 17 September 2004 the appeal was dismissed as unfounded. The judgment was produced on 20 September 2004.\n\n119.\n\nThe applicant did not appeal against the judgment before the Appeal Court, though it did bring further appeal proceedings before the Circuit Court.\n\n120.\n\nOn 2 February 2005 the judgment was upheld by the Circuit Court.\n\n**(e) The applicant company's proposal of 5 July 2004 and related proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nIn addition to the above attempts to stay the enforcement of the judgments concerning the 2000 Tax Assessment, the applicant company, by a letter dated 2 July and filed on 5 July 2004, suggested to the bailiffs for the second time that it repay its debts by using 34.5% of Sibneft stock allegedly worth over 4 billion United States dollars (\"USD\", or some EUR 3.3 billion), citing its vertically integrated structure as a possible reason for seeking to find the least intrusive solution as well as the need to honour its contractual debts.\n\n122.\n\nThe Government provided the following background information in connection with the applicant's second offer of Sibneft shares (see paragraph 121 above). At this point, the owners of Sibneft had already obtained a court judgment in their favour by the City Court on 1 March 2004, ordering the applicant company to return the 57.5% of Sibneft shares swapped for the cancelled 17.2% of the applicant company's shares and on 6 July 2004, that is, on the day after the applicant's second offer, they had filed court claims demanding the return of 14.5% of the shares previously exchanged for 8.8% of the applicant company's existing shares. In addition, by a decision of 6 July 2004 the owners of Sibneft had obtained an attachment order in respect of the Sibneft shares in question.\n\n123.\n\nOn 14 July 2004 the applicant company filed an action against the bailiffs on account of their alleged failure to respond to the company's offer of 5 July 2004.\n\n124.\n\nOn 17 August 2004 the City Court dismissed this action, having noted that the failure to respond was lawful and within the scope of the bailiffs' discretion. The court established that some of the steps undertaken by the applicant company during the unsuccessful merger with the Sibneft company had been contested in a different set of proceedings as unlawful. In addition, the applicant company's ownership of the Sibneft shares had been contested by third parties in two different sets of proceedings. On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the bailiff had not breached the law by ignoring the company's offer.\n\n125.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company appealed against the judgment.\n\n**(f) Default notice of 5 July 2004**\n-------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nOn 5 July 2004 the applicant company received a default notice from syndicated lenders, a group of international banks, who had previously loaned the company USD 1 billion (EUR 821,894,430). The lenders considered that a default had occurred as a result of the recent and well-publicised events in respect of the applicant company and their actual or potential impact on the applicant company's business and assets. The notice stated that as a result of the default notice the loans were due and payable on demand.\n\n**(g) The company's cassation appeal of 7 July 2004 and the motion to stay the enforcement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nAs set out above (paragraph 67), on 7 July 2004 the applicant company filed a cassation appeal against the court judgments on the 2000 Tax Assessment and at the same time it moved to stay the enforcement proceedings. It argued that its assets were highly valuable, but that it had insufficient cash to honour the debts immediately and that the attachment of assets made any voluntary settlement impossible. The applicant company also argued that enforcement of the court judgments in the case would irreparably damage its business, since a reversal of the enforcement would be impossible.\n\n128.\n\nBy a decision of 16 July 2004 the Appeal Court agreed to consider the cassation appeal and, having examined the motion to stay the enforcement, dismissed it as unsubstantiated and unfounded, as the circumstances referred to by the applicant company were irrelevant under the domestic law. The court noted that it would be possible to reverse the enforcement, since the plaintiff was the Treasury.\n\n129.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Circuit Court on 4 August 2004.\n\n**(h) 7% enforcement fee**\n--------------------------\n\n130.\n\nBy a decision of 9 July 2004 the bailiffs levied an enforcement fee of 7% in respect of the applicant company's failure to comply with the execution writs of 30 June 2004 (see paragraph 110 above). The applicant company was to pay RUB 6,848,291,175.45 (approximately EUR 190,481,640)\n\n131.\n\nOn 19 July 2004 the applicant company challenged this decision in court.\n\n132.\n\nBy a decision of 3 August 2004 the City Court examined the applicant company's action and quashed the decision of 9 July 2004 as disproportionate and unjustified. The court decided that the enforcement fee could only be levied if the respondent had acted in bad faith and found that the bailiffs had failed to examine this question. The court also noted that 7% was the highest possible rate and that the bailiffs' decision failed to explain why the fee could not be lower. Among other things, the court referred to section 3 of Constitutional Court Ruling no. 13-P of 30 July 2001.\n\n133.\n\nFollowing an appeal by the Ministry, on 27 August 2004 the Appeal Court quashed the decision of 3 August 2004 as erroneous and held that the bailiffs' actions had been lawful and justified. The court noted that the applicant company had failed to demonstrate that it had taken any steps to meet the liabilities. It further noted that the cash in the applicant company's accounts was only frozen in certain specified amounts and that, above those amounts, the company was free to function as usual. As to the company's proposal to offer the Sibneft shares as payment, the court noted that this could not be accepted, because the applicant company's property rights in respect of these shares had been questioned by a third party in a parallel set of proceedings. In addition, the court noted that the applicant company had failed to use a remedy provided in Article 324 of the Commercial Procedure Code.\n\n134.\n\nThe Circuit Court upheld the appeal decision on 6 December 2004.\n\n**(i) Overall debt in respect of 2000**\n---------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2000, the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 99,333,836,391 (approximately EUR 2,814,667,452)\n\n**(j) The applicant company's proposal of 13 July 2004 and related proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nOn 13 July 2004 the applicant company again repeated its offer of 34.5% of Sibneft shares to the bailiffs. On the next day the offer was amended to include only 20% of Sibneft shares. The domestic courts at three instances analysed this offer in detail in their decisions of 6, 18 August and 25 October 2004 (see paragraphs 139-146 below).\n\n**(k) Seizure of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Decision of 14 July 2004*\n------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nOn 14 July 2004 the bailiffs seized the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegas, one of the applicant company's principal production subsidiaries. The decision referred to the applicant company's inability to meet its liabilities. The attachment did not affect the applicant company's ability to manage OAO Yuganskneftegaz, but rather prevented the company from selling or encumbering those shares.\n\n*(ii) The applicant company's challenge to the decision of 14 July 2004*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe applicant company appealed against this decision in court. With reference to section 59 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, it argued that the bailiffs ought firstly to claim assets which were not involved in the production process, secondly those goods and other values which were not related to the production process and, thirdly, immovable objects, raw material and other main assets relating to the production cycle. In addition, the applicant company referred to Ruling no. 4 of the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court \"On certain questions arising out of seizure and enforcement actions in respect of corporate shares\", dated 3 March 1999, which suggested, in respect of those companies which had been privatised by the State as parts of bigger holding groups through the transfer of controlling blocks of shares, that the production cycle of the respective production unit should be preserved as much as possible. The company further claimed that the above ruling was applicable to the case at issue, that OAO Yuganskneftegas was a major production unit and that the bailiffs had produced no evidence that the assets and goods and other values not involved in the production process were insufficient. In addition, it reiterated its offer of the shares in Sibneft.\n\n*(iii) First-instance proceedings*\n----------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nOn 6 August 2004 the City Court examined and allowed the applicant company's challenge of this seizure.\n\n140.\n\nAt the hearing the Ministry and bailiffs referred to sections 9 (5) and 51 (1-4) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act and Government Decree no. 934 \"On seizure of securities\" of 12 August 1998. They argued that, under the applicable domestic law, the seizure should be made first in respect of the cash-flow and then, under section 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings, it would be open to the bailiffs to assess and seize the assets depending on their liquidity. They countered the applicant company's arguments by saying that the latter's references were invalid in that they related to the other stage of enforcement proceedings (the collection of debt and not the seizure as such). Furthermore, they argued that Ruling no. 4 of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable since, in the case of Yuganskneftegas, the State had transferred only 38% of the shares and not a controlling block. With regard to the offer of Sibneft stock, the Ministry and bailiffs argued that the applicant company's rights in respect of these shares had been contested in separate sets of court proceedings and it was therefore risky to accept them as a payment. Lastly, they informed the court that the applicant company had recently hidden the shareholder registers of its three major subsidiaries, OAO Yuganskneftegas, OAO Samaraneftegas and OAO Tomskneft, which, in their view, demonstrated the risk of possible asset-stripping by the applicant company.\n\n141.\n\nHaving examined the parties' submissions, the court upheld the applicant company's arguments. It noted that the applicant company's references to the applicable domestic law were correct. With regard to the non-controlling block argument, the court noted that at the time of transfer of the shares, 25% of shares were privileged and non-voting. For the remaining 75% of the voting stock, the 38% transferred by the State constituted the controlling block. As regards the offer of shares in Sibneft, the court noted that the exact quantity of the contested shares was unclear and that the bailiffs should find out the exact figures and that they should consider the uncontested shares as a possible means of partial settlement. The court concluded that the decision of 14 July 2004 was unlawful and quashed it.\n\n*(iv) Appeal proceedings*\n-------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOn 9 August 2004 the Ministry challenged the decision of 6 August 2004 on appeal.\n\n143.\n\nOn 18 August 2004 the Appeal Court quashed the decision, finding that the first-instance court had erred both in law and fact. In particular, the court confirmed that it was up to the bailiffs to choose the most liquid assets and dispose of them with a view to honouring the applicant company's huge debt. It also noted that Ruling no. 4 of the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court was inapplicable to the case in issue, as the applicant company, in the years following its privatisation, had restructured its initial shareholding in OAO Yuganskneftegaz in 1999 in such a manner as to take those shares outside the scope of the exception provided by Ruling no. 4.\n\n*(v) Cassation proceedings*\n---------------------------\n\n144.\n\nFollowing an appeal by the applicant company, on 25 October 2004 the Circuit Court upheld the decision of 18 August 2004.\n\n145.\n\nThe applicant company's attempts to bring supervisory review proceedings against this decision proved unsuccessful.\n\n146.\n\nThe respective complaint was dismissed by a decision of the Supreme Commercial Court dated 17 December 2004.\n\n**(l) Seizure of shares of OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegaz**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn addition to seizing the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, on 14 July 2004 the bailiffs also seized the shares of OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegas, the applicant company's two other principal production units.\n\n148.\n\nThe applicant company's complaint against the seizure of OAO Tomskneft-VNK proved unsuccessful.\n\n149.\n\nThe City Court dismissed its complaint as unfounded on 13 August 2004.\n\n150.\n\nThe applicant company did not contest that judgment before the Appeal Court.\n\n151.\n\nOn 5 November 2004 the Circuit Court dismissed the applicant company's cassation appeal in respect of the judgment of 13 August 2004. The court noted that the seizure was intended to protect the creditor's claims and that there was no indication that the seizure impeded the production cycle or otherwise disturbed the normal functioning of the company.\n\n152.\n\nThe company also complained unsuccessfully about the seizure of its shares in OAO Samaraneftegaz.\n\n153.\n\nThe City Court, acting as a first-instance court, dismissed the appeal on 2 September 2004.\n\n154.\n\nThe applicant company failed to appeal the judgment before the Appeal Court, although though it did pursue cassation proceedings.\n\n155.\n\nOn 18 January 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the judgment.\n\n**(m) The applicant company's request to the Ministry of Finance dated 16 July 2004**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nOn 16 July 2004 the applicant company wrote a letter to the Ministry of Finance, applying for respite or payment in instalments in respect of the sums due. It appears that this letter remained unanswered. The Government submitted that the Ministry of Finance had not had any authority to respond to the request, as the issue of respite and payment in instalment lay within the competence of the courts.\n\n157.\n\nOn 12 August 2004 the City Court examined the applicant company's request to re-pay the 2000 Tax Assessment award in instalments and rejected it as unfounded. The court noted, among other things, that the tax debt had resulted from intentional tax evasion by the applicant company and that the conduct of the debtor in court and during the enforcement proceedings demonstrated that it did not intend to pay the debts voluntarily.\n\n158.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company brought any appeal proceedings in respect of this judgment.\n\n**(n) The applicant company's offer of 9 August 2004**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nOn 9 August 2004 the applicant company offered the bailiffs the 20% stake in Sibneft and shares in fifteen other subsidiary companies as a settlement for its debts, requesting that the bailiffs respond within one day.\n\n160.\n\nIt appears that the bailiffs responded to the company's offer on 9 September 2004. It does not appear that the company brought any court proceedings in respect of that response.\n\n**(o) The Ministry's response of 22 September 2004**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIt appears that on 22 September 2004 the Ministry responded to four of the applicant company's letters about the settlement of the debt, rejecting the offers.\n\n162.\n\nIt does not appear that the company brought any separate court proceedings in this respect.\n\n**(p) The applicant company's announcement in respect of the shares in Sibneft**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nOn 8 October 2004 the applicant company announced that it would comply with the City Court's judgment of 1 March 2004, which had cancelled the issue of additional shares in the applicant company, used for the purpose of acquiring Sibneft. The applicant company, acting in compliance with the court order, instructed the registrar to return its 57.5% stake in Sibneft to its former owners.\n\n**B. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2001**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Tax Assessment 2001*\n------------------------\n\n**(a) Proceedings before the Ministry**\n---------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nOn 23 March 2004 the Tax Ministry commenced tax inspection in respect of the applicant company's activities in 2001. The inspection ended on 30 June 2004 and on 5 July 2004 the Ministry served the resultant report on the applicant company.\n\n165.\n\nOn the basis of the above-mentioned report, by a decision of 2 September 2004 the Ministry issued a tax assessment for the year 2001 (\"the 2001 Tax Assessment\"), finding the company liable for having used essentially the same tax arrangement as in the previous year. The Tax Assessment 2001 relied on a similarly wide range of evidence as the Tax Assessment 2000, including the documentary evidence and detailed statements of those involved in the nominal ownership and running of the trading companies. This time the applicant company had to pay RUB 50,759,436,900 (approximately EUR 1,424,746,313) in tax arrears, RUB 28,520,204,254 (approximately EUR 800,522,195) in default interest and RUB 40,607,549,520 in penalties (approximately EUR 1,139,797,051). Since the applicant company had recently been found guilty of a similar offence, the penalty was doubled.\n\n**(b) The applicant company's request for a court injunction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nOn 14 September 2004 the applicant company lodged an appeal against the decision of 2 September 2004 and requested an injunction against the immediate enforcement of this decision.\n\n167.\n\nOn 5 October 2004 the City Court turned down the request for an injunction and on 13 October 2004 it issued execution writs in respect of the Ministry's decision of 2 September 2004. The court referred to Information Letter no. 83 of the Supreme Commercial Court of 13 August 2004, which recommended that requests for interim measures in such situations be granted only if an applicant could demonstrate some security for a creditor's future claims. The court noted that, in the present case, the applicant company clearly had insufficient cash to satisfy the creditor's claims, and had failed to produce any security, and dismissed the claims accordingly.\n\n168.\n\nThe judgment of 5 October 2004 was upheld by the Appeal Court on 3 December 2004 and by the Circuit Court on 29 March 2005.\n\n*2. Enforcement measures relating to the 2001 Tax Assessment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Enforcement of additional taxes and interest surcharges**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAs the 2001 Tax Assessment was similar to the 2000 Tax Assessment, the Ministry decided to enforce it directly in the part relating to additional taxes and interest surcharges, without taking the matter to the courts. The applicant company was to pay the amounts due by 4 September 2004.\n\n170.\n\nOn 9 September 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in connection with the decision of 2 September 2004. The company was to pay RUB 50,759,436,900 (approximately EUR 1,424,746,313) in tax arrears and RUB 28,520,204,254 (approximately EUR 800,522,195) in default interest.\n\n171.\n\nIt appears that the 2001 Tax Assessment, in the part relating to additional taxes and interest surcharges, was upheld by the City Court on 11 October 2004. The judgment of 11 October 2004 was upheld on appeal on 16 February 2005. The Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts on 9 December 2005.\n\n172.\n\nThe applicant company's request for an injunction pending those proceedings was unsuccessful. The City Court dismissed it in its judgment of 5 October 2004. The refusal was upheld by the Appeal Court on 3 December 2004 and by the Circuit Court on 29 March 2005.\n\n**(b) Enforcement of penalties**\n--------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nOn 3 September 2004 the Ministry applied to the City Court to recover the penalties arising from the 2001 Tax Assessment. .\n\n174.\n\nIt appears that on 11 October 2004 the action was examined and granted by the City Court. The judgment in the case was produced on 15 October 2004.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to the applicant company, its appeal against the judgment of 153 October 2004 was dismissed by the Appeal Court on 18 November 2004. It appears that the Circuit Court upheld these two decisions on 15 November 2005.\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: the text was: \"the judgment of 11 October 2004\"\n\n176.\n\nOn 19 November 2004 the bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the Tax Assessment 2001 in the part relating to penalties. The company was to pay RUB 39,113,140,826 in penalties (approximately EUR 1,097,851,399)4.\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: the text was: \"RUB 40,607,549,520 in penalties (approximately EUR 1,139,797,051)\"\n\n**(c) 7% enforcement fee in respect of additional taxes and interest surcharges**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nOn 20 September 2004 the bailiffs decided to impose a 7% enforcement fee in respect of the applicant company's failure to abide by the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part relating to taxes and interest surcharges. The applicant company was to pay RUB 5,549,574,880.78 (approximately EUR 155,693,193).\n\n178.\n\nThe resolution was served on the applicant company on 1 October 2004.\n\n179.\n\nOn 29 October 2004 the City Court examined and dismissed the challenge to the decision of 20 September 2004 as groundless.\n\n180.\n\nIt does appear that the company pursued appeal proceedings.\n\n181.\n\nOn 1 December 2004 the company appealed in cassation against the judgment of 29 October 2004.\n\n182.\n\nThe appeal was dismissed by the Circuit Court on 3 March 2005.\n\n**(d) 7% enforcement fee in respect of penalties**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiff decided to impose a 7% enforcement fee in respect the applicant company's failure to abide by the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part relating to penalties. The company was to pay a 7% enforcement fee of RUB 7,102,488,295 or approximately EUR 190,077,377.\n\n184.\n\nOn 23 December 2004 the company challenged this decision in court.\n\n185.\n\nOn 3 February 2005 the City Court dismissed the action.\n\n186.\n\nThe applicant company failed to appeal the judgment of 3 February 2005.\n\n187.\n\nThe Circuit Court upheld the judgment of 3 February 2005 on 16 June 2005.\n\n**(e) Overall debt in respect of 2001**\n---------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2001 the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 132,539,253,849.78 (approximately EUR 3,710,836,129).\n\n**C. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2002**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Tax Assessment 2002*\n------------------------\n\n189.\n\nOn 29 October 2004 the Ministry produced an audit report in respect of the applicant company's activities for the year 2002. The report was received by the company on 1 November 2004.\n\n190.\n\nOn 16 November 2004 the Ministry took a decision to levy further tax liabilities, this time in respect of the year 2002 (\"the 2002 Tax Assessment\"). The applicant company was to pay RUB 90,286,552,485 (approximately EUR 2,425,825,387) in taxes, RUB 31,485,110,355.58 (approximately EUR 845,944,140) in default interest and RUB 72,040,907,796 (approximately EUR 1,935,600,133) in penalties.\n\n191.\n\nThe decision established the use of the same tax-evasion scheme (in respect of profit tax, VAT, corporate property tax and motorway users' tax) as in the decisions concerning the years 2000 and 2001. It mentioned that the company had carried out its activities through OOO Ratmir, OOO Alta-Treid, ZAO Yukos-M, OOO Yu-Mordoviya, OOO Ratibor, OOO Petroleum treyding, OOO Evoyl, OOO Fargoyl, most of which had also been used by the applicant company in previous years. The entities in question, acting in breach of Article 575 of the Civil Code, which prohibits grants and gifts between independently functioning commercial entities, had transferred the entirety of their profits unilaterally to a fund owned and controlled by the applicant company. The decision mentioned that the transfers had been wrongly reflected in the applicant company's financial accounting and that the company had failed to explain the origin of these funds and had failed to take these sums into account for tax purposes. Accordingly, the applicant company had failed to pay taxes in respect of these amounts.\n\n192.\n\nThe decision referred to several other mistakes in the applicant company's tax declarations. In particular, the tax in respect of the company's securities transactions was wrongly calculated, there were many general mistakes in the company's financial accounting, and there were some mistakes in the company's request for reimbursement of the VAT on export operations (e.g. on one occasion the company failed to submit the required sales contract; it also mentioned one contract but received the money on the basis of a different contract; on some occasions the company failed to submit documents proving customs clearance, indicated wrongly calculated sums, and made multiple mistakes in VAT export documents). There were further multiple mistakes in tax deductions in respect of internal VAT.\n\n193.\n\nThe decision also established that the applicant company had used sham entities to lower its group taxes, that the entities and the company's subsidiaries had entered into transactions with reduced prices, that on some occasions the company had declared the extracted oil as \"hydrocarbon liquid\" in order to lower the applicable price even further, that there were no cash transactions between the entities and subsidiaries and that the company's own promissory notes and mutual offsetting had been used instead and that the whole set-up, which had no economic purpose other than tax evasion, had resulted in massive tax evasion by the applicant company. The decision also noted that use of tax concessions in the Republic of Mordoviya and the Evenk Autonomous District by the sham entities had been unlawful, because they had failed to qualify for the exemptions and also because they had been sham companies. The decision was detailed in respect of the composition and all the activities of the sham entities: the Ministry analysed the entirety of their activities month by month.\n\n194.\n\nThe applicant company had until 17 November 2004 to meet the debts voluntarily.\n\n*2. Enforcement measures relating to the 2002 Tax Assessment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Enforcement of additional taxes, interest surcharges and penalties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nBy a decision of 18 November 2004 bailiffs proceeded to enforcement of the decision of 16 November 2004 in so far as it related to additional taxes and interest surcharges.\n\n196.\n\nThe City Court joined the proceedings by which the applicant company tried to contest the decision of 16 November 2004 and on 23 December 2004 it examined and, in the most part, dismissed the applicant company's appeals against the decision of 16 November 2004. The court declared the Ministry's conclusions partly unfounded and reduced the company's tax liability by RUB 325,628,742 (approximately EUR 8,752,543), its default interest payments by RUB 98,515,758 (approximately EUR 2,647,995) and the penalty by RUB 851,419,688 (approximately EUR 22,885,227). The court also ordered the applicant to pay the penalty in question.\n\n197.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Appeal Court on 5 March 2005 and the Circuit Court on 30 June 2005.\n\n198.\n\nOn 28 December 2004 the applicant company also appealed against the Ministry's decision in respect of the year 2002, in so far as it had ordered that the tax debts and default interest payments be collected directly.\n\n199.\n\nIt appears that on 7 February 2005 the City Court examined and dismissed the claim as unfounded. The judgment was upheld on appeal on 4 April 2005. The Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts on 15 June 2005.\n\n**(b) 7% enforcement fee in respect of additional taxes and interest surcharges**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiffs decided to impose a 7% enforcement fee in respect of the applicant company's failure to comply voluntarily with the 2002 Tax Assessment in the part relating to additional taxes and surcharge interests.\n\n201.\n\nOn 23 December 2004 the company appealed against this decision in court, initially claiming that the decision had been unlawful and asking to reduce the fee to 1%. The company then withdrew its claim in the part relating to the reduction of the fee.\n\n202.\n\nOn 10 February 2005 the City Court judgment dismissed the appeal.\n\n203.\n\nIt does not appear that the company brought any proceedings before the Appeal Court in respect of the judgment.\n\n204.\n\nThe applicant company's cassation appeal was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court on 16 June 2005.\n\n**(c) Overall debt in respect of 2002**\n---------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nOverall in respect of the year 2002 (excluding the 7% enforcement fee), the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 192,537,006,448.58 (approximately EUR 4,344,549,434).\n\n**(d) Written information report communicated by ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit to the applicant company 's management in respect of the year 2002**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nIn their observations of 15 April 2005 the Government submitted a copy of a report communicated to the applicant company's management by its auditor ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit. The applicant company did not comment on the contents of the report.\n\n207.\n\nIn contrast to \"ordinary\" audit reports, which were made public, the internal information report was produced exclusively for the applicant company's management.\n\n208.\n\nThe report noted specifically that the applicant company's \"Fund for Financial Support of the Production Development of OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya YUKOS\" was in breach of the domestic law in that the relevant legislation disallowed unilateral transfers and gifts between commercial entities. It also noted that the applicant company's accounting policy in respect of the operations involving promissory notes had been incompatible with the legislation in force and provided a distorted view of the company's activities.\n\n209.\n\nIn addition, on 15 June 2007 the applicant company's auditor, ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, disavowed its audit certifications in respect of the applicant company's financial statements for the years 1995-2004 on account of the applicant company's deliberate attempts to conceal its tax-evasion scheme, as well as its failure to disclose all relevant documents during the respective inspections conducted by the company's auditors at the time.\n\n**D. Proceedings in respect of the applicant company's tax liability for the year 2003**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Tax Assessment 2003*\n------------------------\n\n210.\n\nOn 28 October 2004 the Tax Ministry commenced a tax inspection in respect of the year 2003, which resulted in an audit report that was dated 19 November 2004 and served on the applicant company on the same date.\n\n211.\n\nOn the basis of the report, by a decision of 6 December 2004 the Ministry levied tax liabilities for the year 2003 (\"the 2003 Tax Assessment\"), consisting of RUB 86,228,187,852 (approximately EUR 2,327,114,103) in taxes, RUB 15,235,930,657.66 (approximately EUR 411,185,136) in default interest and RUB 68,939,326,976.40 (approximately EUR 1,860,524,778) in penalties.\n\n212.\n\nThe decision established that the company was guilty of having evaded taxes (in particular, VAT, profit tax and advertising tax) by using the same arrangement as in previous years. The decision mentioned the following entities registered either in the Republic of Mordoviya or the Evenk Autonomous District: OOO Yu-Mordoviya, ZAO Yukos-M, OOO Alta-Treyd, OOO Ratmir, OOO Energotreyd, OOO Makro-Treyd, OOO Fargoyl, and OOO Evoyl. It was alleged that the entities were sham and that they had made unilateral transfers to the applicant company, in breach of Article 575 of the Civil Code, that the applicant company had failed to reflect the transferred amounts as its profits, to account for them and to pay taxes in this connection and that the company had used lowered prices to avoid the payment of taxes. The decision contained a detailed contract-by-contract analysis of the sham entities' transactions.\n\n213.\n\nThe decision also mentioned that some of the applicant company's expenses were unjustifiably deducted from the company's taxable income, that the company failed to account for some of its operations with promissory notes, that there were some mistakes in calculation of the VAT owed by the company and that the company had evaded payment of advertising tax in Moscow.\n\n214.\n\nThe applicant company had one day to comply with the decision, that is, until 7 December 2004.\n\n*2. Enforcement measures relating to the 2003 Tax Assessment*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Enforcement of additional taxes, interest surcharges and penalties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nOn 9 December 2004 the bailiffs proceeded to enforcement of the decision of 6 December 2004 in so far as it related to taxes and interest surcharges.\n\n216.\n\nIt appears that the City Court joined the proceedings by which the applicant company tried to contest the decision of 9 December 2004 and on 28 April 2005 it examined the company's challenge. In respect of the company's request to recalculate automatically the export VAT on operations conducted by the sham entities in the course of these proceedings, the court noted the request was unsubstantiated and also lodged out of time. In particular, the company had failed to submit a proper claim with monthly calculations and evidence that the goods in question had indeed been exported. The court also addressed the applicant company's argument that Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code prevented the authorities from levying the interest surcharges. It noted that the provision in question only applied to cases in which the sole reason for the taxpayer's inability to pay tax debts was the seizure of its assets and cash funds. On the facts, the applicant company was unable to pay because it had insufficient funds and not because its assets were frozen. The court concluded that the applicant company's argument was unfounded. The court also reduced the amount of additional taxes to be paid to RUB 86,221,835,476.37 (EUR 2,399,884,085) and the amount of fines to RUB 68,918,264,491 (EUR 1,918,259,397). The amount of interest surcharges was reduced accordingly. The exact figure of the interest surcharges to be paid by the applicant is unclear.\n\n217.\n\nThe judgment was upheld on appeal on 16 August 2005.\n\n218.\n\nThe applicant company appealed on cassation.\n\n219.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 the Circuit Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts.\n\n220.\n\nThe bailiffs instituted enforcement proceedings in respect of the payment of fines on 4 October 2005.\n\n**(b) 7% enforcement fee**\n--------------------------\n\n221.\n\nOn 17 March 2006 the bailiffs decided to impose a 7% enforcement fee in respect of the applicant company's failure to comply voluntarily with the 2003 Tax Assessment. The applicant company was to pay RUB 7,102,488,296 (EUR 211,872,906) in respect of the unpaid reassessed taxes and interest surcharges and RUB 4,824,278,304 (EUR 143,912,080) in respect of the unpaid fines.\n\n**(c) Overall debt in respect of the year 2003**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nOverall, in respect of 2003 (excluding the 7% enforcement fee and the interest surcharges, the exact amount of which is unclear) the applicant company was ordered to pay RUB 155,140,099,967.37 (approximately EUR 4,318,143,482).\n\n**E. Forced auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nOn 20 July 2004 the Ministry of Justice announced the forthcoming evaluation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a part of its ongoing enforcement procedures.\n\n224.\n\nOn 22 July 2004 the applicant company announced that:\n\n\"...the company management [is] currently making every effort to raise additional funds in order to repay, as soon as possible, the tax liability and to finance current operations. However, should those efforts prove unsuccessful and Yuganskneftegaz [be] sold, in the present circumstances, the management of the Company would be compelled to announce the bankruptcy of Russia's largest oil company\".\n\n*1. Valuation report of 17 September 2004*\n------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nOn 17 September 2004 the valuation commissioned by the bailiffs and the Ministry of Justice from Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment branch of Dresdner Bank AG (working in Russia as ZAO Dresdner bank), for the purposes of the enforcement proceedings, estimated that 100% of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas were worth between USD 15.7 and 18.3 billion (between EUR 15.2 and 17.7 billion), excluding the pending and probable tax liabilities of this entity.\n\n226.\n\nThe report evaluated 100% of the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a separate entity and, having deduced its corresponding obligations, calculated the cost of its shares, on the basis of which it would be possible to calculate the price of one share in OAO Yuganskneftegaz.\n\n227.\n\nIt was specifically mentioned in the report that the valuation was not an opinion concerning the attainable price in the event of the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz or any kind of recommendation concerning the starting bid of the auction in the event of the sale of Yuganskneftegaz by the Ministry of Justice or any other State institution, or any recommendation concerning particular actions to be undertaken by the Ministry of Justice with a view to levying the judicially determined or estimated amount of the applicant company's tax debt.\n\n228.\n\nAmong the basic risks affecting the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, the report mentioned the tax claims, the validity of oil extraction licences, future oil prices, export quotas etc. The report also mentioned that the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a part of the applicant company could be substantially different from the price of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as a separate entity. The report also mentioned various valuations of OAO Yuganskneftegaz made by third parties, including investment institutions and banks, and ranging from USD 9 to 22 billion (between EUR 7.4 to 18.1 billion). It also mentioned that, because of the size of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, not many buyers would be financially capable of acquiring it.\n\n229.\n\nThe valuation (between USD 15.7 and 18.3 billion or EUR 15.2 and 17.7 billion) did not take account of already pending and probable tax claims against OAO Yuganskneftegaz. If and when lodged, these claims would \"substantially influence the assessment\" of the equity of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. The claims already announced (as on that date) were USD 951.3 million.\n\n230.\n\nIn carrying out the valuation, the report used the following three methods: the method of discounted cash flows, a method based on the analysis of comparable transactions, and a method based on the analysis of comparable publicly-held companies.\n\n231.\n\nThe report also specifically noted that:\n\n\"...the decision concerning the starting bid of the auction is a tactical one and should strike a balance between the desire to reach the highest price on the one hand, and the need to attract the maximum number of potential buyers on the other. Because of this, the starting bid is most likely to be different from the assessment of the price.\"\n\n*2. Service of the valuation report on the applicant company on 13 October 2004*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nA copy of the valuation report was served on the applicant company on 13 October 2004.\n\n233.\n\nIt does not appear that the applicant company contested the report's valuations report before the courts.\n\n234.\n\nOn 21 October 2004 the bailiffs confirmed to the Ministry that they had collected 79,584,690,127 RUB (approximately EUR 2,183,447,331).\n\n*3. The applicant company's reply of 4 November 2004*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nOn 4 November 2004 the applicant company responded to the valuation report. It disagreed with the decision to evaluate and sell OAO Yuganskneftegaz, and would have preferred to sell its other assets first. The applicant company informed the bailiffs that it had already honoured a major part of the debt (apparently referring to its tax liability for the year 2000 only) and that the remaining sum was USD 2.5 billion (around EUR 2 billion). The company claimed that it would be more reasonable to lift the seizure and let it dispose of its minor assets in order to honour the remaining debt.\n\n236.\n\nAs regards OAO Yuganskneftegas, the company referred to independent valuations by JP Morgan PLC, valuing the subsidiary at \"no less than USD 14 billion (some EUR 11 billion)\" and \"between USD 16.1 billion (EUR 12.6 billion) and USD 22.1 billion (EUR 17.378 billion), including tax liabilities\" respectively.\n\n237.\n\nThe letter mentioned that the Ministry had brought tax claims against OAO Yuganskneftegaz totalling USD 2.903 billion.\n\n*4. The bailiffs' decision of 18 November 2004*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nOn 18 November 2004 the bailiffs noted that the applicant company's debt to the Ministry on that date was RUB 204,902,386,620 (approximately EUR 5,506,781,584 or USD 7,147,250,717). Having referred to sections 4, 46 (6), 54 (2) and 88 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the bailiffs decided to sell 76.79 % of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas at an auction which would take place on 19 December 2004. The published minimum bidding price for 76.79 % of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas was RUB 246,753,447,303.18 (approximately USD 8.65 billion or EUR 6.63 billion).\n\n239.\n\nThe sale was entrusted to the Russian Fund of Federal Property (\"the Property Fund\"), a specialised State Institution in charge of organising sales of federal property and the property of those who had debts towards the State.\n\n240.\n\nOn the same date, the Property Fund issued a regulation setting out the parameters and rules that would govern the auction, including the number of shares to be sold (43 ordinary shares representing 76.79% of the capital of OAO Yuganskneftegaz), the starting price (RUB 248.6 billion or some USD 8.85 billion), the date and place of the auction (19 December 2004), the eligibility requirements for bidders (the auction was open to all perspective bidders, including foreign individuals and legal entities), which included a cash deposit of RUB 49.4 billion (USD 1.7 billion, or 20% of the starting price), to be paid no later than the day before the auction.\n\n*5. Court action against the decision of 18 November 2004*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe decision of 18 November 2004 was challenged in court on 26 November 2004.\n\n242.\n\nIt appears that on 3 December 2004 the City Court dismissed the appeal against the decision of 18 November 2004.\n\n243.\n\nOn 21 January and 3 May 2005 that judgment was upheld on appeal and in cassation respectively.\n\n244.\n\nThe applicant company argued that the valuation report had failed to give a market valuation of the asset and that the decision of 18 November 2004 failed to mention a specific price for OAO Yuganskneftegaz. In response, the courts noted that 43 ordinary and 13 privileged shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been seized by the bailiffs in satisfaction of the applicant company's liability, that the shares had been valued by ZAO Dresdner Bank and that the applicant company had been informed of all of the bailiffs' actions in the course of the enforcement proceedings. They also noted that the seizure of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz had previously been declared lawful, that the applicant company had been properly notified of all of the steps taken by the bailiffs in the course of the enforcement proceedings and could bring court proceedings against them, that the valuation by ZAO Dresdner Bank had not been contested by the applicant in accordance with the special procedure provided for by the legislation in force, and that the bailiffs had properly indicated the amount of the applicant company's debt and requested the Fund to sell the amount of shares necessary to satisfy the debt.\n\n*6. Announcement about the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn the meantime, on 19 November 2004, the Russian Gazette, an official Government newspaper, published an announcement about the sale of 76.79% of shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz at a public auction organised by the Property Fund. The only two conditions for participating in the auction were to file an application between 19 November and 18 December 2004 and to make a deposit payment.\n\n246.\n\nOn 10 December 2004 OOO Gazpromneft, ZAO Intercom and OAO First Venture Company filed applications with the Federal Antimonopoly Service and thus were expected to bid at the auction.\n\n247.\n\nThe media reported that OAO Gazprom, a parent company of OOO Gazpromneft, had begun negotiating a financing arrangement with a consortium of international banks to finance its bid at the auction. It was also reported that a number of non-Russian companies, such as ENI, Chevron Texaco, China National Petroleum Corporation and E.ON, had expressed interest in participating in the auction.\n\n248.\n\nOn 17 December 2004 the bailiffs noted that the applicant company's consolidated debt on that date, regard being had also to the 2001 Tax Assessment, was RUB 344,222,156,424.22 (EUR 9,210,844,560.93, or USD 12,365,545,256.86).\n\n*7. The applicant company's application for bankruptcy in the United States of America and its request for injunctive relief*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Filing of bankruptcy petition and request for injunctive relief**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nOn 14 December 2004 the applicant company filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (\"the U.S. Bankruptcy Court\").\n\n250.\n\nSimultaneously, the applicant company filed a request for injunctive relief, pursuant to section 105 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order, among other things, to enforce the automatic stay set out in section 362 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code by enjoining certain parties from participating in the Yuganskneftegaz Auction. The request was directed specifically against \"... defendants the Russian Federation, OOO Gazpromneft, ZAO Intercom, OAO First Venture Company, ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein ...\".\n\n**(b) Scope of automatic stay**\n-------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nUnder U.S. law, an automatic stay went into immediate effect when the applicant company filed for bankruptcy. The automatic stay protected the company's assets by preventing the creditors from collecting claims that arose prior to the bankruptcy filing or from taking \"possession\" or \"control\" of the applicant company's property covered under the filing.\n\n**(c) Temporary restraining order of 16 December 2004**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nOn 16 December 2004, having examined the applicant company's request, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order barring certain specific entities from taking any actions with respect to the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz, including participation in the auction. Among other things, Judge Letitia Z. Clark stated the following:\n\n\"... The court is mindful of the need for deference to the judicial determination of another jurisdiction. This is ... of exceptional importance when it involves that of agencies of another sovereign state. However, in the instant case, the [applicant company] has made a showing that it needs a short additional time to hold its shareholder meeting scheduled for December 20, 2004 and may elect to file for bankruptcy under Russian law in order to proceed with a more orderly adjustment of its assets and debts in accordance with Russian law or to continue to seek international arbitration ...\".\n\n253.\n\nThe entities mentioned in the order were (a) the three companies registered to bid at the Auction, including OOO Gazpromneft, ZAO Intercom and OAO First Venture Company, (b) six western financial institutions that had announced their intention to fund OOO Gazpromneft's bid at the auction (ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein) and (c) those persons in active concert or participation with them.\n\n**(d) Outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S.**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nOn 24 February 2005 the U.S. Bankruptcy Court dismissed the applicant company's petition for bankruptcy with reference to section 1112 (b) of U.S. Bankruptcy Code which gave the court discretion to dismiss a case \"in the best interest of the creditors and the estate\".\n\n255.\n\nThe court noted that most of the applicant company's assets were oil and gas within Russia, so that the court's ability to carry out a re-organisation without the cooperation of the Russian government was extremely limited, that the applicant company sought to substitute U.S. law in place of Russian, European Convention and/or international law, that the applicant company had commenced proceedings in other *fora*, including the European Court of Human Rights, and the court did not feel that it was uniquely qualified or more able that these other *fora* to consider the issues presented. Lastly, the court noted that the vast majority of the business and financial activities of the applicant company continued to occur in Russia and that the applicant company was one of the largest producers of petroleum products in Russia. The court held that \"the sheer size of [the applicant company] and its impact on the entirety of the Russian economy weighs heavily in favour of allowing resolution in a forum in which participation of the Russian government is assured\".\n\n*8. Auction of 19 December 2004*\n--------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nOn 19 December 2004 the Property Fund auctioned 76.79% of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz. It appears that media reporters were able to attend the auction.\n\n257.\n\nThere were two participants in the auction, OOO Baykalfinansgrup and OOO Gazpromneft. OOO Baykalfinansgrup, the only bidder in the auction, made two bids, first of USD 8.65 billion and then of RUB 260,753,447,303.18 (USD 9.4 billion or EUR 7.05 billion). It appears that whilst taking part in the auction OOO Gazpromneft was prevented from bidding by the injunction of 16 December 2004 (see paragraph 253 above).\n\n*9. The decisions and reports concerning the outcome of the auction*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nOn 21 December 2004 the Ministry of Justice issued a report accepting that the Property Fund had properly carried out the services due under the contract of 18 November 2004.\n\n259.\n\nOn 21 December 2004 the Property Fund publicly reported the sale of the shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz.\n\n260.\n\nOn 31 December 2004 the bailiffs issued a resolution confirming the results of the auction. The resolution stated that OOO Baykalfinansgrup had won the auction for 43 shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz (76.79% of its stock) for RUB 260,753,447,303.18 (approximately EUR 6,896,341,940 or USD 9,396,960,842). By the time that resolution was issued, the money had already been transferred to the bailiffs.\n\n*10. Takeover of OOO Baykalfinansgrup by OAO Rosneft*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nAccording to press reports of 31 December 2004, OAO Rosneft, a State-owned oil company, acquired OOO Baykalfinansgrup and thus took control of OAO Yuganskneftegas.\n\n262.\n\nIn its consolidated financial statements 2003-2005, dated 15 May 2005,OAO Rosneft declared:\n\n\"... In late December 2004 [OAO Rosneft] acquired a 100% interest in [OOO Baykalfinansgrup], which a few days earlier had won an auction for the sale of a 76.79% interest in [OAO Yuganskneftegaz], which represents 100% of the common shares of [OAO Yuganskneftegaz]. ...\"\n\n*11. Court proceedings in connection with the auction*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nIt appears that on 26 May 2005 the applicant company filed an action in the City Court against the Property Fund, OOO Baykalfinansgrup, OAO Rosneft, OOO Gazpromneft, OAO Gazprom and the Ministry of Justice, seeking to annul the auctioning of 43 shares in OAO Yuganskneftegas and the deed of sale. It also claimed damages in excess of RUB 324 billion.\n\n264.\n\nThe action was examined and dismissed by the City Court on 28 February 2007. The court decided that both the Ministry of Justice and the Property Fund5 had acted within their statutory powers, that the auction procedure had been fully complied with and that the applicant company's allegation about the auction participants acting in concert had been unsupported by any evidence.\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: \"Fund\" has been added.\n\n265.\n\nThe judgment was upheld by the Appeal Court on 30 May and by the Circuit Court on 12 October 2007.\n\n266.\n\nOn 27 January 2005 the applicant company also initiated parallel proceedings against OAO Rosneft, OOO Baykalfinansgrup, Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG London, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas and the Russian Federation before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for violation of the automatic stay.\n\n267.\n\nThe applicant company voluntarily withdrew the entire proceedings on 28 March 2005, after its bankruptcy petition was dismissed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\n\n**F. Bankruptcy proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n268.\n\nIt does not appear that any enforcement measures took place in respect of the applicant company after the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz until September 2005.\n\n269.\n\nOn 8 September 2005 a consortium of foreign banks represented by the French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (\"the banks\") filed an application with the City Court for recognition and enforcement of an English High Court judgment ordering the applicant company to re-pay the contractual debt of USD 482 million (around EUR 385 million), resulting from the applicant company's default under a USD 1 billion loan agreement dated 24 September 2003.\n\n270.\n\nOn 22 September 2005, at the banks' request, the bailiffs again attached the applicant company's property.\n\n271.\n\nIn October 2005 the applicant company challenged this order.\n\n272.\n\nOn 30 November 2005 the City Court dismissed the appeal as groundless.\n\n273.\n\nThe first-instance judgment was upheld by the Appeal Court and by the Circuit Court on 27 February and 12 May 2006 respectively.\n\n274.\n\nIn the meantime, on 28 September 2005, the City Court allowed recognition and enforcement of the English High Court judgment.\n\n275.\n\nOn 5 December 2005 the Circuit Court granted the applicant company's cassation appeal and quashed the judgment of 28 September 2005. It remitted the case for a fresh hearing.\n\n276.\n\nOn 21 December 2005, having re-examined the case, the City Court allowed the banks' claims.\n\n277.\n\nOn 25 January 2006 the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 21 December 2005.\n\n278.\n\nOn 2 March 2006 the Circuit Court dismissed the appeal.\n\n279.\n\nIt appears that on 13 December 2005 the banks reached an agreement with the Rosneft company to sell to the latter the applicant company's debt to the banks.\n\n280.\n\nOn 6 March 2006 the banks lodged a petition with the City Court to declare the applicant company bankrupt.\n\n281.\n\nOn 9 March 2006 bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against the applicant company upon the banks' petition. It appears that the Ministry decided to join the proceedings as one of the bankruptcy creditors in respect of remaining tax debts of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments still owed by the applicant company.\n\n282.\n\nOn 14 March 2006 the banks notified the City Court about the decision to sell the debts owed by the applicant company to Rosneft.\n\n283.\n\nOn 29 March 2006 the City Court substituted Rosneft in the place of the banks as a bankruptcy creditor. By the same decision the court imposed a supervision order on the applicant company and appointed Mr Eduard Rebgun as the applicant company's interim receiver. It also prohibited the company's management from disposing of any of its property exceeding RUB 30 million in value.\n\n284.\n\nOn 6 and 7 April 2006 the applicant company appealed against the decision of 29 March 2006 on all three points.\n\n285.\n\nOn 27 April 2006 the Appeal Court dismissed the appeals.\n\n286.\n\nOn 21 June 2006 the applicant company appealed against the lower courts' decisions to the Circuit Court. The outcome of these proceedings is unclear.\n\n287.\n\nOn 21 April 2006 the Ministry submitted a claim to the City Court, seeking to be included in the list of the applicant company's creditors for the amount of 353,766,625,235.66 RUB (approximately EUR 10,435,809,153), along with 2,118 pages of documentation. The claim was based on the company's reassessed tax liability for the year 2004.\n\n288.\n\nIn June 2006 the City Court made a number of rulings concerning the formation of the list of creditors. In particular, on 1 and 7 June 2006 the City Court held hearings on the claim. On 14 June 2006 the final hearing of the claim was held. The court allowed the claims in its entirety and dismissed the application for stay.\n\n289.\n\nOn 21 June 2006 the City Court delivered a full version of the judgment of 14 June 2006. It decided to include the Ministry in the list of the applicant company's creditors for the amount claimed and refused to stay the proceedings.\n\n290.\n\nOn 3 and 6 July the applicant company appealed against the judgment of 14 June 2006 concerning the allowed claims.\n\n291.\n\nOn 4, 7 and 11 August 2006 the Appeal Court heard the applicant company's arguments.\n\n292.\n\nOn the latter date the Appeal Court dismissed the applicant company's appeal.\n\n293.\n\nIt appears that on 18 August 2006 the Appeal Court delivered a full version of the appeal decision.\n\n294.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 the Committee of Creditors rejected the rehabilitation plan offered by the management and recommended the applicant company's liquidation.\n\n295.\n\nOn 31 July 2006 the applicant company appealed against this decision.\n\n296.\n\nOn 4 August 2006 the City Court examined the applicant company's situation, declared that the company was bankrupt and dismissed its management. The court appointed Mr E. Rebgun as the applicant company's trustee. It also refused the company's request to stay the proceedings.\n\n297.\n\nBoth parties appealed on 15 August 2006\n\n298.\n\nThe judgment was upheld on appeal and entered into force on 26 September 2006.\n\n299.\n\nIt appears that on 22 August 2006 Mr E. Rebgun, acting as the trustee in the company's bankruptcy proceedings, revoked the authority of all counsel appointed by the applicant company's previous management, including Mr P. Gardner.\n\n300.\n\nOn 23 October 2006 Mr E. Rebgun appointed a consortium of independent appraisers led by ZAO Roseko (\"the consortium\"), selected through an open tender, to inventory and evaluate the applicant company's assets with a view to auctioning them.\n\n301.\n\nThe consortium carried out its evaluation from October 2006 to July 2007.\n\n302.\n\nFrom 27 March to 15 August 2007 Mr E. Rebgun held 17 public auctions at which all of the applicant company's assets were sold in line with the evaluations which had been made earlier by the consortium. The aggregate proceeds amounted to over RUB 860 billion (around USD 33.3 billion). The assets sold included a 20% stake in OAO Sibneft (sold, along with 12 fully owned subsidiaries, blocks of shares in 5 more entities and some exchange notes, for RUB 151.536 billion, or some EUR 4.387 billion), 9.44% of shares of OAO Rosneft (sold, along with 12 exchange notes of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, for RUB 197.840 billion, or some EUR 5.728 billion) and scores of the company's subsidiary companies.\n\n303.\n\nBy a decision of 12 November 2007, the full version of which was produced on 15 November, the City Court examined the applicant company's situation, heard the report by Mr E. Rebgun and decided to terminate the liquidation proceedings. The applicant company ceased to exist, leaving over RUB 227.1 billion (around USD 9.2 billion) in unsatisfied liabilities.\n\n304.\n\nOn 21 November 2007 a certificate was issued to the effect that the applicant company had been liquidated on the basis of the court decision.\n\n305.\n\nIt appears that a company Glendale Group Limited and Yukos Capital S.A.R.L. contested the decision of 12 November 2007 before the Appeal Court. The appeal of Glendale Group was declared inadmissible for the failure to submit it on time, whilst the appeal of Yukos Capital S.A.R.L. has been accepted for examination. The hearing in this respect was scheduled by the Appeal Court on 19 November 2007.\n\n306.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings remains unclear.\n\nII. RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A. Tax liability**\n--------------------\n\n*1. General provisions*\n-----------------------\n\n307.\n\nUnder Article 57 of the Constitution of Russia, everyone is liable to pay taxes and duties established by law.\n\n308.\n\nArticle 44 of the Tax Code of 31 July 1998 no. 146-FZ (as in force at the relevant time) states that an obligation to pay a tax or a duty arises, alters or ceases in accordance with that Code and other legislative acts on taxes and fees.\n\n309.\n\nArticles 45 and 80 of the Tax Code provide that, as a general rule, taxpayers must comply with their obligation to pay a tax on their own initiative, and define a tax declaration as the written statement by taxpayers on their revenues and expenses, sources of revenue, tax benefits and the calculated sum of the tax, as well as other data related to calculation and payment of the tax.\n\n310.\n\nUnder Article 45, in the event of non-payment or incomplete payment of the tax in due time, the tax authorities may levy the tax liability directly from the taxpayer's bank account.\n\n311.\n\nArticle 11 (2) of the Tax Code defines a branch of an organisation as a geographically separate department, with stable employment posts.\n\n*2. Tax inspections*\n--------------------\n\n312.\n\nUnder Articles 82 and 87 of the Tax Code, the tax authorities may carry out documentary and on-site tax inspections of taxpayers. Such inspections may cover only the three calendar years of the taxpayer's activity directly preceding the year of inspection. In exceptional cases the authorities are allowed to carry out repeated on-site tax inspections. Such cases include, among other things, on-site inspections conducted by way of supervision of the activities of the tax authority that conducted the initial audit (Article 87 (3) of the Code).\n\n313.\n\nArticle 101 (4) 2 of the Tax Code states that the tax authority may use as evidence during its inspections documents earlier demanded by the authority from a taxpayer, documents submitted or obtained during documentary and on-site tax inspections of that taxpayer as well as other documents in the possession of the authority.\n\n314.\n\nUnder Article 100 (5) of the Tax Code a taxpayer has two months to file a detailed reply to the report drawn up by the tax authorities on the outcome of the tax inspection.\n\n315.\n\nUnder Article 81 of the Tax Code, a taxpayer may not be fined in respect of any errors if, prior to commencement of the on-site tax inspection for the relevant year, it files amended tax returns and voluntarily satisfies the related tax liabilities, including default interest.\n\n316.\n\nBy order no. BG-3-29/159 dated 2 April 2003 the Tax Ministry decided that the period for performance of the demand to pay tax addressed to a taxpayer may not exceed ten calendar days from the date of its receipt by the taxpayer.\n\n317.\n\nThe Government relied on the following cases as examples of typical terms given to taxpayers for voluntary payment of reassessed taxes and surcharges:\n\n**(a) Case no. A82-11/2003-A/6**\n--------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nOn 13 November 2000 the Tax Ministry demanded that respondent OAO Slavneft-YANOS pay reassessed taxes and interest surcharges amounting to over RUB 53 million within one day. The court decisions in the case were taken on 11 June 2003, 7 October 2003 and 19 January 2004.\n\n**(b) Case no. A33-16983/01-S3a-F02-1826/02-S1**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nOn 31 May 2001 the Tax Ministry ordered the Municipal Housing and Utilities Infrastructure of the Kansk District to pay reassessed taxes in the amount of RUB 814,581.54 within one day. The first judgment of 9 April 2002 was upheld by the cassation instance on 16 July 2002.\n\n**(c) Case no. F04/1724-594/A27-2004**\n--------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nOn 23 January 2003 the Tax Ministry ordered FGUP PO Progress to pay reassessed taxes in the amount of RUB 72,827,208 within one day. The court decisions were taken on 4 September, 16 December 2003 and 5 April 2004 respectively.\n\n**(d) Case no. A26-8688/03-26**\n-------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nOn seven occasions in 2003 the Tax Ministry ordered OOO Krasnaya Rybka to pay reassessed taxes and interest surcharges in the overall amount of RUB 760,043.19 within one day. The first-instance judgment in the case, dated 13 February 2004, was upheld by a cassation decision of 16 June 2004.\n\n**(f) Case no. F04-2648/2005(10969-A61-37)**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nOn 25 August 2004 the Tax Ministry ordered OOO YamalGIS-Servis to pay reassessed taxes in the amount of RUB 268,083 on the same day. The court decisions upholding the demand were taken on 9 December 2004, 24 February and 4 May 2005.\n\n**B. Applicable taxes**\n-----------------------\n\n*1. General provisions*\n-----------------------\n\n323.\n\nArticle 38 of the Tax Code provides that objects of taxation may be operations involving the retailing of goods, works and services, property, profit, income, value of retailed goods, works and services or other objects having cost, quantitative or physical parameters on the existence of which the tax legislation bases the obligation to pay tax.\n\n324.\n\nArticle 39 of the Code defines retailing of goods, works and services as, *inter alia*, the transfer (including exchange of services, works and goods) in return for compensation of property rights in respect of goods and results of works from one person to another, as well as the rendering of services from one person to another in exchange for compensation.\n\n325.\n\nArticle 41 of the Code defines profits as economic gains in monetary form or in kind.\n\n*2. Value-added tax*\n--------------------\n\n**(a) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nSection 3 of RF Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On Value-Added Tax\" (as in force at the relevant time) subjects to VAT, among other things, the turnover generated by the retailing of goods, works and services on the territory of Russia, the rates of which range between 10% and 20%. Under section 5 of the Law, exported goods are exempt from payment of the tax. The exemption becomes effective only if the taxpayer properly justifies the claim. Until these documents are filed, the tax remains payable under the non-export rate.\n\n327.\n\nLetter no. B3-8-05/848, 04-03-08 of the State Tax Service of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, dated 21 December 1995, stated that taxpayers were to file the following documents to justify this tax exemption: a contract concluded between the legal personality taxpayer registered in Russia with its foreign partner, proof of payment in respect of the goods, and a customs declaration bearing the appropriate stamp of the customs body, confirming the export of goods from the customs territory of Russia.\n\n**(b) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nIn respect of VAT, the applicable tax rate is 0% if the traded goods are placed in an \"export\" customs regime and physically removed from the customs territory of the Russian Federation (Article 164 (1) of the Tax Code). In addition, the taxpayer may claim a refund of the \"incoming\" VAT already paid in respect of the exported goods.\n\n329.\n\nFor the zero rate to become effective and in order to claim the VAT refund, it is necessary to justify the claim by filing the following documents with the tax authorities (Article 165 of the Tax Code): the export contract concluded between the taxpayer and the foreign buyer, a bank statement confirming receipt of funds from the foreign buyer by a Russian bank duly registered with the tax authorities, a relevant customs declaration bearing the stamp of the customs bodies confirming the export of the goods from the customs territory of Russia, and copies of relevant transport bills and shipping documents, bearing the stamps of the customs bodies, confirming the export of goods from the customs territory of Russia.\n\n330.\n\nOn 14 July 2003 the Constitutional Court issued ruling no. 12-P, in which it essentially upheld the constitutionality of Article 165 of the Code. The court distinguished between documents required by public-law norms, such as the taxpayer's customs declaration bearing the relevant stamps from the customs bodies, and which are mandatory in all cases, and other documents such as contracts, transport bills etc. In view of the different practices of the economic actors, which made the latter type of documents mutually replaceable, the authorities were constitutionally permitted to require a taxpayer to file these documents, but without an excessive degree of formalism.\n\n331.\n\nThe relevant documents are to be filed with the competent tax authority within 180 days from the date of the customs clearance of the goods in question (Article 165 (9) of the Tax Code). Until these documents are filed, the tax remains payable under the non-export rate. A taxpayer is not precluded from filing the documents in question even after the expiry of the time-limit in question (Article 176 of the Tax Code).\n\n332.\n\nBy a decision of 28 April 2003 (case no. F09-1159/03-AK) in the case of ZAO Aktsionernaya neftyanaya kompaniya v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural District, acting as a cassation review court, rejected the company's claims for VAT refunds with reference to its failure to satisfy the requirements of Article 165 of the Code. The company could not prove the fact of actual payment for the allegedly exported goods.\n\n333.\n\nBy a decision of 17 February 2004 (case no. F09-187/04-AK) in the case of OOO Firma Galaktika v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural District, acting as a cassation review court, rejected the company's claims for VAT refunds with reference to its failure to satisfy the requirements of Article 165 of the Code. The company failed to submit a proper bank statement confirming receipt of funds from the foreign buyer.\n\n334.\n\nBy a decision of 3 May 2005 (case no. A56-31805/04) in the case of ZAO Stroitelnyy trest no. 28 v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North Western District examined the decisions of lower courts whereby the company had been refused VAT refunds at first instance (by a judgment of 11 October 2004 \u2013 the company failed to submit the properly stamped customs declaration confirming the actual export of the goods) and had subsequently been granted them on appeal (by a decision of 21 January 2005 \u2013 the appeal court decided that the fact of the actual export had been established by a final court decision in a related court dispute). The cassation court quashed the appeal decision, having noted that the requirements set out in Article 165 of the Code were strict and unequivocal and that the law did not allow for any replacement of the customs declaration by other means of proof.\n\n335.\n\nBy a decision of 9 March 2005 (case no. F09-563/05-AK) in the case of OAO Kachkanarskiy gorno-obogatitelnyy kombinat Vanadiy v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural District quashed the decisions of lower courts whereby the company had been granted VAT refunds. The cassation court noted that the requirements set out in Article 165 of the Code were strict and unambiguous and that the law required the taxpayer to prove the actual export solely by means of the properly stamped customs declaration, which had not been done by the company in the present case. Accordingly, the court rejected the company's claims.\n\n336.\n\nBy a decision of 27 September 2005 (case no. F09-4252/05-C2) in the case of OAO Nauchno-proizvodstvennyy centr vysokotochnoy tekhniki Izhmash v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural District, acting as a cassation review court, rejected the company's claims for VAT refunds with reference to its failure to satisfy the requirements of Article 165 of the Code in a timely manner, that is, within six months.\n\n*3. Motorway fund tax*\n----------------------\n\n337.\n\nSection 5 (2) of RF Law no. 1759-1 of 18 October 1991 \"On motorway funds in the Russian Federation\" provides for a 1% motorway users' tax from the turnover of the retail of goods, works and services, payable by all motorway users. Section 4 also makes subject to a 25% tax the turnover (excluding VAT) of companies trading in fuels and lubricants.\n\n338.\n\nThis tax was abolished from 1 January 2003.\n\n*4. Tax for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-cultural facilities*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nSection 21 (\"Ch\") of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the foundations of the tax system\" imposes a tax of up to 1.5% for the maintenance of the housing stock and socio-economic facilities.\n\n340.\n\nThis tax was abolished with the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001.\n\n*5. Corporate property tax*\n---------------------------\n\n**(a) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nSection 2 (1-2) of RF Law no. 2030-1 of 13 December 1991 \"On corporate property tax\" provided for a tax of up to 2% in respect of organisations' property.\n\n**(b) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nChapter 30 of the Tax Code provides for a tax of up to 2.2% in respect of organisations' property. The exact rate is defined by the regional authorities.\n\n*6. Profit tax*\n---------------\n\n**(a) Before the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nLaw no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On profit tax on enterprises and organisations\" (sections 2 and 5) provided for a profit tax, the rate of which could vary depending on the type of taxable activity and the rate fixed by the local authorities. The mandatory rate to be transferred to the Federal budget was 11%.\n\n**(b) After the entry into force of the Second Part of the Tax Code on 1 January 2001**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nChapter 25 of the Tax Code provides for a profit tax of up to 24% (6.5% to be transferred to the Federal budget and the rest to the regional budget).\n\n*7. Advertising tax*\n--------------------\n\n345.\n\nSection 21 (1) \"z\" of RF Law no. 2118-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On the foundations of the tax system\" imposed a tax in respect of the cost of advertisement services.\n\n346.\n\nThis tax was abolished from 1 January 2005.\n\n**C. Tax advantages**\n---------------------\n\n*1. General provisions*\n-----------------------\n\n347.\n\nArticle 56 of the Tax Code defines a tax benefit as a full or partial exemption from the payment of taxes, granted by the tax legislation.\n\n348.\n\nIn letter no. 04/06/08, dated 21 October 1998, the Ministry of Finance noted, *inter alia*:\n\n\"...[that] experience in creating and operating free economic zones in the Russian Federation, established pursuant to both federal laws (the special economic zone in the Kaliningrad region) and resolutions of the authorities of constituent entities of the Federation (Kalmykiya, Tuva), [has] demonstrate[d] that the creation of such zones across such vast areas in the absence of a proper analysis of investment projects leads to abuses of the tax and customs incentives granted and, accordingly, to serious losses suffered by the federal and local budgets, as reported by the Ministry of Finance of Russia to the Government of Russia on multiple occasions.\"\n\n*2. Requirements relating to the registration of taxpayers*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nUnder Article 83 (1) of the Tax Code, taxpayers which are legal entities are required to register with the tax authorities at their headquarters (location of their executive bodies), at the location of their branches and at the location of any real estate and places where vehicles belonging to them are registered.\n\n350.\n\nSpecial registration rules applied in respect of large taxpayers, including the applicant company.\n\n351.\n\nBy Decree no. \u0410\u041f-3-10/399 of the Tax Ministry, dated 15 December 1999, such taxpayers are required to register at their main location, at the location of their branches and at the location of real estate and places where vehicles belonging to them are registered, and in certain specific tax offices (inter-district level or as specifically indicated by the Ministry).\n\n352.\n\nAnnex 3 to the Decree contains the form \"On subsidiary and dependant companies and subsidiary enterprises\", to be filled in by the taxpayer. During registration the taxpayer is required to indicate all of its subsidiary and dependant companies.\n\n353.\n\nIn respect of domestic off-shore territories, according to commentators, this requirement means that in practice the taxpayer's executive body should always be physically located and functioning on the territory of the off-shore. If the taxpayer fails to comply with the requirement, the tax authorities could declare its registration void with the subsequent recovery of the entirety of the perceived tax benefits (see A.V. Bryzgalin, *Practical Tax Encyclopaedia,* Moscow, 2003-2006, Chapter 3 \"Methodology of tax optimisation\").\n\n*3. Closed administrative-territorial formations (the town of Sarov in the Nizhniy Novgorod Region, the town of Trekhgornyy in the Chelyabinsk Region and the town of Lesnoy in the Sverdlovsk Region)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Legal provisions**\n------------------------\n\n354.\n\nUnder section 5 of Law no. 3297-1 of the Russian Federation \"On closed administrative-territorial formations\", tax concessions are provided to businesses if, *inter alia*, they have at least 90% of their fixed assets and conduct at least 70% of their activities on the territory of the respective formation (including a requirement that at least 70% of their employees be made up of persons permanently residing in the ZATO in question, and that at least 70% of their wage bill be paid to employees permanently residing in that territory).\n\n355.\n\nLetter no. A\u041f-6-01/505 of the Tax Ministry, dated 24 June 1999, contained Methodological Directions to the tax bodies on issues concerning the lawfulness of the use of additional tax benefits granted by local authorities in the closed administrative-territorial formations. It stated that the tax authorities ought to verify the actual presence of the taxpayer's assets on the territory in question by checking its accounting records and financial statements, and by confirming the physical location of the organisation at the indicated address and the fact of genuine performance by the taxpayer's employees at the taxpayer's registered location.\n\n**(b) Case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 (The Tax Ministry v. OOO Pribrezhnoe), referred to by the applicant company**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe respondent legal entity was OOO Pribrezhnoe, registered in the closed administrative territorial formation town of Snezhnogorsk, which has a privileged tax regime. The Ministry tried unsuccessfully to contest the use of tax concessions by the respondent, by demonstrating that the entity had not been actually present at the place of its registration. The domestic court found for the respondent. They established that the entity had some assets on the territory of Snezhnogorsk, a number of permanent employees (including a lawyer and the cleaning lady), and a cash account in the local bank, which proved that the entity satisfied the criteria provided for in law.\n\n357.\n\nThe final decision in the case was taken by the Court of Cassation on 5 June 2002.\n\n*4. The Republic of Mordoviya*\n------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nUnder Law no. 9-FZ of the Republic of Mordoviya of 9 March 1999 \"On the conditions of efficient use of the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya\", tax concessions are granted to taxpayers whose entities were established after the entry into force of that law and whose activities meet certain conditions, including but not limited to the following:\n\n(a) they conduct export operations, the quarterly proceeds from which account for at least 15%of the business's total earnings;\n\n(b) they engage in wholesale trade in fuel and lubricants and other types of hydrocarbon raw materials, the quarterly proceeds from which account for at least 70% of the business' total earnings.\n\n359.\n\nSection 1 of the Law states that \"this Law establishes concessions with the objective of creating favourable conditions for attracting capital into the territory of the Republic of Mordoviya, strengthening the socio-economic potential of the Republic of Mordoviya, developing the securities market and creating new jobs through special arrangements for the taxation of organisations\".\n\n*5. The Republic of Kalmykiya*\n------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nLaw no. 12-P-3 of the Republic of Kalmykiya of 12 March 1999 \"On tax concessions for companies investing in the Republic of Kalmykiya\" provides tax concessions to those who meet the following criteria:\n\n(a) the taxpayer is not a user of mineral resources in the territory of the Republic;\n\n(b) the taxpayer is registered with the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic of Kalmykiya as an enterprise investing in the economy of the Republic;\n\n(c) the enterprise's investment in the economy of the Republic meets the criteria established by the Ministry of Investment Policy of the Republic in accordance with this law.\n\n361.\n\nBy a decision of 16 April 2002 (case no. F08-1134/2002-402) in the case of OOO Simpleks v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n362.\n\nBy a decision dated 29 April 2002 (case no. F08-1368/2002-506A) in the case of OOO Impuls v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n363.\n\nBy a decision of 20 May 2002 (case no. F08-1678/2002-614A) in the case of OOO Sibirskaya transportnaya kompaniya (one of the sham entities belonging to the applicant company) v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District ruled as follows:\n\n\"[b]ased on the content and meaning of the [above-mentioned] law and Resolution no. 7 of the Elista Town Administration, [the purpose of the municipal legislation] is to attract funds from various investors for development of the regional and local economies, given the lack of funds in the regional and local budgets and the need for their replenishment to ensure the activities of the Kalmyk Republic and the town of Elista ...\n\nThe case documents show that RUB 27,196 came from the plaintiff for development of the regional and local economies, whereas RUB 6,918,617 did not enter the regional and local budgets directly. Thus, the investments made by [OOO Sibirskaya transkportnaya kompaniya] amount to 0.4% of the amount of taxes that would otherwise have been payable by it. They have no effect on the development of the economy [and] do not cover the budgetary losses related to the granting of incentives to taxpayers; on the contrary, they have consequences in the form of unfair enrichment at the expense of budgetary funds. Thus, given that the amount of the investments made by the plaintiff is incommensurate to the amount of incentives used, the plaintiff abused its right, that is, it acted in bad faith\".\n\nAccordingly, the court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had complied with the above-mentioned conditions and whether it had acted in good faith.\n\n364.\n\nBy a decision of 28 May 2002 (case no. F08-1793/2002) in the case of ZAO Telekom Zapad Komplekt v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District ruled that:\n\n\"[b]ased on the meaning and contents of the [above-mentioned] law and Resolution no. 7 of the Elista Town Administration, it follows that [the purpose of the municipal legislation] is to attract funds from various investors for development of the regional and local economies, given the lack of funds in the regional and local budgets and the need for their replenishment to ensure the activities of the Kalmyk Republic and the town of Elista...\n\n... [the court has to examine] the proportion between the investments made by the [taxpayer] and the amount of tax that did not enter the budget [in order] to resolve the issue of the plaintiff's good faith and its abuse of its rights\".\n\nAccordingly, the court quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had complied with the above-mentioned conditions and had acted in good faith.\n\n365.\n\nBy a decision of 4 June 2002 (case no. F08-1864/2002-697A) in the case of ZAO Promyshlennaya korporaciya Shar v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n366.\n\nBy a decision of 5 August 2002 (case no. F08-2762/2002-1009A) in the case of OOO Promet v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n367.\n\nBy a decision of 13 August 2002 (case no. F08-2892/2002-1051A) in the case of OOO TD Dion v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n368.\n\nBy a decision of 29 August 2002 (case no. F08-3158/2002-1140A) in the case of ZAO Stanford v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n369.\n\nBy a decision of 20 February 2003 (cases nos. F08-270/2003-91A and F08-1679/2002-622A) in a dispute between the Tax Ministry and OOO \"Vostochnaya perestrakhovochnaya kompaniya\", the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian Circuit found as follows:\n\n\"The investments made by the [taxpayer] amount to 0.14% of the amount of taxes that would otherwise have been payable by it. They have no effect on the development of the economy... but ... their effect is unfair enrichment .... Therefore, [as] the amount of investments by [the taxpayer] was incommensurate to the amount of the benefits received, [the taxpayer] abused its right, that is, it acted in bad faith\"\n\n370.\n\nBy a decision of 20 February 2003 (case no. F08-268/2003-98A) in the case of OOO Bazis Sekyuritis v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n371.\n\nBy a decision of 8 April 2003 (case no. F08-1013/2003-383A) in the case of OOO Gravite v. the Tax Ministry, the Federal Commercial Court of the North-Caucasian District quashed the decisions of the lower courts and instructed them to investigate further whether the taxpayer had indeed complied with the conditions mentioned in the law, had acted in good faith in this respect and had indeed made any investments in the local economy.\n\n*6. The Evenk Autonomous District*\n----------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nUnder section 9 of Law no. 108 of the Evenk Autonomous District \"On specific features of the tax system in the Evenk Autonomous District\" of 24 September 1998, substantially lower tax rates apply to local businesses whose activities meet certain conditions with regard to the special taxation procedure set out in section 8 of that Law.\n\n**D. The use and interpretation of terms of civil legislation in tax disputes**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nUnder Article 11 of the Tax Code, the institutions, notions and terms of the civil legislation of Russia used in the Tax Code keep their respective meanings, unless specifically stated.\n\n**E. General principles governing the status of legal entities**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. Presumption of independence*\n--------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nUnder Article 2 of Civil Code of 30 November 1994 no. 51-FZ (as in force at the relevant time), the legal status of parties involved in civil-law transactions, the grounds for the creation of ownership and other property rights and the order of exercising those rights are defined by the civil legislation, which also regulates contractual and other obligations.\n\n375.\n\nThe civil legislation regulates the relations between persons engaged in business activities or in those activities performed with their participation, on the assumption that business activity is an independent activity performed at one's own risk and aimed at systematically deriving a profit from the use of property, the sale of commodities, the performance of work or the rendering of services by those persons registered in this capacity in conformity with the legally-established procedure.\n\n376.\n\nIt is formally prohibited to make any unilateral property transfers (gifts, grants or gratuitous loans) between independent commercial legal entities (Articles 575 and 690 of the Civil Code). Unilateral property transfers are permitted by Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code and not counted for the purposes of profit tax if they are made between associated entities, where one of them holds more than 50% of shares in the equity of the other entity.\n\n*2. Rules applicable to subsidiary and dependant companies*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nArticle 105 of the Civil Code provides that a subsidiary company is one controlled by another company, either through ownership of the subsidiary company's shares, by virtue of a contract or by any other means.\n\n378.\n\nThe controlling company is jointly responsible for debts incurred by the subsidiary company as a result of compliance with the controlling company's instructions. The controlling company may be held vicariously responsible for a debt of the subsidiary company in the event of the latter's insolvency.\n\n379.\n\nArticle 106 of the Code provides that a company is dependant when the other company owns over 20% of the first company's voting stock. A company which purchases over 20% of the voting shares in other companies is obliged to make this information public.\n\n380.\n\nSimilar rules are established in respect of limited liability companies (*\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432a \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e*) by section 6 of Law no. 14-FZ on limited liability companies of 8 February 1998.\n\n**F. Definition of a property owner**\n-------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nArticle 209 of the Civil Code defines an owner as the person who has the rights of possession, use and disposal of his property. In respect of this property, the owner is entitled, at his will, to perform any actions not contradicting the law and the other legal acts, and not violating the rights and legally protected interests of other persons.\n\n**G. Contractual freedom and its limits**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*1. Presumption of good faith and prohibition on abuse of rights*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nArticles 9 and 10 of the Civil Code provide that the parties involved in civil-law transactions are free to act contractually within the limits defined by law.\n\n383.\n\nArticle 10 (1 and 2) of the Code states specifically that parties involved in civil-law transactions are prohibited from abusing their rights. In such cases, the courts may deny legal protection in respect of the right which is being abused. Article 10 (3) establishes a refutable presumption of good faith and reasonableness of actions on the parties in civil-law transactions.\n\n*2. Examples of the case-law of the domestic courts concerning the notion of bad faith*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nIn its decision no. 24-P dated 12 October 1998, the Constitutional Court of Russia for the first time made use and interpreted the notion of \"bad/good faith\" to assess the legal consequence of the conduct of taxpayers in its jurisprudence. In this case this was done to define the moment at which a taxpayer can be said to have discharged his or her constitutional obligation to pay taxes.\n\n385.\n\nIn its decision no. 138-O dated 25 July 2001, the Constitutional Court of Russia again confirmed that there existed a refutable presumption that the taxpayer was acting in good faith and that a finding that a taxpayer had acted in bad faith could have unfavourable legal consequences for the taxpayer. The case again concerned the definition of a moment at which a taxpayer can be said to have discharged his or her constitutional obligation to pay taxes.\n\n386.\n\nThe domestic commercial courts applied this approach in a number of cases concerning the eligibility of taxpayers to tax concessions in the Republic of Kalmykiya, such as decision no. F08-1134/2002-402 of 16 April 2002 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-1864/2002-697A of 4 June 2002 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-2762/2002-1009A of 5 August 2002 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-2892/02-1015A of 12 August 2002 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-3158/2002-1140A of 29 August 2002 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-268/2003-98A of 20 February 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, decision no. F08-1013/2003-383A of 8 April 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit.\n\n387.\n\nIn its decision no. 168-O of 8 April 2004 the Constitutional Court noted that it would be inadmissible for bad-faith taxpayers to manipulate the legal civil-law institutions to create and operate schemes for unlawful enrichment at the expense of the State budget. The case concerned the use of exchange notes in the sphere of VAT refunds.\n\n*3. Rules governing sham transactions*\n--------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Statutory law**\n---------------------\n\n388.\n\nUnder Article 153 of the Civil Code, transactions are defined as activities of natural and legal persons creating, altering and terminating their civil rights and obligations.\n\n389.\n\nArticle 166 of the Civil Code states that a transaction may be declared invalid on the grounds established by that Code, either by force of its being recognized as such by the court (a voidable transaction, *\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*), or regardless of such recognition (a void transaction, *\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*).\n\n390.\n\nUnder Article 167 of the Civil Code, void transactions entail no legal consequences, apart from those relating to their invalidity, and are invalid from the moment they are conducted.\n\n391.\n\nArticle 170 (2) establishes specific rules in respect of two types of void transactions: 'imaginary' transactions (\"*\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*\", effected only for form's sake, without the intention to create the corresponding legal consequences) and 'sham' transactions (\"*\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0430*\", which are effected for the purpose of screening other transactions). This provision condemns both imaginary and sham transactions as void.\n\n392.\n\nIt also provides that in the event of sham transactions, the rules governing the transaction that was in fact intended by the parties may be applied by a court, regard being had to the substance of this transaction (the so-called \"substance over form\" rule).\n\n393.\n\nUnder Article 45 (2) 3 of the Tax Code the power to re-characterise transactions by a taxpayer with third parties, their legal status and the nature of the taxpayer's activity in tax disputes lies with the courts (as opposed to executive bodies). Section 7 of Law no. 943-1 of 21 March 1991 \"On Tax Authorities in the Russian Federation\" vests the power to contest such transactions and recover everything received in such transactions with the State budget.\n\n**(b) Academic sources**\n------------------------\n\n394.\n\nComments on the Civil Code (O.N. Sadikov, *Comments on the Civil Code*, Yuridicheskaya firma Kontrakt Infra-M, Moscow, 1998) states, with reference to Bulletin no. 11 of the Supreme Court of RSFSR (page 2), that any evidence admitted by the rules on civil procedure may also serve as proof of the invalidity of sham transactions.\n\n**H. General rules on price formation and the price adjustment mechanism**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nArticle 40 (1) of the Tax Code requires that the parties trade at market prices. It also establishes a refutable presumption that the prices agreed to by the parties correspond to market levels and are used for taxation purposes.\n\n**I. Price adjustment mechanism of the Tax Code**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nUnder Article 40 (2) of the Tax Code, the tax authorities are empowered to overrule the above presumption by verifying and correcting the prices for taxation purposes. A finding that the prices were lowered usually leads to the conclusion that the taxpayer understated the taxable base and thus failed properly to pay his taxes (see Article 122 of the Tax Code below).\n\n397.\n\nThis may happen only (1) when the parties are interdependent within the meaning of Article 20 of the Tax Code; (2) in the event of barter transactions, or; (3) international transactions; (4) when the prices set by a taxpayer during the same short period for certain identical types of goods, work or services fluctuate by more than 20%.\n\n398.\n\nArticle 20 (1) of the Tax Code defines interdependent parties as natural persons and (or) organisations whose mutual relations may influence the terms or economic results of their respective activities or the activities of the parties that they represent. In particular, (a) one organisation has a direct and (or) indirect interest in another organisation, and the aggregate share of such interest is more than 20%. The share accounted for by the indirect interest held by one organisation in another, through a chain of separate organisations, is defined as the product of the direct interest shares that the organisations in this chain hold in one another; (b) one natural person is subordinate to another natural person *ex officio*; (c) in the case of individuals, they are spouses, relatives, adopters or adoptees, guardians or wards under the family law of the Russian Federation.\n\n399.\n\nArticle 20 (2) of the Tax Code provides that the court may recognize persons as interdependent on other grounds, not provided for by Item 1 of that Article, if the relations between these persons may have influenced the results of transactions in the sale of goods (work, services).\n\n**J. Applicable tax offences and related penalties**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nArticle 122 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Tax Code imposes a penalty of 40% of the unpaid tax liability on intentional non-payment or incomplete payment of the tax due, as a result of understating the taxable base. Articles 112 \u00a7 2 and 114 \u00a7 4 of the Tax Code provide for a 100% increase in this penalty in the event of a repeated offence by the same taxpayer. Article 114 \u00a7 3 of the Code also provides for a possibility of reducing the fine by half if there were extenuating circumstances on the facts of the case.\n\n401.\n\nArticle 114 \u00a7 7 of the Code makes it mandatory to recover the penalties in court. This rule does not apply to reassessed fines and interest surcharges.\n\n402.\n\nArticle 75 of the Tax Code provides for payment of an interest surcharge by taxpayers in cases of late payment of the taxes due. The interest surcharge amounts to one three-hundredth of the statutory rate for each day of the delay. Persons and entities that were unable to meet their tax liabilities in due time because their bank account was suspended by the tax authority or a court are excused from payment of the interest surcharge for the duration of the respective suspension (Article 75 \u00a7 3 of the Tax Code).\n\n**K. Statutory time-bar**\n-------------------------\n\n*1. Situation prior to the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Statutory law**\n---------------------\n\n403.\n\nIn accordance with Article 113 \u00a7 1 of the Tax Code (Chapter 15 General provisions concerning liability for tax offences), a person could not be held liable for a tax offence under Article 122 of the Code if three years had expired since the first day after the end of the tax period during which the offence was committed. The above provision only applied to the payment of fines. Article 115 of the Code sets out an additional six-month time-limit within which the authorities must collect the fines. It starts running from the date of adoption of the relevant audit report.\n\n404.\n\nAs regards the reassessed taxes and interest surcharges, Article 87 of the Tax Code (as in force as the relevant time) limited the ability of the authorities to carry out tax inspections by stating that \"the[y] ... [may] only be carried out in respect of the activities of the relevant taxpayer ... during the three calendar years immediately preceding the year of the tax inspection\" (see also decision no. 3803/01 of the Supreme Commercial Court below).\n\n**(b) Practice directions by the Supreme Commercial Court**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nIn paragraph 36 of Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court no. 5 dated 28 February 2001 \"On certain issues arising from application of the first part of the Tax Code\", the court indicated to the lower courts that \"a taxpayer is considered to have been held liable [within the meaning of Article 113 of the Tax Code] on the date on which the head of the [relevant] tax body or his deputy takes a decision to hold this person liable of a tax offence in accordance with [the rules set out in] the Code\".\n\n406.\n\nThis interpretation was subsequently used by the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court in its decision no. 3803/01 (Averyanov v. the Tax Ministry), taken in 2002, where an offence had been committed in 1996, whilst the time-limit began to run on 1 January 1997 and expired on 1 January 2000. The Ministry's decision was issued on 25 January 2000 and was, accordingly, time-barred in so far as the fines were concerned.\n\n**(c) Case no. F09-3155/05-AK (OAO Bashselstroy v. the Tax Ministry)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural Circuit reviewed and quashed the lower courts' decisions in a tax dispute involving the Tax Ministry and a private shareholding. Among other things, the Circuit Court stated that the time-limit set out in Article 113 of the Code started running from the date on which the relevant facts came to the attention of the competent authorities (as a result of a tax inspection or other types of tax control).\n\n**(d) Cases referred to by the applicant company**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nIn a number of cases pre-dating the decision of the Constitutional Court of 14 July 2005, the courts applied Article 113 in line with an interpretation given by Resolution no. 5 of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court of 28 February 2001 (see decision no. F04/7-1527/A27-2002 of 4 January 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Western Siberia Circuit, decision no. F04/7-1527/A27-2002 of 8 January 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Northern Western Circuit, decision no. F03-A59/03-2/745 of 23 April 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Far-Eastern Circuit, decision no. A48-1188/03-2 of 12 November 2003 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Central Circuit, decision no. A82-471/2004-8 of 8 October 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Volgo-Vyatskyy Circuit, decision no. F03-A73/04-2/947 of 19 May 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Far Eastern Circuit, decision no. A19-3142/04-40-F02-3338/04-C1 of 24 August 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Eastern Siberia Circuit, decision no. A19-9731/03-15-F02-4732/03-C1 of 9 January 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Eastern Siberia Circuit, decision no. A33-15117/03-C3-F02-1877/04-C1 of 2 June 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Eastern Siberia Circuit, decision no. KA-A41/9494-04 of 20 October 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit, decision no. F09-4221/04AK of 13 October 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural Circuit, and decision no. F09-3799/04AK of 4 September 2004 of the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural Circuit). None of these cases involved a situation whereby a taxpayer had hindered a tax inspection or had deliberately sought to delay the tax proceedings.\n\n*2. Situation after the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Case no. KA-A40/5876-06 (OAO Korus-holding v. the Tax Ministry)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nBy a decision of 28 July 2006 the Federal Commercial Court of the Moscow Circuit, acting as a cassation review instance, reviewed the application of the time-limits of Article 113 of the Code. The audit report prepared by the Ministry in respect of the calendar year 2001 was dated 28 February, whilst the decision to hold the taxpayer liable was issued on 29 March 2005. The Circuit Court decided that the authorities could be said to have been acting in time provided that they respected the requirements of Article 87 of the Code, which sets out a three-year time-limit for conducting tax inspections and Article 23 \u00a7 8 (1) of the Code, which sets out a four-year time-limit for the maintenance of accounting documents. The Circuit Court also specifically noted the actions of OAO Korus-holding, which had sought to hinder and complicate the tax inspection.\n\n**(b) 2006 amendments to Article 113 of the Tax Code**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe text of Article 113 has been amended by Federal Law no. 137-FZ of 27 July 2006, which came into force on 1 January 2007. The provision now contains \u00a7 1.1., which states:\n\n\"1.1. The running of the time-limit for holding a taxpayer liable stops if [the taxpayer] actively hindered an on-site tax inspection, thus creating an insurmountable obstacle for that inspection and for the determination by the tax authorities of the amount of taxes due to the budgetary system of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe running of the time-limit [in question] is suspended on the date of adoption of a report [setting out the circumstances in which the taxpayer denied the tax authorities access to the relevant documents]. In this case, the running of the time-limit continues on the date when the above-mentioned circumstances no longer exist and a decision on continuation of the on-site tax inspection is taken.\"\n\n**(c) Case no. F08-2786/2007-1290A (the Tax Ministry v. N. A. Borshcheva)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nOn 31 May 2007 the Federal Commercial Court of the North Caucasian Circuit, acting as a cassation review instance, reviewed the application of the time-limits of Article 113 of the Code. The audit report prepared by the Ministry in respect of the calendar years 2001-2004 was dated 18 July 2006, whilst the decision to hold the taxpayer liable was issued on 4 September 2006. Again, the Circuit Court decided that the authorities had been acting in time, regard being had to the taxpayer's actions for the purpose of delaying and hindering the tax inspection.\n\n**L. Applicable rules on court procedure**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*1. First-instance proceedings*\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) Territorial jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nUnder Article 35 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure of 24 July 2003 no. 95-FZ (as in force at the relevant time), claims should be brought to a court having jurisdiction over the defendant's official place of business.\n\n413.\n\nArticle 54 of the Civil Code defines a company's official place of business as the place of the company's registration, unless, in accordance with the law, the company's articles of association do not specify otherwise.\n\n414.\n\nDecision no. 6/8 of the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court and Supreme Commercial Court of 1 July 1996 specifies that the company's official place of business is the location of its entities.\n\n**(b) Interim measures**\n------------------------\n\n415.\n\nUnder Article 91 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure, a party may apply for proportionate security measures, including attachment of a defendant's assets, pending the examination of the case by the courts.\n\n**(c) Grace period**\n--------------------\n\n416.\n\nArticle 213 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure provides that in tax cases a court suit may be filed by the authorities when their demands have not been complied with voluntarily, or when the term for voluntary compliance has expired.\n\n**(d) Time-limits for examination of cases concerning mandatory payments and penalties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nArticle 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure sets out a two-month time-limit during which a first-instance court is to finalise the examination on the merits of any case which involves mandatory payment and related penalties.\n\n**(e) Time-limits for the preparation and examination of the case at first instance**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nArticle 134 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure establishes a two-month time-limit for the preparation of the case for examination at first instance.\n\n419.\n\nPursuant to Article 152 of the Code, the first-instance court should examine the case and deliver its judgment within one month of a decision to list the case for a hearing.\n\n**(f) Rules on adding evidence to the case after the beginning of the hearing**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nArticle 65 (3) of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure makes it mandatory for a party to disclose all evidence relied upon in their claims or objections prior to the beginning of the hearings in a case.\n\n421.\n\nIn paragraph 35 of Information Letter no. 82, dated 13 August 2004, the Supreme Commercial Court gave the following recommendation in respect of whether the trial court ought to accept and examine evidence that was previously undisclosed by the parties prior to the beginning of the hearings in a case:\n\n\"Any evidence undisclosed by the parties to the case prior to the hearing, but submitted later during the examination of the evidence, shall be examined by the commercial court at first instance regardless of the reasons for which the procedure for disclosure of evidence was breached ...\"\n\n**(g) Right to lodge an appeal against the first-instance judgment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nUnder Articles 257 and 259 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure participants in the proceedings have one month from the delivery of the first-instance judgment to lodge an appeal.\n\n*2. Appeal proceedings*\n-----------------------\n\n423.\n\nUnder Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, an appeal court must examine an appeal lodged against the first-instance judgment within one month, starting from the date of its filing. This term includes any time necessary for case preparation and for reaching the appeal decision. By federal law no. 205-FZ dated 19 July 2009 the time-limit was increased to two months. By federal law no. 69-FZ dated 30 April 2010 the provision in question has been amended. The time-limit became extendable up to six months depending on the complexity of the case and the number of participants. The provision also made it clear that the time-limit started running on expiry of the time-limit for lodging an appeal.\n\n424.\n\nUnder Article 268 of the Code, an appeal court fully re-examines the case using the evidence contained in the case and any newly-presented additional evidence. In examining procedural motions by the parties, including requests to call and hear additional witnesses or adduce and examine additional pieces of evidence, the appeal court is not bound by previous refusals of the same motions by the first-instance court.\n\n425.\n\nUnder Articles 180, 271 and 318 of the Code, the first-instance judgment becomes enforceable on the date of the entry into force of the appeal decision confirming it. The enforcement takes place on the basis on a writ issued by the respective court.\n\n*3. Cassation proceedings*\n--------------------------\n\n426.\n\nIn accordance with Article 286 of the Code, a cassation instance court, among other things, reviews the lower courts' decisions and verifies whether the conclusions of the lower courts in respect of both law and fact correspond to the circumstances of the case.\n\n427.\n\nArticle 283 of the Code provides for a possibility of applying for a stay of enforcement of the lower courts' decisions. The applicant must show that it would be impossible to reverse the effects of an immediate enforcement of the lower courts' decisions if the cassation appeal were successful.\n\n**M. Domestic courts' case-law**\n--------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nIn its rulings no. 7-P dated 6 June 1995, no. 14-P dated 13 June 1996 and no. 14-P dated 28 October 1999, the Constitutional Court formulated and reiterated the principle that the constitutional right to judicial protection could not be respected unless courts examined in substance the factual circumstances of the case, without merely limiting themselves to formalistic application of the legal norms. It has frequently referred to this principle in subsequent rulings.\n\n*1. Court disputes involving re-characterisation of sham arrangements*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Case no. A40-31714/97-2-312 (the Tax Ministry v. OOO TF Grin Haus)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nIn 1996 the respondent legal entity was involved in a series of intertwined transactions (rent contracts and loan agreements) with two third parties: as a result, the respondent leased a building in central Moscow to the third parties, but was able to avoid inclusion of the rent payments in the taxable base of its operations by claiming that they were interest payments in respect of the loan agreement. The Ministry discovered the tax evasion scheme, re-characterised the transactions in question as rent and ordered the taxpayer to pay RUB 2 billion in back taxes.\n\n430.\n\nThe case was examined in three rounds of court proceedings by the courts at three levels of jurisdiction. Having regard to the substance of the transactions entered into by the respondent, the terms of payment and execution of the contested contracts, and, generally, to the conduct of the respondent company and the third parties, the courts decided that the contractual arrangement had been sham, re-characterised the arrangement as rent and upheld the Ministry's decision.\n\n431.\n\nIn the first round of proceedings the courts adopted their decisions on the following dates: 1 December 1997, 27 January 1998 and 30 March 1998.\n\n432.\n\nIn the second round of proceedings the decisions were adopted by the first-instance and appeal courts on 26 May 1998 and 21 July 1998. The decision of the cassation court was taken on an unspecified date.\n\n433.\n\nThe third round of proceedings involved decisions on 17 November 1998, 25 January 1999 and 2 March 1999.\n\n**(b) Case no. KA-A40/2183-98 (the Tax Ministry v. AuRoKom GMBH)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n434.\n\nThe respondent legal entity entered into a loan agreement with a third party; the tax authorities considered it a sham, re-characterised it as a rent contract and reassessed the tax due in respect of the profits made. The lower courts disagreed and quashed the tax authority's decision. By a decision of 17 September 1998 the cassation court quashed the lower courts' decisions and ordered that the matter be re-examined, giving due regard to all relevant circumstances, including the substance of the transaction. The courts were to reconsider all relevant clauses in the agreement in question, the conduct of the parties and the fact of physical occupation of the allegedly rented space.\n\n**(c) Case no. A40/36819/04-75-387 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO AKB Rossiyskiy Kapital)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is a bank which in 2001-2002 conducted business by buying and then reselling precious metals. To avoid the payment of full VAT on its sales operations in this respect, the bank entered into commission agreements with the sellers from which it bought the metals, in order to be considered not as the owner of the traded goods, but merely as the sellers' agent.\n\n436.\n\nThe domestic courts took account of the substance of the bank's transactions (terms of payment, actual circumstances of delivery and other relevant factual details) and, having established that in reality the bank had been buying and reselling the precious metals, re-characterised the bank's activity as sales. The courts referred to Article 209 of the Civil Code (containing the legal definition of an owner) and concluded that the bank first bought the precious metals, thus becoming the \"owner\" within the meaning of the said provision and thereafter resold the goods. They found the bank liable for tax evasion under Article 122 of the Tax Code, ordered it to pay reassessed VAT in the amount of RUB 1,091,123,539.42, default interest of RUB 408,289.76 and penalties of RUB 436,391,918.65.\n\n437.\n\nThe first-instance judgment was adopted on 3 November 2004 and upheld on appeal on 11 January 2005.\n\n*2. Tax evasion schemes involving sham rent agreements and letter-box entities registered in the domestic offshore town of Baykonur*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Case no. A41 K1-13539/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nOAO Ufimskiy NPZ, the main production unit of one of the biggest Russian oil companies, OAO Bashneft, physically located in the town of Ufa, used the domestic tax offshore territory situated in the town of Baykonur, the territory rented by Russia from the Republic of Kazakhstan for its space-related projects. The town's tax regime was similar to that in the closed administrative-territorial formations (see above).\n\n439.\n\nOn 1 February 2001 the respondents OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M, a letter-box entity registered in Baykonur, entered into a rent agreement whereby the entirety of OAO Ufimskiy NPZ's production facilities were rented by ZAO Bort-M in exchange for nominal compensation. Since ZAO Bort-M was registered in Baykonur, the activity of OAO Ufimskiy NPZ enjoyed lower rates in respect of excise duties. The tax authorities discovered \"the scheme\" and contested it in court as sham and therefore null and void.\n\n440.\n\nOn 8 October 2002 the first-instance court had regard to the substance of the transaction and, having established that, despite the contractual arrangement, OAO Ufimskiy NPZ had continued to operate the facilities in question, that furthermore the letter-box entity was never properly registered and licensed as the operator of oil processing and oil storage facilities in accordance with the relevant law, and that the letter-box entity could not operate the facility because it had rented only one part of the production cycle (which, in technological terms, could not be split in two), that the sole aim and effect of the arrangement was tax evasion and that OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M had \"malicious intent\" to evade taxes, upheld the tax authorities' claim.\n\n441.\n\nThe first-instance judgment was upheld on appeal and in cassation on 17 December 2002 and 19 March 2003 respectively.\n\n**(b) Cases nos. A41 K1-13244/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novo-ufimskiy NPZ and ZAO Bort-M), A41 K1-11474/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novo-ufimskiy NPZ and OOO Korus-Baykonur), A41 K1-137828/02 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Ufimskiy NPZ and OOO Korus-Baykonur)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nThese cases are essentially follow-ups to the previous case: OAO Novo-Ufimskiy NPZ is the second main production unit of OAO Bashneft and was involved in exactly the same tax-evasion scheme, using the sham offshore entities ZAO Bort-M and OOO Korus-Baykonur. The domestic courts examined all three cases at three instances and granted the Ministry's claims. The decisions in the first set of proceedings were taken on 9 October, 16 December 2002 and 13 March 2003. The decisions in the second set of proceedings were taken on 19 September 2002, 5 December 2002 and 28 February 2003. The decisions in the third set of proceedings were taken on 18 December 2002, 20 February 2003 and 26 May 2003.\n\n**(c) Case no. A41 K1-9254/03 (the Tax Ministry v. OOO Orbitalnye sistemy and OAO MNPZ)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nThis case concerns exactly the same tax-evasion scheme as in the previous cases, but involves OAO MNPZ, a major oil-processing facility located in Moscow and owned by the Government of Moscow, as the defendant.\n\n444.\n\nThe decisions in the case were taken on 29 October and 27 December 2004.\n\n**(d) Case no. KA-A41/6270-03 (the Tax Ministry v. OOO Ekologiya)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nThis case also concerns the tax-evasion scheme described in the previous cases. The Ministry assessed the company, apparently a sham entity belonging to an oil producer, and found that it owed additional taxes, surcharges and penalties. The entity prevailed at first instance on 15 May 2003. On 10 October 2003 the cassation court quashed the first-instance judgment, as the lower court had failed to take into account the relevance of the entity's activity for the economy of the town of Baykonur, which was one of the criteria the law considered relevant to the issue of the lawfulness of tax exemptions.\n\n*3. Sham rent agreements and letter-box entities registered in the domestic offshore town of Ozersk (closed administrative-territorial formation, ZATO)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Case no. A55-1942/04-24 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe case concerns the same tax-evasion scheme as in the previous cases (involving the sham renting agreement), but the offshore territory at issue is the town of Ozersk and the taxpayer is OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ, one of the applicant company's subsidiary oil-processing units.\n\n447.\n\nThe scheme operated from January 1999 and was prosecuted in 2004. The first-instance judgment in favour of the Ministry was taken on 13 August 2004. The court applied the same 'substance over form' approach as in the previous cases and, having assessed the defendants' conduct, the character of their relations and statements by the officials of the entities, granted the Ministry's claims and also ordered OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ to pay RUB 120,688,860 in reassessed taxes.\n\n**(b) Case no. A55-5015/2004-33 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the previous case: in the first-instance judgment the court declared the defendants' contractual arrangement to be sham and unlawful and ordered OAO Novokuybyshevskiy NPZ to pay RUB 252,963,364 in reassessed taxes.\n\n449.\n\nThe first-instance judgment in the case, dated 19 October 2004, was upheld on appeal on 19 October 2004.\n\n**(c) Case no. A55-1941/2004-40 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Syzranskiy NPZ and OOO SK-STR)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the previous cases and involved OAO Syzranskiy NPZ, a production unit belonging to the applicant company. The rent agreement between the letter-box entity and the applicant company's production unit was declared sham and annulled. OAO Syzranskiy NPZ was ordered to pay RUB 30,309,119 in reassessed taxes.\n\n451.\n\nThe first-instance judgment of 18 August 2004 was upheld on appeal on 4 November 2004.\n\n*4. Sham arrangements and VAT fraud*\n------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Case no. 367/96 (the Tax Ministry v. Russian-Austrian Joint Stock Enterprise \"Sibservis\")**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is a privately-owned enterprise specialised in importing and assembling computer equipment. In 1995 the respondent disguised a portion of its sales as loan agreements with its clients in order to avoid payment of VAT. The first-instance judgment and the appeal decision in the case were taken on 31 August and 11 October 1995. On 17 September 1996 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia reviewed the lower courts' decisions and quashed them, ordering the lower courts to investigate the exact circumstances of the case, including everything relating to \"the sales disguised as loans\" arrangements.\n\n**(b) Case no. A57-11990/01-5 (the Tax Ministry v. FGUP Nizhnevolzhskgeologiya)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is a State-owned enterprise specialising in geological exploration and identification of oil fields. In 2000 it entered into a series of deliberately unprofitable oil trading transactions with a third party, OOO Roza-Mira Processing. Since the transactions preceded the actual export of oil, the two taxpayers, acting in concert, intended to obtain an artificially increased VAT refund. Having regard to the substance of the transaction and the relevant circumstances of the case, such as the terms of actual payment and execution, the courts decided that the transactions were sham, declared them null and void and refused the respondent's request for a VAT refund. In addition, the courts recovered the unpaid VAT with penalties.\n\n454.\n\nThe domestic courts reached their respective decisions on 22 November 2001, 29 April and 8 July 2002.\n\n**(c) Case no. 7543/02-16 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Saratovneftegaz)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nThe respondent legal entity is the main production unit of OAO NK Russneft, a large Russian private oil company, which was involved in a dispute with the Ministry over VAT refunds in respect of its export operations. The courts established that in 2001 the respondent entered into a series of transactions with a number of third parties, aimed at deceiving the Ministry and claiming an artificially increased VAT refund. The courts took account of the overall economic effect of the transactions in their entirety, numerous discrepancies and contradictions between the contractual arrangements, the actual movement of oil, the documents certifying the customs clearance of the goods in question, etc., and refused to recognise them as valid for the purposes of reimbursement of VAT. The courts concluded that the Ministry had been acting lawfully by refusing the respondent company's request for a refund of export VAT.\n\n456.\n\nThe domestic courts reached their respective decisions on 30 June 2003, 31 May and 16 September 2004.\n\n**(d) Case no. A28-7017/02-301/21 (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Kirovskiy Shinnyy Zavod)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThis is essentially a follow-up to the previous cases. The courts reached similar conclusions in respect of the respondent company and recovered RUB 5,000,000 in overpaid VAT in favour of the Ministry.\n\n458.\n\nThe decisions in the case during the first round of proceedings were taken on 19 December 2002, 19 March 2003 and 27 June 2003.\n\n459.\n\nThe second round of proceedings resulted in the first-instance judgment of 19 December 2002, the appeal decision of 19 March 2003 and the supervisory review decision of 23 December 2003.\n\n**(e) Case no. A09-846/03-28 (the Tax Ministry v. ZAO Melkruk, OOO Antareks-Unit, OOO Starlayt-N)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe first respondent legal entity is a big producer of grains, cereals and related processed products. It was involved in a dispute with the Ministry over VAT refunds in respect of export operations, whereby it had commissioned the second respondent to sell certain equipment abroad. The equipment was bought by the third respondent and resold \"at an economic loss\" to an entity registered in a foreign offshore location. Having regard to various circumstances, including the conduct of the entities involved and the fact that no actual hard cash had been paid for the equipment in question, the Ministry applied to court, asking it to invalidate the transactions in question as sham. The first-instance court dismissed the claim but the appeal and cassation review courts subsequently reversed that judgment, essentially upholding the Ministry's approach.\n\n461.\n\nThe domestic courts took their respective decisions on 14 April 2003, 4 August 2003 and 10 December 2003.\n\n**(f) Case no. A09-1646/03-GK (the Tax Ministry v. OAO Belkamneft, Baxter Trading Inc, OOO Tekhnotreyd)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nThe first respondent legal entity was involved in a dispute with the Ministry over VAT refunds in respect of export operations, whereby it had entered in complex relations with the other two respondents to sell certain goods abroad. Having regard to various circumstances, including the conduct of the entities involved and the fact that no actual hard cash had been paid for the goods in question, the Ministry applied to court, asking it to invalidate the transactions in question as sham and therefore null and void. The courts at three instances upheld the Ministry's approach.\n\n463.\n\nThe domestic courts took their respective decisions on 28 December 2002, 10 April 2003 and 1 July 2003.\n\n**(g) Case no. F09-1071/03-AK (the Tax Ministry v. OOO Khudozhestvennaya masterskaya \"Tvorchestvo\")**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe respondent entity was involved in a dispute with the Ministry over the latter's refusal to refund the VAT in respect of the entity's export operations. The Ministry uncovered an arrangement whereby there had been no hard cash transactions between the parties to the export operation, the respondent had \"traded at a loss\" and the allegedly exported produce had had nothing to do with the respondent's usual business activity. Having regard to various circumstances, including the conduct of the entities involved, the courts at three instances upheld the Ministry's approach.\n\n465.\n\nThe domestic courts took their respective decisions on 29 October 2002, 6 February 2003 and 17 April 2003.\n\n*5. Case-law of the domestic courts concerning the invalidity of sham transactions*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nBy a decision dated 15 May 1997 in the case of the Tax Ministry against Commercial Bank Mechel-Bank and OAO Mechel (no. F09-162/97-AK), the Federal Commercial Court of the Ural Circuit quashed the decisions of lower courts in which they had upheld the lawfulness of a \"kickback\" contract which had been concluded between the respondent bank and the respondent company. The Circuit Court ruled that the lower courts had failed to study and to take account of all of the circumstances relevant to the case at issue. In particular, the court noted the finding that the contract had been concluded specifically to avoid the payment of taxes. Accordingly, it reversed and invalidated the contract as unlawful, contrary to the legal order and morality, and ordered that the proceeds (RUB 1.5 bn) derived by the parties from the contract be seized in favour of the State.\n\n467.\n\nIn a decision of 9 December 1997 in case no. 5246/97, the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia invalidated a loan secured by a promissory note and a related pay-off agreement as imaginary and sham respectively. The court had regard to the terms of contracts concluded between the parties and the manner of their execution, in particular the fact that the loan had never been used by the borrower; it concluded that the transactions in question covered the sale of a promissory note and invalidated them as sham.\n\n468.\n\nIn a decision of 6 October 1998 in case no. 6202/97 the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of Russia invalidated two contracts for the sale of securities and a related loan agreement as sham, having regard to the terms of contracts in question, the manner of their execution and the contractual prices. The court established that the sales contracts in fact covered the loan agreement secured by the pledge of securities and remitted the case for re-trial.\n\n**N. Enforcement proceedings in respect of a presumably solvent debtor**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*1. General principles*\n-----------------------\n\n469.\n\nThe Enforcement Proceedings Act (Law no. 119-FZ) of 21 July 1997 (as in force at the relevant time) establishes the procedure by which a creditor may enforce a court award against a presumably solvent legal entity debtor. According to Article 46 \u00a7 6 of the Act, execution was to be levied against the debtor's property \"in such amount and such scope as is required to ensure the satisfaction of claims set out in the enforcement document\".\n\n470.\n\nRussian legislation provides for a set of special procedures in respect of presumably insolvent legal entity debtors (see section O below).\n\n*2. Term for voluntary compliance with the execution writ*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nUnder section 9 (3) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, on an application by the creditor, the bailiff institutes enforcement proceedings, fixes the time-limit for enforcement of the execution writ - which may not exceed five days from the date of institution of enforcement proceedings -and notifies the debtor accordingly.\n\n*3. Various ways to stay or delay enforcement proceedings*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nArticle 324 of the Commercial Procedure Code sets out a procedure whereby a court may alter the method and order of enforcement of a final court decision. Among other thing, it provides as follows:\n\n\"1. If there are circumstances which make it difficult to enforce the judicial act, the commercial court which issued a writ may, upon an application by the creditor, debtor or bailiff, grant respite in respect of the enforcement or arrange for the payment in instalments, or otherwise change the method or order of enforcement. ...\"\n\n473.\n\nAt the same time, Articles 62, 64 (1) and (2) of the Tax Code specify that a respite or possibility of repaying in instalments concerns only the taxes, and not the interest surcharges and penalties, and may be granted by a court only for a period from one to six months from the original deadline for payment, may only be granted on specific grounds enumerated in the law and cannot be granted if there are tax proceedings pending against the applicant (Article 62 (1)).\n\n474.\n\nThe Enforcement Proceedings Act provides for three possibilities, namely: (a) to postpone enforcement actions for a term of up to 106 days (section 19); (b) to suspend the enforcement proceedings (section 21); or (c) to defer the execution of enforcement of a debt or arrange for payment in instalments (section 18).\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: the text was: \"up to 15 days \u2026\".\n\n475.\n\nWith regard to (a), the bailiff takes the decision in the \"appropriate circumstances\" either on an application by the debtor or of its own motion.\n\n476.\n\nWith regard to (b), the decision may only be taken in seven enumerated cases: if the bailiff applied to the court with a request to interpret the judicial act; on a request from a debtor who has been drafted to serve in the army; if the debtor is on a long-term mission; if the debtor is hospitalised and being treated; if the actions of the bailiff are being contested in court; if the debtor himself or his property is being searched for; if the debtor or creditor are on holiday and cannot be contacted.\n\n477.\n\nAs regards (c), the debtor, creditor or bailiff has the right to request the court to defer the execution of enforcement of a debt or arrange for payment in instalments if there are \"circumstances impeding the enforcement actions\".\n\n*4. Seizure of the debtor's assets*\n-----------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nIf the debtor does not comply within the specified time-limit, under section 9 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act the bailiff, on an application by the creditor, has the right to make an inventory of the debtor's property and to seize it.\n\n479.\n\nUnder section 9 (5) of the Law on Enforcement Proceedings the bailiff is empowered to seize any of the debtor's assets to secure enforcement. In seizing the debtor's assets the bailiffs are obliged to follow the order of priority of arrest and sale set out in section 46 (2) of the Law on Enforcement, which provides:\n\n\"... execution under enforcement documents shall, in the first priority, be levied on the debtor's monetary funds in roubles and in foreign currency, and on other valuables, including those kept in banks and other credit institutions\".\n\nAt the same time, the Supreme Commercial Court specified in its Information Letter no. 6, dated 25 July 1996:\n\n\"... the freezing of cash ... may not be imposed on the respondent's account and on amounts that will enter this account in the future ...\".\n\nIn its Resolution no. 11 of 9 December 2002 the Plenary Supreme Commercial Court ruled:\n\n\"... arrest on cash owned by the debtor shall be imposed not on its account in credit institutions but on cash that is on the accounts, within the limits of the monetary claims ...\"\n\n480.\n\nSection 46 (5) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act provides that, if a debtor lacks sufficient cash funds to satisfy the creditor's claims, the debt may be levied from the other forms of the debtor's property, unless the federal law states otherwise. The debtor has the right to indicate his preferred order of priority, but the final order is determined by the bailiff.\n\n481.\n\nSection 51 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act establishes a one-month time-limit for the seizure of the debtor's property from the date on which the ruling on the institution of enforcement proceedings is served. The seizure is intended, *inter alia*, to secure the safety of the debtor's property and the creditor's claims, which shall be subject to a subsequent transfer to the creditor or to a subsequent sale. The seizure of securities is carried out in conformity with the procedure defined by the Government of the Russian Federation in Decree no. 934 \"On the seizure of securities\", dated 12 August 1998.\n\n482.\n\nSection 59 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act establishes the order of priority in the seizure and forced sale of a debtor's property in three stages. Firstly, the bailiff sells property which is not immediately involved in the debtor's production cycle (securities, cash on the debtor's deposit and other accounts, currency valuables, cars, office equipment, etc.); secondly, finished products (goods) and other material values not immediately involved in production and not intended to play an immediate part in it; and, thirdly, real-estate objects, as well as raw and other materials, machine-tools and equipment and other fixed assets, intended for immediate involvement in production.\n\n483.\n\nIn Ruling no. 4 \"On certain questions arising out of seizure and enforcement actions in respect of corporate shares\", dated 3 March 1999, the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court decided that in respect of companies which had been privatised by the State as parts of bigger holding groups through the transfer of controlling blocks of shares, the production cycle of the respective production unit should be preserved as much as possible.\n\n*5. Enforcement fee*\n--------------------\n\n484.\n\nSection 81 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act penalises a debtor's failure to comply voluntarily with a writ of execution with a 7% enforcement fee. Under Section 77 of the Act the fee is a priority payment which should be made by the debtor even before it begins repaying the principal debt.\n\n485.\n\nIn ruling no. 13-P of 30 July 2001 the Constitutional Court of Russia described the enforcement fee as an administrative penal sanction having a fixed monetary expression, exacted by compulsion, formalised by the decision of an authorised official and levied in favour of the State. The Constitutional Court struck the above provision down as unconstitutional, in so far as it did not allow the debtor to excuse his failure to comply with the writ by reference to certain extraordinary, objectively inevitable circumstances and to other unforeseeable and insurmountable obstacles beyond the debtor's control.\n\n486.\n\nThe Government referred to over a dozen cases from across Russia which, they claimed, confirmed that that the 7% enforcement fee was levied by bailiffs as a matter of standard practice in the event of the debtor's failure to pay, routinely and without exceptions, even if the debtor was a State-owned entity or indeed a State body. Here are some examples: enforcement proceedings dated 19 January 2001 no. 6-26/2001, in respect of RUB 304,078,000, owed by a State-owned private-law entity GUP Tatvodokanal; enforcement proceedings dated 18 November 2005 no. 3068/62/2/2006 in respect of RUB 108,083,008.64, owed by the Ministry of Education of the town of Kazan; enforcement proceedings dated 18 December 2002 no. 2-12/2002 in respect of RUB 19,0311,000, owed by OAO Tatavtodor; enforcement proceedings dated 25 February 2004 no. 7-18/04 in respect of RUB 445,336,550.84, owed by OAO Vertolety-MI; enforcement proceedings dated 13 November 2001 no. 5-17/2001 in respect of RUB 917,787,000, owed by FKP Kazanskiy zavod tochnogo mashinostroeniya imeni M. I. Kalinina.\n\n*6. Forced sale of arrested assets*\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(a) Rules concerning valuation of frozen property**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nSection 53 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act requires the bailiff to evaluate the arrested property on the basis of market prices on the date of execution of the enforcement writ. Should valuation be problematic for technical or any other reasons, the bailiff is to appoint a specialist to carry out the valuation.\n\n488.\n\nAccording to a Decree of the Ministry of Justice dated 27 October 1998, the bailiff is obliged to appoint a specialist to conduct the valuation if the seized property is shares or other securities (*\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438*). Under the same Decree the bailiff is to inform the debtor and creditor of the resulting valuation.\n\n**(b) General rules concerning the sale of frozen property**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nSection 54 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act requires the bailiff to sell the arrested property in satisfaction of the debt within two months of the date of seizure. The sale is carried out by a specialised institution on the basis of a commission contract with the bailiff.\n\n490.\n\nAccording to Government Decree no. 418 \"On the Russian Fund of Federal Property\" of 29 November 2001 and Government Decree no. 260 \"On the Sale of Seized, Confiscated and Other Property ...\" of 19 April 2002, the Fund is entrusted with the task, *inter alia*, of auctioning property seized in satisfaction of the debts owed to Russia.\n\n*7. Distribution of levied sums and order of priority in the event of multiple claimants*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nSection 77 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act provides that, in respect of the sums levied from the debtor, including the proceeds from the forced sale of the debtor's property, the bailiffs first recover enforcement fees and all related payments and the remainder is used in satisfaction of the creditors' claims.\n\n492.\n\nIf the proceeds from the forced sale(s) are insufficient to satisfy all creditors, the following order of priority applies (section 78 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act): tort claims, employment and labour-related claims, claims made on behalf of the Pension Fund and the Social Security Fund of Russia, claims made on behalf of the budgets of various territorial levels and finally all other claims.\n\n*8. Court appeals against bailiffs' decisions*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nUnder section 90 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, all actions by the bailiff in the course of enforcement proceedings can be appealed against within ten days from the date of proper notification of the action in question.\n\n494.\n\nAny damage inflicted on the debtor as a result of the bailiff's omission is compensated in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n\n**O. Enforcement proceedings in respect of an insolvent debtor legal entity**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n495.\n\nThe enforcement of court awards and more generally debt claims against insolvent or presumably insolvent debtor legal entities are regulated by the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act of 26 October 2002 (Law no. 127-FZ).\n\n*1. Definition of the state of insolvency (bankruptcy)*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nSection 3 of the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act defines the state of bankruptcy of a legal entity as follows:\n\n\"A legal entity is regarded as being unable to satisfy the claims of creditors in respect of pecuniary obligations and (or) to fulfil its obligations in respect of mandatory payments if the respective obligations and (or) obligation are not complied with within three months of the date on which compliance should have occurred.\"\n\n497.\n\nIn accordance with section 4 of the Act, the obligations are, as a general rule, defined/recognised by the court on the date of examination of the bankruptcy petition.\n\n498.\n\nBankruptcy proceedings in respect of a legal entity may only be instituted by a court if the overall amount of debt claims exceeds RUB 100,000 (section 6 of the Act).\n\n*2. Bringing of a bankruptcy petition*\n--------------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nUnder section 7 of the Act the debtor, the debtor's creditors in respect of pecuniary claims and State bodies competent to take part in bankruptcy proceedings in which the State is a creditor in respect of mandatory payments are entitled to bring a bankruptcy petition.\n\n500.\n\nWhilst the executive body of the debtor has the right to file for bankruptcy in circumstances where it is obvious that the debtor would be unable to fulfil its obligation in due time (section 8 of the Act), it has a legal duty to do so if the forced seizure of the debtor's property in satisfaction of a claim would make the debtor's economic activity extremely difficult or impossible (section 9 of the Act). In this latter respect, the petition should be brought within one month from the date on which the respective relevant circumstances occurred.\n\n501.\n\nFailure to abide by the above rules exposes the offender to civil liability action by virtue of section 10 of the Act and may also make the offender vicariously liable for any resulting damage.\n\n*3. Examination of a bankruptcy petition*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nThe admissibility of the bankruptcy petition is examined by a single-judge bench (section 48 of the Act). Having declared the petition well-founded (admissible), the judge is to impose a supervision order in respect of the debtor (see below).\n\n503.\n\nThe merits of the bankruptcy petition should be examined by a court within seven months of the date of its filing (section 51 of the Act).\n\n504.\n\nHaving examined the merits of the bankruptcy petition, the court takes one of the following decisions (section 52 of the Act): (a) it declares the debtor bankrupt and applies the liquidation procedure in respect of the debtor; (b) it rejects the request to declare the debtor bankrupt; (c) it introduces a \"financial improvement order\" in respect of the debtor; (d) it applies the procedure of external management; (e) it discontinues the bankruptcy proceedings; (f) it disallows the bankruptcy petition; (g) it approves the friendly settlement of the case.\n\n*4. Various solutions available to a court in resolving a bankruptcy case*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nThe following five procedures may be applicable in respect of the debtor in a bankruptcy case (section 27 of the Act): (a) supervision order; (b) financial improvement order; (c) external management; (d) liquidation; (e) friendly settlement.\n\n506.\n\nA supervision order is defined as the first procedure applied to the debtor (see above). It consists of securing the debtor's property, analysing its financial condition, composing the list of creditors and carrying out the first assembly of creditors (section 2 of the Act). The decision to impose a supervision order is taken by a judge in accordance with section 9 of the Act. It can be appealed against to a higher court. In the decision, the judge should also appoint an interim receiver.\n\n507.\n\nA financial improvement order is a bankruptcy procedure intended to re-establish the debtor's solvency and consisting in repayment of the debts in accordance with a debt repayment schedule (section 2 of the Act).\n\n508.\n\nExternal management is a bankruptcy procedure intended to re-establish the debtor's solvency (section 2 of the Act).\n\n509.\n\nLiquidation is a bankruptcy procedure applied in respect of a debtor who has been declared bankrupt. It is essentially the sale of the debtor's property by a court-appointed trustee in proportionate satisfaction of the creditors' claims (section 2 of the Act).\n\n510.\n\nFriendly settlement is a bankruptcy procedure applicable at any stage of bankruptcy proceedings whereby the creditors and the debtor reach an agreement in respect of the debtor's liability (section 2 of the Act).\n\n*5. Supervision order and its consequences*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nThe automatic consequences of the decision to adopt a supervision order in respect of the debtor legal entity (section 63 of the Act) are, in particular, the following: all debts due after the date of the decision are recoverable only pursuant to a special procedure; enforcement of execution writs already issued, including any pecuniary claims (with the exception of those relating to payment of salaries and tort claims) against the debtor, is halted, and the seizure in respect of the debtor's property is lifted.\n\n512.\n\nThe law also introduces some restrictions in respect of operations with the debtor's shares and the actions of the debtor itself (section 64 of the Act). However, the debtor's management team remains in place, subject to limitations restricting their ability to dispose of the debtor's property above a certain value (more than 5% of the book costs of the debtor's property) or to indebt the debtor further by contracting loans, issuing guaranties or sureties, transferring debts to third parties or transferring the debtor's property for external management by a third party.\n\n513.\n\nAn interim receiver is appointed by a court in accordance with sections 45 and 65 of the Act. At this stage of proceedings, he or she has no management functions and is essentially responsible for securing the debtor's property, watching over the activities of the debtor's management, analysing the debtor's financial condition and identifying the debtor's creditors. The interim receiver is accountable to a court and is in charge of organising the first meeting of creditors.\n\n514.\n\nFor a period of thirty days from the date of publication of the supervision order notice, the creditors have the right to file their claims against the debtor (section 71 of the Act). The claims may be included in the list of creditors on the basis of the court's decision.\n\n515.\n\nAt least ten days prior to the date of termination of the supervision order, the interim receiver must organise the first meeting of creditors (section 72 of the Act). At the meeting, the creditors are competent, among other things, to decide either: (a) to introduce a financial supervision order and lodge the relevant request with the court; (b) to introduce an external management order and lodge the respective request with the court; or (c) to request the court to declare the debtor bankrupt and impose a liquidation order (section 73 of the Act).\n\nTHE LAW\n-------\n\nI. COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLE 35 \u00a7 2 (b) OF THE CONVENTION\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe Court reiterates that it declared this application admissible on 29 January 2009 (see *OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia* (dec.), no. 14902/04, 29 January 2009) and decided to hold a hearing on the merits of the case. Subsequently, but prior to the hearing, the Court was informed that arbitration proceedings, allegedly brought against the Russian Federation by the applicant company's former owners, were pending and considered that these developments raised an issue of the applicant company's compliance with the requirements of Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention. It invited the parties to address this question in their submissions at the hearing.\n\n**A. The parties' submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nThe Government submitted that in February 2005 the applicant company's former majority shareholders Hulley Enterprises Ltd, Yukos Universal Ltd and Veteran Petroleum Ltd, which had jointly owned over 60% of shares in the applicant company, brought arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation for the alleged breaches of the Energy Charter Treaty in the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague. The Government pointed out that the applicant company had ceased to exist and that it was obvious that the above-mentioned majority shareholders had been behind the present case in the Court and that they would be the end-beneficiaries of any eventual award in these proceedings. The Government also mentioned a number of arbitration proceedings brought against the Russian Federation by groups of minority shareholders under bilateral investment treaties. Overall, the Government invited the Court to discontinue the case with reference to Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention.\n\n518.\n\nThe applicant company denied any participation in and any knowledge of any other international proceedings that may be of relevance. At the same time, it invited the Court to rule that the parties in the proceedings before this Court (the applicant company) and in The Hague arbitration proceedings (the applicant company's controlling shareholders) were not the same. According to the applicant company, the subject-matter in the two cases was different. It also claimed that the arbitration proceedings in the Hague were conducted before *ad hoc* tribunals, constituted by the parties, and were not comparable to the Court in their structure, permanence or authority. Overall, the applicant company argued that its application complied with Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention and that any parallel proceedings should not undermine its case before the Court.\n\n**B. The Court's assessment**\n-----------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Court will examine this issue under Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n\"... 2. The Court shall not deal with any application submitted under Article 34 that\n\n...\n\n(b) is substantially the same as a matter that has already been examined by the Court or has already been submitted to another procedure of international investigation or settlement and contains no relevant new information. ...\"\n\n520.\n\nAt the outset, the Court would reiterate that Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention is intended to avoid the situation where several international bodies would be simultaneously dealing with applications which are substantially the same. A situation of this type would be incompatible with the spirit and the letter of the Convention, which seeks to avoid a plurality of international proceedings relating to the same cases (see, among others, *Smirnova v. Russia*, (dec.) nos. 46133/99 and 48183/99, 3 October 2002, and *Calcerrada Fornieles and Cabeza Mato v. Spain*, no. 17512/90, Commission decision of 6 July 1992, Decisions and Reports (DR) 73). In determining whether its jurisdiction is excluded by virtue of this Convention provision the Court would have to decide whether the case before it is substantially the same as a matter that has already been submitted to a parallel set of proceedings and, if that is so, whether the simultaneous proceedings may be seen as \"another procedure of international investigation or settlement\" within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention.\n\n521.\n\nThe assessment of similarity of the cases would usually involve the comparison of the parties in the respective proceedings, the relevant legal provisions relied on by them, the scope of their claims and the types of the redress sought (see *Vesa Peltonen v. Finland* (dec.), no. 19583/92, 20 February 1995; *Cereceda Martin and Others v. Spain*, no. 16358/90, Commission decision of 12 October 1992; *Smirnova*, cited above, and *Decision on the competence of the Court to give an advisory opinion* [GC], \u00a7 31, ECHR 2004-VI).\n\n522.\n\nAs regards the analysis of the character of parallel proceedings, the Court's examination would not be limited to a formal verification but would extend, where appropriate, to ascertaining whether the nature of the supervisory body, the procedure it follows and the effect of its decisions are such that the Court's jurisdiction is excluded by Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) (see *Lukanov v. Bulgaria* (dec.), 21915/93, Commission decision of 12 January 1995; *Decision on the competence of the Court to give an advisory opinion* [GC], cited above; *Celniku v. Greece*, no. 21449/04, \u00a7\u00a7 39-41, 5 July 2007, and *Peraldi v. France* (dec.), no. 2096/05, 7 April 2009).\n\n523.\n\nTurning to the case at hand, the Court finds that there is no need for it to examine whether the proceedings in the Hague brought by the company's majority shareholders or the proceedings brought under the bilateral investment treaties brought by various groups of the company's minority shareholders may be seen as \"another procedure of international investigation of settlement\" as it is clear that the cases are not \"substantially the same\" within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention for the following reasons.\n\n524.\n\nThe Court observes that it was Hulley Enterprises Ltd and Veteran Petroleum Ltd (both registered in Cyprus) and Yukos Universal Ltd (registered in the Isle of Man), which in February 2005 initiated arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, referring, among other things, to the same events and proceedings as those complained of by the applicant company in the present application before the Court and alleging numerous violations of their rights as investors under the Energy Charter Treaty. Some of the company's foreign minority shareholders also initiated similar proceedings under bilateral investment treaties. The Court notes, however, that despite certain similarities in the subject-matters of the present case and of the arbitration proceedings, the claimants in those arbitration proceedings are the applicant company's shareholders acting as investors, and not the applicant company itself, which at that moment in time was still an independent legal entity.\n\n525.\n\nThe Court further notes that the present case has been introduced and maintained by the applicant company in its own name. Although the above-mentioned entities could arguably be seen as having been affected by the events leading to the applicant company's liquidation, they have never taken part, either directly or indirectly, in the Strasbourg proceedings. The Court reiterates that in November 2007 the applicant company was liquidated and that despite this fact in its admissibility decision of 29 January 2009 it nevertheless accepted the application \"because the issues raised by the case transcend[ed] the person and the interests of the applicant [company]\" and \"... striking the application out of the list under such circumstances would undermine the very essence of the right of individual applications by legal persons, as it would encourage governments to deprive such entities of the possibility to pursue an application lodged at a time when they enjoyed legal personality...\", which shows that the Court has throughout placed emphasis on the applicant company in its own right.\n\n526.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Court finds that the parties in the above-mentioned arbitration proceedings and in the present case are different and therefore the two matters are not \"substantially the same\" within the meaning of Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention. It follows that the Court is not barred, pursuant to this provision, from examining the merits of this case.\n\nII. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Court notes that in the admissibility decision in this case it has established that Article 6 applied under its criminal head to the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings and has declared admissible the company's grievances that:\n\n(1) the Ministry had brought the action in these proceedings within the grace period;\n\n(2) the time to prepare for trial had been too short;\n\n(3) its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings before the first-instance court and the first-instance court pronounced its judgment without having studied all the evidence;\n\n(4) the statutory time-limit for appeal had been unjustifiably abridged;\n\n(5) and that the appeal court had delayed the delivery of the reasons for its judgment thereby preventing the applicant company from lodging a cassation appeal.\n\n528.\n\nThe Court will examine these grievances under Article 6 of the Convention, which, in its relevant parts, provides as follows:\n\n\"1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\n\n...\n\n3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:\n\n(b) to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence; ...\"\n\n**A. The parties' submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n*1. The applicant company's submissions*\n----------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nAs regards the first instance proceedings, at the admissibility stage of proceedings before this Court the applicant company argued that the supporting material underlying the Tax Assessment for 2000 had first been provided to it as a result of the City Court's decision of 14 May 2004. It alleged that the disclosure did not occur until 17 May 2004, when the Ministry filed 24,000 pages of documents, and continued on 18 May 2004 with approximately 45,000 further pages and a further 2,000 pages late on 20 May 2004, i.e. on the eve of the first-instance hearing. The company conceded that its representatives had indeed been given access to all these materials, both prior to the hearings and during the trial, but submitted that the manner and time for such access had been so unsatisfactory that it was of no practical use. It also argued that it had been unable effectively to access the court's filed documents during the first-instance hearings except during the lunch breaks. Overall, the company insisted that it had had insufficient time to prepare its defence and familiarise itself with the evidence before the court and that it had not had an opportunity to take cognisance of and comment on all of the evidence adduced or observations filed, nor to express its views on every document in the file, contrary to Article 6. It referred to the *Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain* and *Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 v. Czech Republic* cases. In their post-admissibility observations the company submitted that the Ministry had had sufficient time to disclose the evidence, as the relevant documents had been in the possession of the Ministry and that the Ministry could have disclosed them at any point from 8 December 2003 (some six months before the beginning of the hearing). It further noted that the documents filed by the Ministry had been in complete disorder and had been stored in nineteen plastic crates (ten of them containing six thousand pages each and nine more containing some four thousand pages each) and simply could not be studied properly over such a short period. The documents were kept in a room measuring three to four square metres and containing two chairs, a desk and one window. A request for additional space had been turned down. The above-mentioned conditions were reflected in a record dated 18 May 2004, drawn up by the applicant company's counsel. The Ministry's representative had refused to sign it and stated that he disagreed with its contents. More generally, the applicant company criticised the Ministry for bringing an action against it before the expiry of the grace period and argued that the first instance proceedings had been unfair because its lawyers could not obtain from the Ministry answers to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings and that it was under the impression that the first-instance court had pronounced judgment without having studied all the evidence.\n\n530.\n\nAs regards the appeal proceedings, the applicant company also insisted on the breach of Article 6. It submitted that the domestic courts had failed to address the question of whether the abridgement of time had affected its substantive right to a fair hearing and that, equally, it did not rely on Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, referred to by the respondent Government. Also, the rule in Article 267 requiring an appeal to be determined within one month is not respected in practice by the Russian courts; failure to comply with this requirement, even for a whole year, has no consequences for the proceedings. There was, according to the applicant company, no evidence of any particular urgency in listing or resolving the appeal: neither the Ministry, nor the co-appellant, OOO 'YUKOS' Moscow, sought expedition when their appeals were lodged and the co-appellant did not oppose the applicant company's applications to adjourn the appeal hearing. In response to the Government's criticism suggesting that the company's appeal was misaddressed by the omission of part of the postal code from the envelope, the applicant stated that no evidence had been provided of any mistake in this respect and that, after all, the appeal had been received by the court and the tax authorities. In any event, the court had made no criticism of the company in relation to the exercise of this appeal. Overall, the abridgement of the appeal period was a serious interference with the company's right to prepare for the appeal hearings, which failed to cure but rather accentuated the unfairness of the first-instance proceedings, and no substantive reason has been offered as to why this acceleration was lawful, necessary or consistent with the requirements of a fair trial.\n\n531.\n\nThe applicant company submitted in respect of the complaint about the delay in the delivery of the appeal judgment that the delay meant that the decision had been immediately enforced against the company, rendering any further cassation appeal nugatory. Only an application for a stay of enforcement pending an appeal in cassation, coupled with a valid appeal in cassation, could have been effective against the enforcement. In the company's view, such a valid appeal was strictly dependent on filing of the reasons by the appeal court. The appeal decision had become subject to immediate forcible execution, the company had become liable for an additional surcharge of 7% of the total liability and the opportunity to exercise an effective appeal against these measures had been circumvented.\n\n*2. The Government's submissions*\n---------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nAs regards the argument that the company had insufficient time for preparation of the defence, the Government referred in their admissibility observations to the domestic legislation, which established a two-month time-limit for the examination of the case at first instance (Article 134 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure). The applicant company had at least 37 days to prepare its defence from the date of the filing of the suit, which, in view of the above time-limit, had not been unreasonable. Furthermore, the applicant company first became aware of the Ministry's arguments on 29 December 2003, when the Ministry issued the report indicating the applicant company's large tax liability and by 12 January 2004 the company had also filed its objections to the report under Article 100 (5) of the Tax Code. Moreover, the principal arguments contained in these objections remained unchanged throughout the proceedings. It could not be said therefore that the applicant company was unprepared to state its case, since it was well aware of the Ministry's arguments five months prior to the beginning of the court proceedings. In addition, the Government pointed out that the applicant company's lawyers were given an opportunity to study the evidence both in court and at the Ministry's premises throughout May, June and July 2004. According to the documents submitted by the Government, counsel for the applicant company availed themselves of this opportunity at least on two occasions, on 18 and 19 May 2004 respectively. Lastly, the Government argued that the applicant company's arguments about insufficient time for the preparation of the case had been carefully examined and eventually dismissed by the domestic courts as unfounded. In their post-admissibility observations the Government also submitted that the proceedings before commercial courts in Russia were generally conducted without serious delays (referring, for instance, to the lack of any cases against Russia on account of length of proceedings before the commercial courts). They further argued that in its submissions the applicant company had asserted generalities and had never mentioned any specific documents to which they had not had proper access. The evidence in question had been documents which were well known to the applicant company, as the Ministry had requested these documents from it during the on-site inspection (the Government relied on Article 101 (2) 4 of the Tax Code in this respect) and that the documents had been itemised in a register dated 17 May 2004 no. 14-3-02/22-13-1 and had been copies of original documentation reflecting the relations between the applicant company and its sham entities. In addition, the Government argued that any number of the company's lawyers could have come to study the evidence and that the applicant company had apparently felt no need to do so, since it had been represented by eight lawyers in the first-instance proceedings and only two to four of them had studied the documents. Overall, the Government suggested that the dispute was more legal rather than factual, so that the crux of the applicant company's objections concerned the interpretation of the domestic law rather than controversy about the particular circumstances of the tax evasion. In addition, the Government argued that the appeal hearing constituted a *de novo* examination of the case and that by then the applicant company had had a perfectly adequate opportunity to review the documentary record. By asking to adjourn the proceedings the applicant merely intended to delay the delivery of the judgment.\n\n533.\n\nAs regards the appeal proceedings, in the Government's view they too were in compliance with Article 6. The applicant company had brought appeal proceedings against the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004: the possibility of review on both points of fact and law had been expressly provided for by Russian law (Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure) and the company had used it. Under Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, which requires an appeal court to examine the appeals by the parties within a month of the date on which they were filed, the Appeal Court had to examine the case within a month of 1 June 2004, which was the date on which one party to the case, OOO 'YUKOS' Moskva, first lodged an appeal brief, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant company lodged its appeal on 17 June 2004. The appeal hearings, which represented a full re-trial of the case within the meaning of Article 268 of the Code of Commercial Courts Procedure, started on 18 June and lasted eight days, that is, until 29 June 2004, which was in line with the above rule. In addition, the applicant company deliberately delayed the examination of the case by dispatching the appeal brief to an erroneous address. Lastly, the Government underlined that the appeal decision had not been final and had been appealed against by the applicant company both in cassation instance and by way of supervisory review. The Government submitted that the fact that the reasoned copy of the Appeal Court decision of 29 June 2004 had been produced on 9 July 2004 did not affect the fairness of the proceedings as, in any event, it was open to the applicant company to lodge its cassation appeal within a two-month time-limit from the date of delivery of the appeal decision on 29 June 2004, even in the absence of the reasoned copy of the decision. The applicant company had lodged its cassation appeal on 6 July 2004 in the absence of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision. The cassation appeal was accepted for consideration and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court.\n\n**B. The Court's assessment**\n-----------------------------\n\n534.\n\nThe Court would reiterate that while Article 6 of the Convention guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it is not the Court's function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court and the question which must be answered is rather whether the proceedings as a whole were fair (see, for example, *\u00d6calan v. Turkey* [GC], no. 46221/99, \u00a7\u00a7 148-49, ECHR 2005-IV; *G\u00e4fgen v. Germany* [GC], no. 22978/05, \u00a7\u00a7 162-88, ECHR 2010-...). The Court will examine the applicant company's grievances in turn to make an overall conclusion in this connection.\n\n*1. The complaint about the bringing of the action by the Ministry*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nTurning to the applicant company's complaint that in the proceedings before the Moscow City Court the action in respect of the Tax Assessment 2000 and the request to attach the company's assets as a security for the claim was brought by the Ministry within the grace period (see paragraphs 25 and 26), the Court observes that this argument was examined by the Circuit Court, which dismissed it as unfounded and recognised the Ministry's action as lawful in this respect (see paragraph 72). The Court recalls the the Ministry's action was lodged under the rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute was insoluble and, regard being had to the circumstances of the case, finds no indication of arbitrariness or unfairness within the meaning of Article 6 of the Convention in this connection.\n\n*2. The complaint about the allegedly insufficient time for preparation of the defence at first instance*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n536.\n\nThe Court notes that it is common ground between the parties that during the first-instance proceedings the applicant company did not have access to the documents in the court file, other than the report of 29 December 2003, the decision of 14 April 2004 and their annexes, until 17 May 2004 when the Ministry invited the company's lawyers to study the documents at its premises (see paragraphs 41-45). It is also undisputed that the hearings in the case commenced on 21 May 2004, which is four working days later, and the evidence at issue amounted to at least 43,000 pages (see paragraphs 44 and 46). It is also not in dispute that on a few occasions the applicant company requested to adjourn the hearings referring to, among other things, their wish to study the evidence in the case, and that these requests were turned down by the trial court as unfounded (see paragraph 46).\n\n537.\n\nThe Court further notes that according to the applicant company this period was manifestly short, whilst the Government argued with reference to the sequence of the events in the proceedings and the applicant company's conduct that it had no real need to study these documents since the documents came from the company itself and it was entirely familiar with them. The Government also argued that the appeal hearing constituted a *de novo* examination of the case and that by then the applicant company had had a perfectly adequate opportunity to familiarise itself with the evidence at issue.\n\n538.\n\nThe Court reiterates that the principle of equality of arms is one feature of the wider concept of a fair trial, which also includes the fundamental right that criminal proceedings should be adversarial. The right to an adversarial trial means, in a criminal case, that both prosecution and defence must be given the opportunity to have knowledge of and comment on the observations filed and the evidence adduced by the other party. Various ways are conceivable in which national law may meet this requirement. However, whatever method is chosen, it should ensure that the other party will be aware that observations have been filed and will get a real opportunity to comment on them (see *Brandstetter v. Austria*, 28 August 1991, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 67, Series A no. 211; *Ruiz-Mateos v. Spain*, 23 June 1993, \u00a7 67, Series A no. 262; *mutatis mutandis*, *Milatov\u00e1 and Others v. the Czech Republic*, no. 61811/00, \u00a7 65, ECHR 2005-V and, *a fortiori*, *Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the Czech Republic*, no. 35376/97, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, 3 March 2000). Furthermore, the Court reiterates that Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) guarantees \"adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence\" and therefore implies that the substantive defence activity on the accused's behalf may comprise everything which is \"necessary\" to prepare the trial. The accused must have the opportunity to organise his defence in an appropriate way and without restriction as to the possibility to put all relevant defence arguments before the trial court and thus to influence the outcome of the proceedings (see *Can v. Austria*, no. 9300/81, \u00a7 53, Commission's report of 12 July 1984, Series A no. 96, and *Moiseyev v. Russia*, no. 62936/00, \u00a7 220, 9 October 2008). The facilities which should be enjoyed by everyone charged with a criminal offence include the opportunity to acquaint himself, for the purposes of preparing his defence, with the results of investigations carried out throughout the proceedings (see *C.G.P. v. the Netherlands* (dec.), no. 29835/96, 15 January 1997, and *Galstyan v. Armenia*, no. 26986/03, \u00a7 84, 15 November 2007).\n\n539.\n\nTurning to the case at hand, the Court observes that the Ministry's claims to the applicant company in respect of the year 2000 were based on the audit report of 29 December 2003, which became available to the applicant company on the same date and was later used in the decision of 14 April 2004, served on the applicant on 15 April 2004. It is true that these two documents were very detailed, and contained the attachments to substantiate the Ministry's position, and that the applicant company had on a few occasions opportunity to contest them. The fact remains, however, that the object of the trial court's examination during the hearings of 21 to 26 May 2004 was neither the audit report of 29 December 2003 and the decision of 14 April 2004 as such, nor the copies of the documents allegedly already in possession of the applicant company, but rather the Ministry's court claims based on the above-mentioned two documents and the additional body of evidence filed by the Ministry and comprising at least 43,000 pages. It is clear to the Court that in order to provide the applicant company with an adversarial trial and \"adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [its] defence\" the applicant company should have been given an adequate opportunity to study the entirety of these documents and, more generally, to prepare for the hearings of the merits of the case on reasonable terms.\n\n540.\n\nHaving regard to the parties' arguments and the circumstances of the case, the Court is of the view that the trial court failed to reach this objective, as the mere four days during which the applicant company could have access to the case materials were insufficient for the applicant company to prepare properly, no matter the number of lawyers in its defence team or the amount of other resources which the applicant company would have been able to commit during its preparations. As regards the Government's reference to the applicant company's conduct during the proceedings and its argument that the company had no real need to study that evidence, the Court finds that it was incumbent on the trial court in the situation at hand to ensure that the applicant company had a sufficiently long period of time during which it could study such a voluminous case file and prepare for the trial hearings and it was up to the applicant company to use this time as it wished. As regards the Government's argument that the trial court was simply doing its best to comply with the two-month time-limit set out in Article 215 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure for examination of cases of this category, the Court is of the view that even though it is no doubt important to conduct proceedings at good speed, this should not be done at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the relatively short overall duration of the proceedings for a case of such magnitude and complexity.\n\n541.\n\nOverall, the Court is of the view that the applicant company did not have sufficient time to study the case file before the first instance hearings.\n\n542.\n\nThe Court takes note of the Government's argument that any possible defects in the fairness of the proceedings at first instance have been remedied on appeal or in the cassation instance. Since this argument is too closely related to the applicant company's complaint about the early beginning of the appeal hearings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case, the Court will examine them together below.\n\n*3. The complaints about the trial hearings and the allegedly bad quality of the first instance judgment*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nAs regards the applicant company's allegations that its lawyers could not obtain answers from the Ministry to all the questions they wished to ask in the hearings before the court and that the trial court abruptly interrupted the pleadings of the applicant company's lawyer, the Court finds that these complaints are vague and unspecific and there is nothing in the company's arguments to suggest that the conduct restrictions imposed by the first-instance or appeal court on the company's counsel during the hearings were arbitrary or adversely affected the fairness of the proceedings as a whole. The Court also finds unsubstantiated the applicant company's allegation that the Moscow City Court had given its judgment without having studied the evidence.\n\n*4. The complaints about the early beginning of the appeal hearings*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nThe Court observes that under Articles 257 and 259 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure a party has thirty days to file its appeal (see paragraph 422 above). It further notes that the full text of the first-instance judgment of 26 May 2004 became available to the parties on 28 May 2004 and that, despite the applicant company's requests for adjournment, the appeal hearing in the case commenced on 18 and lasted until 29 June 2004 (see paragraphs 51, 57 and 58).\n\n545.\n\nThe Court finds that the beginning of the appeal proceedings on 18 June 2004, that is, twenty-one days after the full text of the first-instance judgment on 28 May 2004 had become available, restricted the applicant company's ability to advance its arguments and, more generally, to prepare for the appeal hearings by shortening the statutory time-limit by nine days. Given the number of the participants, the complexity and magnitude of the case as well as the previous restrictions on the applicant company's ability to study the case at first instance, the Court finds that the applicant company did not have \"adequate time and facilities for the preparation of [its] defence\" within the meaning of Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b) on account of the restricted time for preparation of the appeal hearing. It also finds that the appeal court failed to acknowledge, let alone to remedy the shortcomings committed by the first-instance court as regards the applicant company's restricted access to the case file.\n\n546.\n\nIn so far as the Government relied on Article 267 of the Code of Commercial Court Procedure to justify the promptness in question, the Court would again reiterate that the legitimate goal of conducting proceedings at good speed should not have been achieved at the expense of the procedural rights of one of the parties, especially given the lack of any indication of unjustified delays in the proceedings which lasted at the first two instances for only 3 months and 15 days. In any event, the Court is not persuaded by the interpretation of the text of the provision in question suggested by the Government. It would take note of the fact that recently the domestic authorities themselves have found it necessary to modify and explain the provision in question by amending it (see paragraphs 422 and 423). In its present day version the time-limit in question lasts two months rather than one, and starts running only after the expiry of the time-limit for bringing appeals, and not simultaneously to it, as suggested by the Government in its submissions. In addition, the appeal court now has the discretion to increase the term up to six months, depending on the number of the participants and the complexity of the case.\n\n547.\n\nLastly, in so far as the respondent Government argued that the subsequent examination of the case at the cassation instance had remedied these shortcomings, the Court observes that the cassation hearing took place on 17 September 2004, four months after the disclosure of the evidence and about three months after the appeal hearing which took place between 18 and 29 June 2004. Despite the fact that the company may have had enough time to prepare for the cassation hearing, the cassation court, as a review court, had restricted competence in relation to the assessment of evidence already made by the first-instance and appeal courts (see paragraph 426) and, on the facts, it failed to recognize any shortcomings in the judgments of the lower courts (see paragraph 71).\n\n548.\n\nOverall, the Court finds that the early beginning of the appeal hearing impeded the applicant company's ability to prepare and present properly its case on appeal.\n\n*5. The complaint about the alleged delay in the production of a reasoned version of the appeal judgment*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nIn so far as the applicant company also complained about the alleged delay in providing the reasons for the Appeal Court's judgment in the proceedings in respect of the 2000 Tax Assessment, the Court would note that the applicant company did not complain about the proceedings in cassation as such but rather claimed that, in its situation, effective access to the cassation court was impossible without a stay of enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004. In this respect, the Court observes that the immediate enforcement of the appeal decision did not prevent the company from lodging its cassation appeal and whilst Article 6 provides an applicant with the right of access to court, it does not guarantee, as such, the right to an automatic stay of enforcement of an unfavourable court decision. The Court would underline that the applicant company in the present case had access to courts of two levels of jurisdiction before any enforcement measures were taken and that the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 did not make it impossible for the applicant company to exercise its right to appeal in cassation, or to pursue further proceedings by way of supervisory review or before the Constitutional Court. The applicant company lodged its cassation appeal and additional submissions on the basis of the reasoned copy of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 on 7 July 2004 (see paragraph 67). The appeal was accepted for consideration, and on 17 September 2004 its full version was examined and dismissed by the Circuit Court (see paragraph 70). Not only the cassation appeal, but also the request to stay the enforcement of the appeal decision of 29 June 2004 were examined by the domestic courts at two instances and eventually dismissed as unfounded (see paragraphs 127-129).\n\n550.\n\nOverall, the Court concludes that there is no indication of unfairness within the meaning of Article 6 on account of the alleged restrictions on the applicant company's access to the cassation instance.\n\n*6. Conclusion*\n---------------\n\n551.\n\nHaving regard to the above, the Court finds that the applicant company's trial did not comply with the procedural requirements of Article 6 of the Convention for the following reasons: the applicant company did not have sufficient time to study the case file at first instance, and the early beginning of the hearings by the appeal court unjustifiably restricted the company's ability to present its case on appeal. The Court finds that the overall effect of these difficulties, taken as a whole, so restricted the rights of the defence that the principle of a fair trial, as set out in Article 6, was contravened. There has therefore been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 6 \u00a7 3 (b).\n\nIII. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 1 OF PROTOCOL No. 1, TAKEN ALONE AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLES 1, 7, 13, 14 AND 18 OF THE CONVENTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nUnder Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken alone and in conjunction with Articles 1, 7, 13, 14 and 18 of the Convention, the applicant company complained about the allegedly unlawful, arbitrary and disproportionate imposition and enforcement of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments. The company complained furthermore that the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been unlawful, arbitrary and disproportionate.\n\n553.\n\nThese grievances fall to be examined principally under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, regard being had, where appropriate, to other Convention provisions relied on by the applicant company.\n\nArticle 1 of Protocol No. 1 reads:\n\n\"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\n\nThe preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.\"\n\n554.\n\nThe Court reiterates that in accordance with its constant and well-established case-law Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 comprises three distinct rules. The first rule, which is of a general nature, enounces the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property; it is set out in the first sentence of the first paragraph. The second rule covers deprivation of possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; it appears in the second sentence of the same paragraph. The third rule recognises that the States are entitled, amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose; it is contained in the second paragraph. The three rules are not, however, \"distinct\" in the sense of being unconnected. The second and third rules are concerned with particular instances of interference with the right to peaceful enjoyment of property and should therefore be construed in the light of the general principle enunciated in the first rule (see *Sporrong and L\u00f6nnroth v. Sweden*, 23 September 1982, \u00a7 61, Series A no. 52, and *James and Others v. the United Kingdom*, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 37, Series A no. 98).\n\n555.\n\nThe Court notes that between December 2003 and January 2005 the domestic authorities subjected the applicant company to a number of measures in connection with its alleged failure to pay the correct amount of tax for the years 2000-2003. In particular, as a result of the Tax Assessment proceedings the applicant company was found guilty of repeated tax fraud and was ordered to pay an overall sum of at least RUB 572 billion (around EUR 16 billion) in outstanding taxes, default interest and penalties. In the enforcement proceedings, simultaneously conducted, the applicant company was ordered to pay an additional 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt: its assets were attached and seized, whilst 76.79 percent of shares in its main production unit, OAO Yuganskneftegaz, were sold in satisfaction on the mentioned liability.\n\n556.\n\nThe Court notes that the parties did not dispute that these measures, whether taken alone or together, constituted an interference with the applicant company's property rights as guaranteed by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Court further notes that the company complained about the measures separately and that it also complained about the Government's intentions in connection with those measures. In this latter respect, the applicant company argued that, in bringing the relevant proceedings, the authorities had sought to destroy the company and expropriate its assets. The Court has now to satisfy itself that each instance of such interference met the requirement of lawfulness, pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate to the aim pursued.\n\n557.\n\nHaving regard to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the applicant company's complaints, the Court finds that the complaints concerning the separate decisions and measures in the context of the proceedings against the applicant company fall to be examined under the third rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, taken in conjunction, where appropriate, with other Convention provisions relied on by the applicant company. The Court will examine the complaints in the following order:\n\n(A) the complaints about various aspects of the tax assessment proceedings for the years 2000-2003;\n\n(B) the complaints concerning the measures taken by the domestic authorities to enforce the debt resulting from the tax assessment proceedings on the applicant company and the Government's related plea of non-exhaustion, which in the decision on admissibility of 29 January 2009 it joined to the merits;\n\n(C) the applicant company's allegations concerning the Government's intentions in these proceedings, made under Article 18 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n**A. The complaints about the Tax Assessments 2000-2003**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nThe Court reiterates that it was not in dispute between the parties that the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 represented an interference with the applicant company's property rights. It remains to be determined whether these decisions met the requirement of lawfulness, pursued a legitimate aim, were proportionate to the aim pursued, as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, and whether they were not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n*1. Compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Whether the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 complied with the Convention requirement of lawfulness**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nThe Court reiterates that the first and most important requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 is that any interference by a public authority with the peaceful enjoyment of possessions should be lawful: the second paragraph recognises that the States have the right to control the use of property by enforcing \"laws\" (see *Iatridis v. Greece* [GC], no. 31107/96, \u00a7 58, ECHR 1999-II). This means that the interference should be in compliance with the domestic law and that the law itself be of sufficient quality to enable an applicant to foresee the consequence of his or her conduct. As regards the compliance with the domestic law, the Court has limited power in this respect since it is a matter which primarily lies within the competence of the domestic courts (see *H\u00e5kansson and Sturesson v. Sweden*, 21 February 1990, \u00a7 47, Series A no. 171-A, and, *mutatis mutandis, Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden*, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 58, Series A no. 159). As regards the quality of the law, the Court's task is to verify whether the applicable provisions of domestic law were sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable (see *Hentrich v. France*, 22 September 1994, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 296-A, and *Lithgow and Others v. the United Kingdom*, 8 July 1986, \u00a7 42, Series A no. 110). In so far as the tax sphere is concerned, the Court's well-established position is that States may be afforded some degree of additional deference and latitude in the exercise of their fiscal functions under the lawfulness test (see *National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom*, 23 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 75-83, *Reports* 1997-VII) and that, in view of the complexity of the relevant field of regulation, corporate entities, as opposed to individual taxpayers, may be required to act with additional caution and diligence by consulting competent specialists in this sphere (see *\u0160pa\u010dek, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic*, no. 26449/95, \u00a7 59, 9 November 1999).\n\n560.\n\nThe applicant company argued in respect of the Tax Assessment 2000 that prosecution for tax evasion had been time-barred. Furthermore, it also argued that the decisions in question had been generally unlawful in that they had not been based on any reasonable and foreseeable interpretation of the domestic law, for which reason there had been no basis in law to impose taxes, double fines or to deny the repayment of VAT in respect of the export of oil and oil products. The applicant company also complained that it had been the first entity ever to have been punished for the tax optimisation scheme, hitherto generally tolerated.\n\n*i. The allegation that the prosecution for the alleged tax evasion during the year 2000 was time-barred*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u03b1. The applicant company's submissions\n--------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nThe applicant company complained that in the Tax Assessment proceedings for the year 2000 the domestic courts had failed to apply the three-year statutory time-bar set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code. Since the relevant claims by the Ministry had been time-barred by virtue of Article 113 of the Tax Code, the Tax Assessment 2000 had been unlawful, unforeseeable and retroactive in the light of the decision of the Constitutional Court of 14 July 2005. It also noted that this domestic provision applied to tax assessments proceedings in general and not just to fines and that the doubling of the fines for the year 2001 had also been unlawful.\n\n\u03b2. The Government's submissions\n-------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nThe Government disagreed. They underlined that the issue only concerned the fines for the year 2000, and not reassessed taxes or surcharges. They argued that the decision of the Constitutional Court of 14 July 2005 had simply confirmed the proper application of Article 113 of the Tax Code for all taxpayers, that it explained the meaning of this norm, that this meaning had been in line with international practice and that it had not been aimed at the applicant individually. The Government also stated that the decision had concerned the specific situation of a bad-faith tax evasion where a taxpayer hinders and obstructs tax inspections, and also relied on examples from foreign jurisdictions, where specific rules apply to taxpayers in such situations. They quoted certain Russian cases where the courts applied the Constitutional Court's ruling in a manner similar to that in the applicant company's case and also referred to the Court's judgment in the case of National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the UK. They also noted that the three-year time-limit had not been particularly long and that in other countries time-limits were even longer.\n\n\u03b3. The Court's assessment\n-------------------------\n\n563.\n\nThe Court finds at the outset that this grievance concerns the outcome of the Tax Assessment proceedings for the year 2000 only in the part concerning the imposition of penalties, since Article 113 of the Tax Code which provided for the time-limit in question, only applied to the collection of fines (see paragraph 403) and that no similar Convention issues arise in respect of the collection of additional taxes and interest payments (see paragraph 404). The Court further notes that Article 113 of the Tax Code provided for a three year time-limit for holding a taxpayer liable and that this period ran from the first day after the end of the relevant tax term. According to the practice directions of the Supreme Commercial7 Court dated 28 February 2001, the moment at which a taxpayer was held liable within the meaning of Article 113 of the Tax Code was the date of the relevant decision of the tax authority (see paragraph 405 and 406).\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: \"Commercial\" was added.\n\n564.\n\nOn the facts, such a decision in connection with the company's activities in the year 2000 was adopted on 14 April 2004 (see paragraph 21), which was clearly outside the above-mentioned three year time-limit. In response to the argument raised by the applicant company during the court proceedings, the lower courts decided that the rules on a statutory time-bar were inapplicable because the applicant company had been acting in bad faith (see paragraph 49). Thereafter the supervisory review instance decided that such an interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-limits had not been in line with the existing legislation and case-law (see paragraph 80) and referred the issue to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court, which, in turn, referred it to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 81).\n\n565.\n\nHaving initially refused to consider the applicant company's individual complaint concerning the same issue (see paragraphs 76 and 77), the Constitutional Court accepted the reference from the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court and on 14 July 2005 gave a decision in which it disagreed with the lower courts (see paragraphs 82-88), noting that the rules on the limitation period should apply in any event and that, exceptionally, if a taxpayer impeded the inspections by the tax authorities, and thereby delayed the adoption of the relevant decision, the running of the time-limit could be suspended by the adoption of a tax audit report setting out the circumstances of the tax offence in question and referring to the relevant articles of the Tax Code. Thereafter the case was referred back to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court which applied this interpretation to conclude that the applicant company had been actively impeding the tax inspections (see paragraphs 17 and 90). Since the audit report in respect of the year 2000 had been adopted and served on 29 December 2003, the court decided that the Ministry's claims for 2000 had been brought on time. The Court notes that the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005 resulted in a change in the interpretation of the relevant rules on the statutory time-limits of the proceedings. Accordingly, an issue arises as to whether such a change was compatible with the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n566.\n\nIn making its assessment the Court will take into account its previous finding that the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings were criminal in character (see *OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya Yukos* (dec.), cited above, \u00a7 453) and will also bear in mind that the change in question concerned the collection of fines for intentional evasion of tax. In this connection, it would again reiterate that the third rule of this Convention provision explicitly reserves the right of Contracting States to pass \"such laws as they may deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes\" which means that the States are afforded an exceptionally wide margin of appreciation in this sphere (see *Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden*, 7 July 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 56-63, Series A no. 159).\n\n567.\n\nThe Court reiterates the principle, contained primarily in Article 7 of the Convention but also implicitly in the notion of the rule of law and the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that only law can define a crime and prescribe a penalty. While it prohibits, in particular, extending the scope of existing offences to acts which previously were not criminal offences, it also lays down the principle that the criminal law must not be extensively construed to an accused's detriment, for instance by analogy. It follows that offences and the relevant penalties must be clearly defined by law. This requirement is satisfied where the individual can know from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with appropriate legal assistance, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (see *Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium*, nos. 32492/96, 32547/96, 32548/96, 33209/96 and 33210/96, \u00a7\u00a7 145-146, ECHR).\n\n568.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"law\" implies qualitative requirements, including those of accessibility and foreseeability (see, among other authorities, *Cantoni v. France*, 15 November 1996, \u00a7 29, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1996-V; and *E.K. v. Turkey*, no. 28496/95, \u00a7 51, 7 February 2002). These qualitative requirements must be satisfied as regards both the definition of an offence and the penalty the offence in question carries (see *Achour v. France* [GC], no. 67335/01, \u00a7 41, ECHR 2006-IV). The Court has acknowledged in its case-law that however clearly drafted a legal provision may be, in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation. There will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, *mutatis mutandis*, *Sunday Times v. the United Kingdom (no. 1)*, 26 April 1979, \u00a7 49, Series A no. 30 and *Kokkinakis v. Greece*, 25 May 1993, \u00a7 40, Series A no. 260-A). The role of adjudication vested in the courts is precisely to dissipate such interpretational doubts as remain (see *Cantoni,* cited above, \u00a7 29)*.*\n\n569.\n\nThus, the requirement of lawfulness cannot be read as outlawing the gradual clarification of the rules of criminal liability through judicial interpretation from case to case, \"provided that the resultant development is consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen\" (see *Kafkaris v. Cyprus* [GC], no. 21906/04, \u00a7 141, ECHR 2008-...).\n\n570.\n\nThe Court previously defined limitation as the statutory right of an offender not to be prosecuted or tried after the lapse of a certain period of time since the offence was committed. Limitation periods, which are a common feature of the domestic legal systems of the Contracting States, serve several purposes, which include ensuring legal certainty and finality and preventing infringements of the rights of defendants, which might be impaired if courts were required to decide on the basis of evidence which might have become incomplete because of the passage of time (see *Stubbings and Others v. the United Kingdom*, 22 October 1996, \u00a7 51, *Reports* 1996-IV).\n\n571.\n\nTurning to the facts of the case, the Court would note firstly that the rule which, in the present case, underwent changes as a result of the decision of 14 July 2005, was contained in Article 113 of Chapter 15 \"General provisions concerning the liability for tax offences\" of the Tax Code (see paragraph 403) and thus formed a part of the domestic substantive law. Even though the rule in itself did not describe the substantive elements of the offence and the applicable penalty, it nevertheless constituted a *sine qua non* condition with which the authorities had to comply in order to be able to prosecute the relevant taxpayers in connection with the alleged tax offences. Accordingly, Article 113 of the Tax Code defined a crime for the purposes of the Court's analysis of lawfulness. It remains to be determined whether in the circumstances the decision of 14 July 2005 could be seen as a gradual clarification of the rules on criminal liability which \"[was] consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen\" (see *Kafkaris*, cited above, \u00a7 141).\n\n572.\n\nIn this connection the Court may accept that the change in question did not change the substance of the offence. The Constitutional Court interpreted the existing rules on time-limits in relation to taxpayers who acted abusively. At the same time, the Court is not persuaded that the change in question could have been reasonably foreseen.\n\n573.\n\nIt observes that the decision of 14 July 2005 had changed the rules applicable at the relevant time by creating an exception from a rule which had had no previous exceptions (see paragraphs 86 and 88). The decision represented a reversal and departure from the well-established practice directions of the Supreme Commercial Court (see, by contrast, *Achour,* cited above, \u00a7 52) and the Court finds no indication in the cases submitted by the parties suggesting a divergent practice or any previous difficulty in connection with the application of Article 113 of the Tax Code at the domestic level (see paragraphs 407-408). Although the previous jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court contained some general references to unfavourable legal consequences which taxpayers acting in bad faith could face in certain situations, these indications, as such, were insufficient to provide a clear guidance to the applicant company in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n574.\n\nOverall, notwithstanding the State's margin of appreciation in this sphere, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the change in interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-bar resulting from the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005 and the effect of this decision on the outcome of the Tax Assessment 2000 proceedings.\n\n575.\n\nSince the applicant company's conviction under Article 122 of the Tax Code in the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings laid the basis for finding the applicant company liable for a repeated offence with a 100% increase in the amount of the penalties due in the 2001 Tax Assessment proceedings, the Court also finds that the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part ordering the applicant company to pay the double fines was not in accordance with the law, as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n*ii. The allegation that the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 had not been based on a reasonable and foreseeable interpretation of the domestic law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*\u03b1. The applicant company's submissions*\n----------------------------------------\n\n576.\n\nThe applicant company disagreed with the factual conclusions reached by the domestic courts in respect of the trading companies. In its submission on the admissibility of the case, the applicant company argued that it had been the wrong defendant in the tax assessment proceedings, that there had been no links of dependency between the trading companies and itself, and that there were no grounds for making the applicant company, a holding company with, at the material time, only two employees with highly important but small-scale administrative functions, liable for the trading companies' tax liabilities and creating a previously virtually unknown concept of \"bad-faith taxpayer\". In its submissions on the merits of the case, the applicant company argued that \"the Yukos Group\", including the trading companies, had operated as a unit and that the authorities had been aware of all the details of this unit's functioning, including its relations with the trading companies, because all the entities forming the group made regular tax declarations. The company also submitted that the Ministry made regular checks of the whole group, involving the mapping of the entire course of every link in the chain of transactions from the original purchase of oil by the trading companies until its export, and that Yukos officials held monthly meetings with the Ministry's officials to discuss the company's functioning and tax returns. Overall, the applicant company considered that its tax arrangement had never been secret.\n\n577.\n\nThe applicant company also submitted that Russian law had contained no legal provision allowing for the attribution of tax liabilities as had occurred in its case, that the denial of VAT reductions had been unlawful, that the use of domestic off-shores by the applicant company had been lawful, that the legal theories used by the authorities in its case had been without legal precedent, that the way in which the authorities had assessed taxes had led to double taxation, and that the payment of interest and fines had been domestically unlawful. As regards the attribution of tax liabilities, the applicant company considered that Russian law contained no provisions that permitted piercing of the corporate veil in order to hold one company liable for the actions of another, whether the latter was a subsidiary, an affiliate or a separate entity. The company claimed that the legal theories used by the Ministry in its tax assessment cases had been unprecedented and it referred to legal remedies that could have been used by the Ministry in this situation but had not been employed. In particular, the applicant company argued that the authorities should have applied the anti-transfer pricing mechanism of Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code or that the courts should have invalidated individual transactions by the trading companies so as to make either them or the applicant company's subsidiaries liable for the allegedly underpaid tax. The applicant company considered that in any event, under the applicable domestic law, the authorities could not have held it directly liable for the actions of the trading companies. Furthermore, the company relied on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code to justify the unilateral transfers of cash from the trading companies to the applicant company's Fund. It argued that there had been no such notion as \"sham entity\" in Russian law and that the \"bad faith\" doctrine had been too vague a legal tool to be used to prosecute it. The applicant company also submitted to the Court an opinion dated 7 September 2003 by the company's counsel, the law firm \"Pepelyev, Goltsblat i Partnery\", confirming the lawfulness of the arrangement whereby \"a subsidiary company makes a transfer of its profits to the parent company, which in turn creates a Fund [out of these monies] to return them to the subsidiary companies for use ... or to pay the dividends\" and also relied on case no A42-6604/00-15-818/01 to demonstrate that its tax arrangement had been lawful at domestic level. Lastly, the applicant company considered that the Government's explanations in this connection and in particular its reference to Articles 168, 169 and 170 of the Civil Code could not justify the authorities' actions in the tax assessment proceedings, since these provisions had not been relied upon by the domestic courts.\n\n578.\n\nThe applicant company further argued that the denial of tax benefits to the trading companies and the failure to repay VAT in respect of the export of oil and oil products had been unlawful and unsubstantiated. The applicant argued that the Ministry had known about all of the trading companies' transactions because of their monthly VAT returns and regular requests for tax refunds, and that since all of the traded oil had been for export and exempt from VAT its use of tax arrangements with the trading companies had not achieved any savings in this connection. Both in its initial application to the Court and in further submissions on the admissibility of the case, the applicant company expressed dissatisfaction with the domestic courts' refusal to recalculate the amount of the VAT due in the relevant Tax Assessment proceedings, purportedly as a result of the company's failure to file for VAT refunds in its own name. In its final submissions to the Court at the hearing on 4 March 2010, the company alleged that on 31 August 2004 it had filed the VAT exemption forms in its own name for each of the years 2000 to 2003. In addition, with reference to Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code, the applicant company claimed that it should not have been ordered to pay interest surcharges at all.\n\n\u03b2. The Government's submissions\n-------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nIn their admissibility observations the Government stated that the tax inspections in respect of the applicant company had been conducted in accordance with the domestic law and that the company had been acting in bad faith throughout the proceedings, in blatant breach of tax legislation, and had merely been mimicking compliance with the law. In respect of the factual conclusions of the domestic courts, they argued that the applicant company had committed blatant tax evasion, as confirmed by the findings of the domestic courts. The evidence to confirm the Ministry's claims was abundant and it was clear that the whole setup with trading companies was organised solely for the purpose of tax evasion. During the proceedings the applicant company had been unable to explain the economic reasons for the transactions in question. As an example of the sham nature of the arrangement, the Government referred to the fact, established by the domestic courts in the proceedings against the applicant company, that on one occasion a person managing one of the company's sham entities signed three contracts simultaneously in three different locations, namely Samara, Nefteyugansk and the Tomsk region, situated at great distances from each other. In addition, the Government referred to an \"internal\" opinion by the audit company PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which specifically mentioned various problems with the applicant company's \"tax optimisation\" scheme, including the Fund used by the company for receiving the money generated by the sham entities, and mentioned by the Appeal Court in its decision of 29 June 2004. This was in breach of the Russian legislation, as money could only be transferred from one independent commercial entity to another independent commercial entity in exchange or payment for services or goods (Article 575 of the Civil Code). In addition, the company misled the public in its reports and financial statements. For example, in February 2004 in its report for nine months of the year 2003 under the US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles standards, the company accounted for the difference between the nominal profit tax rate and the actual rate by its use of affiliate companies registered in foreign tax havens. This statement was not true since, as established by the domestic courts, the applicant company used sham entities located in domestic tax havens. The widespread use of promissory notes was also mentioned by the auditor as being non-compliant with the legislation in force. The Government submitted that the company's management had used this opportunity to present a distorted picture of the company's performance and thus attract investors.\n\n580.\n\nAs regards the lawfulness of the company's use of domestic tax havens, the Government referred to statements by a senior partner in the law firm \"Pepelyaev, Goltsblat i Partnery\", which advised the applicant company and its majority shareholder, Group Menatep. In an interview with the Raschyot magazine of 30 January 2001, he stated that, as time passed, any widely replicated optimisation scheme became known to the tax authorities and they started fighting it. Penalties were being imposed with regard to low quality schemes, but the better quality schemes remained safe. The use of Russian low-tax regions was a crude form: where a company was registered in, for example, Kalmykiya, while the director, office and bank account were in Moscow. In such instances the court would rule that the location of the organisation was Moscow and not Kalmykiya. The scheme would be ruined and the company be forced to pay in Moscow. However, there could be more subtle schemes, where everything was arranged in such a way that the director, accountant and some staff were in Kalmykiya and there was an account in a Kalmyk bank, [and] thus the organisation would appear to have an actual presence there. Certainly, business would be conducted in Moscow but through another company, so that the entire profit went through appropriate contracts to Kalmykiya. Such subtle schemes were left untouched because formally there was nothing to pick on. According to the Government, the applicant company used the schemes described in their crudest form and undoubtedly knew that such schemes were illegal.\n\n581.\n\nIn respect of the lawfulness of the domestic authorities' actions, the Government submitted that the company's tax liability had been established by the domestic courts on the basis of, among other things, Article 122 of the Tax Code, which penalised the understatement of revenues and corresponding taxes, RF Law no. 2116-1 of 27 December 1991 \"On profit tax of enterprises and organisations\", RF Law no. 1759-I of 18 October 1991 \"On road funds in the Russian Federation\", RF Law no. 2118-I of 27 December 1991 \"On the basics of the tax system\", RF Law no. 2030-I of 13 December 1991 \"On property tax of enterprises\", RF Law no. 1992-I of 6 December 1991 \"On valued-added tax\" and RF Law no. 3297-I of 14 July 1992 \"On closed administrative territorial entities\", which were all clear and foreseeable at the relevant time.\n\n582.\n\nIn their post-admissibility observations, the Government submitted that the company's tax arrangement, consisting of the systemic use of dozens of shell entities which were controlled by the applicant company, organised in special low-tax zones within Russia, transfers of profits from the shell entities to the applicant company and multiple layers of trading activities between the company's production units and the ultimate customer, had been clearly unlawful and had one and only one aim \u2013 to avoid payment of taxes. The applicant company tried to hide its involvement in this scheme by renaming the shell entities on a regular basis and by operating through a complex system of promissory notes' exchanges aimed at hiding the transfers of profits from the shell entities to the company. The whole setup had been managed by the applicant company, although on paper the shell entities had been owned and managed by third parties.\n\n583.\n\nThe Government also described instances where the applicant company had actively resisted the authorities by failing to present the necessary tax documents following requests by the Ministry, by attempting to hide its corporate register just prior to its seizure by the bailiffs, by making multiple offers of payment with shares in OAO Sibneft (which in reality had not belonged to the applicant company), by lying about its financial status and by rejecting the Ministry's tax claims in respect of years 2001 to 2003 instead of cooperating.\n\n584.\n\nAs regards the lawfulness of the manner in which the authorities had assessed the applicant company's liability for additional taxes, the Government relied on the Constitutional Court's judgment no. 14-P dated 28 October 1999, which had endorsed the 'substance-over-form' approach, and to the extensive case-law of the commercial courts in interpreting and applying it. In all of these cases, exactly the same method as that used by the authorities in the applicant company's case had been used \u2013 i.e. the courts had looked behind appearances and taken account of the substance of the transactions in question. As regards the bad-faith theory, the Government relied on two decisions of the Constitutional Court, nos. 138-O and 168-O, dated 25 July 2001 and 8 April 2004 respectively, and the case-law of the commercial courts. They also relied on international experience, quoting rules adopting the substance over form approach in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and the US.\n\n585.\n\nAs regards the VAT repayments, the Government insisted that the domestic law clearly adopted an approach whereby the owner of the goods in question should apply for any VAT reductions and relied on judgment no. 12-P of the Constitutional Court, dated 14 July 2003, and the extensive case-law of the commercial courts to substantiate their point. They also referred to rules in the UK and France to show that these countries used essentially the same approach in respect of VAT refunds. More generally, the Government also argued that the refusal to grant VAT repayment was a direct consequence of the company's own recklessness in operating its tax optimisation plans and that it had failed to make any attempts to comply with the legal requirements for VAT refunds even after the tax fraud had been exposed. The Government submitted that the applicant company had never made any applications for VAT refunds in its own name.\n\n586.\n\nThe Government also stated that all of the cases cited in their observations had been available in the legal database Konsultant-Plus. The authorities could not be accused of having tolerated the company's tax optimisation, as they could not have had any prior knowledge of it on account of its complex and well-masked character. They also argued that the present case had a moral and social dimension, in the sense that the applicant company had been one of the biggest taxpayers in Russia, that many social programmes run by the State had depended on the company's tax payments, that the company's resources had been transferred to it during privatisation in exchange for their efficient and honest use, and that the colossal scope of the tax evasion had led to an incorrect redistribution of wealth and the denial of their social responsibility by a small number of the company's core shareholders. The Government also insisted that the Court take into account the wide margin of appreciation which is mentioned in the Convention and recognised by the Convention case-law in any assessment of the company's complaints. They disagreed with the applicant company's argument regarding expropriation, as the Government viewed the events referred to by the applicant company as a mere enforcement of tax laws. In addition, they drew the Court's attention to the fact that the applicant company had consistently presented incomplete or untrue information in their arguments.\n\n587.\n\nLastly, they again referred to the statements on tax optimisation techniques made in 2001 by a senior partner in a law firm advising the applicant company and its controlling shareholder, in which, in the Government's opinion, he had openly conceded that the company's techniques had been unlawful and that everything depended on whether or not the given arrangements would be discovered by the authorities. In the Government's view, if this adviser knew this, then his clients, the company's majority shareholders, could not have failed to be aware of the unlawfulness of the arrangement and any associated risk.\n\n\u03b3. The Court's assessment\n-------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Court notes that in this complaint the applicant company challenged the lawfulness of the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 only in the part linked to the payment of reassessed taxes. The examination will therefore be confined to the question of the lawfulness of the additional tax liability. The Court further notes that the company did not seem to dispute that the relevant laws made it clear what taxes were due, at what rate and when. Rather, the company claimed that in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 it used lawful \"tax optimisation techniques\" which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts in 2004, 2005 and 2006. It also complained that any existing legal basis for finding the company liable fell short of the Convention requirements in respect of the quality of the law and that, in any event, the application of the relevant laws contradicted established practice. Accordingly, the Court has to determine whether the relevant tax arrangements were domestically lawful at the time when the relevant transactions took place and whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable.\n\n589.\n\nTurning to the first question, the Court would note at the outset that the applicant company disputed the findings of the domestic courts concerning the nature of relations between the applicant company and its trading entities. In view of its conclusion that the tax assessment proceedings in respect of the year 2000 did not comply with the requirements of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention, the Court is required to decide whether the factual assessments made by the domestic courts could be used for the purposes of its legal analysis under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In this respect, the Court reiterates that according to its well-established case-law it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts, which are in the best position to assess the evidence before them and establish the facts. The Court will not, in principle, intervene, unless the decisions reached by the domestic courts appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable (see, *mutatis mutandis*, *Ravnsborg v. Sweden*, 23 March 1994, \u00a7 33, Series A no. 283-B; *Bulut v. Austria*, 22 February 1996, \u00a7 29, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1996-II, and *Tejedor Garc\u00eda v. Spain*, 16 December 1997, \u00a7 31, *Reports* 1997-VIII) or if the court decisions have been issued in \"flagrant denial of justice\" (compare *Stoichkov v. Bulgaria*, no. 9808/02, \u00a7 54, 24 March 2005).\n\n590.\n\nHaving examined the materials of the case and the parties' submissions and despite its earlier conclusions under Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention in respect of the 2000 Tax Assessment (see paragraph 551), the Court has little doubt that the factual conclusions of the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings 2000-2003 were sound. The factual issues in all of these proceedings were substantially similar and the relevant case files contained abundant witness statements and documentary evidence to support the connections between the applicant company and its trading companies and to prove the sham nature of the latter entities (see paragraphs 14-18, 48, 62-63, 165, 191-193, 212 and 213). The applicant company itself did not give any plausible alternative interpretation of this rather unambiguous evidence, as examined and accepted by the domestic courts.\n\n591.\n\nFrom the findings of the domestic courts and the parties' explanations, the Court notes that the company's \"tax optimisation techniques\" applied with slight variations throughout 2000-2003 consisted of switching the tax burden from the applicant company and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia. These companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by the applicant company itself. In essence, the applicant company's oil-producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the letter-box companies at a fraction of the market price. The letter-box companies, acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to the applicant company's refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Thus, the letter-box companies accumulated most of the applicant company's profits. Since they were registered in domestic low-tax areas, they enabled the applicant company to pay substantially lower taxes in respect of these profits. Subsequently, the letter-box companies transferred the accumulated profits unilaterally to the applicant company as gifts. The Court observes that substantial tax reductions were only possible through the mixed use and simultaneous application of at least two different techniques. The applicant company used the method of transfer pricing, which consisted of selling the goods from its production division to its marketing companies at intentionally lowered prices and the use of sham entities registered in the domestic regions with low taxation levels and nominally owned and run by third persons (see paragraphs 14-18, 48, 62-63 for a more detailed description).\n\n592.\n\nThe domestic courts found that such an arrangement was at face value clearly unlawful domestically, as it involved the fraudulent registration of trading entities by the applicant company in the name of third persons and its corresponding failure to declare to the tax authorities its true relation to these companies (see paragraphs 311, 349-353, 374-380). This being so, the Court cannot accept the applicant company's argument that the letter-box entities had been entitled to the tax exemptions in questions. For the same reason, the Court dismisses the applicant company's argument that all the constituent members of the Yukos group had made regular tax declarations and had applied regularly for tax refunds and that the authorities were thus aware of the functioning of the arrangement. The tax authorities may have had access to scattered pieces of information about the functioning of separate parts of the arrangement, located across the country, but, given the scale and fraudulent character of the arrangement, they certainly could not have been aware of the arrangement in its entirety on the sole basis on the tax declarations and requests for tax refunds made by the trading companies, the applicant company and its subsidiaries.\n\n593.\n\nThe arrangement was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code, which expected taxpayers to trade at market prices (see paragraphs 395-399), and by its nature involved certain operations, such as unilateral gifts between the trading companies and the applicant company through its subsidiaries, which were incompatible with the rules governing the relations between independent legal entities (see paragraph 376). In this connection, the Court finds relevant the warning given by the company's auditor about the implications of the use of the company's special fund during the year 2002 (see paragraphs 206-209) and is not persuaded by the applicant company's reference to case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 (see paragraphs 356-357), the expert opinion of its counsel (see paragraph 577) and its reliance on Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 376).\n\n594.\n\nBy contrast to the Tax Assessments in issue, the respondent entity in case no. A42-6604/00-15-818/01 was not alleged to have been part of a larger tax fraud and the Ministry failed to prove that it had been sham. The courts established that the entity had some assets, employees and a bank account at the place of its registration and dismissed the Ministry's claims. As regards the expert opinion and the company's reference to Article 251 (1) 11 of the Tax Code, the Court finds them irrelevant as they refer to the relations of openly associated companies and not, as was the case at issue, to the use of sham entities fraudulently registered in the name of certain third parties. Thus, the Court cannot agree with the applicant company's allegation that its particular way of \"optimising tax\" had been previously examined by the domestic courts and upheld as valid or that it had used lawful \"tax optimisation techniques\" which were only subsequently condemned by the domestic courts. The above considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the findings of the domestic courts that applicant company's tax arrangements were unlawful at the time when the company had used them, were neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable.\n\n595.\n\nThe Court will now turn to the question whether the legal basis for finding the applicant company liable was sufficiently accessible, precise and foreseeable. In this connection, the Court notes that in all the Tax Assessments (see paragraphs 14-18, 48, 62-63, 165, 191-193, 212 and 213) the domestic courts essentially reasoned as follows. The courts established that the trading companies had been sham and had been entirely controlled by the applicant company and accordingly reclassified the transactions conducted by the sham entities as transactions conducted in reality by the applicant company.\n\n596.\n\nThe courts first decided that the transactions of the sham entities failed to meet the requirements of Article 39 of the Tax Code defining the notion of a sales operation (see paragraphs 48 and 324) as well as Article 209 of the Civil Code describing essential characteristics of an owner of goods (see paragraph 48 and 381). In view of the above and relying on Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code which established a refutable presumption of good faith and reasonableness of actions of the parties in commercial transactions (see paragraph 48 and 382-383), the courts then changed the characterisation of the sales operations of the sham entities. They decided that these were in reality conducted by the applicant company and that it had been incumbent on the latter to fulfil the corresponding obligation to pay various taxes on these activities. Finally, the courts noted that the setting up and running of the sham arrangement by the applicant company resulted in an understating of the taxable base of its operations and, as a consequence, the intentional non-payment of various taxes, which was punishable as a tax offence under Article 122 of the Tax Code (see paragraph 400).\n\n597.\n\nHaving regard to the applicable domestic law, the Court finds that, contrary to the applicant company's assertions, it is clear that under the then rules contractual arrangements made by the parties in commercial transactions were only valid in so far as the parties were acting in good faith and that the tax authorities had broad powers in verifying the character of the parties' conduct and contesting the legal characterisation of such arrangements before the courts. This was made clear not only by Article 10 (3) of the Civil Code relied on by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings, but also by other relevant and applicable statutory provisions which were available to the applicant company and other taxpayers at the time. Thus, Article 45 (2) 3 of the Tax Code explicitly provided the domestic courts with the power to change the legal characterisation of transactions and also the legal characterisation of the status and activity of the taxpayer, whilst section 7 of the Law on the Tax Authorities of the Russian Federation granted the right to contest such transactions to the tax authorities (see paragraph 393). In addition, the case-law referred to by the Government indicated that the power to re-characterise or to cancel bad faith activities of companies existed and had been used by the domestic courts in diverse contexts and with varying consequences for the parties concerned since as early as 1997 (see paragraphs 382-393 and paragraphs 428-468). Moreover, in a number of its rulings, including decision of 25 July 2001 no. 138-0 specifically relied upon by the domestic courts in the Tax Assessment proceedings against the applicant company (see paragraphs 384-387), the Constitutional Court confirmed the significance of this principle, having mentioned various possible consequences of a taxpayer's bad faith conduct.\n\n598.\n\nIn so far as the applicant company complained that the bad faith doctrine had been too vague, the Court would again reiterate that in any system of law, including criminal law, there is an inevitable element of judicial interpretation and there will always be a need for elucidation of doubtful points and for adaptation to changing circumstances. In order to avoid excessive rigidity, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice (see, among other authorities, *Sunday Times*, cited above, \u00a7 49 and *Kokkinakis*, cited above, \u00a7 40). On the facts, it would be impossible to expect from a statutory provision to describe in detail all possible ways in which a given taxpayer could abuse a legal system and defraud the tax authorities. At the same time, the applicable legal norms made it quite clear that, if uncovered, a taxpayer faced the risk of tax reassessment of its actual economic activity in the light of the relevant findings of the competent authorities. And this is precisely what happened to the applicant company in the case at hand.\n\n599.\n\nOverall, having regard to the margin of appreciation enjoyed by the State in this sphere and the fact that the applicant company was a large business holding which at the relevant time could have been expected to have recourse to professional auditors and consultants (see *\u0160pa\u010dek, s.r.o.*, cited above, \u00a7 59), the Court finds that there existed a sufficiently clear legal basis for finding the applicant company liable in the Tax Assessments 2000-2003.\n\n600.\n\nLastly, the Court observes that the applicant company made a number of additional arguments under this head. In particular, it also alleged that there was no basis in law to deny the repayment of VAT in respect of the export of oil and oil products, that the domestic courts had failed to apply Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code, that it should have been dispensed from payment of interest surcharges under Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code and that in respect of the year 2000 the company had been subjected to double taxation in respect of the profits of the sham entities.\n\n601.\n\nThe Court notes that both Section 5 of Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On Value-Added Tax\" governing the relevant sphere until 1 January 2001 as well as Article 165 of the Tax Code applicable to the subsequent period provided unequivocally that a zero rate of value-added tax in respect of exported goods and its refund could by no means be applied automatically, and that the company was required to claim the tax exemptions or refunds under its own name under the procedure set out initially in Letter no. B3-8-05/848, 04-03-08 of the State Tax Service of Russia and the Ministry of Finance and subsequently in Article 176 of the Tax Code to substantiate the requests in order to obtain the impugned refunds (see paragraphs 326-336). In view of the above, the Court finds that the relevant rules made the procedure for VAT refunds sufficiently clear and accessible for the applicant company to able to comply with it.\n\n602.\n\nHaving examined the case file materials and the parties' submissions, including the company's allegation made at the hearing on 4 March 2010 that it had filed the VAT exemption forms for each of the years 2000 to 2003 on 31 August 2004, the Court finds that the applicant company failed to submit any proof that it had made a properly substantiated filing in accordance with the established procedure, and not simply raised it as one of the arguments in the Tax Assessment proceedings, and that it had then contested any refusal by the tax authorities before the competent domestic courts (see paragraphs 49 and 171, 196, 196 and 216). The Court concludes that the applicant company did not receive any adverse treatment in this respect.\n\n603.\n\nAs regards the company's argument that Articles 20 and 40 of the Tax Code should have been applied by the domestic courts in their case and that the Ministry's claims were inconsistent with the above provisions, the Court notes that the Ministry and the domestic courts never relied on these provisions and there is nothing in the applicable domestic law to suggest that they had been under a legal obligation to apply these provisions to the applicant company's case. Thus, it cannot be said that the authorities' failure to rely on these provisions rendered the Tax Assessments 2000-2001 unlawful.\n\n604.\n\nFinally and in so far as the company disagreed with the interpretation of Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code by the domestic courts and also alleged to have been subjected to double taxation, the Court would again reiterate that it is not its task to take the place of the domestic courts, which are in the best position to assess the evidence before them, establish the facts and to interpret the domestic law. On the facts, the former provision only applied to cases where the taxpayer was unable to pay the tax debt solely due to the seizure of its assets and cash funds (see paragraph 402). The domestic courts established that the company had been unable to pay because of the lack of funds and not because of the injunctions and refused to apply Article 75 (3) of the Tax Code in the applicant's case (see paragraph 216). The Court does not find this conclusion arbitrary or unreasonable. Likewise, the Court finds nothing in the parties' submissions or the case file materials to cast doubt on the findings of the domestic courts, which specifically established that the Ministry took account of the sham entities' profits in calculating their claims so as to avoid double taxation (see paragraph 49).\n\n605.\n\nOverall, the Court finds that, in so far as the applicant company's argument about the allegedly unreasonable and unforeseeable interpretation of the domestic law in the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 is concerned, the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 complied with the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n**(b) Whether the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 pursued a legitimate aim and were proportionate**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n606.\n\nThe Court is satisfied that, subject to its findings in respect of the lawfulness of fines for the years 2000 and 2001 made earlier, each of the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 pursued a legitimate aim of securing the payment of taxes and constituted a proportionate measure in pursuance of this aim. The tax rates as such were not particularly high and given the gravity of the applicant company's actions there is nothing in the case file to suggest that the rates of the fines or interest payments can be viewed as having imposed an individual and disproportionate burden, as such, on the applicant company (see *Dukmedjian v. France*, no. 60495/00, \u00a7\u00a7 55-59, 31 January 2006).\n\n**(c) Conclusion concerning the compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the Tax Assessments 2000-2003**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nOverall, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the 2000-2001 Tax Assessments in the part relating to the imposition and calculation of penalties. Furthermore, the Court finds that there has been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the rest of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments.\n\n*2. Compliance with Article 14, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The applicant company's submissions**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe applicant company argued that the courts' interpretation of the relevant laws had been selective and unique, since many other Russian companies such as Sibneft and TNK International Ltd. had also used domestic tax havens.\n\n609.\n\nThe company also submitted that the authorities had tolerated and even endorsed the tax optimisation techniques used by the applicant company in that they had accepted the applicant company's and its trading companies' tax returns and payments on a regular basis, and the company's rate of tax payment had been comparable to or even higher than that of its competitors. In this connection, the applicant company relied on statistical data contained in a report by the Centre for Development, a report of the Financial Research Institute and reports of the Accounts Chamber of Russia. The company also under this heading argued that the legislative framework had permitted the company to use such techniques and that the interpretation of the domestic law in its case had been unique, selective and unforeseeable.\n\n**(b) The Government's submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nThe Government responded that the allegations that other taxpayers may have used similar schemes could not be interpreted as justifying the applicant company's failure to abide by the law. They further contended that the occurrence of illegal tax schemes at a certain stage of Russia's historical development was not due to failures or drawbacks in the legislation, but rather due to \"bad-faith\" actions by economic actors and weakened governmental control over compliance with the Russian tax legislation on account of objective criteria, such as the 1998 economic crisis and the difficulties of the transition period.\n\n611.\n\nAt present, the Government was constantly combating tax evasion and strengthening its control in this sphere. They also referred to statistical data by AK&M and some other news agencies in 2002, which had reported that OAO LUKOIL and OAO Surgutneftegas, two other large Russian oil producers, had posted sales proceeds of RUB 434.92 billion and RUB 163.652 billion and paid RUB 21.190 billion and RUB 13.885 billion in profit tax respectively, whilst the applicant company had posted sales proceeds of RUB 295.729 billion and paid only RUB 3.193 billion in profit tax. The Government submitted that at least two Russian oil majors, OAO Surgutneftegaz and OAO Rosneft, had never engaged in such practices, whilst some, in particular OAO Lukoil, had ceased using them in 2002.\n\n**(c) The Court's assessment**\n------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nThe Court will examine this grievance under Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. This former provision reads:\n\n**Article 14 of the Convention**\n\n\"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in [the] Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"\n\n613.\n\nBefore considering the complaints made by the applicant company, the Court would reiterate that Article 14 does not forbid every difference in treatment in the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Convention (see, for example, *Lithgow and Others*, cited above, \u00a7 117). It safeguards persons (including legal persons) who are \"placed in analogous situations\" against discriminatory differences of treatment; and, for the purposes of Article 14, a difference of treatment is discriminatory if it \"has no objective and reasonable justification\", that is, if it does not pursue a \"legitimate aim\" or if there is not a \"reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised\" (see, amongst many authorities, *Rasmussen v. Denmark*, 28 November 1984, \u00a7\u00a7 35 and 38, Series A no. 87). Furthermore, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in assessing whether and to what extent differences in otherwise similar situations justify a different treatment in law; the scope of this margin will vary according to the circumstances, the subject-matter and its background (*ibid.*, \u00a7 40).\n\n614.\n\nThe Court would reiterate that nothing in the case file suggests that the applicant company's tax arrangements during the years 2000-2003, taken in their entirety, including the use of fraudulently registered trading companies, were known to the tax authorities or the domestic courts and that they had previously upheld them as lawful (see paragraphs 592-594). It thus cannot be said that the authorities passively tolerated or actively endorsed them.\n\n615.\n\nAs regards the applicant company's allegation that other domestic taxpayers used or continue to use exactly the same or similar tax arrangements as the applicant company and that the applicant company was the only one to have been singled out, the Court finds that the applicant company failed to demonstrate that any other companies were in a relevantly similar position. The Court notes that the applicant company was found to have employed a tax arrangement of considerable complexity, involving, among other things, the fraudulent use of trading companies registered in domestic tax havens. This was not simply the use of domestic tax havens, which, depending on the exact details of an arrangement, may have been legal or may have had some other legal consequences for the companies allegedly using them. The Court notes that the applicant company had failed to submit any specific and reliable evidence concerning such details. It further notes that it cannot be called upon to speculate on the merits of the tax arrangements of third parties on the basis of data contained in non-binding research and information reports and that therefore it cannot be said that the situation of these third parties was relevantly similar to the situation of the applicant company in this respect.\n\n616.\n\nThe Court concludes that, in so far as the complaint about discriminatory treatment is concerned, there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n**B. The complaints about the enforcement of the debt resulting from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe Court now has to determine whether the manner in which the domestic authorities enforced the debt resulting from the 2000-2003 Tax Assessment proceedings on the applicant company complied with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n618.\n\nThe Court reiterates that the enforcement of the debt resulting from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 involved the seizure of the company's assets, the imposition of a 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt and the forced sale of the applicant company's main production unit OAO Yuganskneftegaz. These measures constituted an interference with the applicant company's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and it remains to be decided whether these measures met the requirement of lawfulness, pursued a legitimate aim and were proportionate to the aim pursued.\n\n*1. The applicant company's submissions*\n----------------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nThe applicant company complained that the enforcement proceedings in its case had been unlawful, disproportionate and arbitrary. In particular, it argued that the authorities ought to have allowed the company to settle the debt and that it had been wrong to sell off its main production unit at auction with such speed. The company complained that the courts ought to have intervened and corrected the assessment of this matter by the bailiffs. The authorities should have first considered and accepted its offers of shares in OAO Sibneft, and/or allowed the company to make deferred payments over a prolonged period. As regards such deferred payments, the company submitted that the domestic law and practice gave priority to such a solution and that OAO Rosneft was able to obtain such a deferral in respect of the tax debts of OAO Yuganskneftegaz following the auction of 19 December 2004. The company argued that it could have repaid the debt, entirely or in part, had it not been for the attachment imposed by the court. It further criticised the authorities' failure to act during the twenty-two months following the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, as well as the imposition of an unlawful and disproportionate enforcement fee.\n\n620.\n\nThe applicant company contended that the seizure had been disproportionate in that the authorities had ordered the applicant company to pay and, at the same time, had frozen the company's assets, which were worth considerably more than the company's then liability. The authorities refused to use the company's equity in the Sibneft company or other realistic means of settling the debt. According to the applicant company, the domestic authorities should have accepted those other realistic means of settlement (letter of 5 July 2004, letter of 9 August 2004, letter of 4 November 2004, letter of 23 March 2006) because they were required to do so by precedent in the practice of the commercial courts. The period of merely a couple of days granted to the applicant company for payment was absurdly short.\n\n621.\n\nThe applicant company was also of the view that the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been unlawful, disproportionate and had resulted in gross undervaluing by means of a clearly controlled auction with the unlawful participation of a sham bidder, OOO Baykalfinansgrup. It disagreed with the decision to sell OAO Yuganskneftegaz, arguing that under the domestic legislation OAO Yuganskneftegaz should have been the last item to be auctioned, and that the auction had been incapable of generating a reasonably good price because of the limited number of candidates, the widespread perception of the need for political support to acquire the item in question and insufficient time for preparation. The applicant company was also dissatisfied with the decision to sell only the voting shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, as opposed to all of the shares. The company argued that even though the authorities put no open obstacles in the path of potential buyers, there had been practical obstacles, such as the need for the buyers to comply with internal corporate procedures and to request anti-competition clearance.\n\n622.\n\nMore generally, the applicant company viewed the auction as a sham, because OAO Gazprom, OAO Rosneft (both State-owned companies with considerable involvement of State officials in their day-to-day management), the organisers of the auction and the bailiffs were acting in concert. It also relied on interviews by the then President of Russia and argued that the State banks had financed the acquisition and that the State had failed to apply anti-monopoly laws in connection with the auction. The company argued that its actions in the US bankruptcy court had had no effect on the outcome of the auction of OAO Yuganskneftegaz because neither OAO Rosneft nor OOO Baykalfinansgrup had applied for participation before the company filed for bankruptcy in the U.S.\n\n623.\n\nThe applicant company argued that the above circumstances showed that the proceedings against it, taken as a whole, were abusive in that the State clearly wanted to destroy the company and to take control of its assets.\n\n624.\n\nAs regards its alleged failure to exhaust domestic remedies, the applicant company considered that exhaustion had been unnecessary in view of the lack of prospects of success. The domestic courts consistently rejected the company's attempts to contest the actions of the bailiffs, so other attempts would have been futile. In any event, the company had not contested the valuation report in respect of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, since it was not so materially inaccurate as to be realistically challenged in litigation. Furthermore, the company submitted that it did challenge the entire process by which the voting shares in OAO Yuganskneftegaz were sold to a state-owned company, OAO Rosneft.\n\n*2. The Government's submissions*\n---------------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe Government submitted that the enforcement proceedings in respect of the applicant company had been lawful and proportionate.\n\n626.\n\nIt argued that the company had failed properly to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this part of the application. In particular, its complaints about the seizure of property pending the enforcement proceedings, the alleged failure of the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings, the alleged inaction of the bailiffs in respect of the Sibneft's shares, the order to pay a 7% enforcement fee and the circumstances of valuation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz were inadmissible on account of a failure to exhaust domestic remedies.\n\n627.\n\nThe Government pointed out that, in the course of the enforcement proceedings, there had been no restrictions on the company's production cycle or the sale of petroleum and mineral oils and that the applicant company had remained fully operational. In view of the State's wide margin of appreciation in the fiscal sphere and the applicant company's abusive conduct, illustrated by its attempts to hinder enforcement action by hiding the register of the shareholders of its three largest subsidiary companies, the Government were of the view that the fair balance between the private and public interests had been struck.\n\n628.\n\nThe Government further submitted that the procedure for compulsory recovery of arrears of mandatory tax payments had been used in respect of the applicant company, that such tax payments were recovered by way of charging the company's cash flows on bank accounts, that in the case of insufficient or non-existent funds, the recovery of tax was carried out using the taxpayer's assets and that the whole procedure was described in detail in the domestic legislation and had been followed by the authorities. In the circumstances, the measures represented the control of the use of property and were in full compliance with the Convention.\n\n629.\n\nAs regards the seizure of property, the Government referred to the *Gasus Dosier* and *AGOSI* cases and considered that, having regard to relevant factors, such as the enormous amount of arrears, the bad-faith conduct of the applicant company and the need for an expedient and efficient recovery of tax to the State budget, the measure in question was in compliance with the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The Government submitted that both the seizure and freezing orders were usual practice, both domestically and internationally, and their use was especially appropriate in the present case because of the unprecedented amounts of the tax debts, the unrepentant and defiant attitude of the applicant company, claims that the authorities' actions were a \"malicious tax racket\" and the applicant company's history, namely its management and core shareholders moving corporate assets into new shell entities and sometimes into foreign tax havens. These measures were merely precautionary in character.\n\n630.\n\nIn respect of the April injunction, the Government disagreed with the applicant company's claim that it could have repaid the debt but for the seizure of its assets. The injunction did not cover either cash or cash revenues and the applicant company did subsequently repay a portion of its debt using the cash in the frozen account. The applicant company could have had the injunction lifted had it provided adequate counter-security, which it failed to do, or liquidated some of its foreign assets not covered by the injunction. The Government maintained that instead of selling its foreign assets to meet its tax debts the applicant company simply stripped them away, which in itself proved that the company's complaint about the injunction was unsubstantiated. As regards the freezing orders, the Government submitted that they had been issued by the bailiffs pursuant to court writs dated 30 June 2004, which froze the company's accounts in Russian banks as of the date of issue of the respective freezing orders. The company could still dispose of cash added to its frozen accounts after 30 June 2004 and could use its non-seized accounts abroad. The funds in these accounts had been far lower than the company's then liabilities. The Government further noted that as of 14 July 2004 the applicant company had still to pay 96.5% of its then liability and that the company's voluntary payment only commenced on 14 July 2004, apparently as a response to the seizure of the shares of OAO Yuganskneftegaz. The very fact that the payments had been made through the frozen accounts demonstrated that the company's allegations about the effects of the cash freezing orders were untrue.\n\n631.\n\nAs regards the proposals for respite and payment spread, the applicant company first made such a request on 16 July 2004 by sending a letter to the Ministry of Finance. The Government pointed out that the Ministry of Finance had not been the proper authority to grant these measures as only a commercial court could and that the law set out clear rules regarding the conditions that should have been satisfied so that the request could be granted, i.e. the request should have been made one to six months before the original payment deadline and on specific grounds only, such as the risk of bankruptcy. In addition, the law did not allow for respite and payment spread if there were pending tax proceedings against the taxpayer at issue. The applicant not only failed to substantiate its request with reference to the criteria set out in law, but it was also clear that such a request was bound to fail because of the pending tax proceedings against the applicant company.\n\n632.\n\nThe Government relied on the applicable domestic law and cases to demonstrate that asking a guilty taxpayer to pay within one or two days had been standard and lawful practice followed in all cases. They claimed that this period was sufficient, as taxpayers usually learned about tax claims -with a specific indication of the sums to be paid - in the Ministry's audit reports, which were usually served from several weeks to a few months in advance. Thus, in the present case the applicant company had first learned of the Ministry's claims for the years 2000-2003 109, 66, 19 and 18 days in advance. More generally, in such cases the taxpayer usually knew well in advance the sums that had been underpaid (typically during tax evasion), so it cannot claim that it was unprepared. In addition, very similar practices existed internationally.\n\n633.\n\nAs to the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first item to be auctioned in satisfaction of the company's liabilities, the Government pointed out that the offers made by the applicant company had been unacceptable. The first three offers, made on 22 April, 2 July and 13-14 July 2004, all involved various portions of shares of OAO Sibneft, allegedly owned by the applicant company. All three offers were rejected, not only because the company's ownership of these shares had been contested in various unrelated proceedings by third persons, but also because the offers had been made in violation of injunctions issued by the courts in the above-mentioned unrelated proceedings. In fact, the sale of shares that did belong to the applicant company (some 20%) would have been insufficient to cover the company's then debt, even in part, let alone satisfy the Ministry's upcoming claims for the years 2001-2003. It was a minority stake of uncertain value and any such value was in any event insufficient to satisfy the company's tax arrears. As regards the fourth offer, dated 9 August 2004, it involved 20% of OAO Sibneft and a farrago of shares in fifteen companies (some of them subsidiaries, some of them minority stakes and all of uncertain liquidity). In any event, this offer was \"too little and too late\" for the Government, since preparation for the auctioning of OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been under way. The above-mentioned \"shopping list\" did not offer any guarantee of a \"good chance of fetching a price sufficient to discharge much of [the applicant's] rapidly increasing tax liabilities\" and in addition involved a high risk of third-party claims to the property in question in each case.\n\n634.\n\nThe Government maintained that the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz was lawful under Russian law, aimed at securing the payment of taxes and had been effected in full compliance with the provisions of the Federal Enforcement Proceedings Act. Under section 54 (2) of the Enforcement Proceedings Act, the sale of the applicant company's property was made by a specialised organisation pursuant to the terms of commission and the relevant legislation. On 18 November 2004 the bailiffs decided to sell 43 shares (76.8%) of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction. The Government noted that OAO Yuganskneftegaz was itself the debtor in mandatory payments to the budget totalling RUB 102.09 billion, so that the above arrears inevitably affected the price of the auctioned shares, as defined by the valuation institution and the results of the auction. The date of the auction and invitation to participate in the open auction were published in the mass media in due time. The auction itself was open, both with regard to its participants and to the form of submissions of price bids. Bids were received between 19 November and 18 December 2004. On 19 December 2004 the open auction took place. The winner of the auction was recognised as OOO Baykalfinancegrup, which offered RUB 260,753,447,303.18 for the shares in question. The auction itself was public. The mass media representatives provided extensive media coverage. The results were published in the mass media and broadcast. With regard to the proportionality of the sale, the sum of 260.5 billion roubles generated as a result of the sale did not, however, cover the arrears of OAO Yukos entirely. The Government also underlined that the subsequent bankruptcy was not caused by the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz, but had been initiated by a consortium of foreign banks and that the representatives of the applicant company had allegedly acknowledged that the company had been in good financial condition even despite the sale of OAO Yuganksneftegaz. In sum, the Government considered that there had been no breach of the Convention.\n\n*3. The Court's assessment*\n---------------------------\n\n635.\n\nThe applicant company submitted a number of grievances about these proceedings. In particular, the applicant company complained that the enforcement of the tax liability had been deliberately orchestrated with a view to preventing the applicant company from repaying its debts. In this connection the company maintained that the seizure of its assets pending litigation had prevented it from repaying the debt. It was furthermore dissatisfied that it had been ordered to pay a 7% enforcement fee in respect of the entirety of its debt, that the time for voluntary compliance with the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 had been too short and that the sale of the company's main production unit OAO Yuganskneftegaz had been unlawful, arbitrary and generally disproportionate.\n\n636.\n\nBefore turning to the substance of these complaints, the Court reiterates that in its decision on admissibility it joined to the merits the question of exhaustion of domestic remedies. Thus, the Court needs to determine whether the applicant complied with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this part of the application, as required by Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which, in its relevant parts, provides:\n\n\"1. The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law ...\"\n\n637.\n\nThe Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies under Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies which are available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain both in theory and in practice, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness. Article 35 \u00a7 1 also requires that complaints intended to be brought subsequently before the Court should have been made to the appropriate domestic body, at least in substance and in compliance with the formal requirements and time-limits laid down in domestic law and, further, that any procedural means that might prevent a breach of the Convention should have been used. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective (see, for example, *Aksoy*, 18 December 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 51-52, *Reports* 1996\u2013VI; *Akdivar and Others v. Turkey*, 16 September 1996, \u00a7\u00a7 65-67, *Reports* 1996-IV; and, more recently, *Cennet Ayhan and Mehmet Salih Ayhan v. Turkey*, no. 41964/98, \u00a7 64, 27 June 2006).\n\n638.\n\nThe Court has emphasised that the application of the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies must make due allowance for the fact that it is being applied in the context of machinery for the protection of human rights that the Contracting States have agreed to set up. Accordingly, it has recognised that Article 35 \u00a7 1 must be applied with some degree of flexibility and without excessive formalism. It has further recognised that the rule of exhaustion is neither absolute nor capable of being applied automatically; for the purposes of reviewing whether it has been observed, it is essential to have regard to the circumstances of the individual case. This means, in particular, that the Court must take realistic account not only of the existence of formal remedies in the legal system of the Contracting State concerned but also of the general context in which they operate, as well as the particular circumstances of the applicant. It must then examine whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the applicant did everything that could reasonably be expected of him or her to exhaust domestic remedies (see *Akdivar and Others*, cited above, \u00a7 69; *Aksoy*, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 53-54; and *Tanr\u0131kulu v. Turkey* [GC], no. 23763/94, \u00a7 82, ECHR 1999-IV).\n\n639.\n\nThe Court reiterates that at the admissibility stage of the proceedings the Government claimed that the applicant company had failed to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of the attachment and seizure of its assets pending the enforcement proceedings, the alleged failure by the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings, the bailiffs' alleged inaction in respect of the Sibneft shares, the orders to pay a 7% enforcement fee and the circumstances of the valuation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz.\n\n640.\n\nHaving examined the case file and the parties' submissions, the Court finds that in the part concerning the attachment and seizure of the assets the applicant company properly exhausted the available domestic remedies by raising its grievances before the competent domestic courts. The attachment order of 15 April 2004 was reviewed and upheld by the Appeal Court on 2 July 2004 (see paragraph 92) and was also examined and confirmed by the City Court in its decision of 23 April 2004 in the context of the examination of the company's request of 22 April 2004 (see paragraphs 96-97), and by the City Court and the Appeal Court on 23 April and 2 July 2004 respectively in the context of examination of the company's request for an injunction against the attachment (see paragraphs 101 and 102). The seizure order of 1 July 2004 was reviewed at first instance on 17 September 2004 and in cassation on 2 February 2005 (see paragraphs 116-120). The seizure of OAO Yuganskneftegaz on 14 July 2004 was reviewed by the courts at four instances, on 6, 9 August, 25 October and 17 December 2004 respectively (see paragraphs 137-146). As regards the seizure orders of 14 July 2004 concerning OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegaz, the City Court upheld them by respective judgments of 13 August and 2 September 2004, whilst the Circuit Court confirmed this conclusion by the respective decisions of 5 November 2004 and 18 January 2005 (see paragraphs 147-155).\n\n641.\n\nAdmittedly, the applicant company did not complain about the attachment order of 15 April 2004 by way of cassation and omitted the appeal procedure when contesting the seizure of its subsidiaries on 1 July 2004 and the seizure order of 14 July 2004 concerning OAO Tomskneft-VNK and OAO Samaraneftegaz. The Court would note, however, that given the circumstances of the applicant company's tax case, its overall situation at the relevant time, the applicable domestic law and the courts' responses to the arguments put forward by the applicant company in those proceedings, it is clear that both the attachment order of 15 April 2004 and the subsequent seizure orders of 1 and 14 July 2004 have been properly examined and confirmed by the domestic courts at various levels of jurisdictions and it does not appear that the applicant company's complaints in this connection had any additional prospects of success, had the company not omitted the above-mentioned judicial instances.\n\n642.\n\nAs regards the complaints about a 7% enforcement fee, the Court observes that the applicant company was ordered to pay this fee for the years 2000-2003. The company's challenge to this fee was examined and dismissed by the courts at three instances only in respect of the year 2000 (see paragraphs 130-134), whilst its complaints about the payment of the fee for the year 2001 were examined only at first instance and in cassation (see paragraphs 177-187). Also, it is not entirely clear whether the applicant company brought court proceedings in respect of the entire amount of the fee for the year 2002 (see paragraphs 200-204) and whether it brought any proceedings against such an order for the year 2003 (see paragraph 221). The Court again finds that, given the similarity of the orders for payment of enforcement fees for the years 2000-2003 and in view of other relevant circumstances such as the applicable domestic law and the courts' answers to the company's arguments in respect of the fee for the year 2000, there is nothing in the Government's submissions to suggest that the applicant company's complaints in this connection would have had any prospects of success had the applicant company appealed against them.\n\n643.\n\nAs regards the alleged failure by the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings and the bailiffs' alleged inaction in respect of the Sibneft shares, the Court notes that the above-mentioned grievances are entirely subsumed by the complaint concerning the method of enforcement of the tax debt and in particular the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first asset to be sold in satisfaction of the tax claims. In this connection, the Court would note that the applicant company clearly exhausted the available domestic remedies as regards the seizure and the subsequent measures leading to the eventual sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraphs 137-146), and it is also clear that the relevant domestic law specifically disallowed the courts to rearrange or otherwise postpone the repayment of the debt (see paragraphs 471-477) if there were, as in the case at hand, pending tax proceedings against the debtor. Thus, the applicant company could not have been expected to bring separate court proceedings in this connection. Overall, it is clear to the Court that the applicant company used all the remedies that it could reasonably be expected to use in connection with this part of the application.\n\n644.\n\nThus, the Court finds that the applicant company has complied with the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies in respect of this part of the application and dismisses the Government's preliminary objection accordingly.\n\n645.\n\nTurning to the substance of the applicant company's complaints, the Court notes that in April 2004, simultaneously with the Tax Assessment proceedings, the domestic authorities initiated enforcement proceedings aimed at securing their tax claims and later recovering the sums awarded by the courts as a result of the examination of these claims. They attached the company's assets located in Russia and later partly froze the company's domestic bank accounts and seized the shares of the applicant company's Russian subsidiaries. On 20 July 2004 it was decided to auction off the company's principal production subsidiary OAO Yuganskneftegaz, in satisfaction of the company's tax liability, which at the time amounted to RUB 106.182 billion (some EUR 3.005 billion). As a result of the proceedings with regard to the Tax Assessments 2001 and 2002, the company's debt to the tax authorities further increased and by the time the auction of OAO Yuganskneftegaz took place in December 2004 the company already owed the tax authorities some RUB 431.259 billion (some EUR 11.061 billion). In addition to the payments resulting from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003, the company was also required to pay the bailiffs a 7% enforcement fee on the overall amount of the debt.\n\n646.\n\nThe Court notes that the authorities used a variety of measures in connection with the enforcement of the debt, such as the attachment and freezing orders, the seizure orders, the orders to pay enforcement fees and the compulsory auction procedure. Though each of these measures could be seen as a separate instance of interference with the applicant company's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, their common and ultimate goal was to force the company to meet its tax liabilities. Accordingly, the appropriate way to analyse this part of the application is to examine the enforcement proceedings in their entirety as one continuous event. The Court further notes that the enforcement measures in question fall to be analysed under the third rule of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, which allows the member States to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest, by enforcing \"such laws as [they] deem necessary to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties\". It follows that the Court's task is to determine whether the State authorities complied with the Convention requirement of lawfulness and, if so, whether they struck a fair balance between the legitimate state interest in enforcing the tax debt in question and the protection of the applicant company's rights set forth in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n647.\n\nAs regards the lawfulness of the measures in question, the Court has no reason to doubt that throughout the proceedings the actions of various authorities had a lawful basis and that the legal provisions in question were sufficiently precise and clear to meet the Convention standards concerning the quality of law. The attachment, freezing and seizure orders were reviewed by the domestic courts and found to have been lawful. Likewise, the 7% enforcement fee was upheld by the domestic courts and cannot be said to have been selective, given the domestic case-law cited by the Government. As regards the decisions leading to the forced sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz at auction and the auction process itself, the Court notes that they too were reviewed and upheld by the domestic courts as lawful (see paragraphs 263 and 265) and there is nothing in the case file or the parties' submissions to cast doubt on these conclusions. The only question that remains is whether the enforcement measures were proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n648.\n\nIn this connection the Court would reiterate that its task is to determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the public and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights. It finds it natural that in the tax sphere the Contracting States should enjoy a wide margin of appreciation in order to implement their policies. Nevertheless, the Court cannot fail to exercise its power of review and must determine whether the requisite balance was maintained in a manner consonant with the applicant company's right to \"the peaceful enjoyment of [its] possessions\", within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n649.\n\nAt the outset the Court notes the background to this case and, in particular, the fact that the applicant company was one of the largest taxpayers in Russia and that it had been suspected and subsequently found guilty of running a tax evasion scheme, committed consecutively in 2000-2003. From the parties' submissions and the case file it seems clear that the applicant company had no cash funds in its domestic accounts to pay its tax debts immediately, and in view of the nature and scale of the debt it was unlikely that any third party would agree to assist the company with a loan or some form of security. Regard being had to the scale of the tax evasion, the sums involved for the years 2000-2003, the fact under domestic law that they were payable almost at once after the production of the respective execution writ (see paragraph 471), and even taking into account the Court's previous findings in respect of the fines for the years 2000 and 2001, it was questionable whether at the time when the authorities decided to seize and auction OAO Yuganskneftegaz the company was at all solvent within the meaning of section 3 of the Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Act, which generally expected the solvent debtor to repay its debts \"within three months of the date on which compliance should have occurred\" (see paragraph 496).\n\n650.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Court finds that the crux of the applicant company's case did not lay in the attachment of its assets and cash as such, but rather and essentially in the speed with which the authorities demanded the company to pay, in the decision which had chosen the company's main production unit, OAO Yuganskneftegaz, as the item to be compulsorily auctioned in the first instance, and in the speed with which the auction had been carried out.\n\n651.\n\nGiven the paramount importance of the measures taken by the authorities to the applicant company's future, and notwithstanding the Government's wide margin of appreciation in this field, the Court is of the view that the authorities were obliged to take careful and explicit account of all relevant factors in the enforcement process. Such factors were to include, among other things, the character and the amount of the existing debt as well as of the pending and probable claims against the applicant company, the nature of the company's business and the relative weight of the company in the domestic economy, the company's current and probable economic situation and the assessment of its capacity to survive the enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, the economic and social implications of various enforcement options on the company and the various categories of stakeholders, the attitude of the company's management and owners and the actual conduct of the applicant company during the enforcement proceedings, including the merits of the offers that the applicant company may have made in connection with the enforcement were to be properly considered.\n\n652.\n\nThe Court notes that the authorities examined and made findings in respect of some of these factors (see, for instance, the findings in respect of the offers of shares in OAO Sibneft in paragraph 124 or the findings in respect of request for payment spread in paragraph 157), but it is clear that at no point in the enforcement proceedings did they make an explicit assessment in respect of all of them. In particular, neither the seizure order of 14 July 2004, which set in motion the process of auctioning OAO Yuganskneftegaz (see paragraph 137), nor any of the subsequent decisions, including the judicial decisions in the context of the company's complaints against the actions of the bailiffs (see paragraphs 137-158), mentioned or discussed in any detail possible alternative methods of enforcement and the consequences that they might have on the future of the company.\n\n653.\n\nThe Court finds this aspect of the enforcement proceedings of utmost importance when striking a balance between the interests concerned, given that the sums that were already owed by the company in July 2004 made it rather obvious that the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz as the first item to be auctioned in satisfaction of the company's liability was capable of dealing a fatal blow to its ability to survive the tax claims and to continue its existence.\n\n654.\n\nThe Court accepts that the bailiffs were bound to follow the applicable domestic legislation which might limit the variety of options in the enforcement procedure. Nonetheless, the Court is of the view that, notwithstanding these constraints, the bailiffs still had a decisive freedom of choice, the exercise of which could either keep the company afloat or eventually lead to its demise. Although the Court, in principle, does not find the choice of OAO Yuganskneftegaz entirely unreasonable, especially in view of the overall amount of the tax-related debt and the pending as well as probable claims against the company, it is of the view that before definitively selecting for sale the asset that was the company's only hope of survival, the authorities should have given very serious consideration to other options, especially those that could mitigate the damage to the applicant company's structure. This was particularly so since all of the company's domestic assets had been attached by previous court orders (see paragraph 27), and were readily available, the company itself did not seem to have objected to their sale (see paragraph 159) and there had been virtually no risk of the company seriously opposing these actions.\n\n655.\n\nThe Court further notes one other factor which seriously affected the company's situation in the enforcement proceedings. The applicant company was subjected to a 7% enforcement fee in connection with the entire amount of its tax-related liability, which constituted an additional hefty sum of over RUB 43 billion (EUR 1.16 billion), the payment of which could not be suspended or rescheduled (see paragraphs 484-486). This was a flat-rate fee which the authorities apparently refused to reduce, and these sums had to be paid even before the company could begin repaying the main body of the debt (see paragraph 484). The fee was by its nature unrelated to the actual amount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs. Whilst the Court may accept that there is nothing wrong as a matter of principle with requiring a debtor to pay for the expenses relating to the enforcement of a debt or to threaten a debtor with a sanction to incite his or her voluntary compliance with enforcement writs, in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs. Because of its rigid application, instead of inciting voluntary compliance, it contributed very seriously to the applicant company's demise.\n\n656.\n\nLastly, the Court would again emphasise that the authorities were unyieldingly inflexible as to the pace of the enforcement proceedings, acting very swiftly and constantly refusing to concede to the applicant company's demands for additional time. Admittedly, this rigidity may have resulted at least in part from the relevant requirements of the domestic law (see paragraphs 471, 481 and 489). Nevertheless, the Court finds that in the circumstances of the case such lack of flexibility had a negative overall effect on the conduct of the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company.\n\n657.\n\nOn the whole, given the pace of the enforcement proceedings, the obligation to pay the full enforcement fee and the authorities' failure to take proper account of the consequences of their actions, the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aims sought and the measures employed.\n\n658.\n\nTo sum up, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of the applicant company's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the State's failure to strike a fair balance between the aims sought and the measures employed in the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company.\n\n**C. The complaint about the Government's intentions in the tax and enforcement proceedings against the applicant company**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n659.\n\nThe Court notes that, in addition to various specific grievances about the tax and enforcement proceedings already mentioned above, the applicant company also argued that the overall effect of these proceedings showed that the Government had brought and conducted the proceedings with the intent to destroy the company and to take control of its assets.\n\n660.\n\nThe Court will examine this part of the application under Article 18 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\n**Article 18 of the Convention**\n\n\"The restrictions permitted under [the] Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribed.\"\n\n*1. The applicant company's submissions*\n----------------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nThe applicant company argued that the circumstances of the tax assessment and enforcement proceedings as well as the allegedly \"political\" motivation behind the prosecution of Mr M. Khodorkovskiy and other owners and senior officials of the applicant company showed that the proceedings against it, taken as a whole, were abusive in that the State clearly wanted to destroy the company and to take control of its assets.\n\n*2. The Government's submissions*\n---------------------------------\n\n662.\n\nThe Government disagreed, having maintained that tax assessment and subsequent enforcement proceedings had been lawful and regular and that the applicant company's demise was the direct result of its carrying out over many years a gigantic tax fraud.\n\n*3. The Court's assessment*\n---------------------------\n\n663.\n\nThe Court reiterates that Article 18 of the Convention does not have an autonomous role. This provision can only be applied in conjunction with the Convention provisions protecting substantive rights. It also follows from the terms of Article 18 that a violation can only arise where the right or freedom concerned is subject to restrictions permitted under the Convention (see, for example, *Gusinskiy v. Russia*, no. 70276/01, \u00a7 73, ECHR 2004-IV). The Court further notes that in order to hold a member State liable under this provision an applicant should be able to furnish the Court with an incontrovertible and direct proof in support of his or her allegations.\n\n664.\n\nThe Court would observe that in its previous analysis under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 it has already addressed the applicant company's points about the nature of its debt to the authorities, and in particular the merits of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments proceedings. Despite the fact that it found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the speed with which the courts had conducted the proceedings in the 2000 Tax Assessment case and a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the interference by the Constitutional Court with the outcome of the 2000 Tax Assessment case in the part relating to penalties, the Court rejected the applicant company's claims that the company's debt had been recognised as a result of an unforeseeable, unlawful and arbitrary interpretation of the domestic law (see paragraphs 605 and 616). The Court also recognised the right of the State to enforce, as such, the court judgments, but reached conclusions concerning the handling of the enforcement proceedings by the domestic authorities which lead to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. In view of these findings, the Court will proceed on the assumption that the company's debt in the enforcement proceedings resulted from legitimate actions by the respondent Government to counter the company's tax evasion and the burden of proof would accordingly rest on the applicant company to substantiate its allegations.\n\n665.\n\nRegard being had to the case file and the parties' submissions, including the applicant company's references to the allegedly political motivation behind the prosecution of the applicant company and its owners and officials, the Court finds that it is true that the case attracted massive public attention and that comments of different sorts were made by various bodies and individuals in this connection. The fact remains, however, that those statements were made within their respective context and that as such they are of little evidentiary value for the purposes of Article 18 of the Convention. Apart from the findings already made earlier, the Court finds no indication of any further issues or defects in the proceedings against the applicant company which would enable it conclude that there has been a breach of Article 18 of the Convention on account of the applicant company's claim that the State had misused those proceedings with a view to destroying the company and taking control of its assets.\n\n666.\n\nTo sum up, the Court finds that there has been no violation of Article 18 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, on account of the alleged disguised expropriation of the company's property and the alleged intentional destruction of the company itself.\n\n**D. Alleged violations of Articles 7 and 13 of the Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n667.\n\nRegard being had to the particular circumstances of the present case and to the reasoning which led it to find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the Court finds that there is no cause for a separate examination of the same facts from the standpoint of Article 7 of the Convention and through the prism of the \"effective remedies\" requirement of Article 13.\n\nIV. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention provides:\n\n\"If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\n\n669.\n\nThe applicant company claimed a lump sum of over 81 billion euros and a daily interest payment of EUR 29,577,848 in respect of pecuniary damage, \"no less than 100,000 euros\" in respect of non-pecuniary damage and EUR 171,444.60 in respect of costs and expenses.\n\n670.\n\nThe Government disagreed, having contested both the authority of Mr Gardner to make the Article 41 claims on behalf of the applicant company as well as the well-foundedness of the calculations in question.\n\n671.\n\nThe Court considers that the question of the application of Article 41 is not ready for decision. Accordingly, it shall be reserved and the subsequent procedure fixed having regard to any agreement which might be reached between the applicant company and the respondent Government (Rule 75 \u00a7 1 of the Rules of Court).\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n----------------------------\n\n[672].\n\n1. *Finds* by six votes to one that the Court is not barred, pursuant to Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention, from examining the merits of the case;\n\n2. *Holds* by six votes to one that there has been a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention as regards the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings on account of the insufficient time available to the applicant company for preparation of the case at first instance and on appeal;\n\n3. *Holds* by four votes to three that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the 2000-2001 Tax Assessments in the part relating to the imposition and calculation of penalties;\n\n4. *Holds* unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as regards the rest of the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments;\n\n5. *Holds* unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 14 of the Convention, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1;\n\n6. *Dismisses* by a majority the Government's preliminary objection as to the exhaustion of the domestic remedies in respect of the attachment and seizure of the applicant company's assets pending the enforcement proceedings, the alleged failure by the bailiffs to grant the company access to the case in the enforcement proceedings, the bailiffs' alleged inaction in respect of the Sibneft shares, the orders to pay a 7% enforcement fee and the circumstances of the valuation and sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz; and\n\n7. *Holds* by five votes to two that there has been a violation of the applicant company's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company in that the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim of these proceedings and the measures employed;\n\n8. *Holds* unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 18, taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1;\n\n9. *Holds* unanimously that in view of its previous conclusions under Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 the case requires no separate examination under Articles 7 and 13 of the Convention;\n\n10. *Holds* unanimously that the question of the application of Article 41 is not ready for decision;\n\naccordingly,\n\n(a) *reserves* the said question in whole;\n\n(b) *invites* the parties to submit, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, their written observations on the matter and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement that they may reach;\n\n(c) *reserves* the further procedure and *delegates* to the President of the Chamber the power to fix the same if need be.\n\n[673].\n\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 20 September 2011, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[674].\n\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n\n(a) Partly dissenting opinion of Judge Jebens;\n\n(b) Partly dissenting opinion of Judge Hajiyev and Judge Bushev.\n\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE JEBENS\n-----------------------------------------\n\n[675].\n\nI respectfully disagree with the opinion expressed by the majority that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in this case in respect of the 2000-2001 Tax Assessments with regard to the imposition and calculation of penalties.\n\n[676].\n\nI find it useful to clarify the legal questions and give an outline of the developments in the domestic case-law before explaining my opinion in the case.\n\nThe legal question before the Court and the developments in the domestic case-law with respect to the imposition of penalties for tax evasion\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[677].\n\nThe applicant company complains that the imposition of tax penalties violated its right to protection of property, which is secured by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. It should be noted that the question before the Court in this respect is not whether there was a legal basis in domestic law for imposing penalties on the company for acts of tax evasion, but whether the imposition of penalties was precluded. The applicant company argues that prosecution for the alleged tax evasion had become time-barred, in that the decision which established its outstanding tax liability for the year 2000 and imposed a requirement to pay tax arrears, default interest and penalties was adopted on 14 April 2004, that is, outside the time-limit set out by the legislation.\n\n[678].\n\nThe relevant provision, namely Article 113 of the Tax Code, provided for a three-year time-limit for holding a taxpayer liable for tax offences. Under the domestic courts' practice, that period ran from the first day after expiry of the relevant tax term and ended when the taxpayer was held liable. However, the part of their interpretation of the provision which referred to the end of the period in question was the subject of several subsequent clarifications by the superior domestic courts.\n\n[679].\n\nIn its resolution of 28 February 2001 the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court indicated to the lower commercial courts that \"a taxpayer is considered to have been held liable (within the meaning of Article 113 of the Tax Code) on the date on which the head of the (relevant) tax body or his deputy takes a decision to hold this person liable for a tax offence in accordance with (the rules set out in) the Code\" (see paragraph 405 of the judgment). This interpretation was subsequently applied by the lower commercial courts. However, while it generally secured a fair balance between the interests of the tax authorities and those of taxpayers, it would seem to be problematic in situations where the taxpayer impeded the inspections by the tax authorities and thereby delayed the adoption of the relevant decision with regard to the time-limit in Article 113.\n\n[680].\n\nIn the present case several of the applicant company's subsidiaries had refused to comply at all, while others had failed to provide the documents on oil transactions which the tax authorities had requested during the on-site inspection (see paragraph 17 of the judgment). The lower courts held that in such situations the rules on the statutory time-bar were inapplicable, because the applicant company had acted in bad faith. This opinion was not upheld by the supervisory review instance, which pointed out that setting aside the time-limits would be in clear contradiction of the legislation and the relevant case-law. It therefore referred the issue to the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court, which referred it to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 564).\n\n[681].\n\nIn its decision of 14 July 2005 the Constitutional Court clarified, firstly, that the rules on time limitation for imposing penalties should apply in any event, regardless of whether the taxpayer had acted in \"bad faith\". It went on to note that, exceptionally, if the taxpayer had impeded the tax authorities' inspections and thereby delayed the adoption of the relevant decision, the running of the time-limit could be suspended by the adoption of a tax-audit report, setting out the circumstances of the tax offence in question and referring to the relevant articles of the Tax Code (see paragraph 565).\n\nWhether there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[682].\n\nThe applicant company complains about the imposition and calculation of tax penalties, but they do not claim that the decision to impose tax penalties lacked a substantive legal basis. There can be no doubt that such a basis existed in the Russian legislation (see Articles 112 \u00a7 2 and 114 \u00a7 4 of the Tax Code), and that the provision in question was sufficiently clear and foreseeable (see paragraphs 400-402).\n\n[683].\n\nFurthermore, although the clarification provided by the Constitutional Court implied a change in the interpretation of Article 113, it was consistent with the essence of the offence and did not broaden the scope of offences which could lead to prosecution for tax evasion and imposition of penalties. It is important that the novel interpretation of Article 113 did not set aside the rules on time limitations for the imposition of penalties due to tax evasion, nor did it shorten the time-limits for the imposition of such measures. In fact, the Constitutional Court merely explained the existing rules on time-limits in order to ensure their fair application to taxpayers who acted improperly.\n\n[684].\n\nAs regards the foreseeability of the measure, the matter should be seen in the light of the applicant's individual situation as well as the evolution of the Constitutional Court's jurisprudence in this sphere. The tax inspection in respect of the applicant company for the year 2000 was instituted in December 2003, and the audit report was adopted and served on the company on 29 December 2003; in other words, both those events occurred within the three-year time-limit specified in Article 113. Therefore, by that date, the company could already have reasonably expected that it was likely to face substantial penalties in connection with tax evasion.\n\n[685].\n\nIt should also be noted that the acts in question constituted tax offences at the time when they were committed and that the penalties requested by the Ministry and eventually imposed by the courts were not heavier than those applicable at that time (compare *Co\u00ebme and Others v. Belgium*, cited above, \u00a7 150). Finally, it is of relevance that the decision of 14 April 2004 was based on the same facts and the same application of the Tax Code as the audit report of 29 December 2003. It remains the fact that the applicant company hoped to avoid liability for tax evasion by actively impeding the tax inspections and delaying the adoption of the relevant decision by the tax authorities (paragraph 17). However, that in itself is, in my view, insufficient to merit protection, given the circumstances of the case.\n\n[686].\n\nIn addition, the concept of \"good faith\" within the field of tax legislation and practice was not an entirely novel one. The Constitutional Court first used the concept of \"good faith\" when assessing the conduct of taxpayers in their relations with tax officials as early as 1998. It subsequently expanded on this notion, explaining in 2001 that there existed a refutable presumption that the taxpayer was acting in good faith and that a finding that a taxpayer had acted in bad faith could have unfavourable legal consequences for the taxpayer. In view of the evolution of the Constitutional Court's jurisprudence in this sphere (see paragraphs 384-387), the applicant company could, in my opinion, have foreseen that its actions to delay the tax inspection could qualify as bad-faith conduct.\n\n[687].\n\nReferring to the circumstances of the case as explained above, the development in the superior domestic courts' interpretation of the provisions in question and the State's wide margin of appreciation in this sphere, I conclude that the Tax Assessment for 2000-2001 and the imposition of penalties complied with the requirement of lawfulness of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.\n\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE BUSHEV, JOINED IN PART BY JUDGE HAJIYEV\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[688].\n\nThe present opinion contains the joint dissenting opinion of Judge Hajiyev and of Judge Bushev with regard to the finding of a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention (parts 1 and 2 below), and that of Judge Bushev with regard to the remainder of the issues (parts 3 and 4 below).\n\nAs to the violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[689].\n\nUnfortunately, we must dissent from our colleagues' (hereinafter, the Court) finding that there was a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention in the case at hand, concerning (1) application of the 3-year limitation period, provided by article 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, in respect of the imposition of penalties for the years 2000 and 2001, and in respect of (2) certain elements of the enforcement proceedings with regard to court judgments on the debt arising from the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 (hereinafter, the enforcement procedure).\n\n[690].\n\nWe will now examine each of the aforementioned findings.\n\n**1. With regard to application of the 3-year limitation period in respect of the imposition of penalties for the years 2000 and 2001.**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[691].\n\n1.1. The Court has, in essence, agreed in full with the conclusions of the Russian courts that OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya Yukos (hereinafter, Yukos) conducted numerous illicit transactions for the sole purpose of systematically and intentionally evading the payment of taxes. In addition, the Court found that the corresponding tax legislation, in form and in content, and the actions of the authorities in pursuing the assessment of tax arrears and surcharges, fully met the high standards of the Convention. Thus, the Russian Government had enough reasonable grounds for levying taxes and surcharges from the applicant. Equally, the Court has not challenged the Russian Government's finding that Yukos actively opposed tax inspections, thus acting *mala fides*, for the purpose of drawing out the time-limits for their performance.\n\n[692].\n\n1.2. As to the levying of penalties for the intentional tax evasion, the Court did not find the rates applied excessively high or disproportional (see \u00a7 606 of the judgment). However, the Court's findings with respect to each of the three tax periods differ, depending on the possibility of applying the 3-year limitation period set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code, to the imposition of tax liability.\n\n. Thus, with respect to the penalties imposed in April 2004 for the tax violations committed in the period 2002-2003, the Court has not found any violations of the Convention, since those periods fall within the 3-year limitation period.\n\n. In accordance with the rules of application of the 3-year limitation period identified by the Court, it found that imposition of the penalties in 2004 for the tax violations committed in 2000 contradicts the requirements of Article 113 of the Tax Code.\n\n. With regard to the third period, concerning the penalties for 2001, the Court, while not doubting the grounds for their imposition, nonetheless challenged the 80 % rate of the penalty. The Court was not convinced by the Government's argument that, under Article 114 of the Tax Code, the penalty could be increased from 40% to 80% in the event of a repeat conviction. Indeed, following the Court's logic on the limitation period applicable to the penalties for 2000, there was no repetition in 2001, due to the fact that 2001, not 2000, is the first year for which the limitation period is inapplicable. In other words, the penalties for 2000 could not be treated as the initial instance of imposition of tax liability, and therefore, the increase in the penalty rate from 40% to 80% in 2001 was inadmissible, given that there was no repetition of the offence, for which liability could be imposed.\n\n[693].\n\n1.3. In examining the rule on the limitation period set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code, the Court has taken a literal approach, which has led it to find that neither the given provision, nor any other provisions of Russian legislation set out a ground for suspending or amending the limitation period. In the Court's opinion, the wording of Article 113 of the Tax Code does not render it possible to foresee any exceptions from the rule arising from certain circumstances. In particular, the Court has not supported the Government's argument that bad faith on the part of the taxpayer, expressed by actively opposing the authorities in establishing and classifying all elements of the corresponding fiscal and legal relationship, is such an exception.\n\n[694].\n\nThe Court thus considers that the rule set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code did not render it possible for a reasonable person with a fair degree of certainty to foresee any inapplicability of the 3-year limitation period, even where such a person was actively impeding the tax authorities. Hence, as regards the penalties for 2000, the Court believes that the \"quality\" of Article 113 of the Tax Code did not meet in full the requirement of lawfulness for the Government's interference in private property.\n\n1.4. We are not convinced by the Court's arguments.\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n[695].\n\nIndeed, the lawfulness criterion is an indispensable requirement in appraising a Government's activity in the light of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention. For this purpose the notion of law has a wide meaning and includes not only the acts of the respective parliament, but also delegated legislation, decrees, court practice, etc. The law has to meet certain requirements as to its form and substance. One of the requirements imposed on law under the Convention is its legal certainty, rendering it possible for private persons and public authorities to foresee the legal consequences of particular conduct. Meanwhile, the case-law of the European Court on Human Rights (the ECHR) follows the assumption that \"those consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty: experience shows this to be unattainable\" (see *Rekv\u00e9nyi v. Hungary* [GC], no. 25390/94, \u00a7 34, ECHR 1999-III and *Hertel v. Switzerland*, 25 August 1998, \u00a7 35, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1998-VI, refer also to \u00a7 598 of the judgment).\n\n[696].\n\nWe believe that in the case at hand the statutory wording (its \"quality\"), and the specific qualities of the offender were reasonable enough for it to foresee the probability that the limitation rules set out in Article 113 of the Tax Code might be inapplicable in the event of its actively opposing (obstructing) tax inspections. Let us clarify this thinking.\n\n*1.5. \"Legal quality\" of Article 113 of the Tax Code.*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n[697].\n\nNo legal system enables the domestic legislation to be descriptive enough to provide for every eventuality. Setting out a rule of conduct in statute and comprehending the implicit sense thereof is attained by virtue of various legal techniques, including, in particular, judicial interpretation, the interpretation of a rule within a system of other rules, etc. Russian legislation has been codified in the traditions of a pandectic system of law, which assumes that comprehension of the implicit sense of a given special rule can be provided often by taking into consideration a more general rule. A general rule is by default applicable to a special rule, unless the latter sets out directly (obviously) an exception (waiver) to the former. In such a codification system the interpretation principles assume that every special rule contains the provisions of a more general rule, although the literal text of the said general rule is not included in the literal text of a special rule for the purposes of legal techniques.\n\n[698].\n\nMoreover, in the pandectic system a comprehension of the implicit sense of either special or general rules ought to exist through legal principles, which have a universal and exhaustive role. The effect of a legal principle is assumed with respect to each rule of the respective branch of law; every single rule set out in legislation is to be comprehended and applied within the semantic borders of the legal principle and unless the former contradicts the latter.\n\n[699].\n\n1.6. One such general legal principle is the principle of non-abuse of one's rights and the consequent principle of refusal to grant protection to a person who has abused his or her rights. This principle is directly set out in the provisions of the branch of law which regulates property relationships and in the closely-related tax legislation.\n\n[700].\n\nThus, under Article 17 (3) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which is applicable directly to any relationship (Article 15(1)), the exercise of individual and civic rights and freedoms must not violate the rights and freedoms of others. As provided by Article 10 of the Russian Civil Code (this rule came in effect in 1995), which regulates property relationships in general, \"actions by citizens and legal entities, performed with the express purpose of inflicting damage to another person, and the abuse of civil rights in other forms shall be inadmissible\" (paragraph 1), and where a person fails to abide by this requirement a court shall have the right to reject this person's claim for the protection of that right (paragraph 2).\n\n[701].\n\n1.7. With regard to tax relationships, the Russian Constitutional Court has drawn attention to the necessity, in elucidating the special rules of tax legislation, of applying the principle of refusal of protection of rights to persons abusing those rights. The present interpretation was given by the Constitutional Court both prior to the commission of tax violations by Yukos in 2000 (Constitutional Court judgment no. 24-P of 12 October 1998) and in the course of the limitation period, when the applicant was actively impeding the tax inspection (Constitutional Court judgment no. 139-O of 25 July 2001, etc.). The Court on the other issue has also acknowledged the possibility of uncertainty in the law, including the criminal law, as well as, in essence, a need to apply the legal principles -when assessing the quality of the law on specific taxes (see \u00a7 598 in the judgment).\n\n[702].\n\n1.8. Apart from those principles, consideration should be given to a special rule in Russian legislation which could be used in comprehending the implied sense of Article 113 of the Tax Code. Thus, the Court believes that the high rate of penalties (40%) applicable in cases of intentional tax violation creates a similarity between this sanction and measures imposed under the criminal law. Therefore, the Court argues, where such tax liability is imposed, procedural guarantees similar to those applicable in cases of criminal liability should be granted. This conclusion by the Court in respect of the present case is extremely debatable (see paragraphs 3.2 \u2013 3.4 below). Nonetheless, the key issue lies elsewhere. If we follow the Court's logic, the offender, in assessing the risk of applicability of the limitation period to its case, ought also, in our view, to have (or, at least, could reasonably have) considered the special rule of criminal law. According to Article 78 (3) of the 1996 Criminal Code, \"expiry of a limitation period shall be suspended if the person who has committed the crime impedes the investigation or court trial\".\n\n[703].\n\nBesides, the rules on suspension or amendment of the limitation period as a result of certain exceptional circumstances are applicable and ultimately similar for all forms of legal liability.\n\n[704].\n\n1.9. Thus, Russian legislation contained provisions with sufficient legal certainty for the purpose of foreseeing the consequences of bad faith in opposing tax inspections and the applicability of a limitation period in this regard.\n\n[705].\n\n1.10. The Court in its judgment points to certain circumstances that *prima facie* diminish the \"quality\" of law and decrease the legal certainty of Article 113 of the Tax Code. Among such circumstances the Court refers to (i) paragraph 36 of judgment no. 5 of the Supreme Arbitration (Commercial) Court Plenum of 28 February 2001 ((\u00a7 405), hereinafter \u2013 the SAC judgment of 2001), (ii) the Constitutional Court's decision of 18 January 2005 ((\u00a7 75), hereinafter \u2013 CC Decision of 2005), (iii) the Constitutional Court's judgment of 14 July 2005 (hereinafter \u2013 the CC Judgment of 2005) and, last but not least, (iv) amendments to Article 113 of the Tax Code adopted in Federal Law no. 137-FZ of 27 July 2006 ((\u00a7 410), hereinafter \u2013 the 2006 Federal Law). Although all of these circumstances pertain to Article 113 of the Tax Code, their quantity should not affect the comprehension of the \"legal quality\" of the provision at hand.\n\n[706].\n\nIn fact, the SAC judgment of 2001 eliminated internal inconsistencies and contradictory court practice regarding the point at which tax liability is imposed (either the point of drawing up a record of a violation, or the point of adopting a resolution on the imposition of tax liability). The issue of bad faith in impeding tax inspections, and the applicability of the limitation period in this regard, was not addressed in the judgment. Neither was it touched upon in the CC Decision of 2005, which affirmatively answered a request by Yukos regarding the relevance of the limitation period's application *per se*. The Constitutional Court justified its refusal to examine Yukos's claim on the ground that it was inadmissible, as the applicant sought reassessment of the facts as stated by the arbitration (commercial) court, a matter that does not fall within the Constitutional Court's authority (paragraph 2 of the CC Decision of 2005, paragraph 1.3 of the CC Judgment of 2005).\n\n[707].\n\nThe CC Judgment of 2005 confirmed the Constitutional Court's previous finding on the refusal of protection to bad-faith taxpayers, drawing attention to the fact that the said universal principle was also to be applied for the purpose of ascertaining the implicit sense of Article 113 of the Tax Code. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court emphasised that conduct such as impeding a tax inspection might be treated as a taxpayer's abuse of rights and ought to be regarded as a certain form of bad-faith conduct by the taxpayer. The CC Judgment of 2005 indisputably increased legal certainty in comprehension of the special rule of Article 113 of the Tax Code and thus raised the degree of protection for the property interests of private persons. A comparable effect was gained through the enactment of the 2006 Federal Law. Nevertheless, the same interpretation was reasonably foreseeable on the basis of the previously existing legislative provisions, and the \"legal quality\" thereof complied fully with the requirements of the Convention.\n\n*1.11. The applicant's subjective ability to comprehend the implicit sense of the law.*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[708].\n\nIn deciding in any given case whether there has been a violation of the Convention in respect of the applicant, the ECHR considers that applicant's specific situation. Evidently, applicants' individual ability to interact with the public authorities, the degree of their security, so to speak, their ability to have victim status for the purposes of the Convention, can differ substantially. Nevertheless, in spite of its case-law, the Court in the case at hand failed to examine and refused to consider Yukos' subjective ability to foresee the consequences of its own conduct in actively impeding tax inspections, and to assess the explicit and implicit sense of Article 113 of the Tax Code. Such approach by the Court is not consistent, as on the other issue \u2013 assessment of quality of provisions of the special tax laws, i.e. of an element of the tax law offence \u2013 the Court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant was a large holding, capable to consult with experts for risk assessments (see \u00a7 599 of the judgment).\n\n[709].\n\n1.12. Yukos was one of the largest commercial companies in Russia. Running a business (carrying out for-profit activities) at one's own risks implies consent by a commercial company, in the person of its managing bodies, to accept various consequences resulting from conditions of uncertainty, including the imperfections of legislation. The consequences of such uncertainty might be either positive or negative. Therefore, in regulating relationships involving non-entrepreneurs, especially physical persons (humans), who are able to influence the consequences of their risk to a lesser degree than commercial companies, the legal certainty of legislation should be substantially higher than for entrepreneurs (commercial companies). To paraphrase the above-mentioned principle, for the purposes of the Convention the standard of legal certainty of a legal rule might be lower for commercial companies.\n\n[710].\n\nIt is undeniable that the applicant possessed an extremely high potential to assess its own legal risks; its consultants (advisors) were able to reasonably foresee all the possible consequences of application of a legal rule. One need only note that in certain proceedings the applicant was represented by 8 to 10 professional lawyers, the company carried out large-scale and legally significant activities both in Russia and abroad, implementing legal solutions that were occasionally unorthodox in the Russian legal sphere (e.g. use of transnational jurisdiction, the creation of multidivisional branches of affiliates (including sham companies) within a large Russian territory, as well as abroad). It should be mentioned that the applicant was aware of the possibility of tax liability well in advance of the expiry of the 3-year limitation period (a long-term tax inspection preceded signing the protocol on 29 December 2003, establishing tax-law violations); the decision imposing tax liability was issued with an insignificant overstepping of the 3-year term (14 April 2004, i.e. 3 and a half months); the tax authorities filed a claim for tax penalties on 14 April 2004, i.e. within the general term for public authorities to respond to tax violations, namely 3 years (the limitation period under Article 113 of the Tax Code) plus 6 months (the term for bringing a lawsuit before a court, Article 115 of the Tax Code).\n\n[711].\n\n1.13. Thus, we believe that neither the \"quality\" of the tax legislation (the objective factor), nor the alleged legal uncertainty with respect to the applicant's rights (the subjective factor) constituted a violation of Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention in terms of the existence of lawful grounds for an insignificant prolongation of the limitation period for the penalties in respect of 2000.\n\n*1.14. Retrospective effect of the CC Judgment of 2005.*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n[712].\n\nWe were also not convinced by the Court's evaluation of the significance of the retrospective effect of the CC Judgment of 2005 with regard to interpretation of Article 113 of the Tax Code. As was mentioned above, the Constitutional Court did not amend the rules on application of the limitation period, it merely increased legal certainty in comprehension of the special rule of Article 113 of the Tax Code, which, in turn, had been reasonably foreseeable. However, even if we assume that the Constitutional Court introduced a new rule on the influence of a taxpayer's bad faith on the running of the limitation period, the retrospective application of such a \"new\" rule was admissible in the given circumstances.\n\n[713].\n\nThe Convention recognizes a wide margin of appreciation for national governments in regulating taxation and levying taxes and *penalties*. The ECHR respects any decision by the national legislator in this sphere, unless such a decision obviously has no reasonable ground (see *Gasus Dosier- und F\u00f6rdertechnik GmbH v. the Netherlands*, 23 February 1995, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 306-B). The ECHR's case-law contains several instances where the Court accepted retrospective amendments to legislation and, correspondingly, the imposition of additional payments on taxpayers (see *National & Provincial Building Society, Leeds Permanent Building Society and Yorkshire Building Society v. the United Kingdom*, 23 October 1997, \u00a7 80, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1997-VII, *Di Belmonte v. Italy*, no. 72638/01, 16 March 2010).\n\n[714].\n\nIt is worth noting that in the instant case the Constitutional Court did not stipulate any additional obligations regarding the rules on charging and paying taxes, nor did it impose a different rate of tax liability. At the moment of committing the tax offence the applicant had been aware of all of the principal conditions for imposing liability. It is unlikely that establishment of a limitation period is aimed at preventing or correcting the socially undesirable conduct of private individuals. Considering the vast amounts of evaded taxes and the long-term period of the tax violations, it is hardly reasonable to assume that the applicant would have not begun evading taxes or impeding tax inspections if it had been aware that the limitation period might have been 3 years and three-and-a-half months rather than 3 years.\n\n[715].\n\n1.15. Finally, let us end with a reference to the judgment of 17 May 2010 in the case of *Kononov v. Latvia*, delivered by the Grand Chamber, in which the Court set out certain standards as to the legal certainty and foreseeability of a legal rule. We would recall that the issue in question in this case was the legal certainty of a rule which had been effective in the distant past and which became the legal ground for imprisonment of the applicant for 6 years in 2000 for \"military crimes\" committed, according to the Latvian authorities, in 1944. At the moment when the events under consideration occurred, Latvian criminal legislation did not contain any explicit provisions regarding military crimes; moreover, it stipulated general and special limitation periods for criminal liability. Those limitation periods had expired long before the beginning of the criminal proceedings against Kononov. In 1993 the provisions on limitation periods were abolished by a Latvian legislative act. Nevertheless, the ECHR held that serviceman Kononov, who, unlike the applicant in the present case, had no real opportunity to apply to consult legal advisers, relying on a combination of various international conventions and legal customs (including certain that were not officially promulgated) *could* have foreseen that his conduct might be qualified as a military crime. In this the ECHR was also not troubled by the fact that the limitation period set out in national legislation for any type of crime at the time when Kononov committed the alleged offence (1944) had expired several decades before Kononov was brought to trial in 2000 (see *Kononov v. Latvia* [GC], no. 36376/04, \u00a7 239, 17 May 2010).\n\n[716].\n\nThe right to liberty is one of the most protected rights under the Convention; it is at the summit in the hierarchy of human rights values, and therefore the standard of legal certainty in respect of it is much higher than in respect of the rules entitling national governments to control the private property of business organisations in the form of levying taxes and penalties.\n\n[717].\n\n1.16. The ECHR has repeatedly ruled that the burden of interpretation and enforcement of national legislation is primarily with the competence of national public authorities, and particularly state courts (see *Winterwerp v. the Netherlands*, 24 October 1979, \u00a7 60, Series A no. 33 and *Iglesias Gil and A.U.I. v. Spain*, no. 56673/00, \u00a7 61, ECHR 2003-V). In the case at issue the legal interpretation was given by the Constitutional Court; that interpretation is based on reasonable grounds, is not evidently unsubstantiated or unjust, and, considering the judgment in the Kononov case and the remainder of the case-law, meets the requirements of the Convention.\n\n**2. With regard to the enforcement proceedings.**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[718].\n\n2.1. In assessing the Government's actions to collect tax arrears from Yukos the Court found no breaches of national law; however, the Court held that the measures taken by the public authorities against the offending company were disproportionate (see \u00a7 647 of the judgment). According to the Court, the enforcement procedure was executed too rapidly, the applicant in fact had been provided no real opportunity for any alternative ways to pay off its tax debts, the forfeiture of stocks in OAO Yuganskneftegaz (OAO \"YNG\") (the applicant's primary business asset) by auction was not justified, etc. (\u00a7 650). At the same time, the Court did not find every single element of the enforcement proceedings to be disproportionate, but only in the cumulative effect of such elements. Further, in the Court's opinion, the State did not properly take into consideration all of the factors related to the enforcement proceedings (\u00a7 651), though it accounted a few of those (\u00a7 652).\n\n*2.2. The width of the State's margin of appreciation and factors determining its bounderies.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[719].\n\nWe would reiterate that the ECHR's case-law relies on the necessity of recognising the wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by national governments in deciding on the exact measures intended to guarantee observance of human rights. The bounds of such discretion can vary depending on the scope and the nature of a certain right, as well as other circumstances developed under the ECHR's practice (see *Buckley v. the United Kingdom*, 25 September 1996, \u00a7 74, *Reports of Judgments and Decisions* 1996-IV). For the purposes of levying taxes and penalties a government's margin of appreciation is deemed to be particularly wide (see \u00a7 648 of the judgment).\n\n[720].\n\nThe ECHR demonstrates even more tolerance towards the public authorities' actions in respect of private persons in cases where **(a)** an applicant happens to be a commercial company (see *\u0160pa\u010dek, s.r.o., v. the Czech Republic*, no. 26449/95, \u00a7 59, 9 November 1999, *Regent Company v. Ukraine*, no. 773/03, \u00a7\u00a7 60, 61 and 67, 3 April 2008). **(b)** an applicant's conduct contributed to his detriment (see *Beyeler v. Italy* [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 116, ECHR 2000-I) **(c)** the applicant behaved unfairly - *mala fides* (see *AGOSI v. the United Kingdom*, 24 October 1986, \u00a7 54, Series A no. 108, *Sarmin and Sarmina v. Russia* (dec.), no. 58830/00, 22 November 2005, *Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria*, no. 50963/99, \u00a7 89, 20 June 2002); **(d)** there is no consensus among the Contracting States, i.e. governments employ different measures under similar circumstances (see *T. v. the United Kingdom* [GC], no. 24724/94, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72, 16 December 1999), etc. Moreover, the ECHR considers the specific economic and other circumstances in which the governmental action being assessed was carried out (see *James and Others v. the United Kingdom*, 21 February 1986, \u00a7 46, Series A no. 98).\n\n[721].\n\nAll of these factors, developed in the ECHR's case-law and cumulatively denoting a need to recognize a much wider margin of appreciation for the Government than in other cases, are present here. However, they have not been taken into consideration properly by the Court.\n\n[722].\n\n2.3. Yukos at that time was one of the biggest commercial companies, not only in Russia, but throughout the world, and wielded considerable economic and other influence and power. The company engineered and implemented large-scale abusive tax schemes for the sole purpose of systematically and intentionally evading taxes. As a result, the State budget suffered a tremendous amount of damage, unprecedented in the area of tax violations. In the meantime the unpaid funds were at the company's disposal, having probably enriched substantially both the company and its shareholders. The Government's actions were aimed only at levying tax arrears and penalties (see \u00a7 646 of the judgment) the alleged political motive, and the aim of reallocating assets or another intention, unrelated to the tax collection, and selectiveness (discrimination) by the State, as claimed by the applicant, were held to be unsubstantiated (\u00a7\u00a7 616, 666). The scope and rapidity of the State measures against the applicant were determined by the scale of intentional tax violations committed by it, and by the extent of damage inflicted on the State budget (public interest). The company refused to acknowledge the unlawful nature of its activity; the company ignored the advice of its official auditor (ZAO PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit), which informed the company's management well in advance of the tax inspection of the illegality of certain operations being used to evade taxes (the promissory notes schemes, royalty-free disposal of property, etc.); the company was actively impeding the government in collecting taxes and penalties prior to and during the enforcement proceedings.\n\n[723].\n\nWe would also note that the impugned events occurred during the international financial crisis at the end of the 1990s/early 2000s, and the subsequent recovery of the Russian economy, i.e. when the violations by Yukos were especially harmful to the State budget. The State experienced a period of a transitional economy, which can be attributed to restructuring of the political machinery, assembling and adjustment of legislation, *inter alia*, in the taxation sphere, and reorganization of State bodies.\n\n[724].\n\n2.4. Naturally, whatever the wide margin of appreciation granted to a national Government, even in exceptional circumstances, such a margin cannot be boundless. It is always hypothetically possible to imagine certain cases in which the Government's actions would be disproportionate. The question is \u2013 who is best placed to assess and stipulate the extent of such appreciation? Clearly, a judge of an international court has less opportunity than a national authority, which is in the thick of the action, to appraise all the nuances and shades thereof, and to establish whether or not certain actions by the public authorities in specific circumstances were reasonable and proportionate. Finally, we must admit that a decision deemed inaccurate today might be reappraised at a later stage. An unambiguously correct appraisal, especially in complicated circumstances, is hardly possible. The multidimensional nature of the various elements involved, specific national conditions, and other circumstances that demand that a national government be granted a margin of appreciation do not deprive the ECHR of its capability to assess the boundaries of such discretion in the light of the requirements of the Convention.\n\n*2.5. The presumption that the State8 is acting in good faith.*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRectified on 17 January 2012: \"*good faith\"* was deleted.\n\n[725].\n\nThe ECHR's case-law relies not only upon a margin of appreciation, granted to public authorities, but also upon the presumption of *bona fides* on the part of a State. As with most other presumptions, the above presumption is rebuttable. However, the standard of proof to overcome the presumption of *bona fides* of a State Government is high, and irrefutable evidence must be adduced (see *Khodorkovskiy v. Russia*, no. 5829/04, \u00a7 255-256, 31 May 2011, not final). In the case at hand the Court, in spite of the claims by Yukos, found no reasonable legal grounds to overcome a presumption of the Government's good faith. Moreover, as mentioned above (paragraph 2.3.), the Court did not find any alleged political motive or any intention to liquidate the company or reallocate its assets to the interest of the third parties, or discriminatory actions, as alleged by the applicant.\n\n[726].\n\nThe Government may act *bona fides*, enjoying a wide margin of appreciation in selecting various means for protecting the public interest; however, the reverse must also be true. The main criterion in assessing the Government's activity as regards compliance with the Convention, alongside the criteria of lawfulness in actions for the public interest, is the proportionality test. Clearly, given the variety and diversity of legal solutions and national systems, defining common criteria for the concept of proportionality is hardly possible. Nonetheless, the ECHR has developed some common approaches.\n\n*2.6. Proportionality of the actions employed by the State to secure public interest*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[727].\n\nA selected remedy might be acknowledged to be disproportionate in cases when it is obviously unreasonable (see *Gasus Dosier- und Fordertechnik Gmbh* (cited above) and other cases). It is worth noting that the above-mentioned test by the ECHR does not include every form of unreasonableness, but only explicit, obvious, doubtless forms. Doubts as to reasonableness can arise on any ground, including the existence of those doubts themselves. We believe that the wider the margin of appreciation granted to the Government, the more evident the unreasonableness should be.\n\n[728].\n\n2.7. The ECHR's case-law also takes account of other factors in assessing proportionality. Thus, the existence of an effective and accessible system for appealing against the Government's acts before the courts is of great importance (see *Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy* [GC], no. 22774/93, \u00a7 54, ECHR 1999-V). Furthermore, the ECHR examines the availability to a State of less harmful remedies; however, the existence of alternative measures and their non-application in a particular case is not a sufficient and substantive ground to hold the interference in an applicant's private sphere unjustified (see *James and Others* (cited above) \u00a7 51, *Borzhonov v. Russia*, no. 18274/04, \u00a7 61, 22 January 2009).\n\n[729].\n\n2.8. The provision of compensation is a significant criterion in establishing the proportionality of specific measures by a Government. The payment of fair compensation by a State leads, as a general rule, to a finding that the requirement of proportionality has been met. The ECHR tends to apply different approaches to the consideration of proportionality in the case of State interference, depending on whether or not the applicant's conduct was lawful and whether or not the latter behaved in good faith.\n\n[730].\n\nIn the event of lawful conduct by the applicant, the compensation should, as a general rule, be equal to the damage suffered for the proportionality test to be met. At the same time, even in the event of lawful conduct by the applicant, the compensation may be less than the harm sustained by a private person (see *Jahn and Others v. Germany* [GC], nos. 46720/99, 72203/01 and 72552/01, \u00a7 94, ECHR 2005-VI, *Kozac\u0131o\u011flu v. Turkey* [GC], no. 2334/03, \u00a7 64, 19 February 2009, *Broniowski v. Poland* [GC], no. 31443/96, \u00a7\u00a7 182, 186, ECHR 2004-V), or compensation might not be paid at all (see *The Holy Monasteries v. Greece*, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 301-A). In other words, in certain exceptional circumstances the State, acting in the public interest, is justified in inflicting greater loss than may seem necessary on a private person who has behaved lawfully and in good faith.\n\n[731].\n\nWhere the applicant has behaved unlawfully and in bad faith the ECHR accepted a much higher scale of loss, and no compensation at all might be awarded. In respect of tax violations the Court recognizes and advocates the right of the Contracting States to inflict high penalties, especially if the applicant behaved *mala fides* (see *Bendenoun v. France*, 24 February 1994, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 46, Series A no. 284). Where the applicant's conduct is criminal in nature, the ECHR accepts confiscation as an indispensable and effective measure against committal of a crime, i.e. an interference in private property interests which implies no payment of compensation at all (see *Phillips v. the United Kingdom*, no. 41087/98, ECHR 2001-VII and *Denisova and Moiseyeva v. Russia*, no. 16903/03, \u00a7 58, 1 April 2010).\n\n[732].\n\nThis approach is partially supported by the concept of justifiable defence, recognised by most legal systems. As a general rule, the damage sustained by the offender may be slightly higher than the damage prevented. However, in certain exceptional circumstances, subject to the provisions of both civil and criminal law, the infliction of damage (harm) on the offender might be held to be lawful, even if the scope of the damage thus inflicted significantly exceeds the actual damage that might have been sustained were the offender to have completed his actions. In other words, in the event of unlawful conduct an offender accepts the risk of possible infliction of damage (harm).\n\n[733].\n\nUnder this logic, we believe that the infliction of damage on a bad-faith offender, in respect of the levying of taxes owed and imposition of penalties by the national government, does not constitute a violation of the Convention in this regard. In other words, the offender may suffer certain negative consequences, including, *inter alia*, those that he might not have foreseen at the moment of the unlawful conduct and others which are additional to the impact he intended to avoid or escape (arrears, default interest rate, penalties and fines, and other adverse consequences that could reasonably be foreseen under the applicable law). The existence of even highly significant damage in such a case does not in itself mean that the proportionality test has not been met.\n\n[734].\n\n2.9. Let us look again at the factual circumstances of this case, this time through the prism of proportionality.\n\n[735].\n\nThe Court did not detect any violation of national legislation in the measures applied by the Government to the company within the enforcement proceedings. Nevertheless, according to the Court, the manner in which these measures were applied \u2013 so to say, \"excessively harshly\" -does not meet the Convention requirement of proportionality. We believe that the Court, in finding disproportionality, substantially deviated from the practice developed in the ECHR's case-law. Indeed, the judgment states that, in themselves, the measures applied by the Government were not evidently unreasonable (see, for example, \u00a7 654 of the judgment). Moreover, the overwhelming majority of decisions rendered by the enforcement bodies were subject to court supervision, on the applicant's initiative. In some instances those claims were resolved in favour of the applicant.\n\n[736].\n\nAs to the existence of alternative measures, as was mentioned above, this factor is not decisive. According to the case-file, and the judgment itself, it is not clear whether any other effective remedies existed and whether their adoption would have led to the goal of collecting taxes and penalties, in satisfaction of the public interest. Thus, after the disposal of OAO YNG stocks the funds raised were still insufficient to settle the tax and penalties debt owed to the State budget. The reacquisition (redemption) price was assessed by an independent international appraiser (Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the investment branch of Dresdner Bank AG), and on the basis of the auction itself. As noted by the Court, before the enforcement proceedings were initiated, the company was probably in a state of pre-insolvency (\u00a7 649), which is proved, particularly, by the fact that the company informed the US Bankruptcy Court of its intention to file a voluntary petition for bankruptcy long before the auction (\u00a7 252). It appears from the case-file that a certain amount of assets was being rapidly transferred abroad. In such circumstances it cannot be ruled out that further procrastination and/or a decision to seize less liquid assets would have significantly reduced the Government's chances of obtaining payment of the taxes and penalties. The only possible alternative, which was offered by the company itself, was to dispose of OAO Sibneft stocks instead of the stocks in OAO YNG. However, the ownership of OAO Sibneft stocks was subject to litigation, and they were consequently regarded as less liquid.\n\n[737].\n\nIt follows that the decision to seize the applicant's primary business asset and the speed of the enforcement proceedings to collect tax payments do not seem clearly unreasonable. The measures applied by the enforcement bodies were to a large extent determined by the company's actions. The Court recognises the right of national governments to adopt remedies which might grant the State certain privileges over the remaining creditors (see *Gasus Dosier und Fordertechnik GmbH* (cited above)), i.e. the right to apply exceptional measures.\n\n[738].\n\nLet us now turn in more detail to some of the elements of the enforcement procedure. As mentioned above, each of such elements does not appear, in the circumstances of the case, entirely unreasonable, and therefore overall the procedure cannot be said to have been disproportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.\n\n*2.10. Specific elements of the enforcement procedure/interim measures.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[739].\n\nInterim measures intended to ensure enforcement, including putting a lien on assets, may be adopted in good time, before the final decision comes into effect (see *Janosevic v. Sweden*, no. 34619/97, ECHR 2002-VII), provided that such measures will not cause material adverse consequences to interested persons at an early stage and will not substantially affect their defence in forthcoming litigation. In the case at hand, considering the applicant's active impeding of the tax authorities, the use of such interim measure as attachment and freezing orders does not seem unreasonable; the lawfulness of the corresponding State actions was upheld by the national courts. Clearly, interim measures are likely to cause a certain inconvenience in most cases, and might even have adverse consequences for an applicant. However, the applicability of such measures, and the corresponding consequences of their use for Yukos were reasonably foreseeable. The interim measures applied to Yukos did not affect its business activity; nor could they negatively affect the applicant's capability to defend itself in court.\n\n*2.11. Seven-percent enforcement fee.*\n--------------------------------------\n\n[740].\n\nAs regards the seven-percent enforcement fee, the Court, having recognised that collection of that fee was a common practice in Russia (see \u00a7 647 of the judgment), nonetheless considered the amount to be disproportionate, as it significantly exceeded the expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne by the State for the enforcement proceedings (\u00a7 655). The Court's reasoning on the compensatory nature of that fee is not fully clear. Indeed, the Constitutional Court in its Judgment \u2116 13-P of 30 July 2001 (\u00a7 485), clearly stated that the enforcement fee is a type of administrative penalty and is not designed for compensation of enforcement expenses. The procedure for such compensation is stipulated in another statutory provision, namely section 82 of the Enforcement Proceedings Act. The penalty in question is imposed by the bailiff should his proposal for voluntary enforcement of the court award not be met (\u00a7 484). Failure to impose the penalty or a reduction in its amount in the case at hand would have amounted to non-compliance by the bailiff with the statutory requirements, and to discrimination against similar non-payers. The Court based its conclusion on this issue on an incorrect interpretation of the national law, having reached its conclusion on the basis of a misunderstanding about the nature and function of the fee in question (compensation, as opposed to a penalty).\n\n*2.12. Auctioning of the shares of OAO YNG.*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[741].\n\nAuctioning of the shares of OAO YNG, one of the key enforcement measures, was not, as stated by the Court entirely (evidently) unreasonable (see \u00a7 654 of the judgment), and, therefore, in our view, may not in itself be seen as disproportionate (see paragraph 2.6. above). In addition, the following events, which took place after the auction was completed, deserve attention, since they might implicitly provide evidence of the actual economic meaning of the enforcement proceedings for the company.\n\n[742].\n\nMore than a year passed between completion of the enforcement proceedings and the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings; the bankruptcy proceedings were initiated by a consortium (syndicate) of major western banks, seeking debt collection under a credit agreement awarded by a British court judgment; the management of Yukos repeatedly announced that the auction had not negatively affected the company's commercial viability. It is also worth considering that it was not the business assets of OAO YNG that were disposed of in the auction in question, but a controlling block of stocks. Obviously, such a change in the controlling stockholder might eventually lead to certain changes in the respective company's business. Nevertheless, the respective company's commercial obligations to third parties, particularly OAO YNG's obligations to Yukos, are based on contractual rather than corporate relations (creditors' rather than stockholders' control). Thus, a change in stakeholder (whose opportunity to exercise control over a respective company is limited by law), or even numerous changes in stakeholder, do not automatically lead to a weakening of business commitments. A substitution of the controlling stakeholder is not a legal ground for amendment or termination of commercial contracts, unless the latter explicitly provides otherwise. The case-file does not contain any reliable evidence that OAO YNG breached or failed to perform any of its contractual obligations to Yukos, and the latter made no claims to that effect.\n\n[743].\n\n2.13. As a conclusion, with due account for the arguments set out above, and for other circumstances (the applicant's unlawful and bad-faith conduct, the tremendous extent of damage caused by the violations, a lack of consensus among Contracting States, etc.), we believe that the Court, having referred to the concept of a wide margin of appreciation enjoyed by national governments in tax disputes, in fact failed to apply this concept to the case at hand, thus disregarding the ECHR's own case-law.\n\nAs to the violation of Article 6 of the Convention\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n[744].\n\nI cannot support my colleagues (hereafter, the Court) in their finding of a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 (b) of the Convention for the following reasons.\n\n[745].\n\n3.1. In the present case dozens of hearings were held in the national courts at various instances and several hundred procedural actions were taken. Of the numerous uncompromising procedural struggles conducted with varying success by the parties, the Court has identified two counts where, in its opinion, the Government, firstly in the form of the first-instance court, and secondly in the form of the appellate court, acted too speedily. In both instances the applicant was allegedly granted insufficient time to prepare for the court hearings, which had possibly affected the capability of Yukos's legal advisers to counter effectively the tax authorities' lawyers. Both of those episodes concern only the litigation on the collecting of tax payments for 2000. The Court did not find any procedural violations in the chains of court proceedings on collection of tax payments for 2001, 2002 and 2003 or the litigation regarding the enforcements proceedings.\n\n[746].\n\n3.2. My first counter-argument refers to both of the omissions identified by the Court.\n\n[747].\n\nThe ECHR's practice in evaluating tax disputes in the light of Article 6 of the Convention is extremely contradictory, in that, under Article 6, tax disputes do not come under either criminal or civil law (see *Ferrazzini v. Italy* [GC], no. 44759/98, ECHR 2001-VII and *Finkelberg v. Latvia* (dec.), no. 55091/00, 18 October 2001). The ECHR tends to dismiss such cases. An exception is made for cases in which the rigidity of the liability imposed on the applicant verges toward a criminal sanction. At the same time, the rigidity of the sanction is not the sole criterion inviting application of the standards set out in Article 6. A brief overview of the relevant \"for and against\" practice is set out in the joint partly dissenting opinion of Judges Costa, Cabral Barreto and Mularoni, joined by judge Caflisch, in the case of *Jussila v. Finland* ([GC], no. 73053/01, ECHR 2006-XIII). That particular precedent was referred to by the Court when declaring admissible the applicant's complaint under Article 6 of the Convention (admissibility decision, \u00a7 451).\n\n[748].\n\n3.3. Nonetheless, in terms of application of Article 6, the present tax case differs substantially from the case of *Jussila*, and from the other precedent which was taken as a basis for the latter, namely *Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom* ([GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, ECHR 2003-X). In both of those cases the judgments were delivered on the basis of applications from physical persons, not a commercial company. In both Finland and the United Kingdom (and in many other European countries), unlike as in Russia, criminal liability of legal entities is not excluded. Although the Convention's protection extends to the rights of legal entities, one of the four named criteria is qualification of the tax violation as a criminal offence under national legislation. That criterion is not decisive for the purposes of the Convention; however, it must be taken into consideration together with the other criteria.\n\n[749].\n\nUnder Russian legislation the liability imposed on legal entities is administrative, but not criminal. However, this does not exclude the possibility of simultaneously imposing criminal sanctions on physical persons \u2013 including a company's managers who personally participated in taking an unlawful decision on behalf of a legal entity. It is to physical persons that the guarantees concerning criminal prosecution set out in Article 6 are granted (free assistance of an interpreter, free access to legal representation by a court-appointed lawyer, etc.).\n\n[750].\n\n3.4. It should be noted that the judgment in the *Jussila* case was delivered in November 2006, that is, two years after the events and circumstances assessed in the present case. In this respect, given the contradictions and inconsistency in the ECHR's previous case-law, the public authorities hardly had an opportunity to take into account the provisions and standards developed therein. Given the above, in any event, I consider that the standard of requirements with regard to Article 6 of the Convention in this case should have been less harsh.\n\n[751].\n\nLet us now examine briefly each of the violations detected by the Court in respect of the litigation concerning payments for 2000.\n\n*As regards the lack of time granted to the applicant for familiarization with the case file prior to the hearing before the first-instance court (see \u00a7\u00a7 536-541 of the judgment)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[752].\n\n3.5. The Court found that the mere four days granted to the applicant for familiarisation with the case files in the tax authorities' (\"the Ministry's\") premises could have adversely affected the capability of Yukos' numerous legal counsel to prepare the applicant's case efficiently (\u00a7\u00a7 540, 551). It is to be recalled that the tax authorities filed the claim with the court on 14 April 2004, and the main court hearing was held more than a month later \u2013 from 21 to 26 May 2004 (\u00a7 46). Further to the court's procedural decision of 15 April 2004 the tax authority provided the applicant with an opportunity to familiarise itself with the case files from 17 to 20 May 2004, that is, four days. In the Government's submission, which was not disputed by the applicant, the filed documents primarily contained financial and other detailed source documents, which were formerly in Yukos's possession and/or with which it ought to have been familiar.\n\n[753].\n\nWith regard to the lack of time granted to the applicant for preparing the case, the Court investigated only one of the numerous elements in such preparation \u2013 the time for familiarisation with the case files in the tax authorities' premises. This method of familiarisation is by no means the only one, and, in the present case, was probably far from the primary method for acquiring knowledge of the procedural opponent's arguments and the relevant evidence. Having found the four-day term insufficient for familiarisation with the case files in the tax authorities' premises, the Court extended this finding to the remaining stages of preparation of the applicant's case. The question is therefore whether the relatively short time (four days) for familiarisation with the case file in the tax authorities' premises could have significantly affected the applicant's awareness of the case files, and whether the applicant was deprived of other available instruments for familiarisation with the case files and of an opportunity to prepare the defence properly? This question must be answered in the negative.\n\n[754].\n\n3.6. The ECHR's case-law is based on the presumption that failure to provide documents for familiarisation does not in itself constitute a violation of Article 6. What is required is that the content of a document of which the applicant was unaware at a certain point was material and could therefore have affected the applicant's legal argumentation (see *Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 and Others v. the Czech Republic*, no. 35376/97, \u00a7\u00a7 40-44, 3 March 2000).\n\n[755].\n\nFor instance, the ECHR did not find a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in a criminal case in which the text of a sentence transmitted to the appeal court contained significant digressions and discrepancies from the text of the sentence served on the convicted person. All of these differences were held to be insignificant and not to affect - to an extent inconsistent with the guarantees of Article 6 - the applicants' right to defend themselves (see *Karyagin, Matveyev and Korolev v. Russia*, nos. 72839/01, 74124/01 and 15625/02, 28 May 2009)\n\n[756].\n\n3.7. I would suggest that, in preparing for the hearing before the first-instance court the applicant was aware, or could have familiarised itself in good time with the content of the documents; the new data which the applicant was allegedly unable to discover from the served documents was not material and could not affect the applicant's legal argumentation.\n\n[757].\n\nThus, the overwhelming majority of the documents with which the applicant intended to familiarise itself initially originated from the applicant itself; the court proceedings were preceded by a long-term tax inspection; the applicant was capable of familiarising itself with the documents in question not only in the tax authorities' premises, but also at the court, since documents are filed simultaneously with the court as attachments to the statement of claim; the tax authorities' arguments with regard to the numerous documents were set out systematically in the tax inspection statement of 29 December 2003 and in the decision (resolution) of 14 April 2004, and remained unchanged throughout the entire court proceedings; the overall duration of the proceedings in the case before all three instances exceeded five months (from 14 April to 17 September 2004); it is not clear from the applicant's subsequent procedural documents how its statement of defence had significantly changed or might have changed had the applicant been granted more than four days to familiarise itself with the files in the tax authorities' premises at the initial stage of the proceedings.\n\n*As to the commencement of the court proceedings before the appellate court before expiry of the time-limit for lodging an appeal (see \u00a7 544-548 of the judgment)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[758].\n\n3.8. On 1 June 2004 one of the respondents \u2013 OOO \"Yukos-Moskva\" (Yukos-Moskva) \u2013 lodged an appeal against the first-instance court's judgment with a court of appeal, as did the tax authority on 2 June 2004. Under a ruling (decision) of 4 June 2004 the hearing was scheduled for 18 June 2004 (see \u00a7\u00a7 52-54 of the judgment). On the eve of the hearing, on 17 June 2004, the second respondent \u2013 Yukos \u2013 also lodged its appeal (\u00a7 55). The court hearing lasted several days, from 18 to 29 June 2004, and the applicant (respondent) was represented by 10 attorneys (\u00a7\u00a7 57, 60).\n\n[759].\n\nThe cassation petition was filed by the respondent \u2013 Yukos \u2013 on 7 July 2004, i.e. less than 10 days after the appeal court judgment, and long before expiry of the statutory two-month period for applying to the next court instance. The applicant's arguments as set out in the cassation petition were the same as those in its submissions to the appellate court (\u00a7 67). The cassation proceedings were held more than two months later, on 17 September 2004 (\u00a7 70).\n\n[760].\n\nThe court judgments and decisions at all instances provided a detailed response to the applicant's arguments.\n\n[761].\n\nUnder the legislation in force at the material time, an appeal had to be judged *within a month* of being lodged with a court, including the time required to prepare for the proceedings and render a decision (\u00a7 423). The judgment on the appeal lodged by Yukos-Moskva on 1 June 2004 was rendered on 29 June 2004, that is, one day before expiry of the statutory one-month term (\u00a7 62).\n\n[762].\n\nYukos-Moskva, which was the first party to submit an appeal, served as a management company for Yukos (\u00a7 1). In those circumstances, it would be unreasonable to assume that these two respondents had not mutually coordinated and adjusted the other's positions or, at the least, were not aware of them, and that Yukos' procedural capacities were less than those of the company acting as the applicant's executive body, namely Yukos-Moskva.\n\n[763].\n\nBesides, as noted above, the overall duration of the proceedings in the case at all three instances exceeded five months, the case was subject to review at fourth instance, and the overall duration was nearly fifteen months. It is difficult to accept that the overall duration of the proceedings before the national courts was unreasonably short, and that there was therefore a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention in this respect. I would even suggest that, had the duration of the proceedings before the appeal court been extended, the applicant would have alleged, so to speak, the opposite violation of the Convention \u2013 namely, that the duration was unreasonably long (compare, for example, the allegation of a violation of the Convention with regard to exceeding - by two days - of the time-limit for preparation of the appeal court's judgment (decision, \u00a7 43, judgment \u00a7 527 (5), and the judges' unanimous opinion that this allegation was ill-founded (\u00a7\u00a7 549, 550)).\n\n[764].\n\nAs mentioned above, the ECHR relies upon the necessity of recognising the supremacy of national courts in ascertaining the facts and circumstances of a given case and interpreting national legislation. The applicant's arguments concerning the lack of time for preparation of its case and the non-observance of the time-limits for examining the proceedings before the court of appeal were investigated by the Court and found to be insufficient and unsubstantiated (\u00a7\u00a7 71, 72 and others).\n\nAs to the admissibility of the application \u2013 Article 35 of the Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[765].\n\nOn 29 January 2009 the Court issued a decision declaring the application admissible. At the same time, under Article 35 \u00a7 4 of the Convention, the Court must reject any application which it considers inadmissible due to any deterrent circumstances at any stage of the proceedings, i.e. also after the decision as to the admissibility of the application has been issued. Let us consider a few circumstances which were not fully reflected in the decision as to admissibility, but were in part assessed by the Court.\n\n*The power of attorney of the applicant's lawyer Piers Gardner*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[766].\n\n4.1. The ECHR pays particular attention to verification of the validity of the authority held by the applicant's representative in every case (see, *inter alia*, *Post v. the Netherlands,* no. 21727/08, 20 January 2009), and the absence of a duly-issued authority to act is a ground for finding a case inadmissible. Unfortunately, in the case at hand this requirement was not met.\n\n[767].\n\nThe case file contains a notice by the insolvency administrator appointed in the course of Yukos's bankruptcy procedure \u2013 a private person entitled by law to act on behalf of the company \u2013 which revokes the authority to act initially granted to Mr Gardner and empowering him to represent the applicant before the ECHR (see \u00a7 299 of the judgment). It was Mr Gardner who filed the documents on behalf of the applicant, both prior to and following liquidation of the company, and who, notwithstanding the cancellation of his authority to act, represented the applicant in the hearings. The notice of the revocation of Mr Gardner's authority was served to the ECHR prior to termination (liquidation) of the company as a legal entity, at a time when executive decisions could be taken only by the insolvency administrator. In addition, the authority to act granted to Mr Gardner by way of delegation, contained numerous legal omissions, affecting its validity and consequently rendering it null and void, irrespective of the insolvency administrator's notice of revocation, and Professor Valeriy A. Musin, my predecessor as *ad hoc judge* in this case, rightly drew attention to them by dissenting from the majority in the admissibility decision.\n\n*As to the admissibility of the case before the ECHR before all domestic remedies have been exhausted \u2013 Article 35 \u00a7 1 of the Convention*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[768].\n\n4.2. As was mentioned above, throughout the enforcement proceedings numerous interim measures were taken for the purpose of compelling the applicant to pay the taxes and penalties. Some of these measures were challenged by the applicant in the domestic courts. However, in respect of many other measures the applicant failed to use the available domestic remedies first, but submitted the application in their respect to the ECHR directly (such as the seizure, certain of the bailiff's decisions on imposition of the 7% penalty, etc.).\n\n[769].\n\nThe Court, irrespective of whether a given measure was assessed by a national court, considered the interim measures in their totality and found that their joint application had been disproportionate (see paragraph 2.1. above). As a general rule, the ECHR may examine any given alleged violation of the Convention only after all domestic remedies have been exhausted. In the case at hand, application of that rule on exhaustion would have led to a requirement to dismiss certain interim measures from the Court's assessment. The absence of certain interim measures from the examined \"total\" would possibly have mitigated the Court's finding as to the disproportionality of the totality of the interim measures imposed on the applicant in the enforcement proceedings: the \"totality\" in this case would have been significantly decreased. However, the Court managed to overcome this possible logical trap by stating that, with regard to the considered measures, it was highly probable that the domestic courts would have rejected the applicant's claims, and that applying to them would therefore have been pointless. The Court thereby established an exception from the exhaustibility rule in respect of the examined interim measures (see \u00a7\u00a7 636\u2013644 and \u00a7 6 of the operative provisions of the judgment).\n\n[770].\n\nMeanwhile, in spite of their similarities, such cases contain numerous procedural and factual specificities, which could result in different decisions by the national courts. It is to be noted that the applicant was frequently successful in its procedural struggles with the tax authorities on similar measures. For example, the first-instance court, upholding a motion by Yukos, suspended enforcement of the tax authority's decision on payment of 14 April 2004 (\u00a7 105*)*; the same court reversed a bailiff's decision on imposing a 7% penalty (\u00a7 132) and reversed the bailiff's decision on seizing the shares (\u00a7 41), etc.; the company repeatedly obtained a reduction in the amounts levied (decision, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 53, 66), etc.\n\n[771].\n\nIn line with the Court's logic, the following - clearly inaccurate -conclusion might be reached. Where there exists an extensive case-law by the national courts on any given matter, any applicant may apply to the ECHR directly, since the outcome of his or her case before the national courts is foreknown with a high, albeit not 100%, degree of probability. Yet a dispute may contain certain specific factual and procedural features, which may lead to the opposite conclusion [by the domestic courts]. Examination and assessment of such specificities is the priority of the national courts.\n\n[772].\n\nIn view of the above considerations, I cannot agree with the Court's finding as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies.\n\n[773].\n\nIt is also difficult to refrain from a question concerning the exhaustibility of the measures taken to protect the applicant's interests. Given the national courts' numerous findings as to various violations of the tax legislation, what was to prevent Yukos, its shareholders and other interested parties from claiming compensation directly from those physical persons and legal entities who intentionally took decisions to adopt the abusive tax schemes, resulting in the losses by virtue of their arrogant activity; from those persons who are likely to have enriched themselves as a result of their illicit activity, covered by the Yukos corporate veil.\n\n*As to examination by the ECHR of a case which is substantially the same as a matter subject to a procedure of international investigation or settlement*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[774].\n\n4.3. Under Article 35 \u00a7 2 of the Convention the Court shall not deal with any application that is substantially the same as a matter that has already been examined by the ECHR or has already been submitted to another procedure of international investigation or settlement and contains no relevant new information.\n\n[775].\n\nIn the Court's opinion, the matter accepted for judgment by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, pursuant to a legal action by the majority stockholders of Yukos (Yukos Universal Ltd., and others) against the Russian Federation under the Energy Charter Treaty, was not a bar to further examination of the case by the ECHR. The Court considered that, inasmuch as the parties in both cases were not identical the cases were substantially different (see \u00a7 526 of the judgment). Such a formal approach in the case at hand can hardly be accepted. In its arguments, the Court refers to a series of benchmarks developed in the ECHR's case-law to distinguish different cases depending on the substantive nature of their respective similarities and divergences (the parties to the dispute, the substance and legal grounds of the redress sought, etc. - \u00a7 521). Yet in distinguishing between the cases under examination, the Court applied only the criterion of the parties to the respective proceedings. In this case, however, that criterion alone is insufficient to conclude that the cases are *substantially* distinct, irrespective of the fact that the legal entities acting as applicants in the two sets of proceedings are not formally identical.\n\n[776].\n\n*Firstly*, a legal entity as a legal institution, that is, as a product of legal techniques, a legal *fiction*, ultimately serves to represent the interests of certain individuals. The use of distinct legal entities in those two sets of proceedings does not itself imply that the judgments in the respective cases will affect the interests of different (distinct) individuals. Bearing in mind the close affiliation of the companies in the Yukos Group, it would be reasonable to assume that, most likely, identical individual persons have a stake in the outcomes in each set of proceedings.\n\n[777].\n\nThe Court failed to explain why it chose not to observe the rule laid down in the case of *Cereceda Martin and Others v. Spain* (no. 16358/90, Commission decision of 12 October 1992) \u2013 the formal identity of the parties in any given case is insignificant when the claim, in essence, is submitted by the same complainants or interested parties.\n\n[778].\n\n*Secondly*, I would suggest that Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention, in referring to the substance of the matter, primarily concerns the merits (the substantial part) of the dispute, i.e. those criteria that the Court chose not to consider in the case at hand. Were it otherwise, it would be too simple to overcome the restriction set out in Article 35 \u00a7 2 (b) of the Convention by, for example, assigning rights to an affiliate, or submitting identical applications in the name of different stakeholders, etc.\n\n[779].\n\nIn both sets of proceedings the primary question to be examined by the courts was the same \u2013 assessment of the tax schemes applied by Yukos and of the State's corresponding response."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-07-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** |\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n| **2000 Audit Report** | Field Tax Audit Report No. 08-1/1, dated 29 December 2003, finding that Yukos operated a tax evasion scheme |\n| **2000 Decision** | Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1, dated 14 April 2004, holding Yukos liable for a tax offense and reassessing approximately USD 3.48 billion in taxes against Yukos for the year 2000 |\n| **2001 Decision** | Decision No. 30-3-15/3, dated 2 September 2004, holding Yukos liable for a tax offense and reassessing approximately USD 4.1 billion in taxes against Yukos for the year 2001 |\n| **2002 Decision** | Decision No. 52/896, dated 16 November 2004, holding Yukos liable for a tax offense and reassessing approximately USD 6.7 billion in taxes against Yukos for the year 2002 |\n| **2003 Decision** | Decision No. 52/985, dated 6 December 2004, holding Yukos liable for a tax offense and reassessing approximately USD 6 billion in taxes against Yukos for the year 2003 |\n| **2003 Interim Dividend** | Yukos' declaration of a USD 2 billion interim dividend in November 2003 |\n| **2004 Decision** | Decision No. 52/292, dated 17 March 2006, holding Yukos liable for a tax offense and reassessing approximately USD 3.9 billion in taxes against Yukos for the year 2004 |\n| **ADR** | American Depositary Receipt |\n| **A Loan** | USD 1 billion loan entered into on 24 September 2003 by Yukos from the Western Banks and secured by certain of Yukos' oil export contracts and by YNG |\n| **April 2004 Injunction** | Ruling by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court dated 15 April 2004 prohibiting Yukos from alienating and encumbering its assets |\n| **Baikal** | Baikal Finance Group, the entity which purchased YNG at auction and which was bought by Rosneft |\n| **BBS Companies** | Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South Petroleum Limited |\n| **B Loan** | USD 1.6 billion loan entered into on 30 September 2003 by Yukos from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale S.A. and fully collateralized in cash by GML |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Term** | **Definition** |\n| **Chr\u00e9tien letters** | Letters from Jean Chr\u00e9tien to Prime Minister Fradkov, dated 6 and 15 July 2004, and to President Putin, dated 30 July 2004, 10 September 2004 and 17 November 2004 |\n| **Claimants** | Hulley, VPL, and YUL |\n| **Claimants' Post-Hearing** **Brief** | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, dated 21 December 2012 |\n| **Claimants' Skeleton** | Claimants' Skeleton Argument, dated 1 October 2012 |\n| **Confidential Sale** **Agreement** | Confidential sale agreement between the Western Banks and Rosneft dated 13 December 2005 |\n| **Counter-Memorial** | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, dated 4 April 2011, as corrected 29 July 2011 |\n| **Cyprus-Russia DTA** | Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Cyprus and the Government of the Russian Federation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, signed on 5 December 1998 |\n| **DCF** | Discounted Cash Flow |\n| **Dresdner** | ZAO Dresdner Bank |\n| **Dresdner Summary Letter** | Dresdner Summary Valuation Opinion Letter dated 6 October 2004 |\n| **Dresdner Valuation Report** | Dresdner Valuation Report of YNG dated 6 October 2004 |\n| **EBITDA** | Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization |\n| **ECHR** | European Convention on Human Rights |\n| **ECT (or Treaty)** | Energy Charter Treaty, 2080 UNTS 95, signed on 17 December 1994 |\n| **ECtHR** | European Court of Human Rights |\n| **ECtHR Yukos Judgment** | OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v.

Over 8,800 exhibits have been filed with the Tribunal.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, 15 March 2012 \u00b6 1199(3) (hereinafter \"Reply\").\n\n5.\n\nThe facts of this dispute have been the subject of attention in the media for more than a decade, involving as they do, as central actors, Mr. Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian Federation, and a Russian \"oligarch\", Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who, at the outset of the dispute, was the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Officer of Yukos, then the largest oil company in Russia and one of the largest oil companies in the world.\n\n6.\n\nThroughout this lengthy and heavily contested arbitration, in circumstances that were often trying and stressful, counsel for the Parties acted in a highly professional way. The Tribunal is most grateful for their assistance. The Tribunal particularly acknowledges the grace and acuity of the participation of Mr. Robert Greig, who was forced by ill health to retire in the midst of the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nHaving studied carefully the voluminous record of these three arbitrations, and having weighed the arguments of the counsel who have so ably represented the Parties, the Tribunal is now ready to deliver its Final Awards.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Interim Awards recount in detail the procedural history of the arbitrations from their commencement up until the date those Awards were issued. The Tribunal has also issued 18 procedural orders, each of which contains a relevant procedural history. In this Part of the Final Award, the Tribunal recalls only the key procedural details from the early phase of the proceedings and summarizes developments since November 2009.\n\n**A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 2 November 2004, all three Claimants delivered to the President of Russia notifications of claim with respect to Russia's alleged violation of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (\" **ECT** \" or \" **Treaty** \") and sought to settle the disputes amicably pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT.3\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Lisbon, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95 (hereinafter \"ECT\" or \"Treaty\").\n\n10.\n\nHaving failed to settle their disputes amicably within the three-month period prescribed under Article 26(2) of the ECT, on 3 February 2005, Hulley and YUL initiated arbitration proceedings through Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim against Respondent. Subsequently, through a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 14 February 2005, VPL initiated arbitration proceedings against Respondent. Claimants' requests for arbitration against Respondent were made pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (\" **UNCITRAL Rules** \").\n\n11.\n\nClaimants alleged that Respondent had expropriated and failed to protect Claimants' investments in Yukos, resulting in \"enormous losses,\" and sought all available relief in respect of those losses.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe history of the constitution of the Tribunal is recounted in detail in the Interim Awards. The Tribunal is composed of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel (appointed by Respondent on 8 April 2005), Dr. Charles Poncet (appointed as a replacement arbitrator by Claimants on 24 September 2007) and The Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC (appointed as Chairman on 21 July 2005 by the agreed appointing authority, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \")).\n\n13.\n\nOn 1 August 2005, the Parties agreed on The Hague as the legal seat of the arbitrations.\n\n14.\n\nOn 15 October 2005, Respondent submitted its Statements of Defense, in which it objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and denied Claimants' allegations of expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 October 2005, a preliminary procedural hearing was held in The Hague, at which the Parties and members of the Tribunal signed Terms of Appointment confirming, *inter alia*, that: (a) the members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed in accordance with the ECT and the UNCITRAL Rules; (b) the proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules; (c) the International Bureau of the PCA would act as registry; (d) the dispute would be decided in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law; (e) the language of the arbitration would be English; and (f) all pleadings, documents, testimonial evidence, deliberations and actions taken by the Tribunal would remain confidential in perpetuity, unless the Parties were to release the arbitrators from this obligation. The Tribunal also set a procedural calendar and determined that it would rule on Respondent's plea concerning jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claim as a preliminary question. The calendar was confirmed in **Procedural Order No. 1** on 8 November 2005.\n\n**C. PRELIMINARY PHASE ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent filed its First Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 28 February 2006 and Claimants filed their Counter-Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 30 June 2006.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 September 2006, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2** dealing with document production. The Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on whether requests relating to the Parties' respective \"unclean hands\" contentions and Respondent's contention that the corporate personality of Claimants \"must be disregarded\" because they are \"an instrumentality of a criminal enterprise\" should be considered during the jurisdiction and admissibility phase or deferred to the merits phase.\n\n18.\n\nOn 31 October 2006, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3**, in which it deferred consideration of the Parties' contentions concerning \"unclean hands\" and Respondent's \"criminal enterprise\" contention to the merits phase. On 3 November 2006, Claimants submitted a stipulation of facts, and on 8 November 2006, Respondent submitted its observations on the stipulation.\n\n19.\n\nBetween November 2006 and November 2008, the Tribunal issued six further procedural orders relating to the conduct of the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of the arbitrations. During this period the Parties exchanged two rounds of written submissions on jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as Skeleton Arguments for the hearing. As noted in the Interim Awards, the written record in the jurisdictional phase contained detailed and extensive filings of hundreds of pages, accompanied by over a thousand exhibits and dozens of witness statements.\n\n20.\n\nThe **hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility** was conducted at the Peace Palace in The Hague, from 17 to 21 November, 26 to 29 November and 1 December 2008.\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 November 2009, the Tribunal rendered the **Interim Awards**, stating in operative part:\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISSES the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on Article 1(6) and 1(7), Article 17, Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Article 45 of the ECT;\n\n(b) DEFERS its decision on the objection to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on Article 21 of the ECT to the merits phase of the arbitration, consistent with [paragraph numbers], above;\n\n(c) CONFIRMS that its decision on the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility involving the Parties' contentions concerning \"unclean hands\" and Respondent's contention that \"Claimant's personality must be disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a criminal enterprise\" is deferred to the merits phase of the arbitration, consistent with Procedural Order No. 3;\n\n(d) HOLDS that, subject to the preceding two sub-paragraphs, the present dispute is admissible and within its jurisdiction, and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Russian Federation in connection with the merits of the present dispute;\n\n(e) RESERVES all questions concerning costs, fees and expenses, including the Parties' costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination; and\n\n(f) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect within 60 days of receipt of this Interim Award.\n\n22.\n\nOn 4 February 2010, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal \"to protest Claimants' counsel's publication of the [Interim Awards] in violation of applicable obligations,\" noting that the Interim Awards had appeared on various websites.\n\n**D. BIFURCATION AND OTHER SCHEDULING MATTERS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 24 February 2010, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they disagreed as to whether or not to bifurcate the proceedings between a liability and a damages phase, and as to the sequence and timing of document production. Following an exchange of submissions on these issues, a hearing was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London on 7 May 2010.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 10** on 13 May 2010, in which it: (a) decided that documentary discovery would take place in a single phase, after the Parties' first round of written pleadings on the merits; (b) deferred the decision on bifurcation of the proceedings between a liability and a quantum phase and on the issue of referral arising under Article 21 of the ECT until after the Parties' first round of written pleadings on the merits; and (c) fixed a procedural calendar. The Tribunal specified that the Parties' first round of written pleadings on the merits was to address all issues, including the deferred preliminary questions, liability, quantum and the issue of referral under Article 21 of the ECT. With respect to documentary discovery, the Tribunal confirmed that some of its earlier rulings on requests relating to \"unclean hands\" and \"criminal enterprise\" in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase had been without prejudice to the Parties' ability to restate one or more of these requests in the merits phase. The Parties also agreed for each filing that they would submit one brief and one set of exhibits for all three cases.\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 10 (as amended by the Tribunal on 23 June 2010), Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits (\" **Memorial** \") on 16 September 2010. It spanned 424 pages and was accompanied by 1045 exhibits, nine witness statements and two expert reports (with annexures). On 17 November 2010, further to a request by Respondent, Claimants provided an electronic copy of the appendices to the report of Claimants' damages expert.\n\n26.\n\nOn 4 November 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Baker Botts LLP was joining Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as Respondent's counsel in these arbitrations.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\" **Counter-Memorial** \") on 4 April 2011 and submitted a corrected version on 29 July 2011. The Counter-Memorial spanned 787 pages and was accompanied by 2868 exhibits and eight expert reports (some with annexures).\n\n28.\n\nOn 29 April 2011, the Parties filed their respective submissions on the bifurcation of the proceedings and the issue of referral arising under Article 21 of the ECT. A hearing on these matters was held at the Church House Conference Centre in London on 9 May 2011.\n\n29.\n\nOn 31 May 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 11**, in which it: (a) denied Respondent's request that the proceedings be bifurcated between a liability and a damages phase; (b) reserved its decision on referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT to a later stage of the proceedings, when the evidentiary record would be completed; and (c) ordered the Parties to proceed in accordance with the amended procedural calendar.\n\n**E. DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Parties exchanged requests for documents on 17 June 2011 and the following month exchanged objections and comments on objections to the document requests. Respondent also requested an oral hearing on disclosure issues and repeated a request for more time to file its Rejoinder.\n\n31.\n\nOn 11 August 2011, the Tribunal ruled on certain procedural aspects of document production and the timing of submissions, and informed the Parties that it \"considered then, as it does today, that the Amended Procedural Calendar is in compliance with the requirement of due process and equality between the parties taking into account all the circumstances.\"\n\n32.\n\nOn 16 September 2011, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 12**, in which it ruled on the Parties' document requests (with some rulings being \"without prejudice\" to a further decision after the reply rounds of written submissions).\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 23 September 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the European Court of Human Rights (\" **ECtHR** \") had, on 20 September 2011, issued a judgment in *OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia* (\" **ECtHR Yukos Judgment** \"),4 which addressed the \"same circumstances\" on which Claimants' claims in these arbitrations are based.\n\n*OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia*, ECtHR, Appl. No. 14902/04, Judgment, 20 September 2011, Exh. R-3328, (hereinafter \"ECtHR Yukos Judgment\").\n\n34.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, Claimants produced documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 12. Respondent did not produce documents, but wrote to the Tribunal, expressing concern that Claimants had provided no assurance that documents collected for disclosure would be kept confidential and used only for the purposes of these arbitrations. Respondent requested the Tribunal to issue a directive \"requiring the Parties to protect the confidentiality of all documents disclosed by the other, using them solely for purposes of these arbitrations.\" Claimants objected to Respondent's \"eleventh hour\" request for a confidentiality order.\n\n35.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, the Tribunal ordered Respondent to provide by the end of that day documents to Claimants that had been ordered to be produced in Procedural Order No. 12, requested written submissions on confidentiality and directed that until it decided the confidentiality issue, the documents produced by both Parties were to remain confidential and be used solely for purposes of these arbitrations. Pursuant to the Tribunal's directive, Respondent produced documents on 19 December 2011.\n\n36.\n\nOn 18 January and 2 February 2012, the Parties exchanged submissions on the scope of confidentiality of the documents produced. From January to May 2012, the Parties exchanged extensive correspondence concerning compliance with Procedural Order No.12.\n\n37.\n\nOn 27 February 2012, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 13**, in which it: (a) ordered that all documents produced by a Party to the other Party and the Tribunal following an order of the Tribunal \"be and remain confidential in perpetuity\" and \"be used solely for the purpose of the pursuit or defense of these arbitrations and not for any other purpose;\" (b) listed the persons involved in these arbitrations to whom these documents could be disclosed; and (c) invited the Parties to refrain from discussing these arbitrations in public in order not to exacerbate their dispute or otherwise compromise the integrity of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n38.\n\nClaimants filed their Reply on the Merits (\" **Reply** \") on 15 March 2012. It spanned 474 pages and was accompanied by a further 629 exhibits and two expert reports (with annexures).\n\n39.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 14**, granting some of Respondent's document production requests which had earlier been denied \"without prejudice\" in Procedural Order No. 12. Claimants produced documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 14 on 29 May 2012. On 29 June 2012, Respondent produced additional documents \"in accordance with the parties' continuing obligation to disclose requested documents as they are discovered\" under Procedural Order No. 12. Throughout June and July 2012, the Parties exchanged extensive correspondence as to whether that was in violation of Procedural Order No. 12.\n\n40.\n\nOn 16 August 2012, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (\" **Rejoinder** \"). It spanned 819 pages and was accompanied by 1739 exhibits and seven expert reports (with annexures).\n\n**F. HEARING ON THE MERITS**\n----------------------------\n\n41.\n\nOn 28 August 2012, a pre-hearing telephone conference took place during which the Parties agreed on a number of issues, but disagreed on others. For example, Respondent requested that the Tribunal set a deadline for the exchange between the Parties of witness \"impeachment\" evidence prior to the Hearing on the Merits, while Claimants raised several \"due process\" issues and requested permission to file written submissions in support of their requests. The Parties then exchanged written comments on these issues.\n\n42.\n\nBy exchange of letters dated 10 September 2012, Claimants provided the names and order of three Respondent witnesses they wished to cross-examine and Respondent advised the names and order of ten of Claimants' witnesses whom it wished to cross-examine.\n\n43.\n\nOn 12 September 2012, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 15** dealing with logistical and procedural issues for the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n44.\n\nOn 14 September 2012, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 16**, in which it determined the outstanding procedural issues for the Hearing on the Merits, *inter alia* (a) denying Respondent's requests relating to the exchange of \"impeachment\" evidence (noting that \"in international arbitration practice, documents used at an evidentiary hearing should generally be submitted with the Parties' written pleadings, in accordance with the established procedural calendar\"); and (b) granting Claimants permission to file certain documents that would \"complete the record\" in relation to selected exhibits that Respondent had included in its Rejoinder.\n\n45.\n\nClaimants filed additional exhibits on 20 September 2012. On 25 September 2012, Respondent objected to certain of these exhibits on the grounds that they exceeded the scope of Procedural Orders No. 15 and 16. Following an exchange of views by the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on Respondent's objection in **Procedural Order No. 17** dated 2 October 2012.\n\n46.\n\nOn 1 October 2012, the Parties submitted their respective **Skeleton Arguments** in aid of the oral arguments to be presented at the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n47.\n\nOn 4 October 2012, Respondent advised that it no longer intended to cross-examine one of Claimants' tax law experts, Mr. Philip Baker QC. The same day Claimants withdrew the witness statement of former Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, which had been submitted with the Memorial, on the ground that Mr. Kasyanov had informed Claimants' counsel that \"he will not appear at the hearing in these arbitrations.\"\n\n48.\n\nOn 8 October 2012, Claimants advised that they no longer intended to cross-examine one of Respondent's tax law experts, Professor Rosenbloom.\n\n49.\n\nThe **Hearing on the Merits** took place at the Peace Palace, The Hague from 10 October to 9 November 2012. Over the course of the Hearing, the following were in attendance:\n\n**Tribunal**\n\nThe Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC\n\nDr. Charles Poncet\n\nJudge Stephen M.

On behalf of Respondent, oral arguments were presented by Dr. Claudia Annacker, Mr. Lawrence Friedman, Mr. David Sabel and Mr. Matthew Slater.\n\n51.\n\nDuring the Hearing, on 14 October 2012, the Parties filed brief written submissions on a document production request made by Respondent in follow up to Procedural Order No. 14. On 15 October 2012, the Tribunal ruled that the time for document production requests had passed, and noted that Respondent was free to ask the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from any alleged non-compliance by Claimants with the Tribunal's document production orders.\n\n**G. POST-HEARING PROCEDURES**\n------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAt the close of the Hearing on 9 November 2012, the Tribunal directed the Parties to submit Post-Hearing Briefs of no more than 100 pages by 21 December 2012. On 13 November 2012, the Tribunal confirmed that the Post-Hearing Briefs were to be prepared on the basis of a closed evidentiary record as at 9 November 2012.\n\n53.\n\nDuring November 2012, the Parties provided electronic copies of all additional materials relied upon during the Hearing, demonstrative exhibits and slides from arguments. They also submitted agreed and contested corrections to the transcript to the court reporter, who in turn circulated amended transcripts on 11 December 2012.\n\n54.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Parties filed their **Post-Hearing Briefs** spanning 100 pages each.\n\n55.\n\nOn 1 August 2013, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on a judgment issued on 25 July 2013 by the ECtHR.5\n\n*Khodorkovskiy (2) and Lebedev (2) v. Russia*, ECtHR, Appl. Nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, Judgment, 25 July 2013, (hereinafter \" *Khodorkovsky v. Russia 2* \").\n\n56.\n\nOn 30 August 2013, the Parties submitted their comments on the ECtHR judgment.\n\n57.\n\nOn 26 September 2013, Respondent drew the Tribunal's attention to developments in two other international arbitrations against the Russian Federation connected with Yukos. Claimants submitted comments in response on 8 October 2013.\n\n58.\n\nOn 10 January 2014, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties noting that Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, former CEO of Yukos, had been pardoned and released from prison, and inviting the Parties to submit their observations on the impact, if any, of these developments on the present arbitral proceedings. The Parties submitted their comments in response on 24 January 2014, and further observations in reply on 4 February 2014.\n\n59.\n\nThe Parties filed their costs claims on 17 April 2014, and submitted comments on the opposing side's costs claims on 6 May 2014.\n\n60.\n\nOn 7 May 2014, the Tribunal formally declared the record in these arbitrations closed.\n\n61.\n\nOn 9 June 2014, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was prepared to agree that the Final Awards may be publicly disclosed under certain conditions. Respondent also requested that the Tribunal modify its Procedural Order No. 13 to lift confidentiality restrictions with respect to documents disclosed in the course of these proceedings, to allow them to be used in \"related proceedings\" recently commenced against the Russian Federation. Claimants submitted comments in response on 16 June 2014, and Respondent further commented on 20 June 2014.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 June 2014, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 18** in which it: (a) ordered that these Final Awards remain confidential for a period of ten calendar days following electronic dispatch to the Parties, after which period the PCA would post the Final Awards to its website and so notify the Parties and the Tribunal, whereupon all confidentiality obligations in respect of the Final Awards shall terminate; and (b) modified Procedural Order No. 13 to provide for limited disclosure of documents in related proceedings.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe disputes between the Parties to the present proceedings involve various measures taken by Respondent against Yukos and associated companies primarily in the period between July 2003 and November 2007, when Yukos had emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union to become the largest oil company in the Russian Federation. The measures complained of include criminal prosecutions, harassment of Yukos, its employees and related persons and entities; massive tax reassessments, VAT charges, fines, asset freezes and other measures against Yukos to enforce the tax reassessments; the forced sale of Yukos' core oil production asset; and other measures culminating in the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006, the subsequent sale of its remaining assets, and Yukos being struck off the register of companies in November 2007. Claimants contend, and Respondent denies, that Respondent failed to treat Claimants' investments in Yukos in a fair and equitable manner and on a non-discriminatory basis, in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, and that Respondent expropriated Claimants' investments in breach of Article 13(1) of the ECT. Claimants seek full reparation in excess of USD 114 billion.\n\n64.\n\nThe factual matrix of this case is complex. A detailed exposition of the relevant facts, including specific references to the record, is set out for each part of the narrative in Part VIII (broken down into eight chapters, starting with Yukos' tax optimization scheme and the Russian Federation's tax assessments against Yukos and ending with the bankruptcy of Yukos and the withdrawal of audit opinions by PricewaterhouseCoopers (\" **PwC** \")). It is also in Part VIII that the Tribunal makes determinations in respect of the many highly contested issues of fact and observations on the significance of various facts and findings. By contrast, the purpose of the introductory overview of the facts contained in this Part II of the Award is only to provide sufficient background for what follows.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES TO THESE PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants and Related Entities**\n-------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe three Claimants in these related cases are all part of the Yukos group of companies, which had at its center Yukos, headed by Chief Executive Officer Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 226, Hulley, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on 17 September 1997 and was a 100 percent owned subsidiary of YUL.\n\n67.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 227, YUL, was incorporated on 24 September 1997 in the Isle of Man (a Dependency of the United Kingdom).\n\n68.\n\nClaimant in PCA Case No. AA 228, VPL, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on 7 February 2001.\n\n69.\n\nHulley held approximately 56.3 percent, YUL held approximately 2.6 percent and VPL held approximately 11.6 percent of the outstanding shares in Yukos. Collectively therefore, Claimants approximately had a 70.5 percent shareholding in Yukos.\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n70.\n\nRespondent in these three arbitrations is the Russian Federation.\n\n**B. OAO YUKOS OIL COMPANY**\n----------------------------\n\n71.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yukos was incorporated as a joint stock company in 1993 by Presidential Decree. Fully privatized in 1995-1996, it was a vertically integrated group engaging in exploration, production, refining, marketing and distribution of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Its three main production subsidiaries were Yuganskneftegaz (\" **YNG** \"), Samaraneftegaz and, from 1997, Tomskneft.\n\n72.\n\nIn May 2002, Yukos became the first Russian company to be ranked among the top ten largest oil and gas companies by market capitalization worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2002, Claimants submit that Yukos became the largest oil company in Russia in terms of daily crude oil production.\n\n73.\n\nAt its peak in 2003, it had around 100,000 employees, six main refineries and a market capitalization estimated at over USD 33 billion. According to Claimants, after its projected 2003 merger with then Russia's fifth largest oil company Sibneft (\" **Sibneft** \"), YukosSibneft would have become the fourth largest private oil producer worldwide, behind BP, Exxon and Shell. At the time of Respondent's alleged adverse actions in the summer of 2003, Yukos was engaged in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco for a merger or other form of business combination. Claimants contend that this level of success was the result of efforts to modernize Yukos' operations and implement Western business practices. According to Claimants, Yukos' success and the increasing social and economic influence gained by its management\u2014including financial support given by Mr. Khodorkovsky to opposition parties\u2014 were perceived as a political threat by the Russian authorities and accordingly Yukos would fall from grace and be targeted for destruction. Respondent, however, contends that Yukos was a \"criminal enterprise\", engaged in a variety of tax evasion schemes and other fraudulent activities.\n\n**C. THE RUSSIAN LOW-TAX REGION PROGRAM**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe low-tax region program was established in the 1990s to foster economic development in impoverished areas of the Russian Federation. The Russian low-tax regions were permitted to exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit tax for the purpose of fostering taxpayers' investments in the low-tax regions, provided the taxpayer complied with certain requirements.\n\n75.\n\nThe Russian low-tax regions that are relevant to Yukos' \"tax optimization\" scheme include:\n\n\u2022 Closed Administrative Territorial Units (known as \" **ZATOs** \"): Lesnoy and Trekhgorniy; and\n\n\u2022 Other low-tax regions: Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia.\n\n76.\n\nWith respect to the tax benefits available in the ZATOs (Lesnoy and Trekhgorniy), in 1999, the ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers fully from federal corporate profit tax. In 2000, most ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*e.g.*, up to 19 percent). In 2001, all ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*e.g.*, also up to 19 percent). In 2002, however, these exemptions were revoked.\n\n77.\n\nWith respect to the tax benefits available in other low-tax regions, in 2000 and 2001, Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia were permitted to exempt taxpayers fully from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*e.g.*, from up to 19 percent to zero percent). From 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2003, low-tax regions were permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget, but only up to four percent. An exception existed for \u2018grandfathered' tax investment agreements entered into prior to 1 July 2001, such that these taxpayers could still receive a zero percent profit tax rate if they fulfilled certain other conditions. As of 1 January 2004, the existing tax investment agreements were terminated, but the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (the \" **Russian Tax Code** \") still allowed low-tax regions to reduce the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget up to four percent.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent contends that Yukos' restructuring of its trading operations from high-tax jurisdictions, such as Moscow and Nefteyugansk, to trading companies incorporated in the low-tax jurisdictions of Lesnoy, Trekhgorny, Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia was aimed at evading taxes, rather than to achieve any genuine economic result. Respondent alleges that Yukos interposed between Yukos and its customer its \"sham\" trading shells registered in Russian low-tax regions. Yukos' oil producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the trading companies at a fraction of the market price. The trading companies then sold the oil either abroad at a market price or to Yukos' refineries, and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price. Respondent asserts that prices increased step by step from sham shell to sham shell, generating artificially inflated profits through non-armslength transactions. Those profits were then taxed at reduced rates in the low-tax regions, where the sham trading shells were registered. Respondent contends that the tax authorities identified abuses by the Lesnoy trading shells, which resulted in further investigations and, ultimately, in the tax assessments against Yukos and related proceedings.\n\n79.\n\nClaimants contend that Yukos, like other Russian companies at that time, was merely taking advantage of the legislation in place in the low-tax regions. Claimants assert that any findings of \"abuse\" by the Russian tax authorities was a function of the arbitrary and unpredictable interpretations of the law in Russia.\n\n80.\n\nThe details of the Russian low-tax region program and Yukos' tax optimization scheme are set out more comprehensively in Chapter VIII.A of this Award.\n\n**D. CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------\n\n81.\n\nStarting in July 2003, a series of criminal investigations were initiated by the Russian Federation against Yukos management and activities. According to Claimants, these actions included the \"targeting\" of Yukos' employees, auditor PwC, in-house counsel, lawyers involved in various Yukos-related cases, as well as searches and seizures, threats to revoke its oil licenses, and mutual legal assistance requests and extradition proceedings against Yukos management. Claimants characterize these actions as harassment, motivated by Mr. Khodorkovsky's participation in Russian opposition politics, that were intended\u2014together with tax reassessments\u2014to lead to the expropriation of Yukos' assets. Respondent contends that its actions were in response to illegal acts committed by Yukos and its officers and shareholders.\n\n82.\n\nBetween July and October 2003, three key Yukos officers were arrested. In July 2003, Mr. Platon Lebedev, Director of Hulley and YUL, was arrested on charges of embezzlement and fraud; he was sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. In October 2003, Mr. Vasily Shakhovsky, President of Yukos-Moscow, was charged with and later convicted of tax evasion. In October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky himself was arrested and charged with crimes including forgery, fraud and tax evasion; he was also sentenced to a nine-year prison term in May 2005. As a result of these arrests, a number of high-ranking Yukos executives fled Russia, such as Mr. Leonid Nevzlin, Deputy Chairman of the Yukos Board of Directors until 2003. On 2 February 2007, new charges of embezzlement and money laundering were brought against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, leading to further convictions in December 2010. Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were each imprisoned for over a decade.\n\n83.\n\nClaimants contend that by April 2006, no fewer than 35 top managers and employees of Yukos had been interrogated, arrested or sentenced, and that lawyers acting for Yukos had been obstructed in their work. During the same period, Russian authorities conducted searches, seizures and interrogations of Yukos property and personnel. Claimants contend that all of these actions amounted to harassment and intimidation, that they deprived Yukos' management of the ability to manage and control Yukos as a business, and that the underlying motive was to expropriate Yukos' assets.\n\n84.\n\nRespondent contends that in addition to participation in tax fraud schemes, Yukos participated in a massive transfer pricing scheme by which hundreds of millions of dollars from the sales of oil and other products were illegally siphoned off to offshore entities for the benefit of Khodorkovsky/Lebedev and other controlling Russian \"Oligarchs\".6\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated 4 April 2011, as corrected 29 July 2011, p.1 n.1 (hereinafter \"Counter-Memorial\"): Respondent employs the term \"Oligarchs\" throughout its pleadings to refer to Messrs. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Nevzlin, Dubov, Brudno, Shakhnovsky, Golubovitch; the individual owners standing behind Claimants (hereinafter the \"Oligarchs\").\n\n85.\n\nRespondent also contends that Yukos officials have been engaged in violent crimes, such as the murder, attempted murder and assault of persons seeking to enforce Russian tax laws or otherwise perceived to threaten Yukos interests. Claimants deny Respondent's allegations of criminal acts as well as acts of tax evasion.\n\n86.\n\nRespondent denies that Yukos and its officers were targeted in a discriminatory way, contending that Russian taxation measures have also applied to other offenders and that the searches and seizures were taken as part of legitimate taxation measures and conducted in accordance with normal Russian practice and the appropriate procedural protections available under Russian law.\n\n87.\n\nThe particulars of Claimants' allegations concerning harassment, intimidation and arrests are presented in Chapter VIII.C of this Award.\n\n**E. ADDITIONAL MEASURES**\n--------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn the period between October 2003 and December 2004, Yukos and its subsidiaries faced a series of major setbacks, including the alleged frustration of its merger with Sibneft, hefty tax reassessments, fines, VAT exactions, the freezing of shares and assets, the threatened revocation of licenses, and the forced sale of Yukos' main oil production subsidiary, YNG. These measures were followed by the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006.\n\n**1. Alleged Frustration of Merger Between Yukos and Sibneft**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn October 2003, a merger was about to be completed between Yukos and Sibneft, Russia's fifth largest oil company. According to Claimants, the resulting entity, YukosSibneft, would have become the world's fourth largest oil company. In November 2003, however, after Yukos had already acquired 92 percent of Sibneft's shares as part of the merger and after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky, Sibneft's controlling shareholder, Mr. Roman Abramovich, called off the merger process and the transactions were then unwound by a series of court decisions. Further details are included in Chapter VIII.D of this Award.\n\n**2. Tax Reassessments for Years 2000-2004**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nOn 28 April 2003, the Tax Ministry issued a Field Tax Audit Report for the years 2000 and 2001 that raised no questions concerning Yukos' tax optimization structure. On 1 September, 1 October and 1 November 2003, the Tax Ministry issued certificates confirming that Yukos had no outstanding debts.\n\n91.\n\nOn 8 December 2003, the Tax Ministry ordered a tax re-audit of Yukos for the year 2000. On 29 December 2003, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation issued the first of five tax assessments against Yukos that were based on the alleged abuse by Yukos of its tax optimization scheme.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tax Ministry demanded payment from Yukos for approximately USD 3.5 billion for 2000, which was largely upheld by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. Similarly large tax reassessments were issued in the period between 2004 and 2006 for subsequent tax years. 2001 taxes were re-assessed in the amount of approximately USD 4.1 billion, 2002 taxes in the amount of approximately USD 6.8 billion, 2003 taxes in the amount of approximately USD 6.1 billion, and 2004 taxes in the amount of approximately USD 3.7 billion. By the time the Tax Ministry issued the last of these demands, Yukos faced a tax bill of more than USD 24 billion, of which approximately USD 10.6 billion constituted allegedly evaded revenue-based taxes (including interest and fines), and the remainder (approximately USD 13.6 billion) comprised of VAT and related, interest and fines.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent contends that the reassessments were a consequence of Yukos' activities relating to the tax fraud scheme. Claimants submit, however, that the reassessments were so excessive that the Russian authorities' strategy of destroying Yukos became plain.\n\n94.\n\nAt the same time that tax reassessments were being filed against Yukos and its subsidiaries, Russian authorities began freezing shares and other assets belonging to Yukos and related entities. In October 2003, Russian prosecutors froze shares held by YUL and Hulley in Yukos. Orders issued by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in April and June 2004 prevented Yukos from disposing of its assets. An application by Yukos in July 2004 to have sufficient assets released to meet its tax liabilities was ignored and a surcharge of approximately USD 240 million was applied for late payment of taxes. Claimants also maintain that Yukos' numerous proposals throughout this period to settle the tax claims were ignored or rejected by the Russian authorities, despite the fact that the government settled with taxpayers in several other cases.\n\n95.\n\nIn July 2004, Russian authorities began seizing Yukos' shares in YNG, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft. YNG bank accounts were also frozen. The Russian authorities also used mutual legal assistance treaties to affect Yukos' interests abroad.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent does not dispute the freezing of Yukos' assets but contends that freezing assets of a debtor, including shares owned by it, is a standard enforcement measure for tax levies and judgments. Respondent maintains that its freezing orders did not cover all of the assets of Yukos in Russia and that Yukos remained in possession of large assets abroad.\n\n97.\n\nThe details of the tax assessments against Yukos and of Yukos' attempts to settle the tax claims are set out in Chapters VIII.B and VIII.E, respectively.\n\n**3. Auction of YNG**\n---------------------\n\n98.\n\nIn July 2004, the Russian Federation indicated that it intended to appraise and sell YNG to pay off Yukos' back taxes. A valuation carried out by investment bank ZAO Dresdner Bank (\" **Dresdner** \") at the request of the Russian Federation valued YNG at between USD 15.7 billion and USD 18.3 billion. A valuation carried out by JP Morgan, at the request of Yukos, valued YNG at between USD 16 billion and USD 22 billion. The Russian Ministry of Justice announced that YNG was worth USD 10.4 billion.\n\n99.\n\nAfter Yukos' attempts to enjoin the sale of YNG by legal recourse in the United States failed, YNG was sold at auction on 19 December 2004 for USD 9.37 billion to sole bidder and newly incorporated entity, Baikal Finance Group (\" **Baikal** \"), which was quickly bought by Russian State-owned Rosneft (\" **Rosneft** \").\n\n100.\n\nFurther particulars on this aspect of the case are presented in Chapter VIII.F of this Award.\n\n**4. Bankruptcy Proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n101.\n\nClaimants allege that the Russian Federation first reported in March 2005 that it intended to \"push Yukos into bankruptcy in order to redistribute its remaining assets.\" On 6 March 2006, a syndicate of foreign bank creditors of Yukos filed a bankruptcy petition before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, pursuant to a Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft (the \" **Confidential Sale Agreement** \"). YNG\u2014then owned by Rosneft\u2014filed a separate bankruptcy petition against Yukos, which was subsequently joined to that of the bank syndicate. On 28 March 2006, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against Yukos, placing it under external supervision, and on 4 August 2006, Yukos was declared bankrupt.\n\n102.\n\nYukos' remaining assets were nearly all acquired by State-owned Gazprom and Rosneft, with the bankruptcy auctions raising a total of USD 31.5 billion. In November 2007, Yukos was liquidated and struck off the register of legal entities.\n\n103.\n\nThe specifics relating to Yukos' bankruptcy are set out in Chapter VIII.G of this Award.\n\n**5. Withdrawal of PwC's Audits**\n---------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn June 2007, PwC (which had served as both auditor and consultant to Yukos starting in 1997) withdrew all of its audits of Yukos from 1995 to 2004.\n\n105.\n\nThis final aspect of the factual matrix is treated in detail in Chapter VIII.H of this Award.\n\n**III. PARTIES' WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nAs indicated in the Procedural History above, the Parties submitted two rounds of memorials on the merits. Each side took full advantage of the written phase of these proceedings, filing detailed and extensive written submissions. Claimants' Memorial runs to 424 pages and was accompanied by 1045 exhibits and 12 witness statements. Respondent's Counter-Memorial is 787 pages long, and was accompanied by 2868 exhibits and 8 witness statements. Claimants' Reply runs to 474 pages, and was accompanied by over 600 further exhibits. Finally, Respondent's Rejoinder runs to 819 pages, and was submitted with over 1700 further exhibits and seven witness statements. The Parties filed Post-Hearing Briefs of over 100 pages. Throughout the arbitration the Parties filed extensive written submissions on various procedural issues.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal studied these submissions carefully. The Parties' principal arguments are re-stated in the Tribunal's analysis of the issues in Parts VIII to XIII below. For the purposes of introduction, the Tribunal reproduces below *verbatim* the written \"skeleton arguments\" that the Parties submitted prior to the Hearing on the Merits at the Tribunal's request.\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' SKELETON ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs 1 to 82 of Claimants' Skeleton Argument submitted on 1 October 2012 (\" **Claimants' Skeleton** \")(footnotes omitted).\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n\n1. The dispute between the Parties arises from the various actions taken by the Russian Federation against Yukos Oil Company (\"Yukos\" or the \"Company\") and related persons and entities, which culminated in the expropriation of the Company for the exclusive benefit of the Russian State and State-owned entities, thereby destroying the Claimants' investments in Yukos. As the Claimants have demonstrated, by (i) failing to treat the Claimants' investments in Yukos in a fair and equitable manner and on a non-discriminatory basis, and (ii) expropriating the Claimants' investments therein, the Russian Federation breached its obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"), respectively, for which the Claimants are entitled to full reparation.\n\n2. The Claimants' positions on the merits are described in detail in their written submissions. This skeleton argument summarizes, for the benefit of the Tribunal, the Claimants' principal arguments, with reference to key supporting materials. It does not replace or supplement those submissions, nor is it a substitute for oral argument.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n\n3. The various actions taken by the Russian Federation against Yukos, and related persons and entities, were aimed at the destruction and expropriation of the Company. The expropriation of Yukos was achieved in 3 overlapping steps: *first*, the paralysis of the Company (A); *second*, the manufacturing of a pretext for the taking of the Company's assets, namely, the fabrication of debt (B); *finally*, the use of that pretext to take Yukos' assets piece by piece, including its most valuable asset, Yuganskneftegaz, and transfer them to the State-owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom (C). Each of these steps was accompanied by serious due process violations. The result was the liquidation of Yukos in November 2007, and the complete and total deprivation of the Claimants' investments therein.\n\n**A. PARALYSIS OF YUKOS**\n\n4. Prior to the Russian Federation's attack, Yukos was a flourishing oil company. In May 2002, it was the only Russian company to be ranked among the top 10 largest oil and gas companies by market capitalization worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2002, it became the largest oil company in Russia in terms of daily crude oil production. In October 2003, it completed its merger with Sibneft, another of Russia's leading oil companies, creating the world's fourth largest private oil producer, behind BP, ExxonMobil and Shell. Yukos was also engaged in advanced discussions with American oil majors, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco, in relation to a merger or other form of business combination. This success was the result of concerted efforts to modernize the Company and implement Western business practices.\n\n5. Starting in the summer of 2003, the Russian Federation took a series of actions aimed at undermining the ability of the Company's management to run the business. These included: (i) the arrests of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky, Yukos' CEO; (ii) the targeting, intimidation and/or prosecution of other high-ranking Yukos managers, employees and related persons; (iii) the harassment, prosecution and/or arrest of Yukos' in-house counsel and lawyers involved in various Yukos-related cases; (iv) the conduct of widespread and aggressive searches and seizures; (v) the seizure of the Claimants' shares in Yukos; (vi) the threats to revoke Yukos' oil licenses; (vii) the numerous mutual legal assistance requests and extradition proceedings to affect Yukos and entities/persons associated with the Company abroad; and (viii) the targeting and harassment of Yukos' auditor, PwC. These actions were taken in violation of the most basic standards of due process and fair treatment.\n\n6. Contrary to the Respondent's allegations, the actions described above deprived Yukos' management of the ability to manage and control the Company, thereby facilitating its dismantling and ultimate destruction. One early casualty of the Russian Federation's attack on Yukos was the YukosSibneft merger.\n\n**B. MANUFACTURING A PRETEXT \u2014 THE FABRICATION OF DEBT**\n\n**1. The fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos for the years 2000-2004**\n\n7. In December 2003, the Russian Federation's campaign against Yukos entered into a new phase with the fabrication of massive tax claims against the Company.\n\n8. On December 8, 2003, 6 weeks after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, the Tax Ministry ordered a tax re-audit of Yukos for the year 2000. Only 3 weeks later, it issued a Field Tax Audit Report exceeding 100 pages in length and proposing to collect from Yukos US$ 3.4 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines on the purported basis that the use of regional tax incentives by Yukos trading companies constituted unlawful tax evasion by Yukos itself.\n\n9. The December 2003 re-audit of Yukos was extraordinary in many respects. Less than 8 months earlier, on April 28, 2003, the Tax Ministry had issued a Field Tax Audit Report for the years 2000 and 2001 that raised no questions concerning Yukos' tax optimization structure. That audit had taken 5 months to conduct, followed by 2 months for drafting the report. On several occasions after this audit, including on September 1, October 1 and November 1, 2003, the Tax Ministry confirmed that Yukos had no outstanding tax debts. Prior tax audits of the Mordovian trading companies likewise raised no major concerns and specifically found their use of regional tax incentives to be lawful.\n\n10. The Respondent alleges that the Russian authorities lacked knowledge of Yukos' tax optimization structure and only \"discovered\" its allegedly abusive features in the course of the 3-week audit carried out in December 2003. This allegation is not credible. As the record demonstrates, the Russian authorities had long been aware of Yukos' practices, and the Respondent has failed to identify a single piece of material information relevant to the alleged tax claims that it lacked prior to the December 2003 repeat audit. In particular:\n\n\u25a0 Yukos was one of Russia's largest taxpayers and was therefore under constant scrutiny by the Russian tax authorities, who had never found any significant problems prior to the attack on Yukos.\n\n\u25a0 The use of trading companies incorporated in low-tax regions was a common practice among Russia's vertically integrated oil companies, a fact that was well known to Russian authorities.\n\n\u25a0 Several trading companies' affiliations with Yukos were reflected in their names, for instance, Yukos-M and Yu-Mordovia.\n\n\u25a0 Prior to using trading companies in Mordovia\u2014the source of the overwhelming majority of the purported tax claims\u2014Yukos discussed the issue with federal and regional officials, who approved Yukos' plan. Mordovia's Government then signed investment agreements with these trading companies specifying the amounts of monthly payments. Audits of the Mordovian trading companies confirm the tax authorities' knowledge of the factual circumstances later alleged to constitute \"abuse\".\n\n\u25a0 As the Respondent concedes, Yukos' financial statements disclosed that companies within Yukos' consolidation perimeter enjoyed tax benefits under the low-tax region program and the overall amounts of such benefits.\n\n\u25a0 VAT refund submissions documented the entire chain of transactions prior to export, including, in particular, the trading companies' transactions with Yukos' production companies, refineries, and the holding company.\n\n\u25a0 Yukos' monthly submissions to obtain access to export pipelines confirmed that the trading companies' tax payments were in relation to the trading of oil produced by Yukos' production subsidiaries and exported under Yukos' export quotas.\n\n11. The Tax Ministry went on to fabricate similar tax claims against Yukos covering the years 2001-2004. As discussed below, the timing of these claims was instrumental in carrying out the Russian Federation's expropriation plan. By the time the Tax Ministry issued the last of these demands, Yukos faced a tax bill of more than US$ 24 billion, of which only US$ 5.2 billion constituted allegedly evaded revenue-based taxes, the remainder being comprised of VAT, interest, and fines. These payment demands dwarfed the Company's consolidated net income for the relevant periods.\n\n**2. The purported tax claims were unprecedented, arbitrary and manifestly expropriatory**\n\n12. *Purported bases for revoking regional profit tax incentives.* Yukos' tax optimization structure fully complied with the legislation in force and current practices. Indeed, the Respondent does not allege that Yukos or the trading companies failed to comply with the federal or regional legislation. Nor does it allege that the trading companies failed to fulfill the terms of the investment agreements signed with the regional governments. Rather, it claims that the trading companies failed to satisfy additional, unwritten requirements beyond the statutory eligibility criteria, including, in particular, an alleged \"proportionality of investments\" requirement that directly contradicted both the legislation and the investment agreements signed by the regional governments. This justification is not credible.\n\n13. *Re-attribution.* The primary weapon in the expropriation of Yukos' assets was the reattribution of the alleged tax liabilities of the trading companies to Yukos. Russian law did not allow such re-attribution, and the Respondent cannot point to a single example of such a re-attribution other than the Yukos case. Had the Russian authorities genuinely believed that the tax benefits had been improperly granted to the trading companies, which was not the case, the proper course under Russian law would have been to pursue those companies for the allegedly underpaid taxes. Alternatively, had they genuinely believed that sales had occurred at below market prices, Russian tax law contained a specific statutory mechanism for such transferpricing situations. However, the Russian authorities ignored these statutory provisions. Re-attribution served 2 purposes: *first*, shifting liability to Yukos itself paved the way for the expropriation of the Company's assets; *second*, re-attribution provided the basis for massive VAT claims.\n\n14. *VAT.* Simultaneously invoking and contradicting their own re-attribution theory, the tax authorities re-attributed to Yukos all the revenues from the trading companies' transactions, but refused to re-attribute to Yukos the trading companies' entitlements to VAT refunds for export transactions. The purported basis for denying refunds was that the paperwork, although proper and timely, had been submitted by the trading companies rather than Yukos. This enabled the tax authorities to claim an additional US$ 13.59 billion\u201456.20% of the total claims against Yukos\u2014despite the uncontested fact that no VAT was owed on these transactions. Such a step was clearly confiscatory in nature. Further, the fact that, even when Yukos attempted to submit the updated VAT returns in its own name, its submissions were rejected as improper and untimely, confirms that the purported VAT claims had nothing to do with taxation. The Respondent has been unable to offer any defense whatsoever for the fundamentally contradictory way in which its re-attribution theory was deployed.\n\n15. *Fines.* The tax authorities further inflated their claims through the unjustified imposition of fines, including by imposing fines after the statute of limitations had expired; by doubling fines for \"willfulness\" despite the fact that Yukos did not\u2014and could not possibly\u2014\"know\" of the alleged illegality; and by doubling fines again for \"repeat offenses\" despite the fact that at the time of the alleged \"repeat\" offenses Yukos had never been previously held liable for a similar offense. Overall, these inflated fines amounted to US$ 8.5 billion, *i.e.*, 35.13% of the total alleged tax liabilities, with the \"repeat\" offender fines alone amounting to US$ 3.92 billion.\n\n16. The common thread unifying the Russian Federation's approach was an overarching desire to manufacture and inflate claims against Yukos, with a view to expropriating the Company. As Yukos' tax lawyer noted after reviewing the December 2003 audit report, \"[e]ven if we assume political pressure on the court the extent of the violations committed by the Ministry for Taxes and Levies will make it impossible even for the most biased judge to support the clearly unlawful inspection act\". The Russian courts proved Yukos' tax lawyer wrong, rubber-stamping the fabricated tax debts.\n\n**3. Due process violations in the administrative and judicial proceedings**\n\n17. The administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to the alleged tax debts were conducted in blatant disregard of Yukos' basic due process rights. This involved, *inter alia*, pressure on the courts to ensure that only Government-friendly judges would preside over Yukos' challenges\u2014and subsequently rewarding those judges for their efforts; overly speedy proceedings, denying Yukos adequate time and facilities to prepare its defense; and arbitrary denials of Yukos' motions to join to the proceedings the trading companies and the Mordovian Government. Coupled with the harassment of Yukos' lawyers noted above, the Russian Federation ensured the hasty conclusion of these proceedings, bringing it one step closer to its objective, namely the taking of Yukos' assets.\n\n**C. Appropriation of Yukos' assets - Seizing Yukos' assets andTRANSFERRING THEM TO STATE-OWNED COMPANIES**\n\n**1. Yukos was prevented from settling its alleged tax debts or discharging them in full**\n\n18. *The swift and manifestly disproportionate enforcement of the 2000 tax reassessment*. On April 14, 2004, the tax authorities issued their payment demands for the year 2000. Yukos was given until April 16, 2004, *i.e.*, less than 48 hours, to pay in full US$ 3.48 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines.\n\n19. Even this symbolic \"voluntary\" payment period was illusory. On April 15, 2004, the very next day after the demand for payment was issued, the tax authorities obtained from the Moscow Arbitrazh Court an *ex parte* injunctive order freezing, as a purported security measure, all of Yukos' non-cash Russian assets, with the exception of oil and oil products.\n\n20. On June 30, 2004, following Yukos' unsuccessful appeal, an enforcement writ was issued giving the Tax Ministry 3 years to collect the 2000 tax debt. Rather than engage in discussions with the Company about the discharge of this debt within that period, the bailiffs initiated enforcement proceedings that very same day. The Company was given 5 days to pay voluntarily US$ 3.42 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines for the year 2000 and threatened with a 7% enforcement fee if it failed to do so.\n\n21. At the same time, the bailiffs ordered the seizure of (i) monies deposited in Yukos' accounts with 16 Russian banks, and (ii) the Company's Russian non-cash assets (which had previously been the subject of a freeze). On July 1, 2004, a wave of seizures on Yukos' non-monetary assets began, culminating in the seizure on July 14, 2004 of Yukos' shares in its 3 main production subsidiaries\u2014Yuganskneftegaz, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft.\n\n22. It should be recalled that all these seizures were conducted within the framework of the enforcement proceeding initiated on June 30, 2004 to recover from Yukos US$ 3.42 billion in alleged tax liabilities for 2000. These seizures covered virtually all of Yukos' assets, whose value was staggeringly higher.\n\n23. Further, within days, on July 20, 2004, the Ministry of Justice announced its intention to appraise and sell Yuganskneftegaz to satisfy the 2000 alleged tax debt.\n\n24. The decision to seize and sell Yuganskneftegaz, which accounted for approximately 12% of Russia's oil output and whose value on any estimation dramatically exceeded that of the alleged tax debt, can only be reconciled with a desire to destroy the Company and appropriate its core assets. This reality is confirmed by the fact that the decision was taken less than 3 weeks after the writ of execution had been issued and when all of Yukos' domestic assets remained seized and available to satisfy the 2000 tax debt.\n\n25. *The failure to consider Yukos' proposals of alternative means of paying the alleged debt.* Further confirmation of the Russian Federation's expropriatory intent is the systematic rejection of Yukos' numerous offers to the bailiffs, courts and other Russian authorities and officials to settle or discharge its tax debts. These included: (i) the offers of Yukos' Russian non-core assets and its stake in Sibneft, initially 34.5% and subsequently reduced to 20% minus 1 share following the seizure of the 14.5% stake in Sibneft on July 9, 2004, in the context of the Chukotka Arbitrazh Court proceedings; (ii) Yukos' petition to pay its alleged tax debt for the year 2000 in installments; (iii) Yukos' amicable proposal to the Ministry of Finance to defer the payment of the federal share of its alleged debt for 6 months or to pay it in tranches; (iv) the proposals by Mr. Jean Chr\u00e9tien, former Canadian Prime Minister, to Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin of a global settlement of the disputes, which envisaged the payment to the Russian Federation of approximately US$ 8 billion over the course of 2 years; (v) Yukos' October 2004 full settlement proposal in the range of US$ 21 billion, which included non-core assets and Sibneft shares, as well as a concession to re-elect a new board of directors that would include people selected by the Government.\n\n26. Each of these offers, as well as numerous others, was either denied or, in most cases, simply ignored. The Respondent's attempts to provide *post-hoc* rationalizations for its conduct by qualifying each of Yukos' offers as unacceptable or inadequate are unfounded. In any event, the Russian authorities' failure to work with\u2014or even respond to\u2014the multiple offers by Yukos, one of the largest private taxpayers in Russia, or to consider other options for enforcement, confirms that the Russian Federation was not interested in collecting taxes. This is even more so in light of the fact that the Russian authorities had no difficulty entering into settlement discussions and negotiating repayment plans with other Russian oil companies, including, *inter alia*, Rosneft and Sibneft.\n\n**2. The forced sale of Yukos' shares in Yuganskneftegaz**\n\n27. *Fabrication of further debt to maintain the pretext.* Despite the effect of the seizures described above, by the time of the Yuganskneftegaz auction, Yukos had paid off the 2000 tax reassessment in its entirety, eliminating the *raison d'\u00eatre* of the decision to sell Yuganskneftegaz. Recognizing this difficulty as well as the gross disparity between the alleged tax debts and the value of Yuganskneftegaz, the Tax Ministry set about fabricating new claims.\n\n\u25a0 On September 2, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax reassessment for 2001 in the amount of US$ 4.1 billion. Yukos was given only 2 days to pay voluntarily this amount, with the bailiffs initiating enforcement proceedings on September 9, 2004.\n\n\u25a0 On November 16, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax reassessment for 2002 in the amount of US$ 6.76 billion, the largest among the 5 tax reassessments for the years 2000-2004. Yukos was given only 1 day to pay voluntarily this amount, with the bailiffs initiating enforcement proceedings on November 18, 2004.\n\n\u25a0 On December 6, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax reassessment for 2003 in the amount of US$ 6.1 billion, giving the Company 1 day to pay in full. On December 9, 2004, the bailiffs initiated enforcement proceedings.\n\n28. In each case, the bailiffs allowed Yukos at most 5 days for voluntary payment and charged the 7% enforcement fee for failure to comply with these unreasonably short time limits.\n\n29. Thus, in the 4 months from September 2004 up until the auction of Yuganskneftegaz on December 19, 2004, the Russian Federation managed to increase Yukos' alleged tax liability by approximately US$ 17 billion.\n\n30. *Efforts to depress the auction price of Yuganskneftegaz.* At the same time, with a view to facilitating the Russian Federation's acquisition of Yuganskneftegaz at a bargain price, the Russian Tax Ministry also fabricated claims against Yuganskneftegaz. These claims were premised on the application of statutory provisions on transfer pricing, which the tax authorities systematically refused to apply in relation to Yukos itself. Significantly, these claims concerned the same oil trading revenues that had already been re-attributed to Yukos, thus resulting in double taxation.\n\n31. Thus, on October 29, 2004, the tax authorities simultaneously: (i) issued a Repeat Field Tax Audit Report for 2001 requesting Yuganskneftegaz to pay US$ 2.35 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines;93 and (ii) rendered a Decision holding Yuganskneftegaz liable for an alleged tax offense for the year 2002 and requiring payment of US$ 1.03 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines.\n\n32. On December 3, 2004, a Field Tax Audit Report was issued for the year 2003, imposing on Yuganskneftegaz an additional US$ 1.22 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines.\n\n33. In addition to fabricating these US$ 4.6 billion in additional alleged liability, the Russian authorities also began to sow doubts about the security of Yuganskneftegaz's oil licenses to depress further the Company's value.\n\n34. That all these payments demands, imposed simultaneously on Yukos and its main production subsidiary, were issued in the run-up to the auction of Yuganskneftegaz is no coincidence. Nor is it a coincidence that, after Yuganskneftegaz was acquired by Rosneft, the tax claims along with the oil license concerns promptly disappeared. Together with the generous payment terms accorded to Rosneft's new subsidiary but systematically denied to Yukos, these facts confirm both the discriminatory nature of the Russian Federation's treatment of Yukos, and the true purpose of the purported tax reassessments against Yuganskneftegaz, namely, to facilitate the expropriation of the Company and not to collect taxes.\n\n35. *Sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz.* As noted above, the Ministry of Justice publicly announced its plan to sell Yuganskneftegaz on July 20, 2004, purportedly in order to satisfy the 2000 alleged tax debt.\n\n36. On August 12, 2004, the bailiffs appointed ZAO Dresdner Bank (\"Dresdner\") to carry out the valuation of Yuganskneftegaz in preparation for its sale. On October 6, 2004, Dresdner issued a confidential report valuing Yuganskneftegaz on a standalone basis at US$ 18.6 billion - 21.1 billion.\n\n37. On November 18, 2004, the bailiffs announced that Yuganskneftegaz would be auctioned to satisfy Yukos' outstanding tax debt, with the Russian Federal Property Fund issuing the formal auction notice the following day. The opening price for 100% of the ordinary shares, or 76.79% of Yuganskneftegaz's total share capital, was set at US$ 8.65 billion, a price well below its true value. The auction date was set for December 19, 2004, which was the earliest possible date to hold the auction and only 1 month away.\n\n38. In an attempt to prevent the auction of its core asset, Yukos filed an application with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare unlawful the Bailiff's Resolution of November 18, 2004 and sought interim measures. These efforts failed.\n\n39. Confronted, yet again, with the futility of its efforts to obtain justice before the Russian courts, on December 14, 2004, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. By that date, only 3 companies, Gazpromneft (the new wholly-owned subsidiary of State-owned Gazprom), First Venture and Intercom, had sought antimonopoly clearance required in anticipation of the auction. On December 16, 2004, the U.S. Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\") enjoining Gazpromneft, its potential lenders, First Venture and Intercom from participating in the auction of Yuganskneftegaz.\n\n40. Nonetheless, on December 19, 2004, which was a Sunday, the Russian authorities proceeded with the auction of Yuganskneftegaz. Gazpromneft and OOO Baikalfinancegroup (\"Baikal\") were registered as participants. Baikal was a previously unknown company established at the address of a local bar in the provincial town of Tver on December 6, 2004. With only US$ 359 in capital, it mysteriously managed to pay a cash deposit in the amount of US$ 1.77 billion to register for the auction on December 16, 2004.\n\n41. At the auction, Baikal opened the bidding at US$ 9.35 billion. Gazpromneft's representative asked for a recess and left the room to make a telephone call. Upon his return, he did not make a single bid and Baikal was pronounced the winner of the auction with its opening bid of US$ 9.35 billion. The whole bidding process lasted approximately 10 minutes.\n\n42. The Respondent's allegation that the low price for Yuganskneftegaz reflected attempts by Yukos to \"sabotage\" the auction is unconvincing. Neither \"litigation risk\" nor the TRO had a material effect on the participants or the outcome of the auction. The reality is that, ignoring the advice of its own appraisal firm, the Russian authorities systematically acted in ways that negatively affected the ability and willingness of potential bidders to participate, as well as the price they would be willing to pay. Market participants also understood that political support was required to participate in auctions for Yukos assets.\n\n43. The use of Baikal as a conduit for the eventual transfer of Yuganskneftegaz to a State-owned company was confirmed when, only a few days later, on December 23, 2004, Rosneft issued a statement announcing its acquisition of Baikal. Meeting journalists that day, President Putin confirmed his knowledge of the acquisition, stating that: \"Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests. I consider this to be quite logical\". Rosneft then enabled Baikal to repay the principal and interest on its debt by granting it, on December 30, 2004, a 1-year interest-free loan.\n\n44. Rosneft benefited significantly from this acquisition, with Rosneft's estimated value increasing dramatically from US$ 7 billion in December 2004 to US$ 80 billion for its IPO in mid-2006. Based on the valuation disclosed by Rosneft at the time, Yuganskneftegaz was worth US$ 55.78 billion. Further, as noted above, the tax bills raised against Yuganskneftegaz as a Yukos subsidiary were almost entirely set aside by the Russian courts following its acquisition by Rosneft.\n\n45. Looked at from any angle, the Russian Federation's approach to enforcement of the alleged tax debts, culminating in the transfer of Yuganskneftegaz to Rosneft in a sham auction, confirms that the Russian Federation's real goal was to expropriate the Company, and not to collect taxes.\n\n46. Even after the sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no legitimate reason to put Yukos into bankruptcy. There were no substantial creditors apart from the Russian Federation, and the seizure of Yukos' assets remained in place, so there was no risk of assets being dissipated and no need to resolve conflicting creditors' claims. Yukos still possessed 2 substantial production subsidiaries\u2014 Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft\u2014as well as refining and marketing assets, and several non-core assets that it could readily have disposed of to pay off its outstanding debts and remain a going concern. However, the Russian authorities' priority was not recouping taxes; nor did they have any intention of allowing Yukos to survive as a going concern. The initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings provided a convenient way to sideline Yukos' management and to facilitate the taking of the Company's remaining assets.\n\n47. *Forcing Yukos into bankruptcy.* As a result of the Russian Federation's attack, Yukos defaulted on a US$ 1 billion loan granted by a syndicate of Western banks. On December 13, 2005, Rosneft entered into a confidential agreement with the syndicate under which Rosneft agreed to pay the outstanding amount owed by Yukos in exchange for the assignment to Rosneft of the syndicate's rights of claim against Yukos. *Crucially*, the payment of Yukos' debt by Rosneft was conditioned upon the initiation of Yukos' bankruptcy by the syndicate. Pursuant to that agreement, on March 6, 2006, the syndicate filed a petition with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare Yukos bankrupt, and on March 14, 2006, Rosneft paid off the loan.\n\n48. On March 28, 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court ordered the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, placed Yukos under supervision, appointed Mr. Rebgun as interim administrator, and formally substituted Rosneft for the syndicate as creditor.\n\n49. The Respondent argues that \"sound commercial interests\" explain both the syndicate's sale of the loan and Rosneft's reasons for acquiring the same. However, even if that were the case, the Respondent still fails to answer the basic question: why not simply have the syndicate of banks assign their claim to Rosneft, and let Rosneft put Yukos into bankruptcy? The only plausible explanation for this elaborate stratagem was to conceal the Russian Federation's role in initiating the bankruptcy of Yukos.\n\n50. *Ensuring the Russian State's control over the bankruptcy proceedings.* After Rosneft initiated the bankruptcy through the syndicate, the Russian courts ensured that the Russian State, either directly or through Rosneft, would become Yukos' main creditor.\n\n51. *First*, the Russian courts bent over backwards to ensure that the tax authorities' purported claims would be admitted, by: (i) delaying a scheduled hearing in order to give \"the State more time to prove new tax claims\", namely, the US$ 3.9 billion in tax payment demands for 2004, which the tax authorities rushed to issue on March 17, 2006, 11 days after the bankruptcy petition was filed; (ii) merging Yukos' challenge to that payment demand into the bankruptcy proceedings; and (iii) approving all the tax authorities' purported claims against Yukos for the years 2000-2004 following a wholly perfunctory review of the voluminous case files. Consequently, the Federal Taxation Service was by far Yukos' largest creditor with 60.50% of all registered bankruptcy claims.\n\n52. *Second*, in the period leading up to the first meeting of Yukos' registered creditors on July 20, 2006, some 29 purported claims were admitted on behalf of Yuganskneftegaz, now Rosneft's subsidiary, totaling approximately US$ 4.42 billion. Subsequently, Rosneft secured admission of an even larger claim of US$ 5.55 billion premised on an allegation that Yuganskneftegaz had suffered \"lost profits\" in this amount during the period 2000-2003. These purported claims of US$ 9.97 billion enabled Rosneft to more than recoup the US$ 9.35 billion paid for Yuganskneftegaz and thereby acquire the Company for free. With the admission of these and various smaller claims, Rosneft became Yukos' second largest creditor with 37.17% of all registered bankruptcy claims.\n\n53. *Third*, while the Russian court hearing Yukos' bankruptcy showed great flexibility in admitting any and all claims to benefit the Russian State, it was intransigent and formalistic in finding pretexts not to recognize substantial claims of creditors related to Yukos or to Yukos' shareholders.\n\n54. These combined efforts resulted in the complete monopolization of Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings by the Russian State, which held 97.67% of all bankruptcy claims, guaranteeing its control over the bankruptcy process.\n\n55. *Rejection of Yukos' Rehabilitation Plan.* The Financial Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos' management (\"the Rehabilitation Plan\") set out a series of concrete measures that would enable Yukos to pay off its alleged liabilities fully within 2 years, while remaining a viable going concern. This would be achieved by, among other things, creating a \"cash pool\" from the sale of ancillary assets, cash flows generated by Yukos' remaining core assets, and more than US$ 1.5 billion from the sale of Yukos' 53.7% stake in the Lithuanian oil company Mazeikiu Nafta and Yukos' 49% stake in Slovakian oil transport major Transpetrol.\n\n56. By contrast, according to Mr. Rebgun, the potential proceeds from the sale of Yukos' remaining assets, which he significantly undervalued at US$ 17.75 billion (after deducting the 24% profit tax payable on auction proceeds), were not sufficient to cover the US$ 18.3 billion of registered bankruptcy claims. Accordingly, he did not even bother to propose any measure for the Company's financial restoration but simply recommended liquidation. In the event, despite the fact that the bankruptcy auction prices represented significant markdowns from market value, the bankruptcy estate netted approximately US$ 35.55 billion\u2014twice the amount Mr. Rebgun had put forward to argue in favor of liquidation.\n\n57. Ultimately, the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft held 93.87% of votes at the meeting of Yukos' creditors of July 25, 2006. It therefore came as no surprise that they rejected the Rehabilitation Plan and voted to liquidate Yukos' assets, despite the fact that Yukos' assets exceeded its alleged liabilities, and the Company was clearly solvent.\n\n58. *The bankruptcy auctions.* Yukos' remaining assets were transferred to the Russian State at well below their fair market value through a series of 17 auctions held between March 2006 and August 2007. Rosneft thereby directly or indirectly acquired Yukos' key remaining assets, including Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and Tomskneft (Lot No. 10), which were sold at a gross discount of approximately 37% and 33%, respectively, of their fair market value. For its part, Gazprom acquired through Eni/Enel the 20% minus 1 share stake in Sibneft that the Russian Federation had persistently refused to let Yukos sell to pay off alleged tax debts. As with the sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no genuine competition in the bankruptcy auctions and, in many instances, including those for Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft, the only participants were Rosneft and a previously unknown entity whose sole role was to satisfy the formal requirement that there be a minimum of 2 bidders.\n\n59. Finally, when, by the end of July 2007, it became clear that despite the low auction prices, the bankruptcy might still generate some surplus, further claims were admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the Russian State, through the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft. This ensured the completeness of Yukos' destruction and the transfer of its value and assets to the Russian State. Thus, the Russian Federation received, either directly or through State-owned Rosneft or Gazprom, approximately 99.71% of the bankruptcy proceeds and over 95% of Yukos' remaining assets, including all of Yukos' main production assets.\n\n60. On November 12, 2007, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally endorsed all the activities of Yukos' receiver Mr. Rebgun, closed the Company's receivership and ordered that Yukos be struck off the register of legal entities. The latter happened on November 21, 2007: Yukos was removed from the register of companies, its shares were legally extinguished and so, too, were the Claimants' investments.\n\n**D. CONCLUSION**\n\n61. Seen together, the Russian Federation's actions can only be reasonably understood as a deliberate and sustained effort to destroy Yukos, gain control over its assets and eliminate Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political opponent. Indeed, viewed any other way, they make no sense and the Respondent has been unable to provide a plausible alternative explanation for its actions.\n\n**III. LAW**\n\n**A. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ART. 10(1)** **ECT**\n\n62. Under Article 10(1) ECT, the Russian Federation undertook to \"encourage and create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for Investors\", to accord at all times \"fair and equitable treatment\" to investments made in its territory and not to \"in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of such investments, which \"shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security\".\n\n63. The Russian Federation violated the above mentioned undertakings in the most egregious manner. In particular, it violated its obligation under Article 10(1) ECT to provide to the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment, by failing to meet basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process, engaging in conduct that was unreasonable, arbitrary, disproportionate and abusive, and failing to ensure a stable and transparent legal and business framework. The Russian Federation's actions also constituted a denial of justice in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard of Article 10(1) ECT, as demonstrated by, *inter alia*, the removal of judges refusing to rule in the Russian State's favor and the lack of independence and impartiality of judges hearing Yukos' cases.\n\n64. The Russian Federation also breached Article 10(1) ECT by discriminating against the Claimants' investments. In particular, it (i) singled out Yukos and treated it in a markedly different manner from other similar oil companies in Russia, (ii) treated Yuganskneftegaz differently before and after its acquisition by State-owned Rosneft, in the hands of which the former Yukos subsidiary's alleged tax liabilities all but disappeared, and (iii) ensured a differential treatment in the bankruptcy proceedings between creditors related to Yukos, on the one hand, and State-related creditors, on the other.\n\n65. The Respondent's primary defense is to invoke Article 21 ECT to argue that the Claimants' claims should be dismissed on the ground that they are \"based exclusively on measures \u2018 *with respect to Taxation Measures.* '\" As discussed below, not only is the Respondent's interpretation of Article 21 ECT untenable, but the Russian Federation's conduct had nothing to do with the genuine exercise of its taxation power and is thus not covered by Article 21 ECT.\n\n66. The Respondent has moreover attempted to restrict the scope of its treaty obligations by misrepresenting the content of the fair and equitable treatment and discrimination standards in Article 10(1) ECT. Such attempts are groundless and should be rejected.\n\n**B. THE RussiAN FEDERATioN is iN BREACH oF iTs oBLiGATioNs uNDER ART. 13(1)** **ECT**\n\n67. The Russian Federation expropriated the Claimants' investments in breach of Article 13(1) ECT.\n\n68. As of October 2003, Yukos was one of the largest oil companies in the world. It held 92% of Sibneft, 3 core production subsidiaries (Yuganskneftegaz, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft), as well as refining and marketing subsidiaries. As of November 21, 2007, it ceased to exist as a company, owing to a series of actions by which the Russian Federation seized its assets and transferred their title to State-owned Rosneft and Gazprom. The only plausible explanation for the Russian Federation's actions is the twin desire of dismantling the Company and transferring its assets to the State and the removal of Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political opponent. The result of those actions was a complete and total deprivation of the Claimants' investments therein.\n\n69. The Russian Federation moreover failed to satisfy any of the 4 conditions set out in Article 13(1) ECT. The expropriation of the Claimants' investments was manifestly: (i) not in the public interest; (ii) discriminatory; (iii) carried out without due process of law; and (iv) not accompanied by the payment of any compensation, let alone prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n70. Unable to deny the total deprivation of the Claimants' investments and the transfer of title of Yukos' assets to State-owned Rosneft and Gazprom, the Respondent disaggregates its actions and argues that, when taken in isolation, each of them was, under Russian law, a proper response to Yukos' alleged conduct. While, in fact, many of those actions amounted to a gross distortion or abuse of Russian law, lawfulness under domestic law is not, in any event, the proper inquiry under Article 13(1) ECT. Under the applicable international law standards, the actions of the Russian Federation, in their totality, constitute an expropriation of the Claimants' investments in breach of Article 13(1) ECT for which compensation is due.\n\n**IV. DAMAGES**\n\n71. The Russian Federation is under an obligation to make full reparation to the Claimants for the financial consequences of its breaches of Articles 10(1) and 13(1) ECT. This standard of reparation is not challenged by the Respondent.\n\n72. The magnitude of these financial consequences cannot be underestimated. As a result of the Respondent's actions, the Claimants have lost the entire value of their investments in YukosSibneft, as well as the benefits they should have received from those investments. The Claimants' valuation expert, Navigant, has quantified the Claimants' damages for the loss of their investments in YukosSibneft at US$ 114,174 billion.\n\n73. Navigant has also quantified the Claimants' damages for the loss of their investments in YukosSibneft in 3 alternative scenarios, assuming that: (i) the Respondent does not bear responsibility for the demerger between Yukos and Sibneft, which it does; (ii) further, all tax reassessments were legitimate, which they were not; and (iii) in addition, the sale of Yuganskneftegaz was legitimate, which it was not, and assessing the Claimants' damages at US$ 107,966 billion, US$ 69,583 billion, and US$ 33,317 billion, respectively.\n\n74. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent chose not to challenge Navigant's valuation of the Claimants' expropriated investments underlying their principal claims for damages, instead seeking to divert the Tribunal's attention through a series of flawed objections. When the Respondent did make an effort to address the subject, in its Rejoinder, its arguments were inaccurate and entirely divorced from historical data and contemporaneous valuations of YukosSibneft's assets.\n\n75. Navigant has provided the only reliable and methodologically sound model for calculating the compensation due to the Claimants by the Russian Federation for the expropriation of their investments in breach of Articles 10(1) and 13(1) ECT.\n\n**V. THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS SHOULD BE REJECTED**\n\n76. *The Respondent's rehashed \u2018fork-in-the-road' objection is both* res judicata *and groundless.* The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims because the Claimants are allegedly pursuing identical claims before the ECtHR. This very same objection was first raised in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of these arbitrations and unequivocally dismissed by the Tribunal. It is entirely inappropriate for the Respondent to reopen this issue, which is *res judicata*, on the basis that it was allegedly poorly decided. Further, the Respondent's allegations that the Interim Awards were based on an \"incorrect assumption\" or that there are \"special circumstances\" justifying a new examination of the issue are unfounded. The Respondent's objection based on Article 26(3)(b)(i) ECT is manifestly without merit and must fail.\n\n77. *The Respondent's attempt to rely on Article 21 ECT is misguided.* The issues arising in relation to Article 21 ECT have already been briefed at length in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of these arbitrations. In deferring the Respondent's objection based on Article 21 ECT to the merits phase, the Tribunal indicated that it did not wish to rule in a vacuum on the issue of the background to, and motivation behind, the Russian Federation's actions. In light of the Parties' pleadings on the merits, it is clear that those actions had nothing whatsoever to do with the genuine exercise of the Russian Federation's taxation powers, but were rather solely intended to destroy Yukos and gain control of its assets. Article 21 ECT clearly was not meant to shield a Contracting Party from such egregious conduct.\n\n78. Even assuming, however, that the Russian Federation's actions were a genuine exercise of its taxation powers, which they were not, those actions would nonetheless fall outside the scope of Article 21 ECT, which is limited to the enactment of tax provisions. Further, even if Article 21 ECT were applicable, which it is not, Article 21(5) ECT ensures that Article 13(1) ECT's substantive protection from expropriation remains fully intact. Finally, under any interpretation of Article 21 ECT, many of the Russian Federation's actions had nothing to do with taxation and thus fall outside the ambit of Article 21 ECT altogether.\n\n79. Conversely, under the Respondent's interpretation of Article 21 ECT, save for expropriatory \"charges or payments, to the exclusion of enforcement and collection measures, including interest and fines\", investors would stand unprotected from any and all State actions, so long as the respondent State in an arbitration labels its actions as \"taxation\"\u2014regardless of whether such actions had anything to do with taxation, or were being pursued with the sole aim of expropriating or otherwise harming an investor's investment. Such an interpretation, which would turn Article 21 ECT into a gaping hole in one of the key multilateral treaties on investment protection, is clearly untenable and should be rejected.\n\n80. *The Respondent's so-called \"unclean hands\" theory is without merit.* The Respondent argues that over a period of approximately 12 years, an array of actors engaged in a variety of allegedly \"illegal and bad faith misconduct\" that somehow deprive the Claimants' investments of ECT protection. The Respondent's position is fundamentally unfounded for several reasons. *First*, the so-called \"unclean hands\" theory finds no support in the text of the ECT, customary international law, or investment treaty jurisprudence. *Second*, even assuming the existence of such a general principle of international law, which the Claimants deny, its scope would be dramatically more limited than the Respondent contends, such that the Respondent has not alleged any facts that could establish its applicability in the present case. As demonstrated by the Claimants, the Respondent's theory is premised almost exclusively on allegations of collateral illegalities, unrelated either to the making of the Claimants' investments, or to the Claimants' claims in these arbitrations, and all but one of which assert misconduct by third parties. *Third*, and in any event, the Respondent has failed utterly to substantiate any of its allegations. *Finally*, the principles of estoppel and proportionality prevent the Respondent from invoking such alleged illegalities in an attempt to escape liability for its violations of the ECT.\n\n81. In its Rejoinder, while recounting its laundry list of alleged misconduct, the Respondent devotes attention solely to its allegation concerning the application of the 1998 Russia-Cyprus Double Taxation Agreement (\"DTA\"). Apart from the fact that: (i) this allegation has no bearing on the merits of these arbitrations; and (ii) these arbitrations are not the appropriate forum to hear and decide an alleged dispute on the application of the DTA, the Claimants have, in any event, demonstrated that this allegation is baseless. The Respondent's so-called \"unclean hands\" objection is thus without merit and must fail.\n\n**Vi. REQuEsT FoR RELiEF**\n\n82. For the reasons set out above, the Claimants respectfully request the Arbitral Tribunal to render an Award granting the relief set out in paragraph 1199 of the Claimants' Reply.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S SKELETON ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs 1 to 104 of Respondent's Skeleton Argument submitted on 1 October 2012 (\" **Respondent's Skeleton** \") (annexes omitted).\n\n**I. The Russian Federation Properly Assessed Taxes And Fines Against Yukos**\n\n1. Yukos fraudulently evaded billions of dollars of Russian corporate profit tax from 1999 to 2004, abusing the program authorized by the Russian Government in the early 1990s to foster economic development in designated economically underdeveloped areas. Under this program, corporate profits in the low-tax regions were taxed at substantially reduced rates if the taxpayer complied with the applicable legal rules, including Russia's anti-tax abuse principles.\n\n2. In order to properly avail itself of the benefits available in a low-tax region, Yukos was required to comply with three legal regimes: (a) the federal statute authorizing the low-tax region program and the region's own statutes; (b) Yukos' agreements with the regional authorities; and (c) Russia's federal anti-tax abuse \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine.\n\n3. The federal bad faith taxpayer doctrine is rooted in Russia's federal Constitution, and has been applied by Russian tax authorities and courts in thousands of cases since the mid-1990s to condemn abusive transactions that, in substance, constitute unlawful tax evasion. As described by Yukos' own tax lawyers in commentaries they published before the assessments at issue in these arbitrations, this doctrine condemns as tax evasion transactions in which \"the taxpayer's actions were aimed solely to reduce the amount of its tax payments rather than to achieve an economic result, [as] this would demonstrate that the relevant transaction was inconsistent with law because the motive underlying such transaction was to avoid tax [...]. A person's actions aimed solely at tax evasion may not be regarded as actions made in good faith.\"\n\n4. Yukos abused the low-tax region program, and evaded Russian corporate profit tax in violation of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine, by implementing what Yukos referred to internally as its \"tax optimization\" scheme. Pursuant to this scheme, Yukos established dozens of sham \"trading companies\" in low-tax regions that had no business purpose, and then shifted its own profits to the sham trading companies. These sham trading shells had no genuine economic substance and served no purpose other than to reduce Yukos' tax liabilities, an arrangement described by Yukos' own lawyers as constituting unlawful tax evasion.\n\n5. The European Court of Human Rights (\"ECtHR\") unanimously rejected Yukos' challenge of the tax assessments that are at issue here, on the basis of the same core principles that underlie these arbitrations. The ECtHR found that Yukos' \"tax optimization\" scheme consisted of \"switching the tax burden from [Yukos] and its production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in Russia,\" and that these \"letter box companies\" had \"no assets, employees or operations of their own [and] were nominally owned and managed by third parties, although in reality they were set up and run by [Yukos] itself.\"\n\n6. According to the ECtHR, the \"letter-box companies\" (a) purchased oil and oil products from Yukos' production companies at a fraction of their true market prices, (b) \"acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market price or to [Yukos'] refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and re-sold it at the market price,\" (c) thereby accumulated most of Yukos' profits in the low-tax regions, resulting in Yukos paying substantially lower taxes on those profits, and (d) then unilaterally transferred to Yukos, as a gift or in purported repayment of sham loans, the profits that had been improperly taxed at reduced rates in the low-tax regions. The ECtHR unanimously concluded that this scheme \"was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code\n\n7. The Russian tax authorities concluded that Yukos' \"tax optimization\" scheme constituted unlawful tax evasion under the bad faith taxpayer doctrine. In particular, the Russian tax authorities found, and the Russian courts later agreed, that Yukos had abused the low-tax region program because its trading shells (a) did not engage in any genuine business activities in the low-tax regions, but were instead controlled by Yukos from Moscow, (b) purchased oil and oil products at below-market prices solely to artificially concentrate Yukos' profits in low-tax regions, and (c) made only paltry investments in the low-tax regions that were dwarfed by the tax benefits they claimed, thereby failing to fulfill the purpose of the low-tax region program.\n\n8. Yukos did not then -- or later -- offer any rationale for selling Yukos' oil through its network of low tax region trading companies other than reducing Yukos' own tax liabilities, nor have Claimants done so in these arbitrations.\n\n9. Yukos was aware of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine and the risk that its scheme would result in substantial tax assessments if the Russian authorities were ever to learn of it. Among other things, (a) Yukos knew that the authorities had previously denied the low-tax region benefits claimed by several sham trading shells in the Lesnoy region and Sibirskaya based on the same Russian anti-abuse rules that were later applied to Yukos (the Russian authorities only later learned that Yukos exercised *de facto* control over and management of Sibirskaya and the Lesnoy trading shells, and that Yukos surreptitiously liquidated the latter in order to prevent the collection of their overdue taxes), (b) Yukos managers had expressly warned the company's senior executives in internal memoranda that public disclosure of the scheme \"will result in substantial tax claims against the Company,\" (c) as Yukos' former deputy general counsel later conceded, none of the company's external lawyers was willing to render an opinion endorsing its scheme (to the contrary, in refusing to render a \"clean\" opinion, one cited the need to comply with the same bad faith taxpayer doctrine that later led the Russian tax authorities and courts to find that Yukos was guilty of tax evasion), and (d) Yukos had access to the numerous court decisions applying the bad faith taxpayer doctrine to abusive tax schemes -- including those finding Lukoil, one of Yukos' major competitors, liable for substantial additional amounts for having abused the low-tax region program -and to the published legal commentaries discussing the bad faith taxpayer doctrine and its requirements, including those written by its own tax lawyers.\n\n10. Yukos' knowledge that its \"tax optimization\" scheme was unlawful is further confirmed by Yukos' repeated lies to the tax authorities, the Russian courts, the ECtHR, and Yukos' own external auditors, including Yukos' knowingly false assertion that it was not affiliated with (and did not control) the sham trading shells, a point now conceded even by Claimants. Yukos' repeated false denial of its affiliation with the sham trading shells can only be explained by the company's awareness of the illegality of its scheme.\n\n11. Yukos' tax evasion was not victimless. The billions of dollars in tax benefits it wrongfully claimed caused commensurate damage to the regional budget of Moscow, where Yukos, as the real party in interest, should have paid profit tax at the full rate.\n\n12. Claimants' claims that the Russian authorities' measures were expropriatory and unfair are meritless. First, Claimants' contention that the legal principles applied by the Russian courts were \"novel\" or \"vague\" is, as the ECtHR unanimously found, refuted by the numerous Russian court decisions that applied these principles and similar ones to hold taxpayers liable for tax evasion since the mid-1990s, including their abuse of the low-tax region program. Moreover, the published legal commentaries, including the guidance published by Yukos' own tax counsel, describe those principles in the same terms as they were applied to Yukos. The relevant Russian judicial precedents include those compiled for the Tribunal by Russian tax law expert Oleg Konnov, whose description of the history and content of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine Claimants have not sought to rebut with any expert testimony.\n\n13. Mr. Konnov shows that the fines assessed against Yukos were also proper because, among other reasons, no taxpayer -- in Russia or elsewhere -- could legitimately claim to be surprised that it may not invoke a limitations period that has expired only because of its own obstruction of tax audits.\n\n14. Claimants also ignore the extensive international precedents demonstrating that the principles applied by the Russian authorities and the actions they took against Yukos' tax evasion were consistent with those of ECT signatories and other nations worldwide.\n\n15. Second, Claimants' attack on Yukos' VAT assessments -- holding Yukos liable for the VAT due on revenues nominally realized by the sham trading shells but properly attributable to Yukos itself -- is also meritless. As the ECtHR unanimously held, the Russian authorities acted properly in disregarding Yukos' sham trading shells for profit tax purposes and denying Yukos the benefit of the shells' 0% VAT filings. Claimants also ignore Yukos' still unexplained failure to submit proper 0% VAT returns in its own name after it received its December 29, 2003 tax audit report. It is not disputed that Yukos could have filed proper VAT returns -- nothing prevented it from doing so -- or that had it done so, it would have avoided more than half of its challenged tax liabilities.\n\n16. Third, Claimants' assertion that the tax assessments were discriminatory is contradicted by the facts. The ECtHR unanimously rejected this charge. Several large Russian companies, including a number of Yukos' principal competitors, were also held liable for tax evasion and assessed substantial amounts of tax on grounds similar to those relied on by the Russian authorities and courts in dealing with Yukos. But unlike Yukos, these other companies promptly paid their taxes and, in the case of Lukoil, publicly abandoned its own \"tax optimization\" scheme.\n\n17. There were also numerous material differences between Yukos' conduct and that of many other Russian oil companies: (a) no other Russian oil company committed abuses that were as egregious as those of Yukos, (b) none did so for as long as Yukos, (c) none attempted to conceal its abuses as did Yukos (to the extent of lying about them to the tax authorities, the courts, and even its own auditors), (d) none obstructed their tax audits as did Yukos, including by sending documents and employees to distant locations before they could be reviewed and interviewed, (e) none made investments in the low-tax regions that were so miniscule in comparison to the tax benefits they claimed, (f) none diverted billions of dollars offshore to prevent the collection of overdue taxes, and (g) none refused to pay their assessed taxes when ultimately required to do so.\n\n18. Fourth, Claimants' contention that the Russian authorities knew and approved of Yukos' scheme is completely unsupported by any credible evidence, as the ECtHR again unanimously found. Claimants' contention cannot be reconciled with Yukos' unflagging efforts to conceal its scheme from the Russian authorities. Yukos would obviously have had no reason to hide its scheme if it believed the authorities were already aware of it, let alone had approved it, or if it thought its scheme was lawful and its disclosure would not lead to substantial tax claims. Yukos' efforts to conceal its scheme are reflected in (a) the company's convoluted offshore structures, serving no purpose other than to mask Yukos' affiliation with its sham trading shells, (b) Yukos' *seriatim* restructuring of its Lesnoy trading shells after their abuse of that region's low tax program was discovered, (c) Yukos' management's internal warnings that disclosure of its scheme \"will result in substantial tax claims against the Company,\" (d) Yukos' failure to disclose its scheme in its purportedly \"transparent\" financial statements, and (e) Yukos' repeated lies about its scheme to the tax authorities, the courts, the ECtHR, and its own auditors.\n\n19. In any event, as a matter of Russian law and as Claimants concede, even if the tax authorities had known of Yukos' scheme -- and there is no evidence they did -- they would not have been estopped from later challenging it.\n\n20. Fifth, Claimants' contention that the assessments against Yukos were fabricated as part of a politically motivated campaign to dismantle Yukos - an allegation on which Claimants have unambiguously staked their claims, contending that the assessments \"cannot be explained in any other way\" -- is, as the ECtHR again unanimously found, unsupported by any credible evidence. If the assessments were, as Claimants insist, the product of a massive political conspiracy spanning several years and involving numerous government agencies, engineered and implemented by hundreds if not thousands of officials, including no fewer than 60 judges at four different levels of courts, along with a large cast of third parties around the globe, then surely after nearly a decade of challenges -- by Yukos, its minority shareholders, and now Claimants -- at least one internal government memorandum, instruction or minute of a meeting evidencing or referring to the grand conspiracy alleged by Claimants would have surfaced, or one disgruntled former Government official would have reported having participated in a meeting or telephone call where the alleged conspiracy was discussed. Instead, Claimants rely solely on double and triple hearsay renditions of purported conversations by vocal opponents of the Russian Government, inaccurate and uninformed reports by political commentators, and sheer innuendo, none of which, even as proffered, competently supports Claimants' conspiracy allegations.\n\n21. Claimants' failure to prove the supposed vast conspiracy confirms that it is merely one more sham perpetrated by the Oligarchs who controlled Yukos and were ultimately responsible for its demise.\n\n22. Yukos' dealings with PricewaterhouseCoopers (\"PwC\") provide yet another example of Yukos' blaming the Russian Federation for the consequences of its own misconduct.\n\n23. PwC withdrew all of its Yukos audit opinions in June 2007 (after refusing to continue to audit the company's U.S. GAAP financial statements in 2003, itself an extraordinary event for a supposedly \"transparent\" company), following confirmation that Yukos' senior managers had repeatedly lied to PwC about, among other things, Yukos' *de facto* control over the management of its sham trading shells -- an essential element in the company's \"tax optimization\" scheme.\n\n24. Claimants' attempt to blame the Russian Federation for PwC's withdrawal of the firm's audit opinions finds no support in the record. To the contrary, both PwC's senior Russian representative at the time (in a contemporaneous private conversation with U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow) and PwC's senior Yukos auditor (in sworn U.S. deposition testimony) confirm that PwC, in withdrawing its audit opinions, acted in accordance with applicable auditing standards, a conclusion supported by Mr. John Ellison, a former KPMG LLP partner, in his unchallenged expert report. The U.S. deposition testimony of Mr. Douglas Miller, the PwC partner in charge of auditing Yukos, is especially relevant, because (a) it was sought by counsel for Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev on the grounds that it would provide the best opportunity to obtain a truthful account of the reasons for PwC's actions, and (b) Mr. Miller repeatedly rejected Claimants' \"harassment\" theory.\n\n25. On all of these points, the *RosInvestCo* and *Rovime* awards are inconsistent with the facts and Russian law, and ignore a wealth of uncontested international practice.\n\n**II. The Russian Federation Is Not Responsible For And Did Not Cause The Unwinding Of The Sibneft Merger**\n\n26. The Russian Federation is not responsible for the unwinding of Yukos' proposed merger with Sibneft because Claimants do not allege -- let alone establish -- that Sibneft was then exercising governmental authority or acting under the instructions of Russian State organs. Nor was the Russian Federation the cause of the unwinding of the merger. To the contrary, the Russian Federation repeatedly supported the proposed merger, and Claimants themselves acknowledge that the Russian Federation provided all of the approvals necessary for the merger, including approvals granted long after the Russian Federation's supposed attack on Yukos.\n\n27. The merger in fact collapsed because Yukos refused to accommodate Sibneft's request that Mr. Khodorkovsky, following his resignation from Yukos' management, be replaced by a Sibneft nominee as head of the to-be merged company. Sibneft's proposal would have left Yukos representatives in all of the surviving company's other senior management positions.\n\n28. Documents that Claimants were ordered to produce in these proceedings (over their objection) show that Claimants and Sibneft's principal shareholders agreed to unwind the merger without the payment of additional compensation by either side, an agreement fatal to Claimants' request for damages relating to the proposed merger. The same documents also reveal that Yukos' management proposed its own plan to unwind the merger without the payment of additional compensation, and that this plan contemplated the initiation of a \"sham\" lawsuit challenging the previously-completed exchange of Yukos and Sibneft shares. The contemplated lawsuit bears a striking resemblance to the actual lawsuit (challenged by Yukos in these arbitrations) that was brought by two of Yukos' shareholders and ultimately led to the legal unwinding of the merger without the payment of additional compensation.\n\n29. Claimants' assertion that the US$ 2 billion giga-dividend was required by the Sibneft merger is patently untrue. The record shows that the giga-dividend was approved on November 28, 2003 (and not on September 25, 2003, as Claimants falsely asserted in their Reply), one day after Yukos was informed that the Sibneft merger would not proceed. At the Extraordinary General Meeting of Yukos' shareholders held on November 28, Claimants voted against all the other shareholder proposals linked to the completion of the Sibneft merger, but supported payment of the giga-dividend \"for Yukos\" (that is, for Claimants to the extent of 70% of the dividend).\n\n**III Yukos Bears Sole Responsibility For The Consequences Of The Assessments** **Properly Made Against It, Because It Could Have Avoided Those** **Consequences -- And Reduced Its Liability By Well More Than Half - By Paying The Amounts Due During The First Quarter Of 2004, While Continuing To Challenge The Assessments In Full**\n\n30. During the first quarter of 2004, Yukos could have avoided well more than half of its ultimate tax exposure by paying its corporate profit taxes and the interest then due and by filing proper amended VAT returns in its own name. Had Yukos taken these few simple steps -- abiding by its own tax counsel's published advice as to how a taxpayer should mitigate its tax liabilities -- it would also have avoided all of the subsequent enforcement measures about which Claimants complain, and still preserved its right to seek a refund of all the taxes it paid.\n\n31. If Yukos had mitigated its liabilities in this way, its total exposure under the Russian court rulings that Claimants challenge in these arbitrations would have been capped at less than US$ 9.8 billion, rather than the US$ 25.8 billion that was ultimately assessed.\n\n32. Yukos had more than ample resources in the first quarter of 2004 to cap its tax exposure at less than US$ 9.8 billion and to satisfy that liability, even after paying its unprecedented US$ 2 billion giga-dividend, but it elected not to do so.\n\n33. Instead, Yukos pursued an irrational and ultimately self-destructive course of action, for which only the managers of Yukos, installed and controlled by Claimants, are to blame. This course of action included (a) Yukos' continuing denial of any liability for its assessed taxes, (b) Yukos' now acknowledged false denial that it controlled the sham trading shells, (c) Yukos' repeated obstruction of the actions taken by the Russian authorities to enforce and collect the company's overdue taxes, (d) Yukos' dissipation of its own assets and those of the companies it controlled, to frustrate the collection of the taxes it owed, and (e) Yukos' attempt to put pressure on the Russian Government by mounting an aggressive international lobbying and disinformation campaign that sought to politicize what, for the Russian authorities, was always a matter of tax evasion and collection.\n\n34. All of the subsequent enforcement proceedings and other measures about which Claimants now complain were thus the result of Yukos' own adamant refusal to acknowledge or mitigate its tax liabilities, and its repeated attempts to dissipate and conceal its assets and to frustrate the enforcement and collection of its overdue taxes. Had Yukos not persisted in this self-destructive course of action, there would have been no April injunction (discussed below), and YNG would not have been sold.\n\n35. Permitting Claimants to benefit from Yukos' self-inflicted wounds would contravene basic legal principles, and provide Claimants with a windfall -- beyond the billions of dollars they have already extracted from Yukos, including by way of dividends, share sales, and *stichting* assets -- to which they are not entitled.\n\n**IV. The Russian Federation Acted Properly In Enforcing The Tax Assessments Against Yukos, Including By Auctioning YNG**\n\n36. The tax assessments were enforced against Yukos in compliance with Russian law and after ample notice to Yukos. As the ECtHR unanimously concluded, there is \"no reason to doubt that throughout the proceedings the actions of various authorities had a lawful basis and that the legal provisions in question were sufficiently precise and clear.\" The enforcement actions were also measured and appropriate in the circumstances and entirely consistent with international practice.\n\n37. Claimants' and Yukos' contention that Yukos was \"surprised\" by the timing of the assessment for 2000 and the need to make prompt payment is false and indicative of Yukos' lack of good faith. Promptly upon receipt of the December 29, 2003 audit report, Yukos' internal and external counsel advised Yukos that, under established Russian law and practice, it should expect to receive a final tax assessment within about a month, and that this assessment would require Yukos to make full payment promptly, most likely within one day. In the event, the tax assessment for 2000 was issued on April 14, 2004, more than two months later than Yukos' advisors had expected, and required payment in two days, not one.\n\n38. Although Yukos had ample notice of when and how much it would be required to pay, it made no effort to marshal the necessary assets, instead claiming that it was not able to pay, even though Claimants now acknowledge that Yukos had sufficient resources to pay all of its 2000 taxes.\n\n39. By the time of Yukos' April 2004 assessment, the tax authorities had learned that Yukos controlled the Lesnoy shell companies and had sought to prevent the payment of their overdue taxes by dissolving them. The tax authorities thus understandably applied to the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in April 2004 for enforcement of Yukos' 2000 tax liability and for an injunction prohibiting Yukos from selling or encumbering the company's shareholdings in its Russian subsidiaries.\n\n40. As the ECtHR held, the authorities' actions were neither arbitrary nor unfair:\n\n\"[T]he Ministry's action was lodged under the rule which made it unnecessary to wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute was insoluble and, regard being had to the circumstances of the case, [the Court] finds no indication of arbitrariness or unfairness [...] in this connection.\" [emphases added]\n\n41. The April injunction did not affect Yukos' use of its substantial on- and off-shore cash resources, and did not affect Yukos' offshore assets at all. Yukos nonetheless falsely claimed that the injunction prevented Yukos from paying its taxes, again evidencing its lack of good faith and credibility.\n\n42. No further enforcement efforts were taken for more than two months. During this period, Yukos continued to generate close to US$ 2 billion each month in gross receipts that Yukos partly transferred off-shore and partly used to voluntarily pay its loan to GML's Moravel shell subsidiary -- but not to pay its tax liabilities.\n\n43. Yukos also began a pattern of diminishing the value of its assets, often to the benefit of Claimants and the Oligarchs whose interests they represented. For example, Yukos forced its production subsidiaries to guarantee Yukos' already outstanding US$ 1.6 billion loan from Moravel, corroborating the concerns that had led the authorities to obtain the April injunction.\n\n44. Following Yukos' failure to make (or even to promise to make) any tax payments, as well as its dissipation of substantial assets, Russia's bailiffs finally attached a number of Yukos' on-shore bank accounts at the end of June 2004 -- ten weeks after the April tax assessment and 26 weeks after Yukos' legal advisors advised that it needed to be prepared to pay promptly. It was only then that Yukos began to pay some, but not all, of its taxes.\n\n45. The authorities also sought to seize Yukos' shares in its production subsidiaries to prevent Yukos from encumbering them. True to form, Yukos attempted to frustrate the bailiffs' efforts by terminating the share registry company contract for its production subsidiaries and concealing their registries, directing that they be sent from central Moscow to remote locations around the country.\n\n46. Yukos also took steps to reduce the value of its largest production subsidiary, YNG. First, Yukos caused YNG to stop paying its mineral extraction taxes, imperiling its production licenses. Second, Yukos and its trading shells stopped paying YNG for its crude oil, leaving YNG with more than US$ 4 billion in unpaid invoices. And third, Yukos continued to divert funds to GML, its majority shareholder, arranging for the payment of more than US$ 700 million to Moravel, even after the cash freeze orders were in place.\n\n47. Yukos also made a series of bad faith offers to \"settle\" a portion of its tax liabilities, repeatedly offering Sibneft shares as a partial payment or as security for proposed future payment, even though Russian law did not allow payment in kind, Yukos' title to the proffered shares had been challenged by a third-party, and an injunction had been issued (at the request of the third-party) prohibiting their sale or encumbrance.\n\n48. During this entire period, nothing prevented Yukos from selling its assets subject to the bailiffs' approval and using the proceeds to pay its tax obligations.\n\n49. Thus, the authorities found themselves confronted by a company that was fiercely resisting the payment of its overdue taxes, that had previously obstructed its tax audit, lied to the tax authorities and courts, and attempted to make itself and its subsidiaries judgment proof, and that was now burdening the tax authorities' principal security -- YNG -- with new liabilities. In these circumstances, the bailiffs understandably decided to sell a majority of YNG's shares -- the only realistic way to timely collect Yukos' unpaid taxes. Despite criticizing the bailiffs for not adequately documenting their decision-making process, the ECtHR concluded that the bailiffs' actions were not unreasonable. It is commonplace in other countries too for tax collection authorities to sell first the assets that best ensure payment.\n\n50. The sale of the YNG shares was carried out in accordance with Russian law and consistent with international practice. The authorities could have sold the shares to a designated purchaser in a directly negotiated transaction, but instead granted Yukos' request that the shares be auctioned. A formal and careful appraisal was conducted by DKW, and the starting price for the auction was set at a level consistent with DKW's appraisal, taking account of the fact that only 76.79% of the company's shares were sold and that YNG had its own outstanding tax liabilities. All bidders, foreign or domestic, were welcome to participate.\n\n51. Claimants and Yukos did all they could to prevent the auction from succeeding, threatening a \"lifetime of litigation\" against anyone who participated in or facilitated the sale. Yukos also initiated sham bankruptcy proceedings in Houston, obtaining a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") that prevented all the previously announced bidders and all of their banks from participating in the auction. If the price achieved was lower than it might otherwise have been, the fault lies solely with Claimants and Yukos.\n\n52. The YNG auction achieved a price of approximately US$ 9.4 billion, US$ 500 million more than the starting price. This result was consistent with the shares' appraised value and contemporaneous fair market value estimates.\n\n53. The evidence does not support Claimants' contention that the winning bidder, Baikal Finance, conspired with Rosneft. Rather, Baikal Finance found itself unable to finance its winning bid because of the Houston court's TRO, and thus at risk of losing its US$ 1.7 billion deposit unless a substitute purchaser, not dependent on immediate bank financing, could be found on very short notice. Rosneft simply seized a commercial opportunity that presented itself as a result of Claimants' misconduct.\n\n54. The net proceeds of the YNG sale were not sufficient to meet all of Yukos' tax obligations. The Russian authorities nonetheless gave Yukos ample time to pay the remaining balance, but it declined to do so, making clear that its priority was to place assets behind the shield of the Dutch *stichtings*.\n\n**V. The Russian Federation Acted Properly In Connection With Yukos' Bankruptcy, Which Was Precipitated By Yukos' Failure To Pay Its Debts To The SocGen Syndicate, And Is Not Attributable To The Russian Federation**\n\n55. Claimants' bankruptcy-related claims fail because critical conduct essential to these claims was taken by actors for which the Russian Federation is not responsible, including the SocGen syndicate, YNG, Rosneft, the Federal Tax Service acting as creditor, the meeting and committee of Yukos' creditors, Yukos' interim manager and bankruptcy receiver, the participants in Yukos' bankruptcy auctions, and the purchasers of the auctioned assets sold. In taking the actions complained of by Claimants, none of these actors was exercising sovereign authority or acting pursuant to the direction or control of sovereign authority. Claimants have provided no evidence on which the Tribunal could make a contrary finding.\n\n56. Yukos' dilatory and obstructionist treatment of its commercial creditors paralleled closely its treatment of the tax authorities. In both instances, Yukos (a) falsely claimed it was unable to meet its obligations, (b) forced its creditors to pursue their claims in multiple court proceedings where Yukos presented unsubstantiated defenses, (c) offered to negotiate with its creditors only when they were close to collecting their claims, (d) made unrealistic settlement proposals that were subsequently withdrawn, and (e) together with its controlling shareholders, strenuously resisted all collection efforts, prompting more aggressive action on the part of its creditors.\n\n57. Both sides agree that Yukos' bankruptcy was initiated by the SocGen syndicate, based upon Yukos' failure to pay an outstanding English court judgment after it was recognized in Russia.\n\n58. The SocGen syndicate simultaneously also sought payment of the same debt from Rosneft pursuant to the 2004 loan guarantee that Yukos had foisted on YNG, which Rosneft then owned. Although Rosneft disputed the validity of the guarantee, Rosneft required forbearance from the same banks on covenant breaches arising from the YNG acquisition, and Rosneft needed the banks' cooperation for its planned IPO. The convergence of the syndicate's and Rosneft's commercial interests resulted in their agreeing that Rosneft would pay the syndicate in full, but only after the syndicate had pursued all legal avenues to obtain payment from Yukos, the primary obligor. If Rosneft instead paid, the syndicate's rights under the loan agreement were to be assigned to Rosneft.\n\n59. Claimants acknowledge that this agreement was commercially-motivated and on commercial terms, but contend that its confidentiality clause evidences a conspiracy on the part of the SocGen syndicate to act secretly on behalf of Rosneft, which Claimants improperly equate with Respondent. The confidentiality clause, however, was itself a standard commercial term necessary to preserve the possibility that Yukos would pay the SocGen syndicate before Rosneft became unconditionally obligated to do so, and remained in effect only for so long as Yukos' payment would have discharged Rosneft's own obligation to pay the syndicate.\n\n60. Yukos satisfied the criteria for bankruptcy under Russian law due to its persistent failure to pay its commercial creditors, and was insolvent long before the proceedings were commenced. This is also undisputed.\n\n61. The proceedings were conducted in compliance with Russian law and international practice. The courts properly allowed the Federal Tax Service's, Rosneft's and YNG's claims, and substantial amounts of YNG's claims were never disputed by Yukos. Belying Claimants' discrimination charge, the courts also allowed some Yukos related-party claims, but properly rejected other abusive claims, such as the Moravel loan, a barely disguised attempt to turn equity into debt.\n\n62. Yukos' management, actively supported by Claimants, had the opportunity to present a rehabilitation plan to the meeting of creditors. The rough outline management submitted was, however, legally defective and did not provide any basis for creditors to prefer rehabilitation to liquidation. It was not properly presented to or approved by Yukos' shareholders, did not meet the legal requirement that the company's tax claims be satisfied within six months, and did not ensure full, let alone timely, payment of Yukos' creditors' claims.\n\n63. Once Yukos' liquidation was properly approved, the company's assets were sold at auction in accordance with Russian law and international practice. Yukos' receiver obtained appraisals for the fair value of the assets, and used those appraisals to set minimum bids in the auctions, all of which were exceeded, some by very large margins. The auctions were open to domestic and foreign bidders, adequately noticed and advertised, and competitive. To the extent that any bidders may have been discouraged from participating, this was again the result of Claimants and Yukos having threatened potential bidders with legal action. While the aggregate results exceeded Yukos' own (and other) contemporaneous fair market value estimates, more than US$ 9 billion in creditor claims nonetheless remained unsatisfied.\n\n**VI. Claimants Have Failed To Establish** ***Sine Qua Non*** **Elements Of Their Article 13 And 10(1) ECT Claims**\n\n**A. Article 21 ECT**\n\n64. First, as an initial matter, Claimants' claims must be based on measures outside the taxation carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT or, alternatively, within Article 21(1) ECT, but subject to one of the claw-backs of Article 21(2) to (5) ECT.\n\n65. Taxation carve-outs such as this one fulfill plainly legitimate functions. They (a) preserve the Contracting Parties' sovereign power in the field of taxation, which is of critical importance to the very existence of a State, (b) delineate the extensive network of investment treaties from the even broader network of taxation treaties, (c) pay due regard to the complexity of tax matters, and, in many cases, preserve the coordination role of the competent tax authorities under double taxation treaties.\n\n66. To fulfill these functions, taxation carve-outs are typically broad, covering all aspects of tax regimes, including tax enforcement measures.\n\n67. Article 21(1) ECT, under its plain meaning, covers the whole range of measures taken by all branches of government in the field of taxation. Tax legislation and enforcement measures are inextricably linked, and it is not possible to meaningfully dissociate them in the context of Article 21(1) ECT.\n\n68. The core allegations on which Claimants base their claims are squarely within the scope of Article 21(1) ECT: tax audits, tax assessments, interest and fines provoked by Yukos' failure to pay its assessed taxes, measures to ensure the effective collection of its taxes, and the sale of Yukos' assets to satisfy its tax liabilities.\n\n69. Claimants seek to avoid Article 21 ECT on two grounds, that Article 21(7)(a) ECT limits the scope of the taxation carve-out to tax legislation and tax treaties and does not apply to *mala fide* taxation measures. These arguments are baseless.\n\n70. Article 21(7)(a) ECT contains an illustrative list of taxation measures that does not replace the term \"measures\" with the term \"provisions,\" but underscores that the term \"Taxation Measures\" covers all aspects of the tax regime, including international and domestic measures.\n\n71. Claimants' position that Article 21(1) ECT is inapplicable to the taxation measures they complain about fails as a matter of fact and law. The record shows that the taxation measures at issue were a justified response to Yukos' massive tax fraud and its willful strategy to obstruct efforts to collect the taxes due. As a matter of law, Claimants mix two issues, the concept and definition of \"Taxation Measures,\" on the one hand, and their legality, on the other. Legality is determined under Part III of the ECT, but only to the extent of the claw-backs pursuant to Article 21(2) to (5) ECT.\n\n72. Article 21 ECT contains no claw-back for Article 10(1) ECT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over core allegations of Claimants' Article 10(1) ECT claims.\n\n73. Article 21(5) ECT contains a claw-back for Article 13 ECT claims, but is applicable only to \"taxes,\" and is combined with a mandatory referral to the competent tax authorities, a procedure invoked by Respondent in these proceedings. The expropriation claw-back, in its ordinary meaning, supported by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, applies to charges imposed by the State for public purposes, excluding tax enforcement and collection measures. When compared to the varying practices with respect to clawbacks in taxation carve-outs, the deliberate choice of the ECT negotiating States to reinstate expropriatory \"taxes\" represents a middle ground, which must be respected.\n\n**B. Article 13(1) ECT**\n\n74. In order to establish their claim for a breach of Article 13(1) ECT, Claimants must show that, in addition to being outside the scope of the taxation carveout of Article 21(1) ECT -- or within Article 21(1) ECT, but **reinstated** by Article 21(5) ECT -the measures complained of must be \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.\"\n\n75. First, Claimants have failed to establish that conduct not carved-out by Article 21 ECT that is (a) attributable to Respondent, and (b) an exercise of its sovereign power caused a total or near total deprivation of Claimants' investment. Critically, the core allegations of Claimants' claims are outside the scope of Article 13(1) ECT by virtue of Article 21 ECT. Moreover, Yukos itself engaged in conduct -- by refusing to pay the assessments against it when due, while preserving its right to challenge them - that directly resulted in the company's demise and the ensuing loss of Claimants' investments. Finally, conduct that was essential to Yukos' liquidation, including in particular the filing of the bankruptcy petition by the SocGen syndicate, and the creditors' meeting decision to liquidate Yukos, is not expropriatory because it is not attributable to Respondent under the rules of State responsibility, or does not involve an exercise of sovereign power.\n\n76. Second, Claimants have failed to establish that the measures complained of frustrated distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations, an important element in assessing whether regulatory measures amount to \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.\" Claimants had no right or legitimate expectation to operate Yukos in violation of Russian law, and no right or legitimate expectation that Respondent would exempt Yukos from the tax enforcement and collection measures about which Claimants complain if Yukos failed to pay its taxes and obstructed the collection of taxes due.\n\n77. In particular, Claimants have failed to establish that Respondent at any time made a representation, based upon complete disclosure, that it would allow Yukos to operate its fraudulent tax evasion scheme or refrain from enforcing and collecting the taxes Yukos owed. Yukos' tax evasion scheme was illegal under Russian law when Claimants made their investments, and the tax enforcement and collection measures taken against Yukos were all provided for by Russian law at that time. The bad faith taxpayer anti-abuse doctrine that Respondent's tax authorities and courts applied to counter Yukos' tax evasion dates back to the mid 1990s, well before Claimants acquired their Yukos shares.\n\n78. Third, putting aside the other elements required to establish \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation,\" the executive and judicial measures at issue, in any event, constitute a legitimate exercise of Respondent's regulatory power.\n\n79. The measures alleged to be expropriatory are well within the range of what is generally accepted as a legitimate exercise of States' police powers. First, Respondent has established that the measures complained of accord in all material respects with international and comparative standards.\n\n80. Second, the measures challenged by Claimants conform with Russian law, which in turn accords with international standards, and have been reviewed and upheld by multiple levels of Respondent's judiciary, including the Russian Supreme Court.\n\n81. Third, the European Court of Human Rights has found that the very same measures Claimants allege to be expropriatory were a legitimate exercise of Respondent's regulatory power.\n\n82. Fourth, the measures complained of must be assessed in their proper context -Yukos' massive tax evasion, compounded by its illegal and deliberate strategy to frustrate any effort by the authorities to collect the company's overdue taxes.\n\n83. Contrary to Claimants' perception, respect for the rule of law is not a oneway-street. Foreign investors have a duty to abide by the law, pay taxes, provide required disclosures of their activities in the host State, and cooperate with the authorities.\n\n84. Measures taken to combat illegal conduct may legitimately result in the loss of an investment. Yukos' tax evasion scheme violated Russian law, and the assessment of the evaded taxes was a legitimate measure to combat Yukos' fraud. The resulting tax enforcement and collection measures were completely justified in light of Yukos' failure to pay the assessed taxes and its willful obstruction of Respondent's collection efforts. Indeed, none of the subsequent enforcement measures, including the auction of YNG, would have occurred, and Yukos would not have been liquidated, had Yukos acted as a responsible taxpayer should have done.\n\n**C. Article 10(1) ECT**\n\n85. Claimants' Article 10(1) ECT claims fail for many of the same reasons as their expropriation claim. At the threshold, the core allegations on which Claimants base their Article 10(1) ECT claims are within the taxation carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT. The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over these claims and Article 10(1) ECT is inapplicable.\n\n86. Again, at the threshold, critical conduct alleged to be unlawful under Article 10(1) ECT is not attributable to Respondent or not an exercise of sovereign authority. The harm attributed to Respondent's alleged breaches of Article 10(1) ECT, the loss of Claimants' Yukos shares, was caused by Yukos' own misconduct and conduct of third parties not attributable to Respondent. Claimants have failed to show that any of the irregularities they allege in the administrative and judicial proceedings at issue affected the outcome of the case, the liquidation of Yukos, and the ensuing loss of Claimants' shares.\n\n87. In any event, Claimants have failed to establish that the challenged measures interfered with their legitimate expectations at the time they made their investment or were not taken in the proper exercise of the authorities' statutory duties. The contested measures (a) accord with international and comparative standards, (b) were reviewed and upheld by the Russian courts, and (c) have been assessed by the ECtHR to be a legitimate exercise of Respondent's taxation power.\n\n88. Finally, but no less important, the host State's conduct under Article 10(1) ECT cannot be assessed in isolation from that of the investor or its investment. Yukos' massive tax fraud and illegal obstruction of the efforts to collect the taxes it owed provoked the measures complained of, which were justified responses to combat Yukos' illegal conduct and enforce overdue taxes. None of the measures at issue can therefore be said to be arbitrary, unfair, or inequitable for purposes of Article 10(1) ECT.\n\n89. Nor are such measures discriminatory within the meaning of Article 10(1) ECT. Article 10(1) ECT does not establish a right of impunity based on the host State's authorities' alleged failure to enforce mandatory legal requirements, and Claimants have in any event failed to show nationality-based discrimination, or unjustified differential treatment of similar cases.\n\n**VII. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Claimants' Claims Concerning The Alleged Mistreatment Of Messrs. Khodorkovsky And Lebedev And Other Yukos Officials, And In Any Event, These Claims, And Claims Concerning Searches Of Yukos Records, Are Unsupported**\n\n90. The Tribunal should reject Claimants' attempt to distract its attention from the only matter that is genuinely at issue in these arbitrations -- Claimants' investments in Yukos, and the consequences for those investments of Yukos' tax evasion scheme -- with extensive allegations concerning the arrests and prosecution of Yukos officials and searches and seizures of the company's records.\n\n91. First, the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT to address alleged violations of the rights of Yukos officials, because Claimants have not proven that any such violations directly impaired Claimants' management or control of their investments. To the contrary, Yukos expressly confirmed after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest and subsequent resignation that they had \"no impact whatsoever on [its] operations,\" and Mr. Lebedev did not even hold a position with Yukos at that time. The prosecutions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev likewise did not impair Yukos' performance, which the company informed its investors in 2005 \"was extremely healthy.\"\n\n92. Claimants have also failed to establish that the prosecutions of any Yukos officials reflect a systemic failure of the Russian judicial system or, at a minimum, were fundamentally unjustified or groundless. To the contrary, all were reviewed by the Russian courts at multiple levels, and by the ECtHR (with respect to the initiation of Mr. Khodorkovsky's prosecution), and were found to be in accord with Russian law and international standards. Tellingly, Claimants have never disputed that Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev, or any of the other Yukos officials who were convicted of crimes related to their management of Yukos, actually committed those crimes, relying instead on conclusory complaints about various procedural matters, based on mischaracterizations of the pertinent facts.\n\n93. Finally, Claimants have not established that the searches of certain of Yukos' offices and the seizure of certain of its records pursuant to the official investigations of its misconduct were expropriatory, evidence a systemic judicial failure, or were otherwise fundamentally unjustified or groundless. This allegation is at best ironic, in light of Yukos' unrelenting obstruction of those investigations. It is also unsustainable. All of these procedures conformed to Russian law, and Yukos' own contemporaneous public statements and internal documents confirm that Yukos itself did not believe they had any significant impact on the company.\n\n**VIII. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Claimants' Claims, Or Must Dismiss Them, Because They Are Based On Illegal Conduct By Claimants And The Yukos Managers They Installed And Controlled**\n\n94. The Oligarchs who controlled Claimants acquired and consolidated their investments in Yukos through illegal acts and bad faith conduct, and thereafter perpetrated -- either directly or through the Yukos managers they installed and controlled -- a long series of illegal acts, including the tax evasion that is at the heart of these arbitrations.\n\n95. Claimants contend that these illegalities are \"collateral\" or \"unrelated to\" their investments, even though they relate to the acquisition or enhancement of the value of Yukos, or to Claimants' own unlawful abuse of the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty. Through that abuse, Claimants themselves fraudulently evaded -- in violation of both Russian and Cypriot criminal laws -- more than US$ 230 million in Russian withholding taxes, and more than triple that amount in Russian profit taxes.\n\n96. This history of repeated illegal conduct by Claimants -- culminating in the diversion of assets worth billions of dollars to the illegally-created Dutch *stichtings*, placing those assets beyond the reach of the Russian tax authorities -- deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over Claimants' claims, because ECT protection does not extend to illegal investments, or requires that the Tribunal dismiss those claims under the principle of unclean hands. The Tribunal should reject Claimants' attack on the existence of the principle of unclean hands in international law, as well as their baseless charge that Respondent is estopped from raising Claimants' illegalities.\n\n**IX. Claimants Have Failed To Establish Any Entitlement To Damages**\n\n97. Claimants are not entitled to any compensation, in light of (a) their own illegal conduct, including their and the Oligarchs' illegal acquisition and consolidation of their ownership and control of Yukos, their abuse of the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty, and their implementation of Yukos' tax evasion scheme, and (b) Yukos' failure to mitigate its tax liability, and Yukos' and Claimants' actions to prevent the collection of Yukos' overdue taxes.\n\n98. Claimants are not entitled to any compensation for acts of the Russian Federation that are within the carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT and not within the clawback of Article 21(5) ECT.\n\n99. Claimants also are not entitled to any compensation based on Yukos' claimed value at any given point in time, because they have failed to demonstrate any causal link between any diminution in Yukos' then-supposed value and specific violations of the ECT. Claimants' \"all-or-nothing\" approach does not provide a means by which the Tribunal can (a) assess whether the Russian Federation's actions constituted an \"expropriation,\" or (b) quantify the damages, if any, arising in the event some, but not all, of the measures Claimants complain about are found to violate the ECT. This is the inevitable result of Claimants' failure to present a damages measure, but instead a static valuation, devoid of any causation analysis.\n\n100. Claimants' valuations also fail on their own terms, because they are entirely dependent on Claimants' unsustainable valuation date of November 21, 2007.\n\n101. Claimants and their expert concede that the valuations presented in their opening submissions are infected by numerous material errors. These errors fatally undermine Claimants' core assertions and render Claimants' evidence unreliable for any purpose. The revised valuations submitted in Claimants' Reply are likewise riddled with errors and are manifestly result-driven, leaving Claimants with no competent evidence of damages at all. This is true, too, of their \"method of collection\" scenarios, which are unsupportable and fail of their own terms.\n\n102. Once Yukos chose not to mitigate its tax liability during the first quarter of 2004 -- by paying no more than US$ 9.8 billion, capping its tax exposure at that amount and avoiding all of the subsequent enforcement measures -- there was no realistic means by which Yukos could have paid all of its liabilities, let alone continued in business as a going concern. Claimants' failure to mitigate is a further reason why their damages model, based on the claimed value of Yukos as of a given date, does not provide a meaningful measure of damages. Thus, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that an award of damages is warranted, it must be capped at Claimants' proportionate interest in the amount, if any, of Yukos' unavoidable liabilities -- not more than US$ 9.8 billion -- that the Tribunal concludes were improperly assessed.\n\n103. Claimants' damages claim represents a 58% compound annual rate of return on their investment in Yukos. Claimants' requested rate of return fails to take account of Claimants', the Oligarchs', and Yukos' unlawful misconduct and is well beyond that which any legitimate investor would have earned.\n\n104. Measured against a reasonable return on investment, and after taking account of the returns on their investment in Yukos that Claimants have already received (not to mention the fruits of their ill-gotten gains and assets secreted offshore), Claimants have not incurred any damages at all.\n\n**IV. PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. RELIEF REQUESTED BY CLAIMANTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal render an Award:\n\n(1) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n(2) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n(3) Ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants, in full reparation of their damages, an amount to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal, estimated by the Claimants at no less than US$ 114,174 billion, to be shared between the Claimants in the following proportions:\n\n\u25a0 Hulley Enterprises Limited US$ 93,229 billion\n\n\u25a0 Yukos Universal Limited US$ 4,666 billion\n\n\u25a0 Veteran Petroleum Limited US$ 16,279 billion\n\n(4) Ordering the Respondent to pay post-award interest on the above sums to the Claimants at the rate of Libor + 4% compounded annually from the date of the Award until the date of full payment;\n\n(5) Ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants the full costs of these arbitrations, including, without limitation, arbitrators' fees, administrative costs of the PCA, counsel fees, expert fees and all other costs associated with these proceedings;\n\n(6) Dismissing all of the Respondent's defenses;\n\n(7) Ordering any such further relief as it may deem appropriate.7\n\nReply \u00b6 1199. *See also* Claimants' Memorial on the Merits, 15 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Memorial\") \u00b6 1056; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, 21 December 2012 (hereinafter \"Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief\") \u00b6 302.\n\n**B. RELIEF REQUESTED BY RESPONDENT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal render an Award:\n\n(a) Dismissing Claimants' claims on the ground that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain them;\n\n(b) In the alternative, dismissing Claimants' claims on the ground that they are inadmissible;\n\n(c) In the alternative, dismissing Claimants' claims on the merits in their entirety;\n\n(d) In the alternative, declaring that Claimants are not entitled to the damages they seek, or to any damages;\n\n(e) Ordering Claimants to pay the Russian Federation's costs, expenses, and attorney's fees;\n\n(f) Granting such further relief against the Claimants as the Tribunal deems fit and proper.8\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1654; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, 16 August 2012 (hereinafter \"Rejoinder\") \u00b6 1748; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 21 December 2012 (hereinafter \"Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief\") \u00b6 263.\n\n**V. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n**A. PROCEDURAL LAW**\n---------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe procedural law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the procedural provisions of the ECT (particularly Article 26), the UNCITRAL Rules of 1976, and, because The Hague is the place of arbitration, any mandatory provisions of Dutch arbitration law. The Final Awards are made pursuant to Article 1049 of the *Netherlands Arbitration Act 1986.*\n\n**B. SUBSTANTIVE LAW**\n----------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe substantive law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the substantive provisions of the ECT, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\" **VCLT** \"),9 and applicable rules and principles of international law, including those authoritatively set out in the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission of the United Nations (\" **ILC Articles on State Responsibility** \").10 In addition to the foregoing sources, the national law of the Russian Federation is relevant with regard to certain issues.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Vienna, 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331.\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries (Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001), Arts. 1-11 and 28-39, Exh. C-1042; Arts. 49-54, Exh. C-1681 (hereinafter \"ILC Articles on State Responsibility\"). The full text of the ILC Articles, along with parts of the official commentary, was also submitted submitted by Respondent. *See* Exhs. R-1031 and R-4235. The Tribunal is aware that Part II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which sets out the consequences of internationally wrongful acts, is concerned with claims between States and may not directly apply to cases involving persons or entities other than States. That being said, the ILC Articles reflect customary international law in the matter of state responsibility, and to the extent that a matter is not ruled by the ECT and there are no circumstances commanding otherwise, the Tribunal will turn to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for guidance. The Tribunal further notes that both Parties have cited to and relied on Parts I and II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in their submissions.\n\n**1. Energy Charter Treaty**\n----------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThroughout this Award, the Tribunal refers to and analyzes specific provisions of the ECT. For ease of reference, the key relevant provisions are also collected and reproduced below, in the order in which they appear in the Treaty:\n\n*Article 10*\n\nPROMOTION, PROTECTION AND TREATMENT OF INVESTMENTS\n\n(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations.\n\n[...]\n\n*Article 13* EXPROPRIATION\n\n(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:\n\n(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;\n\n(b) not discriminatory;\n\n(c) carried out under due process of law; and\n\n(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\nSuch compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\").\n\nSuch fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n[...]\n\n*Article 21* TAXATION\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n[...]\n\n(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where nondiscrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the non-discrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no nondiscrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the expiry of the six-month period;\n\n(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.\n\n[...]\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Article:\n\n(a) The term \"Taxation Measure\" includes:\n\n(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and\n\n(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\n\n(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.\n\n(c) A \"Competent Tax Authority\" means the competent authority pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorized representatives.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"tax provisions\" and \"taxes\" do not include customs duties.\n\n[...]\n\n*Article 26*\n\nSETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN AN INVESTOR AND A CONTRACTING PARTY\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph\n\n(1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n[...]\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:\n\n[...]\n\n(b) a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (hereinafter referred to as \"UNCITRAL\");\n\n[...]\n\n(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n[...]\n\n(8) The awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute. An award of arbitration concerning a measure of a sub-national government or authority of the disputing Contracting Party shall provide that the Contracting Party may pay monetary damages in lieu of any other remedy granted. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay any such award and shall make provision for the effective enforcement in its Area of such awards.\n\n**2. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nRelevant provisions of the VCLT are as follows:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n*(a)* any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n*(b)* any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n*(a)* any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n*(b)* any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n*(c)* any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n*Article 32*\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n1. Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n*(a)* leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n*(b)* leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n*Article 33*\n\n*Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more langauges*\n\n1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.\n\n2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the parties so agree.\n\n3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.\n\n4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.\n\n116.\n\nWhere appropriate, provisions of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and Russian law are set out in relevant parts of the Award. Additionally, where appropriate, the Tribunal cites to decisions of other international courts and tribunals and legal commentaries which the Parties have submitted as relevant sources to consider in deciding the arbitrations.\n\n**VI. SUMMARY OF WITNESS TESTIMONY**\n------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nIn the merits phase of these proceedings, Claimants and Respondent each submitted statements or opinions from 11 witnesses.11 In all, the Tribunal has reviewed over 1,400 pages of written testimony, as well as thousands of exhibits to the witness statements and opinions.\n\nHaving initially submitted statements or opinions from 12 witnesses, on 4 October 2012, shortly before the Hearing on the Merits, Claimants notified the Tribunal that one of their witnesses, the former Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, had informed them that he would not appear at the Hearing and that, in the circumstances, Claimants would withdraw his witness statement. Mr. Kasyanov's witness statement has been filed on 3 September 2010 and consisted of a two-paragraph confirmation of the contents of the following documents: Transcript of Mr. Kasyanov's Testimony before the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow in the second criminal case against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, 24 May 2010, Exh. C-440; *Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovskiy v. The Russian Federation*, ECtHR, Appls. Nos. 5829/04, 11082/06 and 51111/07, Witness Statement of Mr. Kasyanov, 8 July 2009, Exh. C-446; Mikhail Kasyanov, *Without Putin: Political Dialogues with Evgeny Kiselev*, Novaya Gazeta. 2009 (excerpts), Exh. C-574; Video recording and transcript of interview of Mr. Kasyanov on 24 May 2010 after his testimony in the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow; Video recording and transcript of interview of Mr. Kasyanov on 24 May 2010 at the Press Center, Exh. C-591; Alexander Bekker & Vladimir Fedorin, *Interview: Mikhail Kasyanov, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation*, Vedomosti, 12 January 2004, Exh. C-677. These documents were submitted as independently-numbered exhibits with the Memorial. Respondent's position at the Hearing was that the documents annexed to Mr. Kasyanov's witness statement could not be considered by the Tribunal (Transcript, Day 18 at 19-21). Claimants maintained that the exhibits stood on their own as part of the record in these arbitrations. The Tribunal has decided that while Mr. Kasyanov's witness statement itself was withdrawn and thus no longer forms part of the record, the documents annexed to the statement, which have come into the record as independent exhibits to the Memorial, and include statements made by Mr. Kasyanov prior to these proceedings, continue to form part of the record of these arbitrations.\n\n118.\n\nThe purpose of the present part of the Award is to provide an overview of the witnesses' evidence. It is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it serves as a summary of the vast evidentiary foundation on which the Tribunal has reached its conclusions. Additional references to witness testimony, including specific extracts of their oral examinations, are set out in the relevant portions of the Tribunal's analysis of the evidentiary record.12\n\n*See* Part VIII below.\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the evidence of those witnesses that were cross-examined, as well as those witnesses who submitted written statements but were not called to the Hearing. With respect to this latter category, the Tribunal has kept in mind that these witnesses were not subject to cross-examination.\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' WITNESSES**\n---------------------------\n\n120.\n\nAt the Hearing on the Merits, Respondent called 8 of Claimants' 11 witnesses for examination. They were, in the order in which they testified:\n\n1) Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet;\n\n2) Mr. Vladimir Dubov;\n\n3) Mr. Frank Rieger;\n\n4) Dr. Andrei Illarionov;\n\n5) Mr. Leonid Nevzlin;\n\n6) Mr. Bruce Misamore;\n\n7) Mr. Steven Theede; and\n\n8) Mr. Brent Kaczmarek CFA.\n\n121.\n\nClaimants' other witnesses, who did not appear for cross-examination, were:\n\n9) Mr. Philip Baker QC;\n\n10) Mr. Yuri Schmidt; and\n\n11) Dr. Sergei Kovalev.\n\n122.\n\nThe following summary first addresses the testimony of Claimants' eight witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal, in order of appearance. It then reviews the evidence from Claimants' three witnesses whom Respondent chose not to cross-examine.\n\n**1. Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet**\n------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nMr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet13 was a Member of the Board of Directors of Yukos and the Chairman of the Board's Audit Committee from June 2000 to December 2004. In his witness statement, Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet describes Mr. Khodorkovsky's plans in the late 1990s \"to modernize Yukos and to break the company's ties with the Soviet traditions\" through a Western board and consolidation of Yukos' accounts. According to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, the reforms brought success: Yukos' shares increased in value by 50 percent after it published U.S. Generally Accepted Account Principles (\" **U.S. GAAP** \") consolidated financial statements in July 2000, and its leadership in transparency and corporate governance brought the verb \"to Yukosize\" into common parlance in Russian business circles.\n\nWitness Statement of Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, 3 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Kosciusko-Morizet WS\") (original in French, translated into English) submitted with Memorial. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet appeared for examination (testifying in English) on 15 October 2012, Transcript, Day 4 at 4-235. References to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests), VIII.D (The Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger) and VIII.H (The Withdrawal of PwC Audit Opinions).\n\n124.\n\nMr. Kosciusko-Morizet's statement also deals with the relationship with PwC, which he describes as \"cordial and close\" while he was Chairman of the Audit Committee. Yukos was one of PwC's major clients; PwC conducted Yukos' external audits and assisted with training Yukos' in-house accountants and with designing and implementing procedures. Thus, he testifies, \"from 1997 to 2004, PwC was given access to the entire documentation of the whole of Yukos without restriction and had a very detailed and global view of the financial situation and the procedures of Yukos and its subsidiaries.\"14\n\nKosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 17.\n\n125.\n\nAfter the arrest of Mr. Platon Lebedev in July 2003, Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet chaired a temporary ad hoc committee set up to assess the situation through interviews with individual managers at Yukos and PwC. He states that Mr. Michael Kubena, a PwC partner, assured the committee that Yukos had always complied with Russian law, including in its tax optimization structure, and that \"PwC did not consider that there was any possibility for the Russian authorities to attack Yukos on these issues.\"15 Mr.Kosciusko-Morizet referred to this advice several times during his oral testimony. Thus, according to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, the \"late and spectacular volte-face of PwC,\" including the withdrawal of the certification of Yukos' accounts that took place on 15 June 2007, was \"in blatant contradiction\" to his relationship with PwC, was \"questionable and damaging to [PwC's] reputation,\" and can only be explained by Respondent's pressure on PwC's Moscow office from December 2006 onwards.\n\nKosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 24.\n\n126.\n\nMr. Kosciusko-Morizet appeared before the Tribunal on 15 October 2012. He was cross-examined about, *inter alia* : (a) his responsibilities as the Chairman of Yukos' Audit Committee; (b) the relationship between Yukos and PwC including as to disclosures about Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South Petroleum Limited (known collectively as the \" **BBS Companies** \"); (c) the Yukos consolidation perimeter for purposes of U.S. GAAP; (d) the abandoned plans to list Yukos on the New York Stock Exchange (\" **NYSE** \") due to the Yukos-Sibneft merger; and (e) his knowledge of Yukos' tax optimization structures and the tax assessments against regional Yukos trading entities (in which context he remarked that \"[t]rying to minimise tax is good management... within the legislation applicable.\")16\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 65 *.*\n\n127.\n\nMr. Kosciusko-Morizet was also given the opportunity to recount to the Tribunal a story that Mr. Khodorkovsky had conveyed to him in August 2003 about threats from the Russian authorities and their potential impact on Yukos.17\n\n*See* paragraph 775 below *.*\n\n**2. Mr. Vladimir Dubov**\n-------------------------\n\n128.\n\nMr. Vladimir Dubov18 held various senior positions in Bank Menatep and Yukos entities, including on the Yukos Board from 1998 to 1999. He was elected as a State Duma Deputy in December 1999 (representing a region encompassing Mordovia) and was Chairman of the Tax Sub-Committee of the State Duma from February 2000 to October 2003. From 1997 he was a shareholder, and then a beneficiary of trusts holding shares in GML Limited (\" **GML** \") (the parent company of YUL). He first met Mr. Khodorkovsky in the late 1980s. In his witness statement, Mr. Dubov makes three key assertions: (a) Respondent was aware of, and approved Yukos' trading structure and tax optimization scheme; (b) Yukos' trading companies significantly contributed to the social and economic development of the regions in which they operated; and (c) Respondent's tax claims were aimed at appropriating Yukos' assets and removing Mr. Khodorkovsky as a \"potential political threat\".\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Vladimir Dubov, 8 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Dubov WS\") (original in Russian, translated into English), submitted with Memorial. Mr. Dubov appeared for examination (testifying in Russian through English interpretation) on 16 October 2012, Transcript, Day 5 at 2-191. References to Mr. Dubov's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003) and VIII.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests).\n\n129.\n\nMr. Dubov explains in his statement that, given that Yukos' tax payments accounted for approximately four percent of the country's 2003 budget, the company was under \"constant supervision and control of the Russian tax authorities.\"19 Before 2003 there was never \"any suggestion that Yukos' trading structure was other than in compliance with legal requirements and appropriate.\"20 The authorities were extensively consulted and approved Yukos' practice of operating through trading companies in low-tax regions like the Republic of Mordovia. Yukos' trading companies significantly contributed to the local economy. Yukos' trading companies' VAT refunds were also closely monitored. According to Mr. Dubov, all four major Russian oil companies (Lukoil, Sibneft, TNK, Yukos) engaged in tax optimization. Their taxes were closely supervised. Access to pipelines was conditioned on payment of taxes. This involved liaising with officials and opening up records to inspection.21\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 11.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 54.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 42-53.\n\n130.\n\nMr. Dubov describes how he and Mr. Khodorkovsky became increasingly involved in social and political activities to build a civil society based on \"liberal, open and democratic values\" and in 2001 co-founded Open Russia to manage and fund projects to foster a \"social and liberal ethos.\"22 Mr. Khodorkovsky's funding of political parties openly and legally \"put pressure on other political parties to be more transparent.\" These efforts \"sent shockwaves through the entire Russian political system.\"23\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 55, 61.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 64.\n\n131.\n\nMr. Dubov expresses \"no doubt that the alleged tax claims and the other trumped-up charges brought against Yukos, Khodorkovsky and his associates, were merely a pretext to remove Khodorkovsky as a potential political threat and to destroy Yukos with a view to taking its assets.\"24 According to Mr. Dubov's statement, as the 2004 presidential elections approached, the Administration shifted attention to seizing Yukos' assets. At a meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs with President Putin at the Kremlin in February 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky raised questions about official corruption. President Putin rebuked him and suggested that Yukos be scrutinized. At an April 2003 meeting, President Putin approved the Sibneft merger but warned that Mr. Khodorkovsky should restrict his political activities and not finance the Communist Party. In October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested just before a planned meeting with opposition parties.25\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 58.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 55-64.\n\n132.\n\nMr. Dubov testifies that, on 27 October 2003, he learned his name had been removed as a Duma candidate. He was advised to leave Russia and was told by a Kremlin official that President Putin \"had gone absolutely berserk over Khodorkovsky.\"26 He left that night and has not returned since. In January 2004, the financial support of Messrs. Dubov and Nevzlin to an opposition presidential candidate was announced. The next day, international arrest warrants were issued against both men on \"entirely unfounded and politically motivated\" charges. They were both found guilty *in absentia*.27\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 80.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 65-72.\n\n133.\n\nMr. Dubov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 16 October 2012. He was cross-examined about his financial interest in the case, being the beneficiary of the Draco Trust, in which had made an initial investment of around USD 10,000 and which now has a seven percent interest in GML.28 He was also extensively cross-examined about the extent of disclosures he made to Russian government officials about Yukos' tax scheme in Mordovia and his knowledge and understanding about the Yukos trading entities in the ZATOs and the tax assessments leveled against them.29\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 29-36.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 81-84, 101-102, 149-50, 152-54.\n\n134.\n\nMr. Dubov stated his belief, held since he heard about the tax assessments against Yukos in 2004 from media reports, that the tax claims were being used by Respondent as an instrument of confiscation.30 When asked by the Tribunal to elaborate on what information at the time led him to that conclusion, he testified:\n\nI had a personal relationship with the Deputy Head of Staff of the President, Mr. Vladislav Surkov.... [O]n the first business day following Khodorkovsky's arrest, Surkov asked me to come see him in the Kremlin.... He told me that he was asking for my forgiveness.... I had been struck from the list upon petition from the Prosecutor General by the council of the party without leveling any charges against me.... And I remember asking, \"What will happen to Yukos?\" And he said\u2014and I am quoting him verbatim; I remember it very well\u2014he said, \"Yukos will be taken away from... you gentlemen.\"... And I also had a longstanding good relationship with yet another Deputy Head of the Staff of the President who, in late November of that year, told us... there would be criminal claims against every single shareholder. He said that an instruction had been issued to commence criminal cases against us and to take Yukos from us.31\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 52.\n\n*Ibid.* at 181-82.\n\n**3. Mr. Frank Rieger**\n-----------------------\n\n135.\n\nMr. Frank Rieger32 is the former Acting CFO of Yukos, and held various positions with Yukos and its subsidiaries from 2000 until 2006. He resigned on 26 March 2006, due to the \"deepening crisis surrounding the company and the persecution of its management.\" In his witness statement, Mr. Rieger recounts that under Mr. Khodorkovsky's leadership, Yukos acted as a \"trail-blazer\" in corporate governance in Russia. When Mr. Rieger joined Yukos in 2000 from Roland Berger Consulting, he was directed by Mr. Khodorkovsky to \"apply the same benchmark of Western corporate accountability and responsibility.\" Yukos modernized its production process, disclosed the company's shareholding details, and implemented international accounting and reporting procedures. Mr. Rieger states that Yukos \"set a new standard for corporate social responsibility in Russia\" but its achievements provoked concern amongst competitors.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Frank Rieger, 9 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Rieger WS\") submitted with Memorial. Mr. Rieger appeared for examination on 17 October 2012, Transcript, Day 6 at 1-235. References to Mr. Rieger's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VIII.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests), VIII.E (Attempts to Settle), VIII.G (The Bankruptcy of Yukos) and VIII.H (The Withdrawal of the PwC Audit Opinions).\n\n136.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rieger, the Russian authorities targeted and harassed Yukos' auditor, PwC. Yukos engaged PwC as its external auditor and gave it \"unrestricted access\" to its \"personnel, management, the Board of Directors, books and accounts.\" Mr. Rieger's \"personal involvement with PwC was extensive.\" After PwC employees began to be questioned by the Prosecutor General's Office, PwC ceased to have further contact with Yukos. Mr. Rieger learned about PwC's withdrawal of its Yukos audits from 1995 to 2004 from the media. The suggestion that PwC did not have full access to information or that Yukos deliberately withheld information \"defies credibility\"; PwC raised no such concerns until its June 2007 withdrawal letter (\" **PwC's Withdrawal Letter** \").\n\n137.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rieger, Yukos made numerous attempts to settle the alleged tax claims against it, including through negotiations and significant payments. However, the Russian authorities did not respond to Yukos' various proposals, and refused to provide written confirmation of the payments. It became clear to Mr. Rieger that \"this was a political case, not a tax case, aimed at the destruction and expropriation of the company itself.\"\n\n138.\n\nMr. Rieger claims that Respondent conducted a campaign of harassment against Yukos, including illegal raids by armed masked men, searches and seizures of up to 70 percent of the Accounting Department's documents. In addition, numerous Yukos employees were questioned by the Prosecutor General's Office. Mr. Rieger himself was detained and interrogated at Moscow's airport in May 2006.\n\n139.\n\nMr. Rieger appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 17 October 2012. He was cross-examined about, *inter alia* : (a) his role at Yukos and understanding of its related entities; (b) Yukos' accounting structure including the extent to which it was designed by PwC; (c) the timing and process of Yukos' identification of assets for payment of taxes; (d) Yukos' settlement offers, the responses from the Russian authorities and the legal limits within which the authorities were operating; (e) the repayment of the SocGen and Moravel Investments Limited (\" **Moravel** \") loans, relevant to the bankruptcy; (f) dividend payments via the \"Laurel\" group of Yukos companies; and (g) his awareness and understanding of tax assessment of Yukos entities in the ZATOs.\n\n140.\n\nMr. Rieger was also given an opportunity to describe to the Tribunal how in 2006 he was asked a series of questions at the General Prosecutor Office for which the investigator had already prepared his answers, a situation he said he \"couldn't believe\" had he not experienced it himself. He refused to sign the pre-prepared answers and gave his own version instead.33\n\nTranscript, Day 6 at 69-70.\n\n**4. Dr. Andrei Illarionov**\n----------------------------\n\n141.\n\nDr. Andrei Illarionov34 served as Chief Economic Advisor to President Putin from April 2000 until his resignation in December 2005. He was also President Putin's personal representative (\"sherpa\") to the G-8. He is currently a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity in Washington, D.C., as well as the President of the Institute of Economic Analysis in Moscow, which he founded. Dr. Ilarionov maintains a residence in Moscow and visits approximately five times a year.35 In his witness statement, Dr. Illarionov recounts the evolution of Yukos since its establishment by government decree in 1993 following the dissolution of the USSR and the restructuring of the oil industry. Yukos saw remarkable growth and improvements in performance after its privatization in 1995-96, as a result of substantial investment, the employment of foreign engineers and managers, and the use of Western technology. Some officials viewed such reforms negatively. Yukos' public revelation, in 2002, of details of its shareholding, including the structure of GML, \"had the effect of an earthquake on the Russian business community.\" It contrasted with the traditionally secretive manner of doing business and was viewed as setting a \"harmful\" precedent. In Dr. Illarionov's words, Yukos was \"one of the most dangerous enemies for those who did not want to see Russia a free country.\"36\n\nWitness Statement of Dr. Andrei Illarionov, 11 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Illarionov WS\") submitted with Memorial. Dr. Illarionov appeared for examination on 18 October 2012, Transcript, Day 7 at 3-176. References to Dr. Illarionov's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VIII.C (Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests) and VIII.F (The Auction of YNG).\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 5.\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 5-16.\n\n142.\n\nAccording to Dr. Illarionov, the arrests of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and the dismantlement of Yukos were politically and economically motivated. Yukos' intended merger with Western oil majors was seen as a national betrayal and a hurdle to expropriation. Dr. Illarionov describes the 19 February 2003 meeting at the Kremlin between President Putin and business leaders, at which Mr. Khodorkovsky made a presentation on corruption, to which President Putin responded that everyone knew how various assets, including Yukos, were acquired, and told Mr. Khodorkovsky: \"I return the ball in your corner.\" The tone of the meeting became \"steely and menacing\" as if something had gone \"really wrong.\" It signaled the \"gloves [had come] off,\" and that Mr. Khodorkovsky was no longer tolerated. From then on, according to Dr. Illarionov, \"a case needed to be fabricated to launch the Government attack under the guise of \u2018legitimate' court proceedings\" and a special unit was set up to fabricate evidence against Yukos. In October 2003, the \"dramatic arrest\" of Mr. Khodorkovsky at the airport signaled Yukos could be attacked. Few dared to voice support, and Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, among others, was dismissed for doing so.37\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 17-41.\n\n143.\n\nDr. Illarionov's statement further recounts that the campaign against Yukos culminated in the confiscation of YNG. While it was independently valued at USD 14.7-17.3 billion, the Russian authorities sold YNG for USD 9.3 billion\u2014\"a price well below even the most conservative estimates prepared by experts\"\u2014on a Sunday, at a forced auction attended by two participants, to an unknown company (Baikal) which was registered at an address above a local bar and had a charter capital of USD 350. President Putin said he knew the individuals behind the company and they were \"well-established in the oil business.\" Four days later, Rosneft purchased Baikal with funds from State banks. According to Dr. Illarionov, the auction \"sent shockwaves\" and was internationally condemned. This \"scam\" was \"one of the low points in Russia's recent history.\" The dismantling of Yukos was contrary to \"basic principles of due process,\" and led Dr. Illarionov to resign as sherpa in 2004 and as the President's Chief Economic Advisor in December 2005.38\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 42-52.\n\n144.\n\nDr. Illarionov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 18 October 2012. Respondent sought to undermine his credibility by showing he is now a vocal critic of the Russian Government, and that he has taken extreme positions against climate change regulation.39 Respondent also challenged his assertion that Yukos' financial statements had complied with U.S. GAAP, on the basis that Dr. Illarionov lacked an understanding of GAAP and had not read Yukos' financial statements in full. Dr. Illarionov was cross-examined mostly about his claimed knowledge and understanding of the valuation of YNG and the auction process.40\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 12-50.\n\nFor further specific references to the transcript, see discussion in Chapter VIII.F at paragraphs 1013 and 1019.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal asked Dr. Illarionov whether he had ever felt able to discuss with President Putin the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and the measures of the Russian Government in respect of Yukos.41 He replied:\n\nthe most important conversation that I had with Mr. Putin was several days after Mr. Khodorkovsky had been arrested.... Mr. Putin has said that Mr. Khodorkovsky has made mistakes and behaved pretty badly.... And for a long time Mr. Putin himself was protecting Mr. Khodorkovsky from these attacks of his friends, of Mr. Putin's friends, but unfortunately Mr. Khodorkovsky continued to behave badly, and not cooperatively... One thing, he said that Mr. Khodorkovsky lied to us because he was in negotiations with American oil company about possible merger. Another issue he has mentioned: that Mr. Khodorkovsky joined Communist Party in preparation to the parliamentary election of year 2003... That is not something that \"mi dogovarivalis\"\u2014I will try, \"we had an agreement on.\" So he said...\n\nSo he said that after protecting Mr Khodorkovsky for some time\u2014now it's almost a quotation\u2014\"I decided and I stepped aside to allow Mr Khodorkovsky to solve his problems with the boys by himself.\"....\"so Mr Khodorkovsky has chosen to fight. Okay,\" said Mr Putin, \"if he has chosen to fight, let him to fight and we'll see what will happen.\"42\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 153 (referring to Illarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 39-41).\n\n*Ibid*. at 153-56.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal also asked Dr. Illarionov about the 50-person special unit that, according to paragraph 35 of his statement, was set up at the Russian General Prosecutor's office to work exclusively on \"fabricating\" evidence against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos and, in particular, whether he could identify the sources on which he relied for that statement. He could not disclose the identity of his source\u2014due to that individual still residing in Moscow and thus facing \"serious risks\" but his source was a \"very high-placed official in the Russian administration at the time\" and was very reliable.43 Dr. Illarionov testified that the official had told him that the targeting of Yukos was \"a big mistake... but it is a mistake that would be impossible to stop.... This unit has been created to \u2018zanyatsa' Khodorkovsky, [meaning to] \u2018take care of' Khodorkovsky... which means one day... security services and officers did receive an order so-called to solve the problem.\"44\n\n*Ibid*. at 156-57. Upon further cross-examination, Dr. Illarionov said he had only ever discussed this special unit with his source and with Claimants' lawyers in these arbitrations. *Ibid.* at 164-65.\n\n*Ibid*. at 158.\n\n147.\n\nDr. Illarionov elaborated on his assertion, at paragraph 41 of his statement, that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov had \"expressed his disapproval of Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest and the mounting attack on Yukos\", and explained that after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest:\n\nthere was public outrage in mass media.... From the Government ranks, I cannot recall any person who would express disapproval of the arrest... with the exception of Mr. Kasyanov.... And after making such a statement, Mr. Putin publicly made a very rude statement that you can find recorded in video... that, \"I would ask everybody in the Government to shut up on Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest.\" And it was very clear that this comment was addressed to Mr. Kasyanov, and later Mr. Kasyanov... [was] removed from his position.'45\n\n*Ibid*. at 159-60.\n\n**5. Mr. Leonid Nevzlin**\n-------------------------\n\n148.\n\nMr. Leonid Nevzlin46 is a long-standing friend and close business colleague of Mr. Khodorkovsky. They first met at a research centre in 1987. Mr. Nevzlin held various high level positions in Bank Menatep and Yukos, including as Vice-President of Yukos responsible for public relations, and as First Deputy Chairman of the Yukos Board of Directors. Mr Nevzlin helped found Open Russia in 2001. He also later served as a senator representing Mordovia until March 2003. He is a beneficiary of three of the trusts that hold ownership shares in GML. He now resides in Israel, working in philanthropy.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Leonid Nevzlin, 29 August 2010 (hereinafter \"Nevzlin WS\") (original in Russian, translated into English), submitted with Memorial. Mr. Nevzlin appeared for examination on 18 and 19 October 2012 (testifying in Russian, through English interpretation), Transcript, Day 7 at 176-224 and Day 8 at 1-43. References to Mr. Nevzlin's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.C (Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests) and VIII.D (The Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger).\n\n149.\n\nIn his witness statement of 15 September 2010, Mr. Nevzlin testifies that his support for democratic causes led the Russian authorities to target him for persecution. For example, after he announced his financial support for an opposition presidential candidate in January 2004, the Prosecutor General's Office brought \"entirely unfounded and politically motivated\" charges against him for tax evasion and embezzlement. \"Ludicrous\" murder charges were added in 2004 and 2005. Israel refused to extradite him to Russia but after a \"show trial\" in 2008, he was sentenced *in absentia* to life imprisonment.47\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6\u00b6 14, 22.\n\n150.\n\nMr. Nevzlin explains that Mr. Khodorkovsky was perceived by the Kremlin as a political threat and a potential presidential candidate. According to Mr. Nevzlin, the attacks on Yukos were motivated by the objectives \"to remove Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political threat,\" \"to punish and make an example of\" Yukos leaders, and to \"expropriate Yukos without compensation.\" Mr. Nevzlin received warnings of the attacks on Yukos, including at a meeting with the Media Minister in Spring 2003, who told him that Mr. Khodorkovsky risked losing everything, including his liberty, if he did not immediately stop criticism of President Putin. He was told that President Putin was \"furious\" about Mr. Khodorkovsky's media coverage.48\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 22, 28-36.\n\n151.\n\nWith regard to the Yukos-Sibneft merger, Mr. Nevzlin testifies that he understood that \"everything that happened with Sibneft was approved by President Putin.\" At a meeting with Mr. Khodorkovsky, President Putin cautioned against a U.S. oil major acquiring more than 25 percent of YukosSibneft. The merger was completed in October 2003, but Mr. Abramovich \"abruptly changed his mind and sought to unwind the merger\" after it \"became apparent that Khodorkovsky was being targeted by the Kremlin.\" Mr. Nevzlin testifies that shortly after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest in October 2003, Mr. Abramovich approached Mr. Nevzlin in Tel Aviv to convey that the Yukos-Sibneft merger could only be preserved if Sibneft was given management of the merged company. The companies were not integrated and eventually de-merged.49\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\n152.\n\nMr. Nevzlin appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 18 and 19 October 2012. Respondent highlighted his lack of banking experience when he rose to the top of Bank Menatep. Mr. Nevzlin pointed out that \"there had not been any commercial banks in the Soviet Union, and not a single person in the Soviet Union worked in a commercial bank prior to 1988;\" and further that \"the position of bank president did not mean that [he] in fact was responsible for banking operations; it was a position that was established specifically for someone who engaged in public relations.\"50\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 180-82.\n\n153.\n\nMr. Nevzlin was cross-examined on his interest in GML, his motives for testifying in these arbitrations, and a recent UK court case relating to individuals involved in the Yukos-Sibneft merger. He acknowledged that the trusts in which he has beneficial interests (the Pictor Trust, the Southern Cross Trust and the Palmus Trust) hold a total of approximately 67 percent of GML, and thus that he would benefit financially if the outcome of these arbitrations was favourable to Claimants.51 Mr. Nevzlin testified that he had not paid anything for his interests in the trusts and confirmed also that Messrs. Brudno, Lebedev and Shakhnovsky had not paid any consideration for their beneficial interests in the Palmus Trust. Amidst this line of questioning, Mr. Nevzlin pointed out:\n\neverything I own, just like my partners used to own, was earned through extremely hard work, starting, as you will know from... in 1987.... [V]irtually all the business revenue, except for what was paid to charity or used for personal needs, was reinvested in the business.... So all the money, all the shares that we owned we earned through our titanic\u2014if you will\u2014efforts that had spread over a long period of time.52\n\n*Ibid.* at 187-92, 207.\n\n*Ibid.* at 196-99.\n\n154.\n\nMr. Nevzlin confirmed that he knew about the 2004 tax assessments soon after they were issued, but by that point he had \"already realised that Putin will not stop, and will take away the company anyway. So I was not surprised by tax claims in this size and consequent actions by the Russian Federation.\" He also confirmed his long-held belief that the tax assessments were improper, as were the Russian authorities' enforcement actions, claiming:\n\nYukos was led into bankruptcy... They [the Russian authorities] did everything in order to prevent Yukos from paying off its debts. The company was in perfect shape, with a lot of cash, with the best rating in the country, with a good market capitalisation, but it took about two years for Putin and Sechin... to destroy this company completely.53\n\nWhen asked whether he had hoped Yukos would prevail and defeat the assessments, he replied that \"[t]hose proceedings took place in the Russian Federation, and the outcomes, the decisions were made in the Kremlin. The decisions were not made in the courtroom.... We are not talking about a democratic country; we are talking about a dictatorship.\"54\n\n*Ibid.* at 209-13.\n\n*Ibid.* at 217-18.\n\n155.\n\nMr. Nevzlin was questioned about why he had waited until 2010, when providing his witness statement in these proceedings, to disclose that in 2003 Mr. Abramovich told him that Mr. Khodorkovsky \"had been targeted because of his involvement in politics.\"55 He was also asked why he had not included this evidence in his 6 August 2006 witness statement in the ECtHR proceedings, nor in any of the Russian criminal cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky. He explained:\n\nif I had spread the information about Abramovich and Putin fairly broadly, and if it had become available to the public, then from the perspective of Khodorkovsky, who is in Russian prison, I would have damaged him.\n\n... I would have caused him tremendous amounts of harm... in the other corner facing him were Putin, Sechin and others; but I also would have turned Abramovich into an enemy of Khodorkovsky's by disclosing this information.\n\n... [A]fter... things moved to a second absurd set of charges and a second trial, Khodorkovsky's position changed radically. He was no longer wary of a political... confrontation with Putin's regime because he realised that he was not going to be able to find truth in a Russian court if he tried to defend himself based on the laws.\n\n... Russian courts have no interest in my position: it would be either ignored or rejected by them....Because it's not a judge who makes decision on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev; the judge just rubber-stamps decisions that are made by investigative committee and Prosecutor's Office....The fact that I trust this court and tell this court a lot more than I've ever said on the matter, this is a typical position for me, because... if we're able to defend our interests, that would be either in courts in free countries or international courts.56\n\nTranscript, Day 8 at 4-5, referencing Nevzlin WS \u00b6 35.\n\n*Ibid.* at 17-25\n\n156.\n\nMr. Nevzlin was cross-examined about his May 2011 witness statement to the High Court of Justice in England in a case brought by Mr. Berezovsky against Mr. Abramovich. Mr. Nevzlin was shown the English judge's decision, in which the judge declined to attach significant weight to Mr. Nevzlin's evidence, as she found him to be \"tendentious,\" that he \"expressed opinions about matters in respect of which he had no knowledge,\" and that she had \"the impression that Mr. Nevzlin had crafted his evidence to suit Mr. Berezovsky's case.\" Mr. Nevzlin observed the judge was \"entitled to her opinion\" and he \"only told her the truth.\"57\n\n*Ibid.* at 34, 37, 39-40.

Mr. Bruce Misamore**\n-------------------------\n\n157.\n\nMr. Bruce Misamore58 was Chief Financial Officer of Yukos and a Member of its Management Committee from April 2001 to December 2005. He was a Member of the Executive Committee of the Yukos Board commencing in 2005. He has 38 years experience in financial and executive roles in the oil industry. In his witness statement, Mr. Misamore explains that as CFO, he was to ensure that Yukos met international best practices in financial management. He describes how, by 2003, Yukos had become an industry leader in transparency, corporate governance and production and that, \"[c]ontemplating significant expansion and growth\" Yukos closed its merger with Sibneft on 3 October 2003 and was in talks with Western oil majors.59\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Bruce Misamore, 28 July 2010 (hereinafter \"Misamore WS\") submitted with Memorial. Mr. Misamore appeared for examination on 22 October 2012, Transcript, Day 9 at 1-268. References to Mr. Misamore's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VIII.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests), VIII.D (The Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger), VIII.E (Attempts to Settle) and VIII.H (The Withdrawal of PwC's Audit Opinions).\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.\n\n158.\n\nMr. Misamore testifies that PwC played an \"integral role\" in developing Yukos' financial reporting system and was given full access to Yukos' books, accounts, and employees, and was \"very knowledgeable about and had full access to Yukos' principal subsidiaries.\" He considers PwC's withdrawal of the Yukos audit reports as having been \"motivated by the continuing attack... on Yukos and persons associated with the company\" and that it was \"highly questionable professionally.\"60\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n159.\n\nAccording to Mr. Misamore, the campaign by the Russian authorities to dismantle Yukos began in earnest in the summer of 2003 with arrests, raids, searches, and seizures. In July 2003, Russian authorities raided Yukos' Moscow offices \"in an incredible scene full of armed, masked officers\" and \"trawled through [the company's] computer records for approximately 17 hours.\" Large volumes of documents and electronic files were seized, with no copies or record left.\" In August 2006, \"baseless, politically motivated\" criminal investigations were announced against Mr. Misamore and others.61\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 30-33.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to Mr. Misamore, Russian authorities also interfered with the Yukos-Sibneft merger; Sibneft put the merger \"on hold,\" and refused to negotiate the demerger.62 Russian authorities then imposed a series of \"huge fabricated tax reassessments\" on Yukos \"designed to financially cripple the company\" and to \"serve as a pretext under which the Government broke up the company and expropriated its assets.\" Yukos made numerous efforts to negotiate and to pay its tax bills; these were rejected, \"stifle[d],\" or went unanswered.63 He described how on 19 December 2004, the Russian authorities held an auction for YNG. As one of only two bidders, Baikal won the auction, in ten minutes, for USD 9.35 billion. Baikal was immediately sold to State-owned Rosneft. In 2007, the court-appointed receiver in the bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Eduard Rebgun, liquidated the remaining 40 percent of the company in auctions won by State-owned entities at prices well below market value.64\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 38-51.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 51-60.\n\n161.\n\nMr. Misamore appeared for examination on 22 October 2012. He was cross-examined on a wide range of issues encompassing, *inter alia* : (a) the Yukos-Sibneft merger including the dividend payment and the unwinding of the merger; (b) PwC and its role in developing the concepts of golden shares and call options which allowed Yukos to consolidate the financial performance of companies that it did not own, but for which it had call options; (c) Mr. Misamore's knowledge and understanding of Yukos' domestic offshore trading entities and the tax assessments levied against some of them; (d) the responses to the tax assessments and use of proceeds from the sale of Yukos assets; and (e) the creation of two Dutch foundations, namely Stichting Administratiekantoor Yukos International (\" **Stichting 1** \") and Stichting Administratiekantoor Small World Telecommunication Holdings B.V. (\" **Stichting 2**,\" together with Stichting 1, the \" **Stichtings** \").\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal also asked Mr. Misamore whether he was aware of any written legal opinion that concluded that Yukos' tax optimization scheme was lawful under Russian law. He replied that upon receiving the tax assessment in December 2003, Yukos requested opinions from Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, a tax expert and regular advisor to Yukos, and PwC. Mr. Misamore stated that \"[b]oth of those opinions basically said what Yukos was doing was completely legal,\" but he could not recall if Yukos' tax structure had received the blessing of a lawyer or an accounting firm in writing prior to December 2003. He added that he \"was informed consistently, throughout the entire time [he] was at Yukos, that everything Yukos did with respect to these things was entirely in accordance with Russian law.\"65\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 250-52.\n\n**7. Mr. Steven Theede**\n------------------------\n\n163.\n\nMr. Steven Theede66 joined Yukos as its Chief Operating Officer in August 2003, after a 30 year career with ConocoPhilips. From June 2004 until February 2005, he served as CEO of Yukos. Upon the advice of the U.S. State Department, in November 2004 he decided not to return to Russia. From May 2005 until resigning in August 2006, Mr. Theede was President of Yukos. In his witness statement, Mr. Theede testifies that within a few years he saw \"one of the largest oil companies in the world... managed in accordance with the highest international standards\" be \"brought to its knees through the orchestrated attacks of the Russian authorities.\"67\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Steven Theede, 26 August 2010 (hereinafter \"Theede WS\") submitted with Memorial. Mr. Theede appeared for examination on 23 and 24 October 2012, Transcript, Day 10 at 1-133, Day 11 at 1-59. References to Mr. Theede's testimony appear in Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VIII.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests), VIII.D (The Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger), VIII.E (Attempts to Settle), VIII.G (The Bankruptcy of Yukos) and VIII.H (The Withdrawal of PwC's Audit Opinions).\n\nTheede WS \u00b6\u00b6 1-9, 36.\n\n164.\n\nMr. Theede states that he was involved in many attempts by Yukos to discharge or settle its alleged tax liabilities. While Yukos did not accept the validity of the tax claims, it nonetheless tried to discharge or settle them, only to be prevented from doing so by Respondent. For instance, in April 2004, Yukos was told to pay USD 3.4 billion within two days, but the next day was prohibited by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court from alienating assets. This \"impossible situation\" of demanding that Yukos pay but depriving it of any means to pay, became a pattern that led to \"a state of paralysis.\"68\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 28.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to Mr. Theede's statement, Yukos made about 80 proposals and communications to various Russian authorities but \"all our efforts were in vain.\" For example, he states that in July 2004, an offer by Yukos to relinquish its stake in Sibneft to satisfy the alleged debt was ignored. Yukos retained former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien to seek a global settlement, but his proposals went unanswered. Meanwhile, the tax bill kept increasing and Yukos paid taxes nearly equal to its total revenue. In October 2004, Mr. Theede testifies that Yukos submitted a \"full settlement proposal\" in the range of USD 21 billion, but negotiations \"came to an abrupt end\" when Yukos' principal negotiator, Yukos Vice-President Alexander Temerko was advised to leave Russia to avoid arrest. In December 2004, YNG, Yukos' core asset, was sold for a \"grossly undervalued price\" of USD 9.35 billion in a \"sham auction\" to an \"unknown company.\" After that, there were no more settlement discussions. Mr. Theede stated that the undervaluation of YNG became obvious when in 2006 Rosneft valued it at approximately USD 80 billion.69\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 9, 24-26.\n\n166.\n\nAccording to Mr. Theede's statement, in March 2006, a consortium of Western banks that had obtained a judgment in England against Yukos filed a bankruptcy petition with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. Mr. Theede states that his urgent letter to the Chief Bailiff, requesting that assets be released to satisfy the debt, went unanswered. He further describes how, in a confidential agreement, Rosneft agreed to purchase Yukos' debt to the consortium upon the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, which began in March 2006. Respondent was thus the only creditor of significance. Mr. Theede testifies that in July 2006, Mr. Rebgun produced a report concluding that Yukos was insolvent, and at the 20 July 2006 creditors' meeting, he recommended Yukos be declared bankrupt. By contrast, Yukos had submitted a rehabilitation plan in June 2006 (the \" **Rehabilitation Plan** \"), which valued the company at USD 31 billion, and would have seen Yukos pay its creditors in two years. The Rehabilitation Plan was not mentioned in Mr. Regbun's report. Not wanting to lend credibility to a \"charade\", Mr. Theede did not attend the 20 July 2006 creditors' meeting and, feeling there was nothing more to do to protect the company's assets, he resigned with effect from 1 August 2006.70\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 29-34.\n\n167.\n\nMr. Theede appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 23 and 24 October 2012. Mr. Theede was cross-examined about, *inter alia* : (a) the 15 April 2004 injunction (\" **April 2004 Injunction** \") and its effect on Yukos' control over certain assets; (b) Yukos' perception of the tax assessments as politically motivated; (c) the nature, adequacy and legitimacy of various settlement proposals offered by Yukos to pay off its tax debts; (d) the bankruptcy proceedings and proceeds from asset sales; and (e) the establishment of the Stichtings.\n\n168.\n\nUpon cross-examination, Mr. Theede confirmed that, in light of Yukos' strong performance in 2004, \"[d]espite the ongoing external pressure,\" Yukos' Board approved approximately USD 50 million in bonuses. Mr. Theede himself received a USD 5 million bonus. The decision to issue bonuses was motivated by Yukos' acute concerns about employee retention and \"hiring others was going to be almost impossible, because... it was a scary place to be.\"71 He recalled the exceptional hire of Mr. Aleksanyan as executive vice-president of Yukos because the bankruptcy administrator, Mr. Rebgun, wanted a Yukos executive in Moscow with whom he could work directly. Mr. Theede recounted that Mr. Aleksanyan \"went and met with Mr. Rebgun and explained to him that we were in a difficult situation but we wanted to cooperate, and we really felt that we could find a way to survive.\" Within three days, police stormed Mr. Aleksanyan's house and he was held in jail without a hearing for three years and only released as a result of a ECtHR ruling.72 He died a year later from an illness contracted in jail.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 14-16, 21-23.\n\n*Ibid.* at 38-39. *See also* Theede WS \u00b6 30.\n\n169.\n\nIn response to a Tribunal question, Mr. Theede testified that he met with PwC at least quarterly, but he did not recall that the trading companies ever came up in their discussions. He never asked PwC for a written opinion on the structure of the trading companies, and he \"was told that PwC's consulting arm was actually the architect of those structures.\" He did not discuss any of the tax reassessments with either Messrs. Kubena or Miller of PwC.73\n\n*Ibid.* at 50-51, 54.\n\n**8. Mr. Brent Kaczmarek**\n--------------------------\n\n170.\n\nMr. Brent C. Kaczmarek CFA74 is Managing Director of Navigant Consulting, Inc. and has served as a financial, valuation and damages expert in more than 40 international investment arbitrations. Mr. Kaczmarek was retained by Claimants as a damages expert to calculate Claimants' losses result from a \"series of acts which resulted in the demerger of Yukos Sibneft, the piece-by-piece sale of Yukos' assets, and eventually the destruction of Yukos,\" which he defines as \"the Actions.\"\n\nFirst Expert Report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, 15 September 2010, filed with Memorial (hereinafter \"First Kaczmarek Report\"); Second Expert Report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, 15 March 2012, filed with Reply (hereinafter \"Second Kaczmarek Report\"). Mr. Kaczmarek appeared for examination on 24 October 2012, Transcript, Day 11 at 60-196. References to Mr. Kaczmarek's testimony appear in Part XII of the Award (The Quantification of Claimants' Damages).\n\n171.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek's two expert reports and oral testimony are summarized in Part XII of the Award. In essence he concludes that, assuming the underlying tax assessments and all subsequent Actions were violations of the ECT, Claimants should be compensated for the value of their shareholding in a hypothetical Yukos entity (as merged with Sibneft and listed on the NYSE) as at the date of 21 November 2007, as well as any dividends that would have been paid to them up to that point in time, plus interest. The total amount of damages calculated on this basis would be USD 114,174 billion. Mr. Kaczmarek relies on a number of techniques in support of this figure, including valuations of Yukos' assets, a Discounted Cash Flow (\" **DCF** \") analysis, a comparable companies approach and a comparable transactions approach. Mr. Kaczmarek also offers valuations in scenarios where there is no merger with Sibneft and no listing on the NYSE. He additionally makes assessments of the damages which would be due to compensate Yukos were the Tribunal to find that the original tax assessments did not breach the ECT but that the subsequent enforcement of the tax claims did. His damages calculations for the latter scenario range between USD 33 billion and USD 67 billion.\n\n172.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek was cross-examined about (a) revisions he made between his first and second reports; (b) errors made with respect to the crude oil export tariff rate, the mineral extraction tax rate, inflation rates, the use of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, an erroneous conversion of tons to barrels, (c) assumptions about Yukos' borrowing capacity, and (d) various reasonableness tests. The Tribunal also questioned him about the choice of valuation dates.75\n\nTranscript, Day 11at 192-93.\n\n**9. Mr. Philip Baker QC**\n--------------------------\n\n173.\n\nMr. Philip Baker QC76 practices at Gray's Inn Tax Chambers in London and is presently a senior research fellow at the University of London. Claimants presented him as an expert on international tax law to counter claims made by Respondent's expert Professor Rosenbloom, regarding the benefits claimed by Hulley and VPL under the Agreement between Cyprus and the Russian Federation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, signed on 5 December 1998 (\" **Cyprus-Russia DTA** \"). For reasons explained in more detail in Chapter IX.B of this Award (on \"Unclean Hands\"), Mr. Baker disagrees with Professor Rosenbloom's conclusion that the claims to benefit from the Cyprus-Russia DTA were not appropriate, were vitiated by tax treaty abuse and were not justified by the provisions of the DTA.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Philip Baker QC, 14 March 2012, filed with Reply. Initially Mr. Baker was expected to appear before the Tribunal, but on 4 October 2012, Respondent informed the Tribunal it no longer wished to cross-examine him. References to his report appear in Chapter IX.B (Unclean Hands).\n\n174.\n\nIn essence, Mr. Baker firstly maintains that the benefits that Hulley and VPL received under the Cyprus-Russia DTA are consistent with its purpose. Secondly, Mr. Baker opines that the abuse of law doctrine is found in the domestic law of certain countries, but is not universal and, where it applies, it is for that domestic jurisdiction to resolve whether the doctrine applies to international obligations such as double taxation conventions. Thirdly, Mr. Baker maintains that Hulley and VPL were the beneficial owners of the dividends received from Yukos in the sense of Article 10 of the Cyprus-Russia DTA. Hulley and VPL were acknowledged investment companies holding shares in Russian companies and did not have a permanent establishment in Russia under Article 10(4).\n\n**10. Mr. Yuri Schmidt**\n------------------------\n\n175.\n\nMr. Yuri Schmidt77 was Mr. Khodorkovsky's defense lawyer in his 2004 and 2007 criminal trials, prior to which Mr. Schmidt had no previous dealings with Mr. Khodorkovsky or with Yukos. In his witness statement, Mr. Schmidt recounts that Russian authorities systematically intimidated and harassed Yukos' lawyers and personnel. Illegal and aggressive raids and seizures were \"meticulously calculated to correspond to the critical stages in the dismantlement of Yukos.\" Russian authorities also engaged in physical attacks and other provocation, including long and abusive interrogations and beatings. In February 2007, defense lawyers were illegally and invasively searched at the airport while en route to visit Mr. Khodorkovsky in Siberia. Russian authorities also (unsuccessfully) brought libel proceedings against and attempted to disbar Mr. Schmidt. Respondent chose not to call him for cross-examination.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Yuri Schmidt, 6 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Schmidt WS\") (original in Russian, translated into English), submitted with Memorial. References to Mr. Schmidt's testimony appear in Chapter VIII.C (Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests).\n\n176.\n\nMr. Schmidt testifies that in the criminal cases against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, Russian authorities violated basic standards of due process and fair trial. In 50 years of legal practice in Russia, Mr. Schmidt had \"never seen breaches of due process so flagrant and so egregious,\" nor had he ever, even in the \"darkest hours of the Soviet regime,\" \"seen the Russian State undertake such coordinated, systematic and intense efforts, and deploy such huge resources, against a person accused of an alleged economic offense.\" The raids resulted in the \"massive confiscation\" of documents that were not returned. In December 2006, the defendants were transferred to a \"pre-trial detention isolator\" in Chita and Siberia. Mr. Schmidt recounts that during the trials, seized documents were presented out of context; the defendants sat in metal and glass cages that were equipped with hidden microphones; criminal charges were brought against defense witnesses; and prosecution motions were systematically granted, while defense motions were refused.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to Mr. Schmidt, the goal of destroying Yukos and confiscating its assets was carried out by the coordinated actions of all branches of the Russian State. The judiciary blocked Mr. Khodorkovsky's registration of candidacy for the 2005 parliamentary elections by accelerating his appeal. The administration transferred Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to the \"most inaccessible penal colonies in Russia,\" \"in blatant violation of Russian law.\" The legislature amended legislation to permit the transfer and amended the law on NGOs to force the closure of Open Russia.\n\n**11. Dr. Sergei Kovalev**\n--------------------------\n\n178.\n\nDr. Sergei Kovalev78 is a Russian human rights activist, former politician, Soviet dissident and political prisoner. From 1993 to 2003 he served as an elected State Duma Deputy. He has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. Kovalev's expert opinion is on the independence of the Russian judiciary in cases with a political element or representing a particular interest to Russian authorities. Dr. Kovalev concludes that the Russian judicial system was not, and is still not, independent. According to Dr. Kovalev, where cases implicate the interests of the State, trials are political and decisions dictated by extralegal motives. There exists \"absolute submission of the Russian judiciary to the executive power.\" Respondent did not call him for cross-examination.\n\nExpert Report of Dr. Sergei Kovalev, 2 September 2010 (hereinafter \"Kovalev Report\") (original in Russian, translated into English), submitted with Memorial. References to Dr. Kovalev's testimony appear in Chapter VIII.C (Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests).\n\n179.\n\nDr. Kovalev opines that the normative regulation of the Russian judiciary ensures its dependence, including through the role of the executive branch of government in the appointment of judges. Court Presidents have \"excessive powers,\" courts are under-funded, judges earn bonuses for \"exemplary behavior\" (as defined by the regime), and disciplinary action is taken against disobedient judges.\n\n180.\n\nDr. Kovalev's answer to the question of whether the Russian judiciary was independent of the executive branch in the Yukos and Khodorkovsky/Lebedev cases, is \"unequivocal and definitely negative,\" because of the \"clearly political nature\" of the cases. The political motive was \"to dispose of Mikhail Khodorkovsky,\" whom the Putin administration saw as an \"unmistakable political opponent.\" According to Dr. Kovalev, the attacks on Yukos also had economic motives, as evidenced by President Putin's vouching for the unknown last minute purchasers of YNG. Pressure (including the imprisonment of Yukos lawyer Vasiliy Aleksanyan) was exerted on other Yukos associates to obtain testimony. Dr. Kovalev lists \"egregious due process violations\" against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, including: (a) a pretrial investigation that was conducted without the defendants' participation; (b) the dismissal by the Court of every defense petition; and (c) the refusal by the Court to allow the defense attorneys to question Prosecution expert witnesses.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S WITNESSES**\n-----------------------------\n\n181.\n\nRespondent submitted no testimony from fact witnesses. Respondent submitted 11 expert opinions. At the Hearing on the Merits, Claimants chose to cross-examine only:79\n\n1) Professor James Dow PhD; and\n\n2) Mr. Oleg Y. Konnov\n\nInitially, Claimants intended to also cross-examine Professor H. David Rosenbloom. However, they decided not to after Respondent, shortly before the Hearing on the Merits, advised that it did not wish to cross-examine Claimants' international tax law expert, Mr. Philip Baker QC.\n\n182.\n\nRespondent's other witnesses, who did not appear for cross-examination, were:\n\n3) Professor Reinier Kraakman;\n\n4) Professor H. David Rosenbloom;\n\n5) Professor Thomas Z. Lys PhD;\n\n6) Ms. Felicity Cullen QC;\n\n7) Mr. Dale Hart;\n\n8) Mr. Polyvios G. Polyviou;\n\n9) Mr. John Ellison FCA;\n\n10) Mr. Raymond Gross CPA; and\n\n11) Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg\n\n183.\n\nThe following summary first addresses the testimony of Respondent's two witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal, in order of appearance. It then reviews the evidence from Respondent's nine witnesses whom Claimants chose not to cross-examine as well as the evidence provided by Professor Stef van Weeghel during the jurisdictional phase of this case.\n\n**1. Professor James Dow**\n--------------------------\n\n184.\n\nProfessor James Dow80 is Professor of Finance at London Business School, where he has taught valuation since 1989. He has a PhD from Princeton University and economics degrees from Cambridge University. Professor Dow was retained by Respondent as a damages expert to respond to the reports of Claimants' expert, Mr. Kaczmarek.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Professor James Dow, 1 April 2011, filed with Respondent's Counter Memorial, Second Expert Report of Professor James Dow, 15 August 2012, filed with Rejoinder. Professor Dow appeared for examination on 25 October 2012, Transcript, Day 12 at 1-202. References to Professor Dow's testimony appear in Part XII (The Quantification of Claimants' Damages).\n\n185.\n\nProfessor Dow's two expert reports and oral testimony are summarized in Part XII of the Award. Professor Dow acknowledges focusing on \"explaining why the Kaczmarek Report is not useful for calculating damages in this matter.\" His reports contain no alternative valuation of his own. He basically describes a series of flaws in the analysis of Mr. Kaczmarek, highlighting his choice of a valuation date which, he says, is arbitrary and unjustifiably inflates damages. He also criticizes Mr. Kaczmarek for ignoring causation and the extent to which Yukos' own actions might have contributed to the loss. Professor Dow identifies a number of errors in Claimants' DCF analysis and questions the way in which Mr. Kaczmarek sought to correct them without impacting the ultimate valuation. He also articulates problems with Claimants' comparable companies method and the assumptions underlying the \"alternative collection scenarios\" whereby Claimants would have been given an opportunity to make arrangements to pay off legitimate tax assessments. He identifies some \"obvious and significant errors\" relating to the application of the inflation rate, the export duty rate and the mineral extract tax rate. He also criticizes any valuation based on an American Depository Receipt (\" **ADR** \") listing on the NYSE as too speculative. Professor Dow was cross-examined about these issues.\n\n186.\n\nAt the Hearing, Professor Dow testified that he would be prepared to put some weight on Mr. Kaczmarek's analysis for YNG with corrections (USD 17.1 billion for the comparable companies approach and USD 17.2 billion for the comparable transactions approach); which represented a \"reasonable stab\".81 Professor Dow was asked if his corrected figures for Yukos and YukosSibneft valuations resulting from the comparable companies analysis (of USD 67.8 billion and US 93.7 billion respectively) could provide \"a valid result in terms of valuation in the same manner as for YNG,\" to which he answered that: \"They are not presented in that context, but I think I'd have to agree that they could be a useful valuation, yes.\"82 He qualified this answer by noting he had not done enough analysis, for example by accounting for changes in oil prices. Claimants' counsel also challenged Professor Dow on his criticisms of Claimants' comparable companies approach. With respect to the proper valuation date, from an economic standpoint, he considered that the end of 2004 was the appropriate valuation date, since that is when the loss of value in Yukos had taken place and the market thought, based on the share price, that the company's fortunes had no chance of being reversed. Professor Dow opined that \"it's indisputable that there was no value by the end of 2004.83 By the end of 2004, Yukos' share price had plummeted, it was a penny stock, and in the three years that followed there was no recovery in the share price.\"84\n\nTranscript, Day 12 at 47.\n\nTranscript, Day 12 at 47-48.\n\n*Ibid.* at 176.\n\n*Ibid.* at 47.\n\n**2. Mr. Oleg Y. Konnov**\n-------------------------\n\n187.\n\nMr. Oleg Y. Konnov85 is a partner at Herbert Smith LLP and head of its Russian tax group based in Moscow. He has practiced tax law for 17 years and taught at the Law Faculty of Moscow State University. Respondent retained him as an expert on Russian tax law. Mr. Konnov was the only Russian tax lawyer who appeared as a witness before the Tribunal. Extensive extracts from his testimony are set out in the Analysis portion of the Award, especially the chapters dealing with Yukos' tax optimization scheme and the tax assessments. Accordingly, his testimony is not reproduced here in any detail.\n\nMr. Konnov submitted two expert reports for these proceedings. First Expert Report of Mr. Oleg Konnov, 4 April 2011 (hereinafter \"First Konnov Report\"); Second Expert Report of Mr. Oleg Konnov, 15 August 2012 (hereinafter \"Second Konnov Report\"). Mr. Konnov appeared for examination on 29-31 October 2012; Transcript, Day 13 at 1257; Day 14 at 1-261; Day 15 at 1-256. References to Mr. Konnov's testimony appear Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIII.B (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VIII.E (Attempts to Settle) and VIII.F (The Auction of YNG).\n\n188.\n\nHis first expert report describes the tax optimization scheme adopted by Yukos using domestic offshore companies and sets out some basic principles of the Russian federal tax legislation at the relevant times. He then addresses seven specific questions.\n\n189.\n\nThe first question is whether the tax authorities acted in accordance with applicable law and practice when assessing profit tax on Yukos with respect to sales by the domestic offshore companies. Mr. Konnov answers affirmatively and opines that the actions of the Russian tax authorities against Yukos were consistent with pronouncements by Russian courts on the \"anti-abuse doctrine\", which according to Mr. Konnov, was \"accepted and consistently applied\" by Russian courts before and after the Yukos tax cases.86\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 31-52.\n\n190.\n\nThe second question is whether Yukos was automatically entitled to a zero percent VAT rate in connection with exports declared by domestic offshore companies. Mr. Konnov answers no, because the application of a zero percent VAT rate was \"strictly conditioned\" on the taxpayer's filing of a \"special\" zero percent monthly VAT return. According to Mr. Konnov, Yukos should have complied with the specific procedures because the courts and the tax authorities established that Yukos was \"the actual owner and exporter of goods.\"87\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 53-59.\n\n191.\n\nThe third question is whether Yukos had disclosed to the Russian tax authorities prior to the commencement of the 2003 tax audit its tax minimization practices involving the use of domestic offshore companies registered in domestic low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Konnov saw nothing in the record indicating that Yukos \"made any significant disclosure of its tax scheme,\" but even so, illegal tax practices may not be legitimized through a tax offender's disclosure.88\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 59-64.\n\n192.\n\nThe fourth question is whether the Russian Tax Ministry complied with applicable law in appointing and conducting a tax audit of Yukos in December 2003. Mr. Konnov answers affirmatively.89\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 65-70.\n\n193.\n\nThe fifth question is whether the Russian tax authorities and courts complied with applicable law in imposing fines on Yukos. Mr. Konnov explains that the base fine under Russian tax law is 20 percent, which can be increased to 40 percent if non-payment results from the willful acts of a taxpayer, which in turn may be doubled for repeat offenders. Mr. Konnov concludes that the imposition of fines on Yukos was justified and accorded with prevailing court practice.90\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 71-82.\n\n194.\n\nThe sixth question concerns actions that Yukos could have taken after receiving the 2000 Tax Audit Report in December 2003 to reduce its tax liability. Mr. Konnov explains that Yukos could have: (a) voluntarily paid all tax arrears and accrued interest and reserved cash for fines; (b) filed amended tax returns, and paid tax and interest due for 2001-2003; (c) complied with the legal requirements for claiming the zero percent VAT rate; and (d) discontinued as of 1 January 2004 the use of domestic offshore companies.91\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 83-85.\n\n195.\n\nThe seventh question is whether the tax treatment of YNG changed after its sale to Rosneft. Mr. Konnov concludes that the treatment of YNG before and after its sale to Rosneft \"was consistent with then current practice of the Russian tax authorities and courts, and does not suggest any irregularity.\"92\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 89-92.\n\n196.\n\nMr. Konnov's second report responds to alleged misstatements of Russian tax law found in the Reply, including with respect to the \"anti-abuse doctrine\" under Russian tax law,93 \"re-attribution,\" and the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine.94Mr. Konnov also addresses Claimants' arguments about proportionality between tax benefits claimed and investments made in the low-tax regions, Yukos' awareness that its tax optimization scheme was not fully compliant with the law, the application of the Law of the Russian Federation governing Value Added Tax (\" **VAT Law** \"), and fines on Yukos.95\n\nSecond Konnov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 26-41.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 84-121.\n\n197.\n\nMr. Konnov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 29, 30 and 31 October 2012. He was cross-examined on a range of documents from the record, legal authorities and their application to Yukos and its domestic offshore companies. Issues canvassed in the crossexamination included, *inter alia* : (a) the factual record underlying his views expressed about alleged improprieties in Yukos' domestic offshore companies; (b) whether oil products must be physically stored or moved from the premises of trading companies; (c) the re-attribution theory applied to Yukos and the existence of legal precedents for the theory at the relevant time; (d) provisions in the regional tax legislation in Mordovia and elsewhere; (e) the investment agreements concluded between the domestic offshore trading companies and Mordovian authorities; (f) the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine at relevant times; (g) fines and penalties; (h) prior audits conducted by local and regional authorities on Yukos' domestic offshore trading companies and the extent to which they demonstrate familiarity with and tolerance of the tax optimization scheme; (i) audit inspection practices; (j) the meaning of \"interrelatedness\" in the context of Russian tax legislation; (k) the consequences of the reattribution theory on entitlement to VAT refunds and the formalities required to enjoy VAT exemption; (l) the evolution of the ZATO tax laws and certain internal memoranda within ZATO tax inspectorates; and (m) timing for enforcement of tax assessments.96\n\nTranscript, Day 13 at 49-52, 70-80, 114-20, 151-52; Transcript, Day 14 at 61-68.\n\n198.\n\nMr. Konnov also answered questions from the Tribunal, including about the principle of resolving doubts in favor of the taxpayer.97 He was asked why, in the interests of justice the Russian courts did not treat the filings for VAT by the trading companies as filings by Yukos.98 When he emphasized the formalities required for filing for VAT, he was further asked whether the trustee in bankruptcy (Mr Rebgun), who was charged with maximizing the resources available for creditors, himself could have filed the monthly forms for VAT return. Mr. Konnov answered that he could have done so, subject to the three-year limitation period, *i.e.*, he could have re-filed for the three years preceding his appointment as trustee.99 The Tribunal also asked Mr. Konnov how the tax authorities determine the motivation of a taxpayer in making use of a low-tax region and about his experience in advising clients with respect to tax minimization.100\n\nTranscript, Day 15 at 37-42 (Dr. Poncet referring to the principle *in dubio contra fiscum*).\n\n*Ibid*. at 232.\n\n*Ibid*. at 234-35.\n\n*Ibid*. at 237-41\n\n199.\n\nMr. Konnov was asked about a comment made by him as an expert witness in the *RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation* arbitration (\" ***RosInvestCo*** \"), to the effect that \"sometimes Russian courts [do not] have an excellent reputation.\" Mr. Konnov responded that he had not come across corruption or irregularities in tax cases.101 He was invited to share his views on the tax evasion aspects of the convictions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. The parts of the judgment dealing with tax elements of the ZATOs and issues of personal income tax avoidance seemed to him to make sense, but he could not comment on other parts of the judgment.102\n\n*Ibid*. at 251-56. Referring to the case of *RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Arbitration V (079/2005), Final Award, 12 September 2010, Exh. C-1049 (hereinafter \" *RosInvestCo* \").\n\n*Ibid*. at 249-55.\n\n**3. Professor Reinier Kraakman**\n---------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nProfessor Reinier Kraakman103 is a Harvard law professor specializing in comparative corporate law and governance. Claimants chose not to call him for cross-examination. His expert report concerns the activities of Bank Menatep, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his \"tight-knit group of confederates\" (the \" **Khodorkovsky Group** \"), Yukos Oil Company, and Yukos' subsidiaries from the period 1995-1999. He addresses provisions of the Russian Civil Law, Joint Stock Company Law (\" **JSC Law** \") and privatization law.\n\nExpert Report of Professor Reinier Kraakman, 1 April 2011, filed with Counter-Memorial. References to his expert report appear in Chapter IX.B (Unlean Hands).\n\n201.\n\nProfessor Kraakman maintains that Mr. Khodorkovsky, his Group, and Bank Menatep acted in bad faith and \"probably illegally\" in violation of the spirit and letter of Presidential Decree No. 889, which was the legal foundation of the Loans-For-Shares (\" **LFS** \") Program. At stake in the initial auction of Yukos shares in December 1996 were (i) the right to lend funds to the Russian Federation secured by a pledge of 45 percent of Yukos stock, and (ii) the right to purchase a block of 33 percent of Yukos Stock in a so-called \"Investment Tender\". Bank Menatep held shares pledged by the State and sold those shares to their close affiliates, a \"tactic\" that \"allowed the Khodorkovsky Group to gain title to the pledged shares while avoiding Bank Menatep's agency duty to maximize their value,\" thus violating \"the intent of Decree 889, while making a gesture toward formal compliance.\"\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Professor Kraakman, secondary sources, and some primary documentation, support \"a reasonable inference\" that, prior to the Russian Federation's sovereign debt crisis in late 1998, the Khodorkovsky Group systematically skimmed revenue from Yukos' partially-held operating subsidiaries\u2014YNG, Samarneftegaz, and Tomskneft\u2014in bad faith and in violation of the JSC Law's regulations on self-dealing transactions. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the Khodorkovsky Group skimmed revenue directly from Yukos from mid-1996 until 1999, and transferred it to offshore companies around the world that were controlled or beneficially owned by members of the Khodorkovsky Group.\n\n203.\n\nHe testifies that following the Russian sovereign debt crisis, Yukos and the Khodorkovsky Group largely succeeded in squeezing out minority shareholders from Yukos' operating subsidiaries. Yukos managed this by committing serious violations of the provisions in the JSC Law intended to protect minority shareholders. Yukos exhibited egregious bad faith by blocking minority shareholders from participating in extraordinary shareholders meetings called in March 1999. He claims: \"As a professor of corporate law with a particular interest in the JSC Law, I have never read\u2014or read about\u2014anything more chilling in a professional sense than the documents and manipulative behavior surrounding the March 1999 EGMs [Extraordinary General Meetings] held for YNG, Samareneftegaz, and Tomskneft.\" In Professor Kraakman's opinion, Yukos and the Khodorkovsky Group opportunistically devalued Yukos shares, which Bank Menatep\u2014the Group's financial arm\u2014had previously pledged to Western banks in order to finance Yukos' efforts to gain control of Tomskneft.\n\n**4. Professor H. David Rosenbloom**\n------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nProfessor H. David Rosenbloom104 is a practicing attorney, a consultant and NYU law professor specializing in international taxation. He has worked for the U.S. Government on international tax matters. Respondent retained him as an international tax law expert. He opines on the appropriateness of the actions from 2000-2003 by four Cypriot entities\u2014Hulley, VPL, Dunsley Limited, and Nassaubridge Management Limited\u2014in claiming a reduced Russian Federation tax on dividends paid by Yukos and affiliates, under the Cyprus-Russia DTA.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Professor H. David Rosenbloom, 1 April 2011, filed with Counter-Memorial, Second Expert Report of Professor H. David Rosenbloom, 15 August 2012, filed with Rejoinder. Initially Claimants intended to cross-examine Professor Rosenbloom, but decided not to after Respondent advised it would not be cross-examining Mr. Philip Baker QC. References to Professor Rosenbloom's reports appear in Chapter IX.B (Unclean Hands).\n\n205.\n\nProfessor Rosenbloom concludes that each of the four entities is a \"paper entity\", with \"total control\" and \"ultimate ownership\" exercised by Russian individuals operating solely within Russia and enjoying all economic benefits. According to Professor Rosenbloom, the invocation of the Cyprus-Russia DTA under these circumstances was a \"blatant example of tax treaty abuse.\" Professor Rosenbloom refers to pervasive recognition of the international \"abuse of law\" doctrine, to the OECD Commentaries (the DTA follows the OECD Model), and to the VCLT to assert that: (a) taxpayers must act in good faith to benefit from an income tax treaty; and (b) the employment of entities in one State party to a tax treaty exclusively to reduce taxes otherwise applicable under the laws of the other State party constitutes tax treaty abuse.\n\n206.\n\nFor reasons described in more detail in Chapter IX.B (on \"Unclean Hands\"), Professor Rosenbloom concludes that the benefits claimed were not justified by Article 10 of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, which limits the tax charged by one State on dividends paid from a company in that State to beneficial owners of the stock resident in the other State, provided they do not operate through a \"permanent establishment\" in the first State, to which the dividends are attributable. Firstly, he opines, the Cypriot entities were not beneficial owners of the dividends received on Yukos shares, and the beneficial owners were not residents of Cyprus. Secondly, in his view, the entities were not eligible for the claimed benefits because they operated through permanent establishments in the Russian Federation, to which the dividends were attributable. In sum, according to Professor Rosenbloom, the claims under the Cyprus-Russia DTA on behalf of the Cypriot entities were unjustified. They were not only abusive, but without merit.\n\n207.\n\nIn his second expert report, Professor Rosenbloom replies to the opinion of Claimants' tax law expert, Mr. Baker, which he describes as \"long on law and history\" but \"short, very short, on the facts.\" The facts here, according to Professor Rosenbloom, involve Russian nationals and residents earning Russian source income and claiming a treaty-based reduction of normal Russian tax by reason of a \"wafer-thin Cypriot corporate veneer managed from Russian soil.\" Neither the DTA nor any other income tax treaty would condone such a structure and no rational country would endorse it as sound policy. Professor Rosenbloom then sets out in further detail facts pertaining to several Yukos-related entities which inappropriately claimed benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA.\n\n208.\n\nProfessor Rosenbloom opines that the primary purpose of a tax treaty is to eliminate or at least mitigate international double taxation and none of the authorities in Mr. Baker's report deal with a country using treaties to reduce tax on its own residents but rather discuss third-country investors. Interpreting the Cyprus-Russia DTA as an instrument to attract foreign direct investment into Russia without regard to tax revenue loss exceeds the limited scope of OECD-based treaties and undermines the purpose of tax avoidance and evasion. Professor Rosenbloom also accuses Mr. Baker of failing to differentiate between treaty shopping and \"round tripping\". Russia's inaction to insist on strict limitation on benefit or its failure to terminate the Cyprus-Russia DTA does not establish Russia's endorsement of round tripping.\n\n209.\n\nFinally, Professor Rosenbloom refers to documents provided after the filing of his first report, which he says confirm that neither Hulley nor VPL beneficially owned dividends received from Yukos. Even if Hulley and VPL were considered beneficial owners of the Yukos dividends on the transferred shares, the related-party \"repos\" or stock-lending agreements, which had no purpose other than to enable claims of treaty benefits, are an improper use of the DTA.\n\n210.\n\nAccording to Professor Rosenbloom, even if the Yukos structure and transactions with the Cypriot entities were not abusive, dividend distributions by Yukos and its affiliates to Hulley, VPL and the other Cypriot entities did not qualify under the DTA for reduced tax in Russia since they should have been taxed as \"business profits\" under Article 10(4) of the DTA. The facts also confirm that all the Laurel subsidiaries had permanent establishments in Russia to which the dividends received from their Russian subsidiaries were attributable. According to Professor Rosenbloom, it is not necessary to adopt a complicated \"economic substance\" or \"substance-over-form\" analysis to see that the Yukos structure cannot be defended as within the scope of the Cyprus-Russia DTA or legitimate tax planning. Had Mr. Baker and Claimants \"focused on the facts presented\" they could not reasonably have come to any other conclusion.\n\n**5. Professor Thomas Z. Lys**\n------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nProfessor Thomas Lys105 is a professor of accounting at Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University in Chicago. He has a PhD in accounting and finance from the University of Rochester and an economics degree from the University of Berne, Switzerland. He has served as a consultant to several companies. He was retained by Respondent to expound in detail various financial transactions and operations of Yukos. Claimants chose not to call him for cross-examination. The appendices attached to Professor Lys' Reports were used at various times throughout the Hearing to help illustrate Yukos' structure and activities.\n\nFirst Expert Report of Thomas Z. Lys, 1 April 2011, filed with Counter-Memorial, Supplemental Expert Report of Professor Thomas Z. Lys, 15 August 2012, filed with Rejoinder. References to Professor Lys' Reports appear in Chapters VIII.A (The Tax Optimization Scheme) and X.E (Contributory Fault).\n\n212.\n\nProfessor Lys recounts Yukos' incorporation in 1993, privatization in 1995 and public sale of shares in 1996. He describes Yukos' structure and activities and the role of the various producing subsidiaries, trading entities and off-shore entities, and the structure and flow of funds originating in the trading companies into \"offshore and Yukos entities.\"\n\n213.\n\nProfessor Lys explains that starting in 1999, the majority of Yukos shares were owned by subsidiaries of GML, an entity whose major interest was held by Mr. Khodorkovsky, the CEO and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Yukos. Other shareholders of GML also had senior management positions in Yukos. In several instances, shares of Yukos stock were transferred between various entities under the control of GML. Many such transactions placed the Yukos shares temporarily, sometimes for less than a week, under nominal ownership of Cypriot entities on dates that established record ownership for purposes of Yukos dividend distributions, apparently in an effort to reduce Russian taxes on these dividends. YUL was a wholly-owned subsidiary of GML. Hulley was a wholly-owned subsidiary of YUL. Although VPL did not fall under the ownership structure of GML, it was a subsidiary of the Veteran Petroleum Trust (a Jersey trust), of which YUL controlled at least three quarters of the voting rights.\n\n214.\n\nProfessor Lys describes and details how there were hundreds of transactions of Yukos shares among the above-described entities and their affiliates; in some instances multiple transactions occurred on a single day. Many appear to Professor Lys to \"have been structured to place Yukos shares temporarily in the hands of Hulley and a specific account held in the name of VPL, both of which are Cypriot entities, as of the record dates of Yukos dividend payments.\" He states that \"they appear to have been performed to allow the Cypriot entities to claim beneficial ownership of these shares to reduce the Russian withholding taxes on the dividends Yukos paid on these shares, pursuant to the [Cyprus-Russia DTA].\" Given their timing, Professor Lys sees no apparent business purpose for these transactions.\n\n215.\n\nProfessor Lys also describes Yukos' dividend flows through YUL, Hulley, VPL, and GML. He concludes that YUL, and its beneficiary GML, not only received the economic benefit of the dividends paid on the Yukos shares owned by Hulley, but also received the benefit of the gains Hulley reported from the sales of Yukos shares to YUL. In other words, the profits earned on those sales were effectively \"returned\" through the dividend. YUL (and GML) were also the beneficiaries of dividends paid on Yukos shares owned by VPL.\n\n216.\n\nProfessor Lys describes how from 2000 to 2003, groups of Yukos-related entities \"moved funds in a common pattern from Russia's low-tax regions out of Russia, into off-shore entities.\" He details the flow structures of profits through the Fargoil and Ratibor structures. He sets out the Mega Alyans flow structure, showing the ultimate ownership of trading entities by Laurel, a BVI entity, and its sole shareholder, Stephen Curtis. He describes how Yukos had a call option to acquire all of Mr. Curtis' Laurel shares for one rouble.\n\n217.\n\nHe also details the flow structures in 2000-2001 of the trading companies registered in the ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny (Business-Oil, Flander, Forest-Oil, Greis, Kolkrein, Kverkus, Mitra, Muscron, Nortkes, and Vald Oil). He explains how the Lesnoy and Trekgorny trading companies passed funds through two Russian entities\u2014Neftetrade and Neftemarket\u2014to a number of Cypriot companies, which in turn passed the funds on through Laurel to Halsley and Belmont, two BVI entities owned by Brill.\n\n218.\n\nFinally, Professor Lys describes loans made by and to Yukos Capital (incorporated in Luxembourg in 2003). Yukos Capital's 2005 financial statements show that it borrowed extensively from and lent extensively to other Yukos entities. Professor Lys details loan transactions where the exact amount borrowed by Yukos Capital was then lent by Yukos Capital to other Yukos-related entities.\n\n**6. Ms. Felicity Cullen QC**\n-----------------------------\n\n219.\n\nMs. Felicity Cullen QC106 is a barrister specializing in United Kingdom tax law. Respondent asked Ms. Cullen to opine on rules concerning the assessment, collection, and enforcement of tax in the UK, in the context of showing that \"[t]he treatment by the Russian tax authorities of Yukos' tax evasion scheme is entirely consistent with the positions that would have been taken by the tax authorities of virtually every other country [including the UK].\"107 Claimants chose not to call her for cross-examination.\n\nExpert Report of Ms. Felicity Cullen QC, 4 April 2011.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1135.\n\n220.\n\nMs. Cullen was asked to give her opinion on the basis of a number of assumptions about a large corporate taxpayer who has entered into transactions to reduce its tax liability. She was asked to assume that the transactions are considered by tax authorities to involve avoidance and/or criminal evasion of tax, to lack genuine commerciality, and to have been carried out on nonarm's length terms. The same taxpayer is assumed to have deliberately concealed the true character of its transactions, to have been deliberately uncooperative in tax investigations and to have dissipated assets otherwise available to satisfy potential tax liabilities. In such assumed circumstances, Ms. Cullen describes the investigation and enforcement options open to an officer of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (\" **HMRC** \") during an enquiry into a tax return. For example, HMRC can amend a company's self-assessment if its suspected of understating the company's true tax liability and there is a real risk of substantial loss of tax to the government. Under a discovery process, HMRC is allowed to re-open returns for periods otherwise considered closed when there has been careless or deliberate conduct leading to loss of revenue.\n\n221.\n\nWith respect to penalities, Ms. Cullen notes that under the current UK civil tax penalty regime may vary from 30 to 100 percent of the potential lost revenue (depending on whether there was deliberate concealment). She further describes the considerable methods of enforcement available to HMRC, which include proceedings in English courts, freezing orders, and pursuit of insolvency proceedings. Criminal action may, according to Ms. Cullen, be pursued where appropriate, in which case HMRC will often conduct a form of \"dawn raid\", require production of documents, seize items like computers and make arrests.\n\n222.\n\nMs Cullen observes that traditionally, tax legislation in the UK was construed literally but today, it is construed purposively, which has facilitated challenging and countering tax avoidance schemes.\n\n**7. Mr. Dale Hart**\n--------------------\n\n223.\n\nMr. Dale Hart108 is a retired executive of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\" **IRS** \"). Respondent retained Mr. Hart to describe the U.S. legal framework against tax abuse and evasion and enforcement powers of the IRS, in the context of Respondent's claim that \"tax administrations around the world [including the U.S.] would have been at least as firm as the Russian Federation in dealing with abuses of the kind perpetrated by Yukos.\"109 Claimants chose not to call him for cross-examination.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Dale Hart, 4 April 2011.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1135.\n\n224.\n\nMr. Hart testifies that under U.S. law, abusive or fraudulent tax shelters are broadly defined to include investment schemes that reduce tax income without changing the value of the business. To combat them, the IRS relies on a legal framework that provides the authority to reallocate income and deductions to properly reflect income. The framework includes the judicial doctrines of economic substance, business purpose, sham transactions, substance over form and step transactions. The IRS has extensive civil and criminal enforcement powers, which according to Mr. Hart, it uses \"aggressively\". It has broad discretion in determining which tax returns and taxpayers to select for audit and it tailors the scope of its audit to the taxpayer's financial and tax situation. If evidence of fraud is revealed, the civil audit is discontinued and a criminal investigation may be launched. Mr. Hart notes that the typical three-year limitation period may be extended for fraud or other misconduct.\n\n225.\n\nWith respect to penalties, Mr. Hart describes how U.S. law imposes \"heavy\" penalties on fraudulently underpaid tax, including failure to pay and failure to file penalties, accuracy-related penalties on underpayments and a civil fraud penalty of 75 percent. The collection process begins with a formal notice of assessment requesting payment. According to Mr. Hart, a deferred payment arrangement is only ever considered when the taxpayer is unable to pay in full. Mr. Hart describes the \"strong arsenal\" of administrative enforcement collection tools at the disposal of the IRS, including a federal tax lien, a notice of levy and the sale of property by public auction or public sale after determination a minimum bid price that need not be based on fair market value.\n\n**8. Mr. Polyvios Polyviou**\n----------------------------\n\n226.\n\nMr. Polyvios Polyviou110 of Chryssafinis & Polyviou LLC in Nicosia is a lawyer practicing Cypriot law. Respondent retained him as an expert to show that Claimants' alleged abuses of the Cyprus-Russia DTA also violated the criminal laws of Cyprus. Claimants chose not to call him for cross-examination.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Polyvios G. Polyviou, 1 April 2011 (hereinafter \"Polyviou Report\"). References to Mr. Polyviou's report appear in Chapters IX.B (Unclean Hands) and X.E (Contributory Fault).\n\n227.\n\nMr. Polyviou's report is based on the following assumptions: (a) that for purposes of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, Hulley and Veteran were \"residents\" of Cyprus and Yukos was a \"resident\" of Russia; (b) that in reliance on the Cyprus-Russia DTA, Hulley and Veteran paid a reduced five percent withholding tax to Russia on dividends received from Yukos; (c) that Hulley and Veteran had no right to take the benefit of the Cyprus-Russia DTA because the relevant dividends *were* connected with activities carried out in Russia and/or because Hulley and Veteran were not the beneficial owners of the relevant dividends; (d) that the natural persons who declared/confirmed on forms submitted by Hulley and Veteran to Cypriot tax authorities that the relevant dividends received from Yukos were *not* connected with activities carried out in Russia and that Hulley/Veteran was the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends were authorized to do so on Hulley/Veteran's behalf; and (e) that at the time of making the declarations/confirmations, these natural persons *knew* that the dividends from Yukos *were* connected with activities carried out in Russia or that Hulley/Veteran was *not* the beneficial owner and intended for the forms to be submitted to the Cypriot authorities so as to obtain completion, dating, signing and stamping of Box 4 (the \"Note of the foreign Tax authority\") on the forms. On the basis of these assumptions, Mr. Polyviou was asked to address two questions, as described below.\n\n228.\n\nThe first question was: \"Did the circumstances under which Hulley and Veteran obtained the completion, dating, signing and stamping of certain tax forms by the Cypriot tax authorities give rise to criminal offences under the Criminal Code of Cyprus?\" Mr. Polyviou answers \"Yes\" under sections 297 (false pretences), 305 (willfully obtaining a \"certificate\" by false pretences) and 341 (willfully procuring execution of documents by false pretences) of Cap. 154 of the Criminal Code. According to Mr. Polyviou, but for the false pretence, Cypriot tax authorities would have rejected the request to complete, date, sign and stamp the forms as it would have been pointless and tantamount to assisting an abuse of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.\n\n229.\n\nThe second question was: \"Were criminal offences committed under the Criminal Code and/or the Companies Law of Cyprus?\", assuming that during the period 1 January 2000 to 28 October 2003: (a) in reliance upon the Cyprus-Russia DTA Hulley and Veteran paid a reduced five percent withholding tax to Russia on dividends received from Yukos; (b) neither Hulley nor Veteran had the right to take the benefit of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, at least vis-\u00e0-vis Yukos' above-mentioned dividends; and (c) neither Hulley nor Veteran disclosed point (b) in their annual accounts for financial years 2000-2002? Mr. Polyviou answered \"Yes\" under section 311(b)(iii) (directors and officers of corporations keeping fraudulent accounts or falsifying books or accounts) of Cap. 154 and section 143(6) (contents and forms of accounts) of Cap. 113 of the Criminal Code.\n\n**9. Mr. John Ellison**\n-----------------------\n\n230.\n\nMr. John Ellison111 is a consultant at KPMG in London, having retired as a senior partner in 2010. His report concerns the withdrawal by PwC of its audit opinions on Yukos' financial statements for the years 1995-2004. Claimants chose not to cross-examine him.112\n\nExpert Accountant's Report to the Tribunal by John Ellison, FCA, 14 August 2012 (hereinafter \"Ellison Report\"). References to Mr. Ellison's expert report appear in Chapter VIII.H (The Withdrawal of PwC's Audit Opinions).\n\n*See* Chapter VI.C (The So-Called \"Empty Chairs\").\n\n231.\n\nMr. Ellison opines that for a reputable international firm such as KPMG to withdraw an audit opinion is an \"unusual and serious\" event, of which he knows of only a handful of cases. At KPMG, whether in the UK, the U.S., or Russia, such decision would necessarily be preceded by extensive consultations with several senior partners of the firm together with its technical departments and legal counsel. According to Mr. Ellison, PwC's procedures were similar, as shown by a declaration (appended to the Ellison Report) from Ms. Laurie Endsley, PwC's in-house counsel who worked on the Yukos matter at the time of withdrawing the audits.\n\n232.\n\nMr. Ellison analyzes PwC's letter of 15 June 2007,113 in which PwC announced the withdrawal of its audit opinions of Yukos' financial statements, explaining that it had acquired new information that caused it to question the reliability of the representations made by Yukos' management during the audits. Assuming the veracity of the contents of the letter, Mr. Ellison concludes that in withdrawing its audit opinions, PwC acted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the U.S., Russia and internationally.\n\nLetters from ZAO PwC Audit to Mr. Rebgun, 15 June 2007, Exh. C-611 (hereinafter \"PwC's Withdrawal Letter\").\n\n233.\n\nMr. Ellison notes that under U.S. Statement of Auditing Standards No. 1, Section 333, when an auditor after issuing its report becomes aware of facts that existed at the time the report was being compiled, believes there are persons relying or likely to rely on his report and considers that the new facts are material to his report, or shake his confidence in the overall veracity of representations made by management, the auditor must advise his client to disclose the new facts and possibly revise its financial statements. Mr. Ellison refers to PwC's claim that in light of the bankruptcy of Yukos, PwC \"was unable to access the information required that could lead to revision of the financial statements and was also unable to discuss the matter with management, as recommended by [U.S. Auditing standards] AU Section 561.\" Mr. Ellison accepts that in those circumstances, PwC \"had no option but to withdraw its audit reports.\"\n\n234.\n\nUnder International Standard on Auditing 560 and Russian Federal Auditing Rule 10, when new material facts become known to the auditor after issuance of the audit report, the auditor should consider revising the company's financial statements, discuss the matter with the company's management and \"take the action appropriate in the circumstances\" or \"take steps necessary in the circumstances.\" In Mr. Ellison's view, PwC did take the appropriate steps.\n\n**10. Mr. Raymond Gross**\n-------------------------\n\n235.\n\nMr. Raymond Gross114 is a partner of KPMG's U.S. Accounting & Reporting Group in London. Claimants chose not to cross-examine him. Respondent asked Mr. Gross to review what Yukos' consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP revealed with respect to: (a) Yukos' tax optimization scheme, including its use of trading companies in low-tax regions of Russia to buy oil and oil products from production subsidiaries and transfer the proceeds to offshore companies established or controlled by Yukos; (b) the Jurby Lake structure, a group of offshore trading companies controlled by Yukos or its former Russian majority shareholders and comprising Jurby Lake Limited (Ireland) and the BBS Companies; and (c) the taxes assessed against Yukos' trading companies in the ZATO of Lesnoy for tax years 1999 and 2000.\n\nExpert Accountant's Report to the Tribunal by Raymond Gross, CPA, 14 August 2012.\n\n236.\n\nMr. Gross was instructed to assume that the statements would have \"put a reader on notice of facts relevant to the nature and legality of Yukos' use of the Tax Optimization Scheme\" if they had included: (a) identification of the involved trading and offshore companies (listed in the exhibits to the Report); (b) the monetary value of the investments made and tax savings achieved by Yukos through the scheme; (c) details of the extent of the trading companies' investments in Russia's low-tax regions; (d) details the extent of Yukos' direction of and control over the trading companies; (e) details of the flow of funds from the trading companies to Yukos; (f) details about the taxes assessed against Yukos' trading companies in the ZATO of Lesnoy in 1999 and 2000 and the Republic of Kalmykia in 2001 due to improperly received tax benefits; and (g) disclosure of the possible financial impact on Yukos if the tax optimization scheme was disallowed by the Russian authorities.\n\n237.\n\nMr. Gross concludes that the statements for the years 2000-2002 and the first three quarters of 2003 were not transparent with regard to Yukos' tax optimization scheme, as they disclosed none of the above-listed information necessary to put a reader on notice. While the statements showed that Yukos' effective tax level was lower than the statutory tax level, they failed to explain the nature of the difference. The statements also failed, according to Mr. Gross, to identify the companies composing the Jurby Lake structure.\n\n238.\n\nMr. Gross also concludes that the 2001-2002 statements were not transparent and not consistent with the U.S. GAAP in that they failed to disclose as contingent liabilities the taxes assessed against the trading companies of the ZATO of Lesnoy for 1999 and 2000, despite the fact that these tax assessments were material to the statements. Under the U.S. GAAP, Yukos could omit these assessments from the statements if it determined that the probability of loss was remote; however, the written support of outside legal counsel or another competent authority which would usually be required for such a determination was not obtained in this case. Mr. Gross opines that Yukos should have disclosed that the validity of the tax optimization scheme had been called into question and discussed the risk involved in continuing with the scheme.\n\n**11. Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nProfessor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg115 of Hanotiau & van den Berg in Brussels, specializes in international arbitration. He was previously in private practice in the Netherlands and is a professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. Respondent retained Professor Van den Berg to provide an expert opinion addressing the legality under Dutch law of the 2005 transfer of Yukos' foreign assets into the Stichtings. Claimants chose not to cross-examine Professor Van den Berg.\n\nLegal Opinion on the Validity of Restructuring Devices under Dutch Law by Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg, 14 August 2012 (hereinafter \"Van den Berg Report\"). References to Professor Van den Berg's legal opinion appear in Chapter VIII.G (The Bankruptcy of Yukos).\n\n240.\n\nProfessor Van den Berg was provided with a 12-page Statement of Assumed Facts on which to base his opinion. These assumed facts may be summarized as follows. Before the auction of YNG in December 2004, Yukos' assets outside the Russian Federation (the \" **Foreign Assets** \") were held by two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Yukos, Yukos Finance B.V. (\" **Yukos Finance** \") and Yukos CIS Investment Limited (\" **Yukos CIS** \"). After the auction, Yukos management transferred the Foreign Assets to the two Stichtings, which issued depositary receipts in return to Yukos Finance and Wincanton Holding BV (\" **Wincanton** \"), a Dutch subsidiary of Yukos CIS. This restructuring had the \"stated purpose... to prevent the non-Russian assets of Yukos Oil from being used to satisfy the tax debts that Russian courts had found Yukos Oil to owe, and, more broadly, to prevent the non-Russian assets from being available to satisfy claims of Yukos' Russian creditors.\"\n\n241.\n\nUnder the Articles of Association of the Stichtings (amended in 2008), the management board, including former Yukos managers David Godfrey, Bruce Misamore and Steven Theede, manages the Foreign Assets in the interests of Yukos, its subsidiaries, shareholders, employees and \"legitimate\" creditors. As a result of the restructuring: (a) even after Yukos CIS and Yukos Finance were sold in Yukos' bankruptcy auction, the former Yukos managers have continued to manage and control the Foreign Assets; (b) the lending group under a USD 1 billion loan was unable to enforce an English judgment against Yukos Finance's assets; and (c) Moravel, whose loan had been held to be unenforceable by Russian courts because of its status as a subsidiary of Yukos, was able to negotiate the repayment of its loan from one of the Stichtings.\n\n242.\n\nBased on the above-described assumed facts, Professor Van den Berg opines that the restructuring of Yukos Finance and Yukos CIS was illegal, as Dutch law does not permit a company to transfer its assets for the purpose of making it more difficult for a creditor to satisfy its claims, or for the new ultimate parent company to exercise control. This is so even when a company believes the claims against it are illegitimate. The company is not entitled to exercise self-help.\n\n243.\n\nAccording to Professor Van den Berg, this illegality gave rise to the directors' \"internal liability\" (liability of the directors to the company itself) pursuant to Articles 2:8 and 2:9 of the Dutch Civil Code (the \" **DCC** \") and to the directors' \"external liability\" (liability of the directors to creditors) as well as \"company liability\" (liability of the company to creditors) pursuant to Article 6:162 of the DCC. Further, this illegality renders the board decisions regarding the restructuring voidable pursuant to Articles 2:8 and 2:15(1)(b) of the DCC (as contrary to the principles of reasonableness and fairness) and pursuant to Article 3:40(1) of the DCC (as contrary to \"good morals\"). Professor Van den Berg opines that the Stichtings are also disallowed as invalid permanent protective devices; even if they are treated as temporary protective devices, the requirements to uphold such temporary devices are not met in this case.\n\n**12. Professor Stef van Weeghel**\n----------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Respondent had raised the question of \"unclean hands\" in the jurisdictional phase of the case, an issue which the Tribunal decided to defer for consideration until the merits phase of the arbitration.116 During the jurisdictional phase of the case, Respondent had adduced expert testimony from Professor Stef van Weeghel,117 a professor of international tax law at the University of Amsterdam and a tax law partner at Stibbe. In his expert report, Professor Van Weeghel reached three main conclusions about Claimants and taxation law, as summarized in the Interim Awards.118 The Parties did not reference his report in their pleadings in the merits phase of the case and he was not cross-examined at the Hearing on the Merits. The Tribunal has decided to include in the Final Awards the summary of Professor Van Weeghel's expert evidence.\n\nInterim Award, Hulley \u00b6 435. *See also* Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3 of 8 September and 31 October 2006.\n\nExpert Report of Professor Stef van Weeghel, 29 January 2007, filed with Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. References to Professor Van Weeghel's Expert Report appear in Part X.E (Contributory Fault).\n\nInterim Awards, Hulley \u00b6\u00b6 191-97.\n\n245.\n\nAccording to Professor Van Weeghel, Hulley was not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits contained in the Cyprus-Russia DTA in respect of the Yukos dividends because: (a) Hulley had a permanent establishment in Russia under Article 10(4) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA) as it either had a place of management in Russia, or it had an agent in Russia; and (b) those dividends were attributable to the permanent establishment in Russia. He also opines that VPL was similarly not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits contained in the Cyprus-Russia DTA because it was not the beneficial owner of the Yukos dividends within the meaning of Article 10(2) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to Professor Van Weeghel, the Yukos holding structure is a sham or otherwise abusive under general principles of international tax law and designed specifically to avoid taxation obligations. Therefore rights to tax benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA should be denied. Tax authorities do not always have to accept artificial legal constructions. Anti-abuse doctrines to counter artificial legal constructions have developed in and are common to many countries including the Russian Federation and Cyprus. Professor Van Weeghel refers to the example of the Swiss Federal Court denying the benefits of a double taxation treaty to a Danish company in circumstances analogous to the Yukos holding structure. He refers to international efforts to control the use of tax havens and notes that the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax Practices in its 2000 Progress Report identified 35 tax havens which included the Isle of Man, Gibraltar, Jersey and the British Virgin Islands. Professor Van Weeghel examines the Yukos holding structure, and notes that at the bottom of the structure is the successful and profitable Russian oil company developing and exploiting natural energy resources in Russia, while at the top of the structure are a small number of Russian individual shareholders. He concludes that it is \"hardly perceivable\" that the Russian individual shareholders, in setting up the Yukos holding structure, had any other goal in mind than low taxation and lack of transparency in respect of the ownership of Yukos shares. Such a structure would normally fall within the scope of international efforts to counter the harmful use of tax havens.\n\n**C. THE SO-CALLED \"EMPTY CHAIRS\"**\n-----------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nAt the Hearing on the Merits, each side accused the other of leaving conspicuous \"empty chairs\" in its presentation of witness evidence. Each side asked the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the other from the absence of the persons who should have filled the empty chairs.119\n\n*See e.g.*, Transcript Day 2 at 98 (Claimants' opening); Respondent's Rebuttal Slides, p. 650 & ff; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 135.\n\n**1. Individuals that Claimants Wished were Available for Examination**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nAt the Hearing, Claimants submitted that the following individuals should have been called as witnesses by Respondent as they could have been cross-examined in respect of the knowledge of Yukos' tax structure by high-ranking Russian officials:\n\n\u2022 Aleksei Kudrin, First Deputy Minister of Finance, including in particular on the January 2000 meeting with Mr. Dubov at which the establishment of Yukos' trading companies in Mordovia was discussed;\n\n\u2022 Vladimir Gusev, First Deputy Minister in charge of VAT, including in particular on the meeting with Mr. Dubov at which Yukos' VAT refunds in Mordovia were discussed;\n\n\u2022 Alexander Pochinok, Tax Minister, including in particular on the December 1999 meeting with Mr. Dubov at which Yukos' plan to use trading companies in Mordovia was discussed;\n\n\u2022 Alexander Smirnov, First Deputy Minister of Tax, including in particular on the December 1999 meeting with Mr. Dubov; and\n\n\u2022 Nicolai Merkushkin, Head of the Republic of Mordovia, including in particular on the December 1999 meeting.120\n\nClaimants' Opening Slides, p. 300; Claimants' Closing Slides, p. 14.\n\n249.\n\nClaimants also argued that they should have had the opportunity to hear from and examine the following individuals in respect of their knowledge of Yukos' tax structure derived from the audits of Yukos' trading companies:\n\n\u2022 P. A. Puschin, Senior Tax Inspector of Russian Tax Ministry's Interregional Inspectorate for major Taxpayer No. 1; and\n\n\u2022 A.V. Ivushkina, Senior Tax Inspector of Russian Tax Ministry's Interregional Inspectorate for major Taxpayer No. 1.121\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n250.\n\nIn addition, Claimants complained that they did not have the opportunity to hear from and examine Sergei Bogdanchikov, the President of Rosneft, on the circumstances of Rosneft's acquisition of Baikal in December 2004 and Rosneft's agreement with a syndicate of Western banks led by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale S.A. (the \" **Western Banks** \") regarding the initiation of Yukos' bankruptcy.122\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n251.\n\nFinally, Claimants argued that they should have had the opportunity to hear from and examine the following individuals in respect of PwC's audit of Yukos and the circumstances of the withdrawal of PwC's audit reports:\n\n\u2022 Douglas Miller, Director, ZAO PwC Audit, including in particular regarding the work conducted for the purposes of the certification of Yukos' accounts for years 1998-2003 and the circumstances of the withdrawal of the reports in 2007; and\n\n\u2022 Michael Kubena, General Director, ZAO PwC Audit, including in particular regarding the establishment of Yukos' tax optimization structure and its legality.123\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**2. Individuals that Respondent Wished were Available for Examination**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nAt the Hearing, Respondent argued that the following individuals should have been made available for questioning with respect to: (a) the establishment and history of Yukos' \"tax optimization\" schemes and Yukos' understanding of their legality; (b) Yukos' relationship with its Lesnoy, Mordovian, and other \"sham\" trading shells; and (c) Yukos' reaction to the assessments against and criminal investigation of the Lesnoy and Trekhgorniy trading shells, including the restructurings and liquidations, the instructions to destroy documents, and other apparent attempts at obstruction:\n\n\u2022 Dmitry Gololobov, Yukos' former Deputy General Counsel;\n\n\u2022 Irina Golub, Yukos' former Chief Accountant;\n\n\u2022 Dmitry Maruev, former head of the Financial Engineering Section of Yukos Treasury Department (Deputy Chief Accountant);\n\n\u2022 Alexey Smirnov, former head of Yukos' Tax Department;\n\n\u2022 Vasily Shakhnovsky, GML shareholder/beneficiary and former President of Yukos-Moscow; and\n\n\u2022 Mikhail Brudno, GML shareholder/beneficiary.124\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Slides, pp. 655-56; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 136.\n\n253.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Mr. Golobolov, together with Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, Yukos' tax counsel, could also have addressed the following issues: (a) Yukos' unsuccessful attempts to obtain a legal opinion approving its \"tax optimization\" schemes, including why Mr. Pepeliaev did not provide a legal opinion to Yukos on the schemes prior to the 29 December 2003 tax audit report; (b) the bases for Yukos' responses and reactions to the 29 December 2003 tax audit report, and the bases on which outside counsel prepared its post-hoc opinions for Yukos on the \"tax optimization\" schemes; and (c) the reasons why Yukos tried to file \"annual\" amended VAT returns, and did not submit proper amended monthly VAT returns after the \"annual\" ones were rejected.125\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Slides, pp. 656-57; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 136.\n\n254.\n\nRespondent also argued that on the issue of Yukos' consideration of an enhanced ADR listing, including warnings that were provided to Yukos' senior management concerning the substantial risks of disclosing Yukos' \"tax optimization\" schemes in connection with such a listing, the failure to disclose Messrs. Khodorkovsky's and Lebedev's relationship to the BBS Companies, and Mr. Khodorkovsky's concerns for his own personal liability if he signed Yukos' F-1 Registration Statement, Claimants should have made available for testimony:\n\n\u2022 Pavel Malyi, former Deputy Head of Yukos' Corporate Finance Department; and\n\n\u2022 Oleg Sheiko, former Vice President/Director of Yukos' Corporate Finance Department.126\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Slides, pp. 658; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 136.\n\n255.\n\nOn issues relating to the understanding by Yukos' Russian management of the legality of Yukos' \"tax optimization\" scheme, Respondent complained about the absence of:\n\n\u2022 Yury Beilin, Yukos' former Deputy CEO; and\n\n\u2022 Simon Kukes, Yukos' former CEO.127\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n256.\n\nFinally, with respect to GML's \"sustained and aggressive threats that deterred broader participation in the YNG and bankruptcy auctions,\" Respondent wished they could have heard from and examined Mr. Tim Osborne, GML Director and member of the Stichtings' boards.128\n\nRespondent's Rebuttal Slides, pp. 659; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 136.\n\n**VII. ISSUES FOR ANALYSIS**\n----------------------------\n\n257.\n\nIn this second phase of the present arbitrations, the Parties presented their arguments and evidence on the many substantive issues related directly to the merits of the case under Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT. In addition, the Parties presented extensive argument on the two preliminary objections that the Tribunal had decided to defer to the merits phase, namely the objection based on Claimants' alleged \"unclean hands\" and the objection based on Article 21 of the ECT.\n\n258.\n\nThe deferred preliminary objections\u2014like the merits issues\u2014require the Tribunal to untangle the complex factual matrix underlying Claimant's claims. Indeed, the Tribunal had decided to defer the preliminary objections relating to alleged \"unclean hands\" and Article 21 to avoid making findings on these important questions in a vacuum.\n\n259.\n\nThis Award therefore begins, in Part VIII, with the Tribunal's analysis of the factual issues. Guided in large measure by the Parties' presentations of the issues, the Tribunal considers it convenient to analyze the evidentiary record under the following eight headings\n\nA. Yukos' Tax Optimization Scheme\n\nB. The Russian Federation's Tax Assessments\n\nC. Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests\n\nD. Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger\n\nE. Yukos' Attempts to Settle its Tax Liabilities\n\nF. Auction of YNG\n\nG. The Bankruptcy of Yukos\n\nH. The Withdrawal of PwC's Audit Opinions\n\n260.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Tribunal, in Part VIII, makes determinations in respect of the many highly contested issues of fact and observations on the significance of various facts and findings.\n\n261.\n\nNext, in Part IX of this Award, the Tribunal turns to Respondent's preliminary objections. Specifically, the Tribunal considers:\n\nA. whether all or some of Claimants' claims are barred by the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT (the Tribunal dismissed this objection in the Interim Awards, but Respondent has renewed the objection in this merits phase);\n\nB. whether Claimants' conduct\u2014their alleged \"unclean hands\"\u2014deprives Claimants of protection under the ECT (in the Interim Awards, the Tribunal confirmed the deferral of its decision on this objection to the merits phase of this arbitration, consistent with Procedural Order No. 3); and/or\n\nC. whether Article 21 of the ECT, which contains a \"carve out\" for \"Taxation Measures\", bars the Claimants' claims either as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility (in the Interim Awards, the Tribunal decided to defer these issues to the merits phase, to avoid ruling on them in a vacuum).\n\n262.\n\nSince the Tribunal dismisses each of Respondent's preliminary objections, thereby confirming that it has jurisdiction over Claimants' claims under the ECT, it next addresses Respondent's liability under the ECT. This analysis is undertaken in Part X of the Award.\n\n263.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent, by conducting investigations and legal proceedings against Yukos, its subsidiaries, and their management, has failed to accord Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment. In particular, Claimants allege Respondent failed to refrain from impairing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of Claimants' investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, in contravention of Article 10 of the ECT. Claimants maintain that the treatment of Yukos was discriminatory as compared to other Russian oil companies.\n\n264.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent's actions amount to an expropriation of the Claimants' investments, in breach of Article 13 of the ECT. According to Claimants, the alleged interventions of Respondent, and other entities directed and controlled by it\u2014including in the Sibneft demerger, the sale of YNG at a cost alleged to be much lower than its real value to Baikal (a special purpose company that was quickly bought by the State-owned oil company Rosneft) and the pursuit of Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings\u2014resulted in the total loss of value of Claimants' investments.\n\n265.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent's actions were politically and economically motivated, rather than aimed at legitimate tax enforcement. In that regard, Claimants purport to establish that Respondent acted through almost all its organs, at all levels, in seeking the destruction of Yukos.\n\n266.\n\nIn response, Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to establish a violation under either Articles 10 or 13 of the ECT. For Respondent, this case is about Yukos' tax evasion,129 and therefore about Yukos' self-inflicted demise: Respondent contends that any losses suffered by Claimants are attributable to their own actions, those of the Yukos managers they installed and allegedly controlled, and of Messrs. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Nevzlin, Dubov, Brudno, Shakhnovsky and Golubovitch (the so-called \" **Oligarchs** \"). It follows, argues Respondent, that Claimants had no legitimate expectation that Russian tax law would not be applied to them and their investment when Yukos breached its tax obligations.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1.\n\n267.\n\nIn addition to lacking the factual predicate for an expropriation claim under Article 13 of the ECT, Respondent also contends that Claimants' claims fail because the assessment and collection of taxes is in the public interest, as to which States are afforded a wide margin of discretion. Respondent maintains that its conduct in this regard did not radically depart from either Russian law or international norms.\n\n268.\n\nTo the extent that Claimants allege discriminatory taxation compared to other Russian oil companies\u2014in contravention of the fair and equitable treatment in Article 10 of the ECT, as well as one of Article 13's four conditions for a lawful expropriation\u2014Respondent answers that these claims fail because Claimants do not contend that their investment was subjected to discrimination based on foreign ownership. Respondent also disputes the facts presented by Claimants in support of their allegations of discrimination.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimants' allegations of due process violations with respect to tax, tax enforcement, the sale of YNG and Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings are equally meritless, and, in any event, did not affect the management and operations of Yukos.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusions on these liability issues, in Part X, follow necessarily as the legal consequences of its factual conclusions in Part VIII. The Tribunal includes in Part X its decision on the attribution of the conduct of various actors to the Russian Federation, and its findings in relation to Claimant's contributory fault.\n\n271.\n\nFinally, in Parts XI, XII and XIII of this Award, respectively, the Tribunal decides the issues relating to interest, the quantification of damages, and the allocation of costs.\n\n**VIII. ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE TAX OPTIMIZATION SCHEME**\n----------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n272.\n\nIn the latter years of the twentieth century and in the early years of the twenty first, oil companies in the Russian Federation were growing, consolidating and becoming large corporate entities. By the end of 2000, there were nine major oil companies in Russia. Yukos was the largest, followed by Lukoil. During that period, all nine major oil companies operated in a similar fashion. The key features of their operations were firstly vertical integration; secondly transfer pricing; and thirdly the use of low-tax regions to mitigate tax burdens.130 In relation to the third element, one-time Prime Minister of Russia, Mikhail Kasyanov stated that \"the tax havens in the ZATOs had been used by every oil company.\"131 In fact,\n\n[t]housands of companies took advantage of the low-tax regimes available in Russian tax havens zones, including businesses engaged in construction, services, the sale of oil products, investments, as well as holding companies and groups of companies involved in financing and taxation arrangements. This activity was well known to the Russian government, including the Federal Tax Ministry.132\n\nTranscript of Mikhail Kasyanov before the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow in the Second Criminal Case Brought Against Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev, 24 May 2010, p. 3, Exh.

C-577.\n\n273.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that the majority of large Russian oil companies operated in a way similar to Yukos and did \"use low-tax regions to evade taxes.\" At the same time, Respondent alleges that those companies did so \"on a much more modest scale in comparison to Yukos.\"133\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 12.\n\n274.\n\nIn this sense, Yukos was a typical Russian oil company, as it also used the low-tax regions as part of its tax optimization strategy. A central disputed issue in this arbitration concerns the legality, under Russian law, of the modalities of Yukos' use of the low-tax regions. Was Yukos merely taking advantage of the legislative arrangements in place to minimize its taxes, or was there an element of abuse in its scheme? A related disputed issue concerns the legitimacy of the tax assessments against Yukos that began in December 2003. Was the Russian Federation merely enforcing its tax laws, or rather was it carrying out a punitive campaign against Yukos and its principal beneficial owners? Were the other Russian oil companies subjected to the same tax enforcement actions by the Russian Federation, or was Yukos discriminated against and specifically targeted by the Russian Federation? Before turning to the question of the legitimacy of those tax assessments, which the Tribunal does in the next chapter of the Award, the Tribunal considers it important to address the first question: were Yukos' practices in the low-tax regions, and specifically the practices of Yukos' trading companies in those regions, lawful?\n\n275.\n\nIn sections 2 and 3 of this chapter, the Tribunal summarizes the evidence that was presented by the Parties regarding the structure and legal framework of Yukos' tax optimization scheme. In section 4, the Tribunal distills, as best it can from the massive documentary record, the complex and extensive background relating to the activities and audits of the Yukos trading entities before December 2003. Finally, in section 5, the Tribunal reviews, on the basis of this complex record, the legality of Yukos' tax optimization scheme under Russian law.\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it considers the question of the legality of the tax optimization scheme to be a matter of fact in the present arbitration. It is not the role of the Tribunal in the present proceedings to review and determine, as if it were a Russian court of appeal, the decisions made pursuant to Russian law in respect of the legality of this scheme. However, even in considering the issue as a matter of fact, the Tribunal's observations on the legality of Yukos' tax optimization scheme based on what the record reveals will inform its decision on the principal legal questions facing the Tribunal under the ECT.\n\n**2. The Structure of the Tax Optimization Scheme**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with an enormous volume of material relating to Yukos' structure and tax optimization scheme. In short, Yukos' tax optimization scheme consisted of using \"trading companies\" located in the low-tax regions as intermediaries in the chain of transactions between Yukos' core oil-producing entities YNG, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft at one end, and its customers at the other. The trading companies at issue were established in three types of low-tax regions. The first type was closed administrative territories, or ZATOs (Lesnoy, Trekhgorny, Sarov). ZATOs are territories established in the former Soviet Union as defense and nuclear sites, or as sites with sensitive military, scientific or industrial significance which faced economic catastrophe at the end of the Cold War. For this reason, special tax regimes were instituted in those territories aimed at boosting economic activity.134 The second type was \"domestic-offshore territories\", regions that faced significant economic challenges and where the Russian Federation wanted to facilitate investment (Mordovia, Evenkia, Kalmykia).135 The third low-tax region was Baikonur, a former spaceport, which was treated as a ZATO but is on the territory of Kazakhstan.136\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 226, n.274. *Law of the Russian Federation No. 3297-1* of July 14, 1992, \"On Closed Administrative Territorial Entity,\" Exh.

So there are three categories [of low-tax region].\" Transcript, Day 14 at 54. *See also*, Decision of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 747, 25 October 2001, Exh. C-411.\n\n278.\n\nThe names of the trading entities of particular relevance in this arbitration and the regions or ZATOs in which they were located are set out in the following table:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Region or ZATO** | **Company** |\n| **Mordovia** | Alta-Trade Fargoil Macro-Trade Mars-XII (Energotrage) Ratmir Yukos-M Yu-Mordovia |\n| **Evenkia** | Evoil Interneft Petroleum-Trading Ratibor Yukos Vostok Trade |\n| **Kalmykia** | Siberian Transportation Company |\n| **Baikonur** | Mega-Alliance |\n| **ZATO Lesnoy** | Business-Oil Mitra Vald-Oil Forest Oil |\n| **ZATO Sarov** | Yuksar |\n| **ZATO Trekhgorny** | Grace Muskron |\n\n279.\n\nIn 2000, sales were conducted by at least 16 of these companies. From 2001 to 2003, Yukos employed at least eight such companies, and in 2004 at least three of them. Through this structure, Yukos was able to capture much of the profit from the sale of crude oil to its customers on the books of the entities in the low-tax regions, thus benefiting from substantial tax savings. Some of these after-tax profits, in turn, left the Russian Federation through dividends to the off-shore holding companies that Yukos controlled (for U.S. GAAP consolidation purposes) through trusts and call options.137\n\n*See* Lys Reports.\n\n**3. The Legal Framework of the Tax Optimization Scheme**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Low-Tax Region Program**\n----------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe low-tax region program was established in the 1990s to foster economic development in impoverished areas of the Russian Federation. The Russian low-tax regions were allowed to exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit taxfor the purpose of encouraging taxpayers' investments in their regions, provided the taxpayers complied with certain requirements. There is no dispute between the Parties as to the source of the formal requirements; it is agreed that they are to be found in the low-tax regions' legislation, any applicable tax investment agreements, and the applicable federal legislation, including the Russian Tax Code. More controversial, and contested by Claimants, is the existence and significance of various so-called \"anti-abuse\" doctrines which, according to Respondent, have been established and applied in decisions of Russia's federal courts. The Tribunal addresses these doctrines and the relevant jurisprudence in the next subsection.\n\n281.\n\nThe benefits provided in the low-tax regions were related to profit tax, which was described by Mr. Konnov in his first report as follows:\n\n29. Profit tax is a federal tax, however tax revenues are shared between the federal, regional and (in certain years) local budgets. Through the end of 2001, profit tax was governed by the Law of the Russian Federation No. 2116-1 \"On Tax on Profit of Enterprises and Organisations\" dated December 27, 1991 (the \"Profit Tax Law\") and subsequently by Chapter 25 of the Tax Code. In 1999-2006, profit tax rates applicable to Russian entities and foreign entities having a permanent establishment in Russia (with respect to income attributable to such permanent establishments) were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Year** | **1999** | **2000** | **2001** | **2002** | **2003** | **2004** | **2005** | **2006** |\n| Rate of profit tax total, including: | 35% (30% after April 1) | 30% | 35% | 24% | 24% | 24% | 24% | 24% |\n| Rate of profit tax to the federal budget | 13% (11% after April 1) | 11% | 11% | 7.5% | 6% | 5% | 6.5% | 6.5% |\n| Rate of profit tax to the regional budget | 22% (19% after April 1) | 19% | 19% | 14.5% | 16% | 17% | 17.5% | 17.5% |\n| Rate of profit tax to the local budget |  |  | 5% | 2% | 2% | 2% |  |  |\n\n282.\n\nWith respect to the tax benefits available in the ZATOs (*e.g.*, Lesnoy and Trekhgorny), in 1999, the ZATOs were allowed to fully exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit tax. In 2000, most ZATOs were allowed to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*i.e.*, up to 19 percent). In 2001, all ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*i.e.*, also up to 19 percent). In 2002, however, these exemptions were revoked.\n\n283.\n\nWith respect to the tax benefits available in other low-tax regions (*e.g.*, Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia), in 2000 and 2001, such regions were allowed to fully exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (*i.e.*, up to 19 percent). From 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2003, low-tax regions were allowed to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget, but only up to four percent. An exception existed for \"grandfathered\" tax investment agreements entered into prior to 1 July 2001, and these taxpayers could still receive a zero percent tax rate on the relevant portion of the profit tax if they fulfilled certain other conditions. As of 1 January 2004, the existing tax investment agreements were terminated, but the Russian Tax Code still allowed low-tax regions to reduce the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget up to four percent.\n\n**(b) Anti-Abuse Decisions and Doctrines Promulgated by Russia's Federal Courts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nBefore considering the individual court decisions in which the anti-abuse doctrines are said to have been developed and applied, the Tribunal will describe the different courts within the judicial system of the Russian Federation.138\n\nThis information is derived from the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Exh. C-1698 (hereinafter \"Russian Constitution\") and other particulars in the public domain of interest to narration of the many decisions of the courts of the Russian Federation which the Tribunal reviews.\n\n285.\n\nThe Russian court system is based on four types of distinct judicial procedures\u2014constitutional, civil, administrative and criminal.139 Each area has created its own court structure. For its civil procedure, Russia created a system of commercial, or \"arbitrazh\" courts. The arbitrazh courts have jurisdiction over general commercial disputes and disputes directly relating to commercial matters, such as tax disputes. At the first instance, there are 81 arbitrazh courts, located in and for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.140 At the next level, the appellate instance, there are 20 appellate arbitrazh courts. Then, at the \"cassation instance,\" there are ten federal arbitrazh courts.141 At the apex of the Russian commercial courts system is the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation.142\n\nRussian Constitution, Article 118(2), Exh. C-1698.\n\nRussia as a federation consists of 83 \"constituent entities\"\u2014relatively autonomous territorial and political units. Most of them have their own constitutions, local laws, presidents, governments, parliaments, and court systems. Mordovia, for example, is a \"constituent entity\". The judicial districts usually match up with these autonomous territorial and political units, but there are several \"mismatches\": there are 83 \"constituent entities\" and only 81 first-instance arbitrazh courts.\n\nIn 2000, the Russian Federation created \"federal districts\", which are administrative units that group several \"constituent entities.\" Currently there are eight federal districts. Since there are ten federal arbitrazh courts but only eight federal districts, there is a \"mismatch\" there too. For example, the Siberian Federal District has two federal arbitrazh courts, which are the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the East Siberian District and the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the West Siberian District.\n\nIn late 2013, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation announced a judicial reform which would result in merging the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation with the Supreme Court, which is the apex of the general jurisdiction courts. The reform has not yet been finalized.\n\n286.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the local constitutional courts of its constituent entities are the courts created for Russia's constitutional procedure. Among its other functions, the Constitutional Court plays a supervisory role over all four Russian judicial procedures at the federal level; the local constitutional courts play the same role at the level of the constituent entities. The task of the Constitutional Court is to ensure compliance of the judiciary with the Constitution of the Russian Federation (\" **Russian Constitution** \").143 In this capacity, the Constitutional Court is the court of last resort, which decides whether a particular law applied by the courts of lower instance is constitutional. For example, an individual or a company may apply to the Constitutional Court in a tax matter when the individual or company considers that a particular provision of the Russian Tax Code applied by an arbitrazh court is not incompliance with the Russian Constitution. The decisions of the Constitutional Court are not subject to appeal.\n\nExh. C-1698. The Russian Constitution defines the level of autonomy of the \"constituent entities\" by assigning certain governance matters of federal importance to the federal bodies while allowing the remaining matters to be decided by the \"entities\". At the same time, the Russian Constitution does not allow the \"entities\" to act contrary to the Russian Federation even within the \"entity'\" assigned autonomy. For example, one of the tasks of the Constitutional Court is to ensure that the local laws of the \"entities\" are in compliance with the Russian Constitution and the federal laws.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the anti-abuse principle under Russian law.\n\n288.\n\nRespondent's expert on Russian law, Mr. Oleg Konnov, introduced the anti-abuse principle as follows:\n\nIt is essential to distinguish clearly between the legitimate use of the tax benefits and abuse of tax law. Russian law generally prohibits abuse of law. The constitutional anti-abuse principle has been incorporated in some branches of law (e.g. civil law). However, it has been consistently applied even in branches of law where no explicit provisions have been included in the text of the law, e.g. labour law and tax law. In these instances, Russian courts have themselves developed anti-abuse doctrines. In the tax area, anti-abuse doctrines have been used to combat aggressive tax planning and abuse.\n\nOne should not be misled by the terminology. Even though the term \"substance over form\" is not commonly used in Russia, the terms \"bad faith,\" \"abuse of rights,\" \"proportionality\" and \"business substance\" are used to achieve the same result as the \"substance over form\" notion in other countries.\n\nCourts (including the highest courts of Russia) accepted and consistently applied antiabuse measures both before and after the YUKOS tax cases. The anti-abuse doctrines have been evolving over the time. In some cases, the tax authorities challenged the abusive transactions based on the application of civil law principles (\"sham\" and \"fictitious\" transactions and transactions \"deliberately contrary to fundamentals of civil law and morality\"), and in others they applied the notions of \"bad faith\" and \"unjustified tax benefit\" developed by court practice. There were also cases in which the tax authorities used a combination of legal principles to challenge tax avoidance misconduct.144\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 45-47. Mr. Konnov cites: Article 17(3) of the Russian Constitution, Exh. R-2211; Resolution of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 3-P, 15 March 2005, section 4.3, Exh. R-2217 (as support for the proposition that the Constitutional Court describes non-abuse of law as a general legal principle); an assistant professor of the faculty of law of the Higher School of Economics Mr. Kurbatov, who writes: \"In general terms, antiabuse principle is set forth in Article 17 (3) of the Russian Constitution according to which exercise of rights and freedoms by citizens and individuals may not violate rights and freedoms of other persons. This principle is set forth in Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution governing rights and freedoms of citizens and individuals. However these rights and freedoms may be applied to legal persons to the extent their nature permits so (see, for instance, para. 1 Section 4 of dicta of the Constitutional Court Ruling No. 20-P dated December 17, 1996, para. 4 Section 2 of dicta of the Constitutional Court Ruling No. 24-P dated October 12, 1998).\" (A. Ya, Kurbatov, ABUSE OF LAW: THEORY AND COURT PRACTICE (Consultant Plus, 2009), Exh. R-2214). Mr. Kurbatov also writes: \"It would be fundamentally wrong to consider anti-abuse as only civil law (branch) principle. It may, however, be set in provisions of specific branches of law\"); Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation No. 2, 17 March 2004, at clause 27, Exh. R-2213 (\"If a court establishes the fact that the employee abused his rights, the court can dismiss his claim on reinstatement in a job... since in the specified case the employer should not be responsible for the adverse consequences resulting from the employee' bad faith actions.\"). *See also* V.V. Arkhipov, *Abuse of Rights in Labor Relations: Wilful Hoax or Honest Mistake?*, Zakonodatelstvo i Ekonomika, No. 2, 2008, Exh. R-2215; Civil Code of the Russian Federation, entered into force on 1 January 1995, Articles 10, 169, 170, Exh. R-909 (hereinafter \"Russian Civil Code\"). Mr. Konnov notes that in a number of cases Article 170 of the Civil Code was applied jointly with Article 169 of the Russian Civil Code.\n\n289.\n\nIn support of his assertion that the various anti-abuse doctrines are part of Russian law, Mr. Konnov relies on a series of decisions issued by various Russian courts, starting with the decision of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 367/96 on 17 September 1996 (\" ***Sibservice*** \") and including recent cases such as the 2010 *Novozlatoustovskoye* decision of the same court. Between these bookends, particular reliance is placed on Constitutional Court Ruling 138-0 of 25 July 2001 (which introduced the concept of \"bad-faith taxpayer\") and on Resolution No. 53 dated 12 October 2006 of the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court (\" **Resolution No. 53** \")(which linked the concepts of \"unjustified tax benefit\", \"actual economic substance\" of a transaction and the \"business purpose\" of a taxpayer's actions).\n\n290.\n\nAccording to Mr. Konnov, the cases upholding the tax assessments against Yukos (*i.e.*, confirming the tax authorities' position that Yukos' tax optimization scheme was abusive) were \"an integral part of the evolution of the \u2018business substance' doctrine which eventually resulted in adoption by the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court on 12 October 2006 of Resolution No. 53.\"145\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 49(p).\n\n291.\n\nClaimants argue that the \"business purpose\" doctrine could not possibly have played any role in the tax assessments against Yukos, since \"it did not exist in Russian law at the time, having only been introduced into Russian law in 2006\"146 (in Resolution No. 53 of the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court). Indeed, Claimants note, \"the notion of business purpose was never mentioned in the December 29, 2003 Audit Report and played no role in the tax assessments against Yukos.\"147\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 29.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal's task in evaluating the Parties' arguments is a difficult one. As with many aspects of this case, the record is voluminous and, in certain respects, contradictory. Moreover, regarding issues of Russian tax law, the Tribunal heard only from Mr. Konnov; Claimants put forward no testimony challenging Mr. Konnov's interpretation of the relevant cases from an expert on the subject. And, as discussed further below, Claimants' counsel chose not to crossexamine Mr. Konnov on the existence or evolution of the anti-abuse doctrines. At the same time, in argument, Claimants have challenged almost every aspect of Mr. Konnov's testimony, including on the existence and evolution of the anti-abuse doctrine.\n\n293.\n\nTherefore the Tribunal has had to delve into the voluminous record, including the translations of dozens of Russian court decisions and commentaries thereon, to come to its own view on what anti-abuse principles may have existed during the period relevant for an analysis of Yukos' tax optimization scheme.\n\n294.\n\nThe earliest cases relied upon by Respondent, from the mid-1990s, appear to rely on a \"substance over form\" doctrine. These cases include *Sibservice* and the Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 3661/96 on 21 January 1997 (\" ***Yekaterinburg Telephone*** \").\n\n295.\n\nMr. Konnov summarizes these cases as follows:\n\na. As early as in 1996, the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court reviewed a case involving the Russia-Austrian joint venture Sibservice. Sibservice was assembling and selling computers. Its sales of computers were subject to VAT. In order to defer or avoid VAT payment, Sibservice entered into loan agreements with customers under which the customers purportedly loaned funds to Sibservice, and Sibservice purportedly repaid the loans by transferring computers to the customers. Based on the letter of the law, the making of the loan and the repayment of the loan (unlike sale of computers) were exempt from VAT. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court focused on substance of the transactions between Sibservice and its customers and ruled that the sale of computers had been artificially structured using the loan agreements, thereby supporting the position of the tax authorities. Specifically, the Supreme Arbitrazh Court noted that:\n\n\"The conclusion of the state tax inspectorate that Joint Venture Sibservice supplied the goods on the condition of the prepayment of their price [is justified] since the relations with the customers (buyers) were actually developed that way (supply, contractor relationships) regardless of the name of the agreement.\"\n\nb. One year later, in 1997, the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court reviewed a case involving the state-owned enterprise *Yekaterinburg City Telephone Network.* In 1994, the state-owned enterprise had concluded what they claimed to be several joint venture agreements with private persons and legal entities according to which the participants allegedly agreed to cooperate for the purposes of developing the telephone network of the city of Yekaterinburg. The private persons and legal entities made what purported to be joint venture financing contributions to the state enterprise which they claimed were exempt from VAT and VAT surtax under the then applicable law. The tax authorities conducted a tax audit of the state enterprise and concluded that in practice no true joint venture activity had been conducted and, therefore, VAT and VAT surtax had to apply. The Presidium of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court supported this conclusion:\n\n\"In fact, those transactions have been made in order to raise financing from the relevant entities and individuals in order to finance the claimant's business.\"\n\nWith reference to this case, a group of prominent Russian scholars noted later that Russian tax law required that the tax consequences of a transaction or other arrangement be determined according to its substance rather than its form:\n\n\"... Therefore, the arbitrazh courts as well as the tax authorities currently follow the principle of \"substance of contract over its name (form)\". Thus, any attempts to conceal the real substance of an agreement by using a name of a different contract will most likely be fruitless.\"148\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b649(a)-(b) (citing Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation No. 367/96, 17 September 1996, Exh.

R-290).\n\n296.\n\nRespondent also refers to Constitutional Court Resolution No. 14-P, 28 October 1999 (\" ***Energomashbank*** \"), which, according to Respondent, \"reiterated the notion that when looking at the tax aspects of a particular transaction, Russian courts should be mindful of its substance, and not merely its form.\" Mr. Konnov describes the case as follows in his First Expert Report:\n\nd. Likewise in 1999 the Russian Constitutional Court in the *Energomashbank* case advised Russian courts to analyze the substance of transactions rather than their form:\n\n\"... in instances when the courts while examining a case fail to investigate in essence actual facts thereof but limit themselves to the establishment of formal conditions of the application of the law only, the right to judicial defence envisaged by Part 1 of Article 46 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation is found to be substantially infringed.\"149\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 49(d) (citing Resolution of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 14-P, 28 October 1999, Exh. R-293 (hereinafter \" *Energomashbank* \").\n\n297.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants write that the *Sibservice* and *Yekaterinburg Telephone* cases:\n\ninvolved the application of the principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code, which allows the tax authorities, in certain well-defined circumstances, to disregard the form of a particular transaction and to impose taxes based on the actual facts (*i.e.*, based on the actual transaction which occurred, or the fact that no such transaction occurred). Such cases can obviously offer no support to the Respondent's re-attribution theory. Neither at the time nor in these arbitrations has the Respondent sought to rely on Article 170. Moreover, as the Accounts Chamber emphasized in its 2002 report on Sibneft, apart from the transfer pricing rules under Articles 20 and 40 of the Russian Tax Code (which were also not used against Yukos), Article 170 is the only basis under Russian law to challenge relations or transactions between companies as being \"shams\" or \"fictitious\", refuting the Respondent's claim that such theories as the \"bad faith taxpayer\" concept conferred authority to re-attribute revenues between companies.150\n\nReply \u00b6 234 (citing Russian Civil Code, Part I, Article 170, Exh.

C-1282).\n\n298.\n\nClaimants also challenge the relevance of the *Energomashbank* ruling:\n\nIf that case has any relevance to these arbitrations, it is as a wholesale condemnation of the tax authorities' formalistic approach to VAT, divorced from the actual facts, as in breach of Yukos' constitutional rights. The constitutional issue in the case was the taxpayer's right to a fair opportunity to defend itself against tax claims by the State before a court, and the Constitutional Court held that respect for this right meant that courts could not limit their inquiry to purely \"formal conditions\", but rather must examine the actual facts.151\n\nReply \u00b6 236. (Original footnote omitted.)\n\n299.\n\nPutting aside, for the moment, the *remedy* of re-attribution in the case of a finding of abuse, which the Tribunal considers in Chapter VIII.B of the present Award (in connection with the tax assessments themselves), the question here is whether the decisions cited by Respondent support the *existence* of a judicial anti-abuse doctrine in tax cases.\n\n300.\n\nRespondent insists that they do. Focusing specifically on the *Sibservice* and *Yekaterinburg Telephone* cases, Respondent characterizes these decisions of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court as demonstrating that Russian courts have recognized and applied anti-abuse rules in the tax area to combat aggressive tax planning and abuse since at least 1996.152 In its Rejoinder, Respondent dismisses Claimants' comments on these cases as \"misleading\":\n\nClaimants misleadingly suggest that Respondent's reliance on the 1996 *Sibservice* decision and the 1997 *Yekateringburg City Telephone Network* decision *\"involve[s] the application of principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code\"*.... But nowhere in these decisions do the courts rely on, or even mention, Article 170 of the Civil Code. Rather, in both the Supreme Arbitrazh Court upheld the tax authorities' assessments by looking at the substance of the challenged transaction, as opposed to its form.153\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 648.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 648, n.987.\n\n301.\n\nBased on its review of these cases, the Tribunal observes that Respondent's submission appears to be well-founded. Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code provides as follows:\n\nArticle 170. Invalidity of Mock and Sham Transactions\n\n1. A mock transaction, i.e., a transaction made only for appearances without an intent to create the legal consequences corresponding to it, is void.\n\n2. A sham transaction, i.e., a transaction that is made for the purpose of hiding another transaction, is void. The rules relating to the transaction that the parties actually had in mind, shall be applied, taking into account the nature of the case.\n\nHowever, there is no mention of Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code in either of the *Sibservice* or *Yekaterinburg* decisions in the record of this arbitration.154 Based on this record, it appears to the Tribunal that the Supreme Arbitrazh Court is relying in these cases on a general doctrine of substance over form. The Tribunal further observes that such a doctrine seems entirely consistent with the principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code. It also seems consistent, in a general way, with the anti-abuse principle that Mr. Konnov says existed in the Russian Constitution, even though the Tribunal notes that no authority was brought to its attention in which this principle was expressly extended into the area of tax.155\n\nThe Tribunal observes that there appear to be at least six other decisions in the procedural history of these two cases, and that these are not in the record.\n\nThe authorities cited by Mr. Konnov demonstrate only that the constitutional anti-abuse principle (*i.e.*, persons should not violate other persons' rights and freedoms in exercising their own rights and freedoms) has been extended to the area of labour law. *See generally* First Konnov Report \u00b6 45, n.64, 66 (authorities cited therein).\n\n302.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent cannot draw much support from the *Energomashbank* decision. It appears to the Tribunal that, while the Constitutional Court referred to the importance of investigating the \"actual facts\" of a case as opposed to confirming \"the establishment of formal conditions of the application of the law only,\" it did so in the context of highlighting substance over form as an important feature of \"the right to judicial defense\" of a taxpayer against the claims of the tax authorities, not as a basis for tax authorities to challenge taxpayers. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the *Energomashbank* decision is not inconsistent with the application of the substance over form doctrine by the tax authorities against a taxpayer's scheme.\n\n303.\n\nAnother doctrine invoked by Respondent is known as the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine, or sometimes as the \"good faith taxpayer\" doctrine. This doctrine, submits Respondent, is rooted in the jurisprudence of the Russian Constitutional Court, notably Constitutional Court Ruling No. 24-P of 12 October 1998156 and Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O of 25 July 2001.157 In his First Expert Report, Mr. Konnov summarizes the significance of these cases as follows:\n\nc. In 1998, the Russian Constitutional Court introduced the concept of good/bad faith taxpayers. In 2001, the Russian Constitutional Court held that bad faith taxpayers would not be entitled to the same level of protection as good faith taxpayers.\n\nMr. Savseris in his book \"Bad Faith Category In Tax Law\" states:\n\n\"The criterion of bad faith taxpayer was chosen by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation in order to distinguish legitimate tax planning and illegal tax evasion.\n\n\u2026\n\nSince the adoption of the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 138-0 the criterion of bad faith has become an independent criterion for settlement of disputes on many categories of cases.\"158\n\nRuling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 24-P, 12 October 1998, Exh. R-2212.\n\nRuling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 138-O, 25 July 2001, Exh. R-307.\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 49(c) (citing Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 24-P, 12 October 1998, at Exh. R-2212; Resolution of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 138-0, 25 July 2001, Exh. R-307; S.V. Savseris, *Bad Faith Category in Tax Law*, Statut, 2007, pp. 42, 46, Exh. R-2218. He also refers to another illustration offered by Professor D.V Vinnitsky, *The Principle of Good Faith and Abuse of Right in Taxation*, Pravo i Ekonomika, No. 1, January 2003, Exh. R-2219 (\"the tax legislation does not directly use the notion \"good faith\" as a necessary criterion for assessing activity of tax relations party. However, this is not to say that tax law is indifferent to this principle. In contrast, for this branch of law \"good faith\" is a fundamental principle to be used in the resolution of disputes and execution of certain tax law provisions.\"). Mr. Konnov notes that bad faith is one of the anti-abuse doctrines which was applied either on a stand-alone basis or together with other doctrines in the Yukos case. In many cases, the term \"bad faith\" was used along with other anti-abuse terms, such as \"proportionality\", \"unjustified tax benefit\" or \"abuse of rights.\" According to Mr. Konnov, during the period in question there were a number of non-Yukos cases where the tax authorities applied the concept of bad faith to disallow tax benefits, and the courts upheld their actions. Specifically, between 2001 and 2005 the concept of bad faith was applied in the following number of court cases: (i) 2001\u2014262 court cases; (ii) 2002\u2014644 court cases; (iii) 2003\u20141,189 court cases; (iv) 2004\u20142,235 court cases; (v) 2005\u20143,737 court cases. (citing also S.V. Savseris, *Bad Faith Category in Tax Law*, Statut, 2007 p. 47, Exh. R-310). According to Mr. Konnov, another prominent Russian scholar Arkady Bryzgalin in 2001 distinguished four methods which could be applied by the state to combat tax evasion, including doctrines of \"substance over form\" and \"business substance.\" (citing *Methodology of Tax optimization*, Tax and Tax Law Journal, 2001, No. 1, at p. 26, Exh. R-2283).\n\n304.\n\nClaimants do not deny the existence of the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine,159 but argue that its origins and subsequent application by the Russian courts suggest that it has only a \"limited role\" in Russian law.160 The Tribunal considers it important to set out Claimants' position, as articulated at paragraphs 218 to 224 of their Reply, in full:\n\n218. The phrase \"good faith taxpayer\" first appeared in the inoperative part of a decision of the Constitutional Court arising out of the 1998 financial crisis, during which many tax payments never reached the Treasury because the banks through which such payments were sent had become insolvent. When the funds did not arrive, the tax authorities simply confiscated the unreceived payments directly from the taxpayers' accounts. The Court concluded that the constitutional obligation to pay taxes is fulfilled and the tax is deemed \"paid\" at the moment when the funds are debited from the taxpayer's account and that it would be improper to hold the taxpayer liable for the banks' failure to retransmit those funds to the State. In these circumstances, the Court held that a second collection of these \"paid\" taxes would be inconsistent with constitutionally protected property rights.\n\n219. In 2001, the Tax Ministry asked the Constitutional Court to clarify its earlier decision, in particular, whether the rule (that a taxpayer's constitutional duty to pay taxes ceases when the funds are debited from its account) applied even if the taxpayer deliberately contrived, in bad faith, to use an insolvent bank in order to evade taxes. In the resulting decision, the Russian Constitutional Court held that \"the conclusions which are contained in the motivational and operative parts of the [1998] Ruling do not extend to the dishonest taxpayers, and recovery by enforcement in the manner established by law from dishonest taxpayers of taxes not coming into the budget does not violate the constitutional guarantees of the right of private ownership\". This decision introduced the concept of \"bad faith taxpayer\" into Russian law.\n\n220. Since introducing this novel doctrine, the Constitutional Court has been called on to address its proper scope on a few occasions, and has consistently imposed limits.\n\n221. In its decision of October 16, 2003, for example, the Court for the first time recognized the possibility of the doctrine's application in a context other than tax payments through failed banks, in particular, in relation to claims for VAT refunds for exports. However, the Court emphasized the limited nature of this extension, recalling that, under Article 57 of the Russian Constitution and Article 3(7) of the Tax Code, \" law enforcement authorities may not construe the concept of \u2018good faith tax payer' as imposing on the tax payer additional obligations which are not provided for in the legislation \". The Russian Constitutional Court reiterated this limiting principle in a 2005 decision and specifically criticized the Moscow Arbitrazh Court's sweeping attempt to \"universalize\" the concept so as to circumvent express statutory provisions in the context of the Yukos case.\n\n222. In sum, in its limited endorsement of a \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine, the Russian Constitutional Court has at all times clearly indicated that any such doctrine was subordinate to, and controlled by, relevant Constitutional and statutory provisions.\n\n223. The primacy and supremacy of Constitutional and statutory provisions over the \"bad faith taxpayer\" concept have since been reaffirmed by the Presidium of the Highest Arbitrazh Court in a decision wholly rejecting, in circumstances unrelated to the Yukos affair but involving tax claims against another oil company, the approach of the Moscow Arbitrazh Courts in the Yukos cases and emphasizing that \" courts should assess arguments of tax authorities with respect to underpayment of taxes with consideration of specific statutory provisions rather than such subjective concepts as \u2018bad-faith taxpayer '\".\n\n224. Accordingly, there was nothing in the \"bad faith taxpayer\" concept introduced by the Russian Constitutional Court that could have permitted the tax authorities to reattribute revenues between taxpayers or otherwise disregard directly applicable statutory provisions and impose additional, unwritten obligations beyond those contained in the legislation.161\n\nReply \u00b6 217, n.368.\n\n*Ibid* at \u00b6 217.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 218-24 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).\n\n305.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent dismisses Claimants' suggestion that the Constitutional Court has limited the application of the doctrine since it arose in 1998, notably through its decisions since 2003:\n\n661. Contrary to Claimants' allegations, the Constitutional Court in 2003 was not \"called on to address\" the \"scope\" of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine, much less to \"limit[]\" it, but rather to adjudicate a complaint that had been raised in connection with the tax authorities' denial of a refund of input VAT based on the taxpayer's bad-faith conduct. Thus, the Constitutional Court confirmed its earlier holdings, including its 1998 ruling, reiterating that \"in the sphere of fiscal relations, there shall be a presumption of good faith\" in favor of taxpayers, which the authorities bear the burden of rebutting. The Court also noted that the authorities \"may not construe the concept of \u2018good-faith taxpayer' as imposing on the taxpayer additional obligations which are not provided for in the legislation.\"\n\n662. Claimants' self-serving reliance on this quotation -- which they extract from its allimportant context -- is misplaced. It is clear from this ruling that the Court did not at all intend to \"limit\" the scope of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine, but rather to clarify that a taxpayer's good or bad faith must be determined on a case-by-case basis, upon \"review of all the circumstances of the particular case.\" That is exactly what the tax authorities and courts did with respect to Yukos. Specifically, the Constitutional Court explained that:\n\n\"[t]he determination of the complainant's good or bad faith in the performance of its tax obligations and realisation of its rights to the reimbursement of amounts of tax deductions is connected with the establishment and review of the factual circumstances of the particular case and falls under the jurisdiction of the arbitrazh courts.\"\n\n663. That the Court did not intend to limit the scope of the doctrine as formulated in its earlier jurisprudence is also apparent from its actual holding:\n\n\"Based on the above [...] the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation ruled: 1. The complaint of OOO Export-Service shall not be accepted for examination because the subject matter of the application to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation was earlier clarified in a decision which is still in force.\"\n\n664. In sum, neither in this nor in other later rulings has the \"Constitutional Court [\u2026] suggested that the bad faith-taxpayer doctrine could not be used to combat abusive arrangements such as those used by YUKOS.\"162\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 661-64 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal has read and reviewed the many Constitutional Court decisions that form the backbone of the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine in Russian law as well as papers of various Russian legal scholars. The Tribunal has formed the view that, during the period relevant for the tax assessments against Yukos from 2003 to 2004, the doctrine consisted mainly of the following principles:\n\n\u2022 the good faith (honesty) of the taxpayer is presumed;163\n\n\u2022 the tax authorities have the burden of proving the taxpayer\u2019s bad faith (dishonesty), and in doing so \"may not construe the concept of \u2018good faith taxpayer' as imposing on the taxpayer additional obligations which are not provided for in the legislation\";164\n\n\u2022 in the case of a bad-faith (dishonest) taxpayer, the tax authorities have an \"obligation... [to] ensure protection of the State's interests, including using mechanisms of judicial protection\";165 and\n\n\u2022 the determination of the taxpayer's good or bad faith in the performance of its tax obligations and realization of its rights to the reimbursement of amounts of tax deductions is connected with the establishment and review of the factual circumstances of the particular case and falls under the jurisdiction of the arbitrazh courts.166\n\nConstitutional Court Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 138-O \u00b6 2 of the Motivational Part, 25 July 2001, Exh.

However, even a bad-faith taxpayer cannot be deprived of its *constitutional* rights or of statutory rights *that guarantee* the taxpayer's constitutional rights.168\n\nReply \u00b6 222.\n\nConstitutional Court Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 36-O of 18 January 2005 \u00b6 3 of the Motivational Part, Exh. C-1140. In that case, at issue was Yukos' complaint that the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had failed to grant Yukos the benefit of the statute of limitations (contained in Article 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (hereinafter \"Russian Tax Code\")) on the basis that Yukos was a \"bad-faith taxpayer\". The Constitutional Court dismissed Yukos' complaint on jurisdictional grounds, but opined in *dicta* that Ruling No. 138-O \"cannot serve as a ground for depriving the applicant of the guarantees established by Article 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.\" Earlier in its decision, the court had noted that Article 113 is a guarantee of a taxpayer's constitutional rights.\n\n308.\n\nHaving reviewed and stated its observations on the important Constitutional Court cases, the Tribunal turns now to the Parties' arguments based on the principal arbitrazh court cases on which Respondent relies. Although Mr. Konnov refers to dozens of other specific cases,169 and alludes generally to \"thousands of bad faith cases adjudicated in the relevant period,\"170 Respondent places particular emphasis on the *Sibirskaya* case171 and Resolution No. 53 of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court.172 Claimants, for their part, emphasize a Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District of 5 June 2002 (the \" ***Pribrezhnoye*** \" case).173 The Tribunal considers this case in the next chapter of its Award since it relates more directly to the application of any anti-abuse doctrine to circumstances similar to those that are at issue in the present case, rather than to the existence of any anti-abuse doctrine.\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 49(e)-(s).\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6 13.\n\n*Sibirskaya*, Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Caucasian District, Case No. F08-1678/2002-614A, 20 May 2002, Exh.

See also discussion at paragraph 645 below.\n\n309.\n\nMr. Konnov describes the *Sibirskaya* case as follows:\n\ni. In May 2002, OOO *Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya* (\"Sibirskaya\"), which was later found to be a Domestic Offshore Company, lost a cassation appeal before the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Caucasian District. Like YUKOS two years later, Sibirskaya argued that it had complied with the letter of the Kalmykian law. The tax authorities and courts, however, concluded that Sibirskaya was a bad faith taxpayer and that the tax benefits granted to it were manifestly disproportionate (0.4%) to the amount of investment made by Sibirskaya:\n\n\"Such investments neither have any effect on the economy nor cover any of the losses of the budget relating to the granting of tax incentives to taxpayers. On the contrary, those investments result in unjust enrichment (saving) of funds at the expense of budgetary funds. Therefore, being aware of a clear disproportion between the amount of investment and the amount of the tax incentives applied, the claimant has abused its right, i.e., the claimant acted in bad faith.\"174\n\nThe Tribunal notes that no further appeals appear to have been made in this case. During his cross-examination, Mr. Konnov observed that the amount at stake in *Sibirskaya* (around USD 200,000) \"was peanuts.\"175\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 49(i) (citing Resolution of Federal Arbitrazh Court of North-Caucasian District No. F08-1678/2002-614A, 20 May 2002, at Exh.

Mr. Konnov further speculated when he testified that Yukos may have \"preferred, after having the loss, [to] immediately make the payment and not to take this case forward.\" Transcript, Day 14 at 214.\n\n310.\n\nRespondent argues that the *Sibirskaya* case is one of \"numerous cases [in which] the courts ruled against taxpayers on the basis that disproportion between the tax benefits granted to the taxpayer and amounts of investment into the relevant low-tax region economy is an indication of an abuse of rights and evidence of the bad faith of the taxpayer.\"176 Although *Sibirskaya* involved a Yukos-related entity, Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya, Respondent argues that \"the tax authorities did not realize the connection of that company with Yukos at the time.\"177\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 997, n.1561 (citing Resolutions of Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Caucasian District, Case No. F08-1682/2002-623A, 21 May 2002, Exh.

The decision does appear indeed to stand alone and, as far as the Tribunal can tell, was not followed subsequently. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Konnov's opinion, it was not Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya that \"lost\" an appeal at the cassation level of the arbitrazh court, suggesting that the tax authorities had been successful at all other levels. In fact, the company had actually prevailed in the earlier decisions on this issue.180 Those judgments are not in the record. In addition, Claimants underline that, during his expert testimony in the *Quasar de* *Valores SICAV S.A. et al. v. The Russian Federation* (\" ***Quasar*** \") arbitration proceedings, Mr. Konnov disclaimed reliance on the \"proportionality\" requirement.181\n\nResolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Caucasian District No. F08-1678/2002-614A, 20 May 2002 p. 1, Exh.

R-3383 (hereinafter \" *Quasar* \").\n\n313.\n\nAs is apparent from the many cases reviewed above, Russian courts did consider and rule on tax-related cases before they were seized of the dispute involving the tax assessments against Yukos, including in the \"anti-abuse\" area.\n\n314.\n\nRespondent also raised a 2006 ruling of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court known as Resolution No. 53. In principle cases decided *after* the Yukos tax assessments and decisions should not be relevant for ascertaining the state of the law at the time of those assessments and decisions. However, in view of Respondent's argument that Resolution No. 53 represents the end point of the *evolution* of the anti-abuse doctrine in the Russian courts, the decision is of interest to the Tribunal in ascertaining the state of the law on the anti-abuse doctrines not only after, but also before and during the Yukos tax assessments.\n\n315.\n\nIn Resolution No. 53, the Supreme Arbitrazh Court set out to ensure greater uniformity in its evaluation of the \"justifiability\" of tax benefits received by the taxpayer by setting out straightforward interpretations of certain doctrines. As a starting point, it reaffirmed that the good faith of the taxpayer was presumed and that the tax authority had the burden to prove the facts upon which it relies in making its determinations. It noted that benefits may be considered unjustified when transactions are recorded without reflecting their true nature or are concluded without a business purpose or connection to economic activity. In such situations, the court would determine the rights and obligations of the taxpayer on the basis of the actual economic substance of a transaction. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court noted, however, that no adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that there was another, less beneficial way to conduct a transaction. It laid out four scenarios which may \"point to\" an unjustified tax benefit, and nine factors which, taken by themselves, may not constitute grounds to find a tax benefit unjustified. However, taken in concert with other factors, they may be considered as evidence of an improperly obtained benefit. Finally, it stated that a court should \"establish the existence of economic or other reasons (business purpose) in the taxpayer's actions subject to evaluation of circumstances evidencing its intent to obtain an economic effect as a result of actual business or economic activity.\" It held that the tax benefit itself could not be considered an independent business purpose: \"Therefore, if the court determines that the main purpose pursued by the taxpayer was obtaining of income exclusively or predominantly out of the tax benefit and there was no intention to carry out actual economic activity, the tax benefit may be disallowed.\"182\n\nResolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation No. 53, 12 October 2006, p. 3, Exh. R-1475 (hereinafter \"Resolution No. 53\").\n\n316.\n\nMany articles on Resolution No. 53 have been written by Russian tax scholars and practitioners. Two in particular are cited by Mr. Konnov.183 Both articles underline the importance of Resolution No. 53, although they reach different conclusions regarding the novelty of its content. One article by Mr. Y.M. Lermontov concludes that Resolution No. 53 was an innovation in Russian tax law: \"[t]he concept of the \u2018bad-faith' of the taxpayer has been eliminated by Resolution No. 53,\" and instead other doctrines have been \"incorporated into the regulatory framework.\"184 Mr. Lermontov notes that in the past, \"the judicial practice concerning the treatment of taxpayers as those of good faith and of bad faith in these matters used to be inconsistent,\" and that as a result of Resolution No. 53, more specific doctrines such as \"business purpose\", \"substance over form\" and \"economic justifiability\" were substituted in its place.185\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6 80, n.133.\n\nY.M. Lermontov, *Commentary to the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 53*, Exh. R-3266.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n317.\n\nThe other commentary was written by Messrs. A.V. Bryzgalin and V.V. Goryunov.186 For these authors, the doctrine affirmed in Resolution No. 53 represents less of a break with the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine that existed at the time of the Yukos assessments. Instead, they see Resolution No. 53 as *linking* the \"business purpose\" doctrine to the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine. The authors note that bad faith of the taxpayer was \"considered for the first time... [in] N 138-0 regarding dubious schemes for payment of taxes through \u2018problem banks.'\" The authors further note that since the doctrine had not been \"directly provided for in the law,\" it created \"uncertainty\" leading to \"considerable complications for... taxpayers, but also for the judges.\" Prior to Resolution No. 53, the authors write, \"no criteria in this area existed at all, and the question of bad faith was completely dominated by judicial discretion.\" For the authors, Resolution No. 53 represents a \"positive step\" in which the Supreme Arbitrazh Court \"attempted to establish specific indications of bad faith of taxpayers, characteristic features and approximate examples of permissible and impermissible conduct.\" The authors suggest that the change from \"bad faith\" to \"unjustified tax benefit\" is more a matter of terminology than doctrine. The authors write that \"despite the substitution of terms... the concept of an unjustified tax benefit is illustrated in Resolution N[o]. 53 by what used to be called bad-faith behavior of taxpayers.\"\n\nA.V.

R-3267.\n\n318.\n\nThe link between these doctrines was made, as early as 2002, in a commentary on Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O that was published in 2002 by Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, who would later be retained by Yukos in the Russian tax litigation.187 In his commentary, Mr. Pepeliaev wrote as follows:\n\nIn this Ruling the court considers the issue of limitations on tax planning, which implies the recognition of the right of each taxpayer to use the means, ways and methods permitted by law to reduce such taxpayer's tax liabilities to the maximum extent possible. However, sometimes tax planning goes beyond the permitted limits and results in tax evasion. The boundaries between the tax planning and tax evasion [are] determined by reference [to] the taxpayer's purposes. If tax savings are only ancillary to the relevant economic result, then the relevant tax consequences shall be determined by reference to the form of the relevant transaction. However, where the taxpayer's actions were aimed solely to reduce the amount of its tax payments rather than to achieve an economic result, this would demonstrate that the relevant transaction was inconsistent with law because the motive underlying such transaction was to avoid tax.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe expression \"good faith of the parties to a transaction\" is closely related to the expression \"good faith taxpayer\" which was used by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation twice in the opinion section of Resolution No. 24-P dated 12 October 1998. In other words, in the context of the Resolution, the expression \"good faith of the parties to a transaction\" was used in its public legal meaning. A person's actions aimed solely at tax evasion may not be regarded as actions made in good faith.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf the parties to a transaction act reasonably, i.e., if they aim to achieve the actual business result and also choose such line of action which leads to minimal tax loss, then the parties' tax liabilities should be determined formally.\n\n\u2026\n\nlf it appears that parties act both unreasonably and not in good faith then this constitutes a ground for reassessment of the parties' tax liabilities for which various mechanisms can be used. Upon a claim brought by the tax authorities the actual relations between the parties may be assessed by court[s]. The substance of such court proceedings would be an examination of whether the actions of the relevant parties were aimed at achievement of business (economic) results or whether the idea of tax saving was the prevailing idea....188\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6 12(c).\n\nS.G. Pepeliaev, *Commentary to the Ruling of the Constitutional Court Ruling of the Russian Federation No. 138-O of July 25, 2001*, Exh. R-352.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in respect of the period relevant for the Yukos tax assessments and decisions, while the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine had not yet gelled in the way that it did in 2006, in Resolution No. 53, it had already been recognized and applied in some Russian court decisions. This conclusion, while based primarily on the Tribunal's review of the cases,189 is also supported by the cross-examination of Mr. Konnov at the Hearing, as explained in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that the ECtHR, in its separate judgments relating to the claims against the Russian Federation brought by Yukos and Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, respectively, considered the relevant domestic (*i.e.*, Russian) law and practice, including the Russian courts' case-law on substance over form and related doctrines. *See* ECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6\u00b6 428-68; *Khodorkovsky v. Russia (2)* \u00b6\u00b6 422-28.\n\n320.\n\nIn his cross-examination of Mr. Konnov, Professor Gaillard focused on the sanction that the Russian Federation imposed on Yukos in the present case, rather than on the existence of any anti-abuse doctrine *per se*.\n\n321.\n\nMr. Friedman emphasized the limited scope of Claimants' cross-examination of Mr. Konnov during his re-direct examination of the witness:\n\nMR FRIEDMAN: Just to make sure I am clear, Mr Konnov, you understood the questions yesterday to be about the remedy that's applied based on the anti-abuse doctrine, as opposed to the substance of the anti-abuse doctrine?\n\nA. I thought that Professor Gaillard limited his question\u2014and the Tribunal did the same thing\u2014very specifically to the attribution; which I explained\u2014and I think the record said that\u2014that I don't view that as a separate instrument. But I was nevertheless asked the question about court cases with respect to attribution.190\n\nTranscript, Day 15 at 193-94.\n\n322.\n\nAs Claimants had stipulated to the existence of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine (while contesting the scope and manner of its application), they instead implied in their argument that any such doctrine was irrelevant, since formal compliance with the legislation governing the low-tax benefits in the respective regions, including fulfilment of the terms of any applicable investment agreements, was sufficient to claim the tax benefits.191\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 148-64.\n\n323.\n\nAccordingly, in his cross-examination of Mr. Konnov, Professor Gaillard stressed the compliance of Yukos' tax scheme with the existing legislative framework. In his answer, Mr. Konnov, while acknowledging that the formal requirements of the law may have been met, reiterated the relevance of the anti-abuse doctrine:\n\nQ. So what you are saying is that the Law is not a good law, right? The Law which gives the regions the power to negotiate their taxes downwards in exchange for contributions to their fund is not a good law? The system is not good, as far as\u2014\n\nA. No, I am not saying that at all. I am not saying that at all. I am saying that what was done in this case, it was an abuse of law. So the Law was applied by Yukos in such an abusive manner so that, in violation of the constitutional principles which I've summarized in my report, Yukos did not pay taxes duty in Moscow. It used this whole fraudulent sham arrangement, with the use of the Mordovian companies, to evade taxes in Moscow.192\n\nTranscript, Day 13 at 151-52.\n\n324.\n\nMr. Konnov's insistence on the relevance of the anti-abuse doctrine, notwithstanding Yukos' compliance with the strict letter of the law, can also be seen in the following extract of his cross-examination by Professor Gaillard:\n\nQ. What do you call the proportionality principle? Is it the proportionality between the investment and the benefits?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. Right. Is this\u2014I will use the words \"proportionality principle\" within your meaning, what you just said, right? Is this proportionality principle found in the black letter of the Law of Mordovia; yes or no?\n\nA. No. As I said\u2014\n\nQ. Okay.\n\nA. \u2014neither in Mordovia, nor in Kalmykia, nor in any other jurisdictions.\n\nQ. Fine. And we have seen that in the agreements regarding the ZATOs, the trading companies had agreed to contribute to a fund 5% of their tax benefits. We have seen that earlier, yesterday or this morning, right?\n\nA. Right.\n\nQ. Okay. Now, going back to the Sibirskaya case, in the Sibirskaya case we have a decision of first instance where the taxpayer won; correct?\n\nA. As I recall, correct.\n\nQ. Right. And in the Court of Appeal the taxpayer lost, and it had to do with the Law of Kalmykia; correct?\n\nA. No. No. There was no\u2014again\u2014\n\nQ. But it was a Kalmykian company\n\nA. No, it was not based on the Kalmykian Law. Obviously Sibirskaya was governed by Kalmykian Law; obviously Kalmykian Law did apply to it, to the same extent Mordovian Law applied to companies registered in Mordovia. But the assessment was based on the proportionality principle, which, as we discussed, is not found\u2014I think you used the words\u2014in the black letters of the Law.193\n\nTranscript, Day 14 at 218-220.\n\n325.\n\nHaving completed its review of what it considers to be the central evidence in the record in respect of the legal framework applicable to the Yukos tax optimization scheme under Russian law, the Tribunal now turns to the complex factual matrix involving Yukos' trading entities in the low-tax regions.\n\n**4. The History of the Yukos Trading Entities before 2003**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nIn the present proceedings, the Parties vigorously debated the significance of the history of the Yukos trading companies, including various tax audits that took place before 2003. The pertinent activities of Yukos' trading companies took place in the regions of Mordovia and Kalmykia, as well as in the ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. The Tribunal will now summarize these activities and the results of the many tax audits which were issued.\n\n**(a) Mordovia**\n----------------\n\n327.\n\nMordovia is a region within the Russian Federation. Sometimes referred to as a \"domestic offshore territory\", in the late 1990s it was granted some autonomy as regards taxation, which made it a more attractive destination for investment and business operations.194 This was part of a broader plan by the Russian Government in the 1990s to foster economic development in areas designated as \"economically underdeveloped\".195 As noted earlier, the special exemption plan for domestic offshore territories was largely repealed as of 1 January 2004.196\n\nTranscript, Day 1 at 45-48.\n\nRespondent Opening Statement, Day 2 at 109.\n\n*See* paragraphs 77 and 283 above; First Konnov Report \u00b6 33.\n\n328.\n\nOn 9 March 1999, the *Law of the Republic of Mordovia No. 9-Z* (\" ***Law 9-Z*** \") was enacted.197*Law 9-Z* was the framework which allowed Mordovia to offer tax benefits to corporate entities operating in the region. Article 4.4 of the law states that \"[t]he Government of the Republic of Mordovia shall determine the order and terms and conditions of granting the tax benefit under this Law, as well as the order of keeping reports and records to be able to obtain the tax benefits listed in this Law.\"198\n\n*Law 9-Z*, Exh. C-414.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n329.\n\nMr. Vladimir Dubov, a member of the Yukos management board199 and later a member of the State Duma for the Upper Volga region (which includes Mordovia), was the primary point of contact between Yukos and the regional and federal taxation authorities in Mordovia. He appeared as a witness on behalf of Claimants.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 14.\n\n330.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Dubov stated the following:\n\n\u2022 On 20 December 1999, he attended meetings in Mordovia to explain Yukos' plan to operate through trading companies in Mordovia. He met with Mr. Nicolai Merkushkin, the head of the Republic of Mordovia; Mordovian Prime Minister Vladimir Volkov,; and Mordovian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Ruzhenkov, who was also Head of the Administration of the Government of Mordovia. Mr. Dubov swears that \"[a]ll terms and conditions associated with the use of trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia were discussed and agreed at the meeting, including that Yukos' trading companies would pay [80 million rubles] per month to the Republic.\" He stated that the Mordovian authorities \"fully approved\" of the plan.200\n\n\u2022 In late December 1999, he met with the Tax Minister of the Russian Federation, Mr. Alexander Pochinok, and Mr. Alexander Smirnov, one of Mr. Pochinok's deputy ministers, to discuss Yukos' plan to use trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia. Mr. Smirnov was very interested and called the head of the Special Inspectorate for Major Taxpayers, Mr. Aslambek Pasckachev, and the head of the Oil Department within the special inspectorate, Ms. Lydia Smirnova, into the in the meeting, to ask them to analyze the beneficial taxation plan.201\n\n\u2022 After that meeting, he spoke with Mr. Gusev, First Deputy Minister in charge of the VAT Department, to discuss Yukos' plan. He thought this important as \"it was obvious to me that any trading companies established in Mordovia would be claiming significant VAT refunds on the export of oil and oil products.\"202 He also spoke with Ms. Olga Serdiuk, then Deputy Head of the Indirect Taxes Department and one of the three deputy First Ministers, Mr. Kirill Ugolnikov.203\n\n\u2022 Around late December 1999 or January 2000, he met with each of the deputy First Ministers at the Tax Ministry and at the Menatep office on Kolpachniy Lane to outline the plan for the Mordovian companies. Following these meetings, Mr. Smirnov called the Head of the Regional Department of the Tax Ministry in Mordovia, Mr. Aleksey Averiasov, in Mr. Dubov's presence, to inform him that such discussions had taken place and that Yukos had been \"given the green light at the Ministry level for the use of trading companies in the region.\"204\n\n\u2022 He met with the then First Deputy Minister of Finance (later Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister), Mr. Alexei Kudrin at the Ministry of Finance in January 2000. They discussed establishing Yukos trading companies in Mordovia so that Yukos could take advantage of tax benefits available in the region and that Yukos' trading companies would be able to contribute to the regional economy through fixed monthly payments. Mr. Dubov recalls that \"Alexei Kudrin consented to Yukos' proposal, with the proviso that Yukos' overall tax burden should essentially remain the same.\"205\n\nDubov WS \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 24.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 25.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 26. It is common ground between Claimants and Respondent (hereinafter \"the Parties\") that the point of Yukos' tax arrangements was to lower its tax burden, not to keep it at the level it would have been at without resort to them.\n\n331.\n\nWhen he was cross-examined, Mr. Dubov repeated his statement that he told Mr. Kudrin that Yukos was planning to work in Mordovia through trading companies, as well as \"which taxes it will pay in each level of national budget, which preferences would the budgets provide for Yukos, what benefits Yukos would reap from these preferences and what amounts would be paid in[to] the federal budget, and if there were any issues, how they were going to be resolved.\"206\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 84.\n\n332.\n\nMr. Dubov concludes in his witness statement that, after these meetings, \"[i]t follows that all the relevant authorities, both federal and regional, including the Minister of Taxation, his first Deputies, and the First Deputy Minister of Finance were aware of, cooperated with and approved of Yukos' plan to operate through the trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia to take advantage of the favorable tax climate.\"207 In Mr. Dubov's view, this was favorable both for Mordovia and the Russian Federation, as any improvement in the financial situation of Mordovia would decrease the burden it placed on the federal budget. According to Mr. Dubov, \"[t]he Russian Federation was clearly interested in decreasing the significant disparities in well-being between the regions [of the Federation].\"208\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 27.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 29.\n\n333.\n\nThe record reveals that, as the trading companies began operations, VAT refunds to the companies were very significant. In fact, VAT refunds to the trading companies often exceeded the total amount of VAT collected in Mordovia from all the other companies operating on its territory. The regional section of the Federal Treasury therefore had to transfer the necessary funds to the Tax Ministry's regional VAT Department. This decision to transfer funds, according to Mr. Dubov, had to be taken at the federal level, including obtaining the approval of the Ministry of Finance.\n\n334.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov explained that \"[w]hen, as a result of the operations of the trading companies, the VAT refunds increased many times over, many fold, by many hundreds of per cent, the Tax Ministry department asked the question why[;] the Tax Ministry, the Tax and Charges Ministry for Mordovia replied that we have Yukos trading entities incorporated here, these have to do with the Yukos exports; that is why the VAT refunds are so high.\"209 He also stated that \"[t]his is exactly why, before the scheme became operational, I had cleared [it] with the head of the department and the First Deputy Minister who was in charge of this department.\"210\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 149-50.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 150.\n\n335.\n\nIn addition, in his witness statement, Mr. Dubov affirms that the funds paid into the Mordovian budget were used to fund various projects, such as Internet House, an internet-training center, and the rebuilding of the Saransk Airport. In 2001, according to Mr. Dubov, several dignitaries, including President Vladimir Putin, repeatedly visited the area (using the airport) and discussed the trading companies' work in the region. Mr. Dubov states: \"During such visits, President Putin was told by Nicolai Merkushkin, the Head of the Republic of Mordovia, and other representatives of the Republic of Mordovia, about the social, cultural and industrial projects that had been developed in the region in the previous year through the support and cooperation of Yukos.\"211 Mr. Dubov also recalls that President Putin had been told about several other improvement projects funded by Yukos' support, such as the building of plants for machinery construction, construction materials and the production of optic fiber; the realization of a number of environmental projects such as the recycling of rotten wood and raw materials; the rehabilitation of the meat industry; reconstruction of the Saransk Theatre and Saransk Art Museum; the construction of two asphalt plants just outside of Saransk; and the reconstruction of the Saransk-Moscow highway.212\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 33.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 33; Memorial \u00b6 711.\n\n336.\n\nMr. Dubov concludes that \"[i]t follows that the federal authorities, who had to authorize the VAT refund, as well as any subsequent transfer of funds, were fully aware of Yukos' trading structure, including the activities of the production and trading companies and the transactions between them.\"213\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 44.\n\n337.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that during his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov could not confirm that the VAT forms submitted by the trading companies to the Tax Ministry contained the full particulars as to how the tax optimization scheme was being implemented by Yukos. This was because, as he said, he was not familiar with the specifics of the VAT submissions although he knew that they would be submitted to the Leninsky district of Saransk (Mordovia) and they were likely to be very large.214 It seems unlikely to the Tribunal that such information would have been disclosed in the VAT forms, as the tax benefits of the low-tax regions did not extend to VAT.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 152-54.\n\n338.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov affirmed that he only discussed with Mr. Kudrin \"the general scheme\", not the formalities or the details of the activities of the trading companies.215 The Tribunal further notes that in his witness statement, Mr. Dubov asserts that \"[p]rior to the attacks on Yukos, which began in the Summer of 2003, the Russian authorities never challenged the legality of this structure or the materiality of the facts underlying this structure.\"216 During his cross-examination before the Tribunal, he stated that he had no knowledge of the use of the ZATO Lesnoy companies,217 and in light of such testimony, Mr. Dubov's evidence must be understood as being limited to Yukos' activities in Mordovia.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 81-83.\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 12.\n\nTranscript, Day 5 at 101-102.\n\n339.\n\nIn the following subsections, the Tribunal will review the detailed information that was presented to it regarding the trading companies incorporated in Mordovia.\n\n**i. Alta-Trade (Mercury XXIII)**\n---------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nAlta-Trade was incorporated on 17 December 1999 as Mercury XXIII pursuant to the resolution of a meeting of the company's founders, Polikant ZAO and A-Trust OOO, each with a 50 percent [RUR 5,000] stake in the share capital. In March 2001, Nefteinvest OOO became a shareholder, taking a 2 percent (RUR 200) share in the company's share capital.218 In August 2001, Yukos-Import OOO acquired the shares of Polikant ZAO and A-Trust OOO, and became the owner of 98 percent of the share capital (RUR 9,800).219\n\nField Tax Audit Report No. 08-1/1 of OAO Yukos Oil Company, 29 December 2003 p. 34, Exh. C-103 (hereinafter \"2000 Audit Report\").\n\n*Ibid*. pp. 34-35.\n\n341.\n\nOn 27 June 2001, Alta-Trade concluded an investment agreement with Mordovia, which was supplemented in March 2002.220\n\nInvestment Agreement No. 5, 27 June 2001, as supplemented, Exh. C-1114.\n\n342.\n\nThe record reveals two decisions by the Saransk Tax Inspectorate in 2001 where Alta-Trade was denied the right to offset the VAT in respect of some of its activities. The decision of 15 June 2001 notes that Alta-Trade is \"an enterprise producing oil products and selling its output domestically and [abroad],\" that it purchases crude oil from Yu-Mordovia, and that sales are made through OAO NK Yukos and ZAO Trading House Angarsk-Nefto as commission agents.221 The decision of 29 October 2001 refers to transactions with, for example, Siberian Transportation Company and noted that the commission agent was Yukos Export Trade.222 Thus, this information pertinent to the activities of Alta-Trade in Mordovia and linking Alta-Trade to the Yukos \"family\" was known to the authorities as early as 2001.\n\nDecision of the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of the Russian Federation for the Leninsky District of Saransk No. 23, 15 June 2001, Exh. C-1110.\n\nDecision of the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of the Russian Federation for the Leninsky District of Saransk No. 48, 29 October 2001, Exh. C-1116.\n\n343.\n\nIn April 2002, Alta-Trade's first ever field tax audit was conducted. It covered the year 2000.223 The report from that audit noted the tax-benefit structure under Law 9-Z and the investment agreement between Mordovia and Alta-Trade. It noted that Alta-Trade was engaged in \"crude oil refining [through intermediaries], sale of crude oil and oil products in the domestic market, as well as for export.\"224 It noted the tax benefit structure under Law 9-Z,225 and that the company had no capital assets on its balance sheet.226 It also noted that Alta-Trade's accounting and tax services were completed by Yukos Invest.227 The Audit Report found no violation of any tax laws.228\n\nField Tax Audit Report No. 02-52 of OOO Alta Trade, 19 April 2002 \u00b6 2.3, Exh.

Fargoil**\n---------------\n\n345.\n\nFargoil was registered with state authorities on 23 May 2001. The sole founder of Fargoil was Mikhail Nikolayevich Silayev, who owned 100 percent of the share capital (RUR 10,000). On 25 May 2001, he transferred full ownership of the shares to Nassaubridge Management Limited, a company incorporated in Cyprus, for RUR 11,000.234\n\n2002 Decision, p. 106, Exh. C-175.\n\n346.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Taxation, \"[i]n order to get the opportunity to have dividends taxed at a 5% rate, Nassaubridge Management Limited, pursuant to Article 10 of the Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Cyprus on Avoidance of Double Taxation of Income and Capital of 5 December 1998, made a direct investment in Fargoil OOO capital, equivalent to USD 120,000 (Bank Payment Order No. 1 of 7 February 2002, issued by Nassaubridge Management Limited, worth 3,590,000 paid as a share capital contribution based on an application of 31 January 2002).\"235 Fargoil's accounts were prepared by Yukos Financial Accounting Centre OOO.236\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*. p. 107.\n\n347.\n\nAn investment agreement was concluded between Fargoil and Mordovia on 27 June 2001, and supplemented on 26 March 2002.237 In April 2002, a report of the Directorate on Implementation of the special-development program was issued pursuant to that agreement, which indicated that Fargoil had contributed over RUR 102 Million to the region.238\n\nInvestment Agreement No. 9, 27 June 2001, as supplemented, Exh.

It found no violation of Article 40 of the Russian Tax Code; but did find some underpayments, resulting in an order to Fargoil to pay additional road tax and income tax in the amount of RUR 590,847,939 (USD 19.7 Million). Notably, the report concluded that \"Fargoil lawfully used exemptions applicable to all taxes under review.\"239\n\nField Tax Audit Report No. 02-105 of OOO Fargoil, 3 September 2003 \u00b6 2.16, Exh.

The sole founder and chief accountant of Macro-Trade was Ms. Gulnura Karimovna Zhukova, who was also the founder and director of Mega-Alliance OOO. Pursuant to a resolution of 24 May 2002 and amendments to the charter of Macro-Trade on 22 October 2002, her shareholding was transferred, in equal 50 percent shares, to Conbrook Limited (LLC) and Silverdale Trading Limited (LLC), both registered in Cyprus. On 16 December 2002, Macro-Trade's share capital was increased to RUR 7,700,000 and \"was formed by a deposit of cash assets into the entity's current account from an account at Trust and Investment Bank JSCB on 20 December 2001 [ *sic* ].\"244\n\n2003 Decision, p. 93, Exh. C-190.\n\n351.\n\nMs. Zhukova submitted a statement in court proceedings in Moscow in May of 2005 in which she alleged that she knew nothing about becoming a director of Macro-Trade and that her name was on the books of the company as a result of a fraud. She stated that in December 1998 or early 1999, her purse with her passport had been stolen. She stated that she did not report the theft because the passport was returned at the end of January 1999.245 Mr. Konnov, in his first expert report, referred to Ms. Zukhova's statement.246 When Professor Gaillard cross-examined Mr. Konnov on this \"story\", Professor Gaillard pointed out that Macro-Trade was incorporated in May 2001, more than two years *after* Ms. Zukhova's passport was returned to her.247\n\nApplication by the Russian Federal Tax Service's Inter-District Inspectorate No. 1 for Major Taxpayers to the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District, 4 May 2005 pp. 15-16, Exh.

Mars XXII (Energotrade)**\n-------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nMars XXII was incorporated on 17 December 1999. The founders were OOO Akra, registered in the Kaluga Region, and Renmet ZAO, registered in Moscow, both with equal shares of 50 percent (RUR 5,000).252 Renmet ZAO is also a founder of Elbrus OOO, which had a 20 percent holding in the share capital of Yu-Mordovia and Yukos-M. Ms. Tatiana Subbotina was one of the directors of Mars XXII. In a witness statement of 18 May 2004, Ms. Subbotina affirmed that, while she was formally in charge of the company, she only signed documents and did not know whether any investment agreements were concluded by Mars-XXII.253 According to its charter, the main activities of Mars XXII were the production and wholesale sale of oil products in the internal market and for export.254\n\n2000 Audit Report, p. 20, Exh.

Yu-Mordovia**\n--------------------\n\n369.\n\nYu-Mordovia was incorporated on 2 December 1999 and registered on 17 December 1999. The sole founder of Yu-Mordovia OOO was OAO Yukos Oil Company.289 On 17 January 2000, amendments were made to Yu-Mordovia's charter regarding the identity of the founders, the value of the share capital and the number of shares. The following each had a 20 percent (2.0) share in the share capital: OAO Yukos Oil Company, Sonata OOO, Elbrus OOO, Stekloprommash ZAO and A-Trust OOO.290 The shareholders were registered outside Mordovia, either in the Tyumen Region (OAO Yukos Oil Company) or Moscow (the remaining four shareholders).291 Yu-Mordovia and Mordovia entered into an investment agreement on 27 June 2001, which was later supplemented on 26 March 2002.292\n\n2000 Audit Report, p. 51, Exh.

Only one trading company was based there, Siberian Transportation Company (Sibirskaya), registered in 1998. Kalmykia was authorized to offer tax benefits under the *Law of the Republic of Kalmykia No. 12-II-Z on Tax Benefits Granted to Enterprises Making Investments in the Economy of the Republic of Kalmykia* of 12 March 1999.299 Aimed at \"further enhancement of the investment climate\" in the region, the law was designed to offer exemptions from certain local taxes and corporate taxes to companies making investments in the region.300\n\n*Law of the Republic of Kalmykia No. 12-II-Z On Tax Benefits Granted to Enterprises Making Investments in the Economy of the Republic of Kalmykia*, 12 March 1999, Exh. C-413.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**i. Siberian Transportation Company (Sibirskaya)**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nSibirskaya was founded by Step ZAO, registered in Kaluzhskaya Region, and Polinep ZAO, registered in Moscow, both holding 50 percent shares.301 The Tribunal notes that Polinep ZAO was also a founder of Sonata OOO and Elbrus OOO, which were founders of Yu-Mordovia OOO and Yukos-M ZAO.302\n\n2000 Decision, p. 8, Exh. C-104.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n374.\n\nSibirskaya received tax benefits under the *Law of the Republic of Kalmykia No. 12-II-Z* of 12 March 1999 referred to above and the *Resolution of the Elista Municipal Assembly No. 7* of 25 January 2001.303\n\n*Law of the Republic of Kalmykia No. 12-II-Z*, 12 March 1999, Exh. C-413. The resolution is referred to in Exh. R-311. As is the case with many of the documents referred to below, although the existence of this particular document (the resolution) is evidenced by a reference in an exhibit that is in the record, the resolution itself is not in the record. Claimants have criticized Respondent for failing to provide a complete record of the pre-2003 audits and related documents.\n\n375.\n\nIn September 2001, a resolution was issued by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia (Elista). It found that the Siberian Transportation Company was ineligible for the tax benefits applied to it in the autonomous region.304 On the same day, a tax payment demand was issued to recoup the costs of the inappropriately applied benefits, in the amount of RUR 6,918,617 (approximately USD 230,000).305\n\nResolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Caucasian District, Case No. F08-1678/2002-614A, 20 May 2002, Exh. R-311 (referring to Resolution No. 01-24/2261 of the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia, 25 September 2001).\n\n*Ibid*. (referring to *Tax payment demand No. 01-23/2261*, 25 September 2001). The RUR to USD exchange rate used here is approximate, based on a rate of 30:1.\n\n376.\n\nIn December 2001, the Arbitrazh Court of the Republic of Kalmykia ruled that the tax incentives were, in fact, *lawfully* applied to the Siberian Transportation Company and the resolution and payment demand were declared invalid. In addition, the court specifically stated that it had not found any evidence that the company had acted in bad faith or that it abused its rights.306 The Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia (Elista) appealed the December 2001 judgment. The court of appeal upheld the decision of the lower court, affirming that the resolution and the payment demand were invalid. The court of appeal found no bad faith on the part of the Siberian Transportation Company.307\n\n*Ibid*. (referring to Decision of the Arbitrazh Court of the Republic of Kalmykia, Case No. A22-1306/2001-6/129, 5 December 2001).\n\n*Ibid*. (referring to the Resolution of the appellate court, Case No. A22-1306/2001-6/129, 12 March 2002).\n\n377.\n\nThe Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia (Elista) appealed this decision to the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Caucasian District. The Federal Arbitrazh Court reversed the decisions of the lower courts and ruled that the Siberian Transportation Company was not eligible for the benefits and that the company had acted in bad faith. The resolution and the payment demand therefore became valid once again and were reinstated.308 The Federal Arbitrazh Court held that the tax benefits granted to the company were disproportionate to the investment it had made in Kalmykia. It found that the amount invested was 0.4 percent of the amount of tax benefits. There is no further information in the record as to any further steps in those proceedings, and, in particular, no evidence that the company appealed the decision of the Federal Arbitrazh Court to the Supreme Arbitrazh Court.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n378.\n\nTax reassessments would eventually be made against Yukos for the Siberian Transportation Company for the year 2000,309 totaling RUR 240,437,174 (approximately USD 8,014,572).310\n\n2000 Decision, p. 11, Exh.

As noted earlier, ZATOs or \"Closed Adminstrative Territorial Units\" are restricted-access territories \"established in the former Soviet Union from the late 1940s as defense and nuclear power plant cities, which included communities with sensitive military, industrial or scientific facilities, such as arms plants or nuclear research sites.\"311 Due to the fact that their local economies were particularly dependent on increasingly obsolete military or nuclear functions, the ZATOs faced economic collapse at the end of the Cold War. To address the problem, in 1992, the Russian State Duma \"enacted a federal law to define the special tax regime of the ZATOs and the financing of these territories by the federal government, and guaranteed the ZATOs' residents certain social and health benefits.\"312 The number of restricted access jurisdictions in Russia is unknown, and it was not until the late 1990s that the territories were even named or mapped.313 In 1996, about half of the ZATOs were declassified of ZATO status.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 226, n.274.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nVladimir Samoylenko, *Government Policies in Regard to Internal Tax Havens in Russia*, Publication of International Tax & Investment Center, December 2003, p. 10, Exh.

In early 1998, the trading companies entered into agreements with the Lesnoy Town Administration to make investments in the region that would entitle them to certain tax benefits.314 These were renewed in 2000.315\n\n2000 Decision, Exh.

There is no information on a renewal in favour of Forest-Oil, though it seems likely there was one.\n\n381.\n\nIn January 1999, the trading companies based in Lesnoy and the Lesnoy Administration agreed to allow the companies to use interest-bearing promissory notes of OAO Yukos Oil Company in order to pay their taxes.316 This agreement was later formalized in a decision by the head of ZATO Lesnoy.317\n\nReport No. 04-14/11-1, 22 February 2002 pp. 7, 9, 11, 12, Exh.

Resolution 189 of the Duma of Lesnoy referred to joint investment activity within the framework of a partnership \"between the Lesnoy administration and YUKOS OC OJSC.\"318 The investments included construction and reconstruction of gas stations based on joint-activity agreements entered into \"for a total of [RUR] 2,730 Million.\"319 In late 1999, three of the four trading companies were subjected to \"desk audits\", which \"confirmed the validity in application of additional tax incentives granted.\"320\n\nDecree of the Investigation Committee of the Russian Federation, 16 January 2002, p. 2, Exh.

It appears that the audit report, whose findings were summarized in this undated memorandum, was issued on 7 March 2000. *See* Statement No. 6 on the legality of the use by OOO Business-Oil in 1999 and 2000 of additional tax incentives granted by the head of the municipal formation of Town of Lesnoy No. 6, 29 June 2001, p. 4, Exh. R-295.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in essence, the memorandum concludes that while each entity has the *formal* right to receive the \"additional tax incentives under Law of the Russian Federation No. 67-FZ of 2 April 1999\"323 based on an examination of the entity's operations, it was established during the interrogation of a witness, in respect of each entity, that \"the employees residing on the ZATO territory are not involved in the work related to the main activity of the company.\"324\n\nMemorandum on the results of the audit of the legality of additional tax incentives granted to Mitra, Business-Oil and Forest-Oil in Lesnoy for 1998 and 9 months of 1999 pp. 2, 4, 6, Exh.

On the other hand, Claimants replied that the memorandum was a document internal to the tax ministry.325 Claimants also aver that contemporaneous field tax audits conducted in March and May 2000 found no violations of any tax law by Business Oil, Forest Oil or Mitra in relation to the application of these taxation arrangements.326\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 48; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; *see also* Transcript, Day 14 at 86.\n\nThese documents are not in the record but see Statement No. 6 on the legality of the use by OOO Business-Oil in 1999 and 2000 of additional tax incentives granted by the head of the municipal formation of Town of Lesnoy No. 6, 29 June 2001, Exh.

The new entity that emerged was named OOO Investproekt and was registered in the Kirov region. In August 2001, Investproekt moved across Russia to the Chita Region.\n\n390.\n\nThese restructurings and movements by Yukos\u2014referred to collectively by Respondent as the \" **Lesnoy Shuffle** \"\u2014are seen differently by the Parties. According to Claimants, they were merely a simplification of the corporate group of \"hundreds of companies.\"327 Claimants also noted that the restructurings occurred before any Tax Ministry decisions were rendered against it.328 Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that they were indicative of a pattern of behavior on the part of Yukos that shows an intent to frustrate the taxation authorities.329 While the Tribunal need not determine why these restructurings took place at this time, it has formed the view that the simplification claim is a simplification. No persuasive argument has been advanced by Claimants to explain why the series of mergers occurred at this precise time.330 At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the tax authorities were then slowly moving away from the taxation autonomy previously given to the ZATOs and that, on 1 January 2002, the right of the ZATOs to grant any tax incentives was removed from the law completely.331\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 43.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 64.\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 57-60.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 8-12 (chronicling the series of moves that were taken \"for no stated business reason\".)\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 33.

Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 6, which examined the benefits granted to Business-Oil, found that the tax incentives were actually not in accordance with the law on ZATOs and not approved by the Ministry of Finance. It also found a violation due to payment of taxes with promissory notes. It assessed taxes of approximately RUR 2.8 Billion (USD 98 Million) for the whole period. The memorandum also notes specifically that the Lesnoy entities were enterprises of OAO NK Yukos.333\n\nStatement No. 6 on the legality of the use by OOO Business-Oil in 1999 and 2000 of additional tax incentives granted by the head of the municipal formation of Town of Lesnoy No. 6, 29 June 2001, Exh.

The RUR to USD exchange rate used here is approximate, based on a rate of 30:1.\n\n392.\n\nInternal Tax Ministry Statement No. 7, which examined the benefits granted to Forest-Oil, found that the company's employees residing in Lesnoy were not engaged in trading, and also found violations due to payment of taxes with Yukos promissory notes and assessed approximately RUR 671 Million (USD 22 Million) in taxes that were not paid in cash.334\n\nStatement No. 7 on the audit of OOO Forest-Oil, 11 July 2001, Exh. R-296. The RUR to USD exchange rate used here is approximate, based on a rate of 30:1.\n\n393.\n\nBenefits granted to Mitra were examined in Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 8, which found that Lesnoy unlawfully granted tax incentives, found a violation due to payment of taxes by Yukos promissory notes and assessed approximately RUR 783 Million (USD 26 Million) in taxes paid with promissory notes.335\n\nStatement No. 8 on the audit of OOO Mitra, 11 July 2001, Exh.

It found that Lesnoy could not grant incentives for 2000 and assessed that RUR 986 Million (USD 33 Million) was owed. It also found fault on the basis of a substance over form analysis, and a violation due to payment of taxes by Yukos promissory notes in the amount of RUR 1.8 Billion (USD 60 Million).336\n\n*Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 8* (Vald-Oil), 11 July 2001, Exh.

The e-mail contained a document itemizing in tabular format, all of the information that Mr. Kartashov had regarding investigations into trading companies across the ZATOs and other low-tax regions.341 It identified, in a column entitled \"Risks\", a criminal case \"in connection with tax evasion\" for the four Lesnoy entities and nine Trekhgorny entities. The document also noted that office personnel in all 13 of those firms had been interrogated, including the general directors of some of the Lesnoy companies. The entries for the Lesnoy entities also noted that some documents had been seized.\n\nE-mail from Ms. Golub to Mr. Kartashov, 23 November 2001, Exh. R-3338.\n\n398.\n\nIn December 2001, Ms. Golub drafted a letter to be used as a template by one or more of the directors of the Lesnoy trading companies regarding the investigation into the use of promissory notes and sent it to Mr. D.V. Gololobov, Deputy Head of Yukos' Legal Department.342 Later, Mr. V.G. Aleksanyan, the Head of the Legal Department, wrote to Ms. Golub regarding her draft letter, asking that in correspondence with the authorities, no reference be made to the tax incentives granted by Lesnoy.343 Respondent argued during the Hearing that this demonstrates knowledge of and intent to conceal wrongdoing by Yukos.344 Claimants answered that the document merely notes that the tax incentives were not at issue in the investigation (only the use of promissory notes to pay taxes was), and that Mr. Aleksanyan was simply asking Ms. Golub not to bring up an issue that was not being investigated.345\n\nDraft letter regarding investigation into use of promissory notes, undated, Exh.

R-304 (referring to Decision No. 04-15/10 to conduct additional control activities on Investproekt, 17 December 2001).\n\n400.\n\nIn January 2002, the criminal investigation of the directors of the Lesnoy trading companies was terminated because the investigation had not determined that a crime was committed. The report stated that \"there is no constitution of a crime,\" and \"tax payments in non-monetary form cannot indicate the intention of tax evasion.\"347 The document also concludes that the head of the Lesnoy Administration, Mr. A.I. Ivannikov, believed at the time that tax payments by promissory notes were legal and that his actions and the actions of Lesnoy officials relating to granting of tax benefits should be considered as exceeding their authority and as negligent.348\n\nDecree on termination of criminal case no. 135070 (in part), 16 January 2002, Exh. R-377.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n401.\n\nHowever, a few days later, that decision was reversed.349 The reason then given was that no \"legal assessment was conducted during the preliminary investigation as to whether the selection by the [trading companies] of such a knowingly illegal method of tax payment involving intentional overpayment of charged taxes and subsequent refund of surplus sums to the accounts of these same companies in real monetary form could be considered as \u2018another method' of tax avoidance....\"350\n\nDecree on the Reversal of the Decree to Discontinue Criminal Case No. 135070, 1 February 2002, Exh. R-381.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 3.\n\n402.\n\nUltimately though, the Tribunal notes that the investigation was suspended because, in the words of the resolution, \"all possible investigative actions have been taken in the absence of an accused.\"351 The resolution noted that \"this type of tax crime should be assessed as a tax evasion scheme by making advance payments for taxes of future periods,\" and that \"[h]ere a mandatory condition is the fact that the advance payment is made in non-monetary form.\"352 The resolution concluded that it was not possible to determine who among the directors of the trading companies or who in the Municipal Department of the City of Lesnoy actually committed a crime.353 Claimants stressed, in their Closing Statement, that no further action was taken.354 In this connection, the Tribunal recalls that Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev were ultimately convicted, *inter alia*, for tax evasion, including in relation to the trading companies' use of promissory notes to pay taxes in Lesnoy.355\n\nResolution on Suspension of a Preliminary Investigation Due to Failure to Establish an Individual to be Accused, 4 March 2002, Exh.

R-379.\n\n403.\n\nIn the period between the reversal and the suspension of the criminal case regarding the promissory notes, the report on additional control measures against Investproekt for 1999 was released.356 It considered that Business-Oil was not entitled to tax benefits in 1999, as it \"was carrying out its business within ZATO Lesnoy as a matter of form only.\"357 The report also considered that the other Lesnoy companies were not entitled to tax benefits in 1999. The report estimated their tax liabilities on the basis of Business-Oil as a \"similar taxpayer\".358\n\nReport No. 04-14/11-1, 22 February 2002, Exh. R-304.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 2.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 4.\n\n404.\n\nThe report assessed the value of the tax benefits that it concluded had been improperly granted at approximately RUR 5.3 Billion (USD 177 Million). However, no assessment or decision was issued on the basis of this report to recoup the funds, which could have occurred any time up until 31 December 2002, before becoming time barred.359 No assessment was issued during the subsequent ten-month period against Investproekt.\n\n*Ibid*.; *see also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 63, n.136.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in March 2002, Mr. Dmitry Maruev, Yukos' Deputy Financial Manager, e-mailed M. U. Barbarovich and V. M. Zhuravlev and asked that they clean their e-mail folders and servers of references to a number of companies, some of which (\"Alebra, Greis, Business Oil, Vald Oil, Kverkys [sic], Kolrein, Mitra, Muskorn, Nortex\") had been merged into Investproekt.360\n\nD. L. Maruev e-mail to M. U. Barbarovich and V.M. Zhuravlev, 15 March 2002, Exh. R-4040. The e-mail listed the following companies: Alebra, Belz, Business-Oil, Vald-Oil, Greis, Kverkys, Kolrein, Mitra, Muksar, Muskron, Nortex and Flander.\n\n406.\n\nAround this time, a demand requesting enforcement of a tax debt against Investproekt in the amount of RUR 25 Million (USD 833,000) was sent by the Ministry of Taxes and Levies for Chernyshevsk District to Bailiffs in the Chita region. It was returned by the bailiffs who considered this matter to be outside of their jurisdiction since, when the debt was incurred, the company was located in Kirov. The bailiffs also noted that Investproekt's executive S. A. Verketin still resided in Kirov, and supplied his address.361\n\nLetter from Acting Senior Court Bailiff L.M. Lobanova to the Head of the Interdistrict Inspectorate No. 4 of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies for Chernyshersk District, Exh. R-306.\n\n407.\n\nIn April 2002, a decision was issued not to hold Investproekt liable for tax offenses in 2000. Rather, it proposed to collect taxes but not fines as offenses were \"discovered after the completion of their reorganization.\"362 It assessed the taxes owed at RUR 11,985 Billion (approximately USD 400 Million).363 Two months later, a decision was issued by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North West District in the *Pribrezhnoye* case, which found (on nearly identical facts to those relied upon in the decision against Investproekt) that the tax authorities had acted in breach of the Russian Tax Code.364 Claimants argued that this decision explains, at least in part, the reason why the tax assessment against Investproekt was never collected. In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants submit that \"in the non-political circumstances that prevailed in 2002, the assessment would not have survived court review.\"365\n\nDecision No. 02-11/1/1, 2 April 2002 p. 8, Exh.

The taxes owing were assessed at RUR 11,985 Billion (USD 400 Million); and this time, the authorities decided that they would also fine Investproekt, adding an additional approximate amount of RUR 2.4 Billion (USD 84 Million).366 It is not clear to the Tribunal as to whether this assessment was ever paid.367 The Tribunal notes that the basis for reversing the April 2002 decision (*i.e.*, the decision not to hold the company liable) was not explained in the August 2003 decision.\n\nDecision No. 2.6-23 of the Department of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of the Russian Federation for the Chita Region and Agynsky Butyatsky Autonomous District, 8 August 2003, Exh.

Tribunal's Observations**\n------------------------------\n\n484.\n\nHaving set out the evidence regarding Yukos' tax optimization scheme, the Tribunal now returns to the question posed at the beginning of this chapter: does the record which it has reviewed at length demonstrate that Yukos was merely taking advantage of the legislation in place in the low-tax regions of the Russian Federation to minimize its taxes, or was there an element of abuse in its activities that made them illegal under Russian law?\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal first reiterates that the evidence reveals\u2014indeed, the Parties are agreed\u2014that the Russian Federation had enacted (in the late 1990s and early 2000s) a legislative structure to encourage investment in some of its low-tax regions, and that Yukos (as did many other Russian companies, including other oil companies) sought to take advantage of that legislative structure. As a result, Yukos set up trading companies in various low-tax regions and, where required, entered into investment agreements with the local authorities.\n\n486.\n\nThere is evidence in the record that Mr. Dubov informed the authorities, at least in respect of the Yukos trading companies in Mordovia, that Yukos was using the legislative arrangements in place to minimize its taxes, and that none of his interlocutors, including the then First Deputy of Finance, Alexei Kudrin, formulated any objection. Finally, the Tribunal recalls that few of the audits of the trading companies conducted in the regions prior to 2003 ever resulted in any tax assessments, and, when they did, the transgressions were generally minor and the assessments insignificant.\n\n487.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that Respondent chose not to call any fact witnesses to challenge Claimants' fact witnesses. That is unfortunate. The Tribunal would have been assisted, for example, by the evidence of Mr. Kudrin who, after his meeting with Mr. Dubov, became Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Instead, Respondent has relied solely on the documentary record to build its case that Yukos' activities in the low-tax regions were abusive and illegal. As Claimants pointed out during the Hearing, and as the Tribunal found out for itself, the documentary record compiled and presented by Respondent to the Tribunal, while significant, is selective and unfortunately incomplete.\n\n488.\n\nThe record does reveal, however, that Yukos had some concerns about the legality of its trading operations in certain low-tax regions, notably in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. As recorded in the previous section of the present chapter, there were audit reports and memoranda that attest to an investigation of whether the practices of some of the Yukos trading companies in those regions were abusing the system, since those companies were acting in conformity with the relevant legislation in form only and not in substance.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in November 2001, after an extensive corporate restructuring had taken place (as a result of which the trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny ceased to exist, and were merged into entities created in other regions), Ms. Irina Golub, the Chief Accountant of Yukos, received a document by e-mail from Mr. Kartashov, a general director of Yukos. That document referred specifically to the ongoing investigations in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny by the Federal Tax Police Service of Sverdlovsk as part of a criminal case \"in connection with tax evasion\" by the Yukos entities and to the fact that office personnel in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny (including, in the case of the Lesnoy entities, the General Directors) had been interrogated by tax authorities.\n\n490.\n\nThe Tribunal notes here that the Investigation Group of the Russian Federation's Federal Tax Police Agency for the Sverdlovsk Region was the organization that had issued the \"Decree on the institution and initiation of criminal proceedings\"487\u2014looking into the payment of taxes with promissory notes\u2014three weeks earlier.\n\nDecree on the institution and initiation of criminal proceedings of the Investigation Group of the Russian Federation's Federal Tax Police Agency for the Sverdlovsk Region, 3 September 2001, Exh. R-376.\n\n491.\n\nDuring the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent referred many times to the Kartashov e-mail, as well as the following evidence, which, it argued, demonstrated that Yukos knew that its scheme was unlawful and \"took pains to conceal its scheme from the authorities\":488\n\n\u2022 Firstly, the 22 April 2002 memorandum from Mr. Maly, in which he expressed his concern that if Yukos' affiliation with the trading entities were included in the SEC filing, that information \"may be used by the Russian tax authorities to challenge [Yukos'] approach to certain transactions and, consequently, will result in substantial tax claims against the [c]ompany\";489\n\n\u2022 Secondly, the e-mail from Mr. Maruev (from the Treasury Department) to employees in 2002 to \"clean your folders\" of references to the Lesnoy trading companies;490\n\n\u2022 Thirdly, the internal memorandum from Yukos' General Counsel Mr. Aleksanyan advising Ms. Golub not to draw the attention of the authorities to the use of tax incentives in the ZATO Lesnoy, since \"an investigation into the legality of the use of the incentives... entails substantial risks, including under criminal law\";491\n\n\u2022 Fourthly, Mr. Khodorkovsky's refusal in early 2003 to sign Yukos' registration statement (for a confidential SEC filing) over concerns for his \"personal risks\";492 and\n\n\u2022 Fifthly, a \"blackline\" version of Yukos' draft filing for the SEC sent on 23 July 2002 by Natalia Kuznetsova of PwC to Stephen Wilson (at that time Yukos' international tax director), proposing that the following be deleted from an earlier draft: \"We use tax optimization mechanisms that may be challenged by the tax authorities\" and \"If a number of regional tax incentives we have used to reduce our tax burden are successfully challenged by the Russian tax authorities, we will face significant losses associated with the additionally assessed amount of tax and related interest and penalties.\"493\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 29, 38.\n\nE-mail from P.N.

R-1477.\n\n492.\n\nIn their reply to the evidence regarding concern over potential tax liabilities, Claimants submit that the Russian tax authorities \"were notorious for displaying arbitrary and unpredictable interpretations of law generating significant and unquantifiable risks for taxpayers[,] risks that Yukos and other Russian oil companies... disclosed in their financial statements.\"494 They conclude that references by Yukos' management to such risks \"[could not] reasonably be construed as evidencing \u2018knowledge' or \u2018belief' that Yukos' tax structure was unlawful.\"495 Claimants also argue that Respondent's reliance on Mr. Maly's e-mail was \"much ado about nothing,\" and that \"it is clear that any risks were neither a problem, nor an obstacle, to Yukos pursuing the NYSE listing because Yukos continued to draft its Form F-1 into mid-March 2003, nearly a year after this memo.\"496 Claimants also note that, in respect of the blackline filing that it \"in fact states\u2014in a sentence the Respondent omits to quote\u2014that Yukos' management \u2018 believe the tax mechanisms used by us comply.'\"497\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 15.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nReply \u00b6 111.\n\nReply \u00b6 199 (emphasis in original). As Claimants note, the full paragraph reads:  \n \"Our results of operation have historically benefited significantly from the use of tax [illegible] mechanisms. We believe that the tax mechanisms used by us comply with relevant [illegible]. If, however, we phase out all of our current tax optimization mechanisms due to changes to the tax regime or other reasons, we may have to pay significantly higher taxes in the future, and our result of operation may be adversely affected. In addition, if the various initiatives we have used to reduce our tax burden are successfully challenged by the Russian tax authorities we may face significant losses associated with the assessed amount of tax underpaid and related interest and penalties, which would have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\"  \n*Ibid*. n.337.\n\n493.\n\nIn fact, the record before the Tribunal reveals that Lukoil, Rosneft, Sibneft and TNK, in their financial statements in those years, all referred to the significant risks associated with the varying interpretation by the Russian tax authorities of the Russian tax legislation.498\n\n*See* Consolidated Financial Statements of OAO Lukoil, 30 May 2003, Exh. C-371; Consolidated Financial Statements of OJSC Rosneft Oil Company (hereinafter \"Rosneft\"), 24 June 2005, C-373; Consolidated Financial Statements of AO Siberian Oil Company, 21 June 2002, C-384;and Consolidated Financial Statements of TNK International Limited, 15 May 2003, C-390. To illustrate, the following is the warning contained in Lukoil's financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2002  \n \"The taxation systems in the Russian Federation and other emerging markets where Group companies operate are relatively new and are characterized by numerous taxes and changing legislation, which may be applied retroactively and is sometimes unclear, contradictory, and subject to interpretation. Often, differing interpretations exist among different tax authorities within the same jurisdictions and among taxing authorities in different jurisdictions. Taxes are subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities, which are enabled by law to impose severe fines, penalties and interest charges. Such factors may create taxation risks in the Russian Federation and other countries where Group companies operate substantially more significant than those in other countries where taxation regimes have been subject to development and clarification over long periods.  \n...  \n The regional organizational structure of the Russian Federation tax authorities and the regional judicial system can mean that taxation issues successfully defended in one region may be unsuccessful in another region. The tax authorities in each region may have a different interpretation of similar taxation issues. There is however some degree of direction provided from the central authority based in Moscow on particular taxation issues.  \n The Group has implemented tax planning and management strategies based on existing legislation at the time of implementation. The Group is subject to tax authority audits on an ongoing basis, as is normal in the Russian environment, and, at times, the authorities have attempted to impose additional significant taxes on the Group. Management believes that it has adequately met and provided for tax liabilities based on its interpretation of existing tax legislation. However, the relevant tax authorities may have differing interpretations and the effects could be significant.\"  \n Exh. C-371, pp. 30-31 (emphasis added).\n\n494.\n\nAlthough the Yukos entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny were only a small part of Yukos' tax optimization scheme,499 it is clear to the Tribunal that these entities were being investigated as of late 1999 by the tax authorities in these regions, and were suspected of being \"shams\". It is the view of the Tribunal that the legal basis for this scrutiny was the jurisprudential \"good faith taxpayer\" doctrine (\"substance over form\" or \"anti-abuse\" doctrine) and that, within the senior management of Yukos, there were a number of persons who were aware that Yukos was vulnerable in respect of certain facets of its tax optimization scheme.\n\nThe tax assessments levied against Yukos in connection with the trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny, which related only to the 2000 tax year (since the entities ceased to exist in early 2001), represented approximately 19 percent of the total tax assessment against Yukos for 2000, and represented under 3 percent of the total of all tax assessments against Yukos (for the years 2000-2003). *See* Yukos Tax Reassessment Breakdown, Exh. C-1752.\n\n495.\n\nAs for the existence of the \"good faith taxpayer\" doctrine in Russia at that time, the Tribunal has reviewed the evidence of Mr. Konnov, the only expert on Russian tax law to give evidence in these proceedings, who appeared on behalf of Respondent. Although Claimants elected not to present their own expert on Russian tax law,500 in their written submissions, they referred to and criticized various Russian court decisions, which they contended did not support Respondent's interpretation. As noted earlier in the present chapter, the Tribunal has considered Claimant's submissions.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the *RosInvestCo* arbitration, the claimant presented a Russian tax law expert, Professor Maggs. The Russian Federation relied on Mr. Konnov. The *RosInvestCo* tribunal stated that it found Professor Maggs' evidence more persuasive, but it also acknowledged that Professor Maggs did not dispute the existence of the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine. *See RosInvestCo* \u00b6\u00b6 432, 495, Exh. C-1049. Similarly, in the *Quasar* arbitration, claimants presented a Russian tax law expert, Professor Stephan, as well as an expert on the *Russian Civil Code*, Professor Mozolin, who opined, *inter alia*, on the distinction between good and bad faith taxpayers. *See Quasar,* \u00b6 66, 77-78, Exh. R-3383. As in this arbitration, and the *RosInvestCo* arbitration, the Russian Federation\u2019s expert on Russian law was Mr. Konnov. As in the *RosInvestCo* case, the debate turned primarily on the application to Yukos of the anti-abuse doctrine, as opposed to the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine.\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the lengthy cross-examination of Mr. Konnov by Professor Gaillard. The Tribunal recalls again that Professor Gaillard did not challenge Mr. Konnov on the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine but rather sought Respondent's expert's acknowledgement that the Yukos tax optimization scheme complied with the existing legislative framework in Russia as well as in the regions. The Tribunal notes in this context that Claimants stipulate to the existence of the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine in their Reply, but argue that \"neither it nor any other alleged judicial doctrine had previously been applied as in the Yukos case.\"501\n\nReply \u00b6 217, n.368.\n\n497.\n\nAs a matter of background fact, the record before the Tribunal is clear that, at the time of the issuance on 29 December 2003 of the Field Tax Audit Report, the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine, although it had not yet gelled in the way that it did in 2006 in the ruling of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court in Resolution No. 53, had been recognized and applied in some Russian court decisions.\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the eminent Russian tax lawyer, Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, who later represented Yukos in the Russian tax litigation, wrote in 2002 that the doctrine existed and that \"[i]f it appears that parties act both unreasonably and not in good faith then this constitutes a ground for reassessment of the parties' tax liabilities....\"502\n\nS.G. Pepeliaev, *Commentary to the Ruling of the Constitutional Court Ruling of the Russian Federation No. 138-O of July 25, 2001*, Exh. R-352.\n\n499.\n\nBeyond this conclusion, which the Tribunal considers a matter of fact, the Tribunal does not need to determine, as a matter of Russian law, whether any of the activities of the Yukos trading companies in the low tax regions in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 in the implementation of its tax optimization scheme were in violation of this doctrine. As noted in the introduction to the present chapter, it is not the role of the Tribunal in the present arbitrations to sit as a court applying Russian law.\n\n500.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does note that that, in using the available tax benefit legislation in the Russian Federation, the Yukos group principally availed itself of facilities under the laws of Mordovia, the region which represents approximately 78 percent of the 2000 to 2004 tax reassessments against Yukos. Another significant portion of the reassessments relates to Evenkia, while the tax reassessments in ZATO Lesnoy and Trekhgorny represent less than three percent of the total. It is important for the Tribunal to stress that the bad faith doctrine was never used against Yukos prior to December 2003.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn in the next chapter of its Award to the central question which it posed at the beginning of the present chapter: were the December 2003 and the subsequent tax assessments a legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to enforce its tax laws or were they, as Claimants argued, a mere fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos serving as instruments which allowed the premeditated expropriation of all Yukos assets by the State after the arrest of Mr. Lebedev and Mr. Khodorkovsky.\n\n502.\n\nAs will be seen, a crucial consideration for the Tribunal concerns the remedy or sanction of \"re-attribution\", and the application of the \"re-attribution\" remedy to revenues (for purposes of profit tax) without a corresponding \"re-attribution\" of tax filings for purposes of VAT. Also considered in the next chapter is the legitimacy of associated fines levied against Yukos, notably the \"willful offender\" and \"repeat offender\" fines.\n\n**B. THE TAX ASSESSMENTS STARTING IN DECEMBER 2003**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n503.\n\nThis chapter addresses the next crucial facet in the factual narrative of the present arbitration, namely the tax assessments that were issued against Yukos starting in December 2003, the manner in which those assessments were made and how they were reasoned and, eventually, enforced.\n\n504.\n\nThis important review will lead the Tribunal to consider a central question in this case: were the December 2003 and subsequent tax assessments covering the tax years 2000 to 2004 a legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to enforce its tax laws (Respondent's position), or were they a fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos that allowed the premeditated expropriation of all Yukos assets by the State (Claimants' position)? Or does the record rather suggest that the truth lies somewhere between these two positions: could certain taxes in the assessments have legitimately been imposed while others plainly not, and were the consequential sanctions inexorably exacted by Russian authorities so excessively disproportionate as to require an answer to the question described as key by counsel for the claimant in *Quasar*, Mr. O.T. Johnson: \"Why would Russia have treated Yukos as it did if its purpose was to collect taxes?\"503\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 41, Exh. R-3383.\n\n505.\n\nA closely related question concerns the arrests in 2003 of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky: were the arrests and the subsequent convictions of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky (not once but twice), again, a legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to enforce its criminal and tax laws (Respondent's position), or were they a politically motivated attack on these individuals as part of a broader campaign to confiscate the rich assets of Yukos (Claimants' position)?\n\n506.\n\nThe issues raised by the arrests and convictions of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky, and of other individuals connected with Yukos, and the alleged harassment of Yukos management, are addressed in detail in Chapter VIII.C of the present Award. The Tribunal considers it opportune however at this time to comment upon some of the circumstances surrounding those arrests.\n\n507.\n\nClaimants have argued that the arrests, and the broader campaign of harassment and intimidation of the leading officers and employees of Yukos, were prompted by President Putin's desire to retaliate against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos for Mr. Khodorkovsky's political and social activism, which Claimants allege became intolerable for President Putin subsequent to a public encounter between the two men in February 2003.\n\n508.\n\nSpecifically, on 19 February 2003, in the context of a meeting between President Putin and a group of the country's most powerful businessmen, a televised confrontation between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky took place.504 According to the testimony of Dr. Illarionov, President Putin had scheduled regular meetings between himself and the business leaders, facilitated by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs headed by Mr. Arkady Volsky.505\n\nVideo recording and transcript of the meeting of the members of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs with President V. Putin held in the Ekaterininsky Hall, Kremlin, 19 February 2003, Exh. C-1396.\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6 23.\n\n509.\n\nAt the meeting, which would, according to Dr. Illarionov, turn out to be the last of its kind, Mr. Khodorkovsky made a presentation on the topic of corruption. In his presentation, he asserted that corruption in Russia was rife, and that it was \"rotting the Russian Government and the Presidential Administration.\"506 While no names were mentioned, relates Dr. Illarionov, President Putin did discuss the acquisition of Severnaya Neft by Rosneft, for which Rosneft had paid approximately USD 622 million. Dr. Illarionov states that \"[i]t was widely considered that the price was exaggerated and that a portion of the price represented kickbacks to State officials.\"507\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 29.\n\n*Ibid.* (citation omitted).\n\n510.\n\nDr. Illarionov concludes as follows in relation to his understanding of the significance of that encounter:\n\nDuring his closing remarks, the President turned to Mr. Khodorkovsky and stated that everyone knew how various assets, including Yukos, were acquired. The President indicated to Khodorkovsky that \"I return the ball in your corner\".... Later, it became clear that this was a signal to the governing elites that Mr. Khodorkovsky could be attacked and he was no longer tolerated.508\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 31.\n\n511.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal's findings in the previous chapter of the present Award suggest that well before the clash between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky at the February 2003 meeting, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation were challenging the tax benefits claimed by some Yukos entities (in ZATO Lesnoy) and, in a few cases, had made findings adverse to those trading companies. Moreover, the Tribunal recalls, as it did in the previous chapter, that Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were ultimately convicted, *inter alia*, for tax evasion in relation to Yukos' activities in Lesnoy, in which (the record revealed) the authorities had suspended an investigation into the commission of tax crimes because, according to the conclusions in the relevant Resolution, it was not then possible to determine who actually committed the crimes.\n\n512.\n\nRespondent emphasized Yukos' earlier tax problems in its comments on the February 2003 meeting. Respondent noted in its Closing Statement that President Putin publicly told Mr. Khodorkovsky that the political protection or assistance he was allegedly receiving from the Kremlin until that meeting would be removed, and he added that \"we've talked about taxes before.\"509\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 113. Counsel for Respondent interprets this as \"I am not going to protect Mr. Khodorkovsky anymore. He is on his own.\" *Ibid*. The full quote of the President's remark is: \"We have already discussed it with you recently, that your company, for example, has had problems with the payment of taxes.\" Transcript of the 19 February 2003 Meeting, Exh. C-1396.\n\n513.\n\nBased on the extensive record that was presented to it, the Tribunal is unable to accept the proposition that the February 2003 confrontation created Yukos' tax problems and that, but for such a confrontation, Yukos would have avoided any and all tax reassessments against it. While this meeting may well have marked a turning point in the relations between Yukos and the Russian Federation, as the Tribunal observed in the previous chapter, within the senior management of Yukos, and well before February 2003, there were individuals who were aware that the company's tax optimization mechanisms were vulnerable and could be challenged by the tax authorities. Some of the evidence presented to the Tribunal also revealed that there was at least some awareness within Yukos that a successful challenge to the Yukos tax structure would result in \"substantial tax claims\"510 or \"significant losses associated with the additional assessed amount of tax and related interest and penalties\"511 and possibly even criminal liability. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the tax assessments and decisions against Yukos led not just to \"substantial tax claims\" or to \"significant losses\" but to its bankruptcy and destruction, and to the transfer of the principal assets of Yukos to Rosneft, a company controlled by the Russian Federation.\n\nE-mail from P.N. Maly to O.V. Sheyko, 14 May 2002, Exh. R-184. *See* paragraph 491 above.\n\nFacsimile transmission from Natalia Kuznetsova to Stephen Wilson, 23 July 2002 p.134, Exh. R-1477. *See* paragraph 491 above.\n\n514.\n\nThe crucial question addressed in this chapter of the Award, therefore, is whether Claimants have discharged their burden of proof and established that the tax assessments, and the enforcement processes of the Russian Federation which followed, are more consistent with the conclusion that they evidence a punitive campaign against Yukos and its principal beneficial owners with sanctions entirely disproportionate to the company's tax liability, rather than with the conclusion that they were a legitimate exercise of tax enforcement.\n\n515.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it may well be that, while Yukos was vulnerable on some aspects of its tax optimization scheme, and possibly even would have faced \"substantial tax claims\" that might have resulted in \"significant losses,\" principally because of the sham-like nature of some elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions, the State apparatus decided to take advantage of that vulnerability by launching a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena.\n\n516.\n\nDr. Illarionov asserts in his witness statement that \"various possible justifications for Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest and Yukos' dismantlement were tested in the Fall of 2003.\"512 He then goes on to list fifteen \"theories\" that, he says, \"were gradually created as a smoke screen and advanced for public consumption,\" including \"tax evasion schemes.\"513 In other words, Yukos' tax arrangements in certain low-tax regions (some of which, notably in ZATO Lesnoy, as related in Chapter VIII.A, were being scrutinized as of 1999 by the tax authorities and were suspected of being \"shams\") may have served as a plausible pretext for the State apparatus to crush Mr. Khodorkovsky and expropriate Yukos. In this chapter, the Tribunal considers evidence that is crucial to its determination of this central issue in the present proceedings. The Tribunal observes again that its conclusions in this chapter are only concerned with factual findings. The determination of the relevant legal issues under the provisions of the ECT will be considered later, in Part X of the Award.\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6 36.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**2. Chronology of the Tax Assessments and Related Decisions**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nOn 29 December 2003, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation issued the first of five tax assessments against Yukos based on the alleged abuse by Yukos of its tax optimization scheme. These five assessments were:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tax Year** | **Date of Tax** **Audit Report** | **Date of Tax** **Decision** | **Total Amount Assessed** **(USD billion)** |\n| **2000** | 29 Dec. 2003 (Exh. C-103) | 14 Apr. 2004 (Exh. C-104) | 3.48 |\n| **2001** | 30 June 2004 (Exh. R-345) | 2 Sept. 2004 (Exh. C-155) | 4.10 |\n| **2002** | 29 Oct. 2004 (Exh. R-346) | 16 Nov. 2004 (Exh. C-175) | 6.76 |\n| **2003** | 19 Nov. 2004 (Exh. R-1583) | 6 Dec. 2004 (Exh. C-190) | 6.10 |\n| **2004** | 27 Dec. 2005 (Exh. C-200) | 17 Mar. 2006 (Exh. R-1539) | 3.74 |\n| **Total for Tax Years 2000-2004** | **24.18** |\n\n518.\n\nFor each year that the Tax Ministry re-assessed Yukos a Repeat/Field Tax Audit Report and a Decision were issued. For ease of reference, in this chapter, each Audit Report and Decision will be referred to by the tax year to which it relates. For example, the Tax Ministry audited Yukos' activities in the year 2000. It issued Field Tax Audit Report No. 08-1/1 on 29 December 2003 (\" **2000 Audit Report** \"). It issued Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 to hold the taxpayer fiscally liable for a tax offense on 14 April 2004 (\" **2000 Decision** \").\n\n519.\n\nIn the subsections below, the Tribunal records, for each tax year, the extensive chronology of tax assessments and related decisions of the tax authorities, bailiffs and Russian courts. These events as such are not disputed by the Parties.\n\n**(a) The 2000 Decision**\n-------------------------\n\n520.\n\nAs noted above, on 29 December 2003, the 2000 Audit Report, was issued.514 It was followed, on 14 April 2004, by the 2000 Decision holding the taxpayer liable for a tax offense.515 It levied the following amounts in tax arrears:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **COMPANY** | **TAX BENEFITS** | **VAT** | **TOTAL** |\n| **Alta Trade** | RUR 2,491,817.840 | RUR 467,486,102 | RUR 2,959,303.942 (USD 104 Million) |\n| **Mars XXII** | RUR 18,393,165 |  | RUR 18,393,165 (USD 643,361) |\n| **Ratmir** | RUR 4,336,209.757 | RUR 1,770,256.037 | RUR 6,106,465.794 (USD 213,593,448) |\n| **Yukos-M** | RUR 14,456,555.351 | RUR 9,697,309.558 | RUR 24,153,864.909 (USD 845 Million) |\n| **Yu-Mordovia** | RUR 2,210,007.592 | RUR 2,045,653.454 | RUR 4,255,661.046 (USD 149 Million) |\n| **Sibirskaya** | RUR 240,437,174 |  | RUR 240,437,174 (USD 8.4 Million) |\n| **Business-Oil** | RUR 1,584,766.950 PN:\\* RUR 36,184,822 |  | RUR 1,620,951.772 (USD 56.7 Million) |\n| **Mitra** | RUR 27,124,001 |  | RUR 27,124,001 (USD 948,750) |\n| **Vald-Oil** | RUR 1,304,431.717 PN:\\* RUR 57,784,864 |  | RUR 1,362,216.581 (USD 47,647,943) |\n| **Grace** | RUR 20,247,201 |  | RUR 20,247,201 (USD 708,212) |\n| **Muskron** | RUR 7,398,094 |  | RUR 7,398,094 (USD 258,772) |\n| **Nortex** | RUR 3,152,537.572 |  | RUR 3,152,537.572 (USD 110 Million) |\n| **Quercus** | RUR 3,031,422.237 |  | RUR 3,031,422.237 (USD 106,033,825) |\n| **Virtus** | RUR 2,359,700 |  | RUR 2,359,700 (USD 82,538) |\n| **Yuksar** | RUR 95,875,131 |  | RUR 95,875,131 (USD 3. 353,544) |\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **COMPANY** | **TAX BENEFITS** | **VAT** | **TOTAL** |\n| **Interneft** | RUR 224,642 |  | RUR 224,642 (USD 7,858)\\*\\* |\n| **Petroleum** **Trading** | RUR 23,333,365 |  | RUR 23,333,365 (USD 816,160) |\n\n\\* \"PN\" indicates taxes considered unpaid as they were paid with promissory notes.\n\n\\*\\* Interneft is ultimately removed from this list by the Decision of 26 May 2004, for not being legally \"interdependent.\"516\n\n2000 Audit Report, Exh.

Also on 14 April 2004, a related fine was issued, imposing penalties in the amount of RUR 19,195,696.780 (USD 671 million).518 Payment of this sum was also due on 16 April 2004. The total amount payable within two days by Yukos was thus approximately USD 3.48 billion.\n\nTax Payment Demand No. 14-3-05/1610-8, 14 April 2004, Exh.

C-110.\n\n523.\n\nYukos began parallel proceedings to those initiated by the Tax Ministry, challenging the 2000 Decision as unlawful. On 19 May 2004, Judge Cheburashkina granted interim relief *suspending* the effect of the 2000 Decision, pending a judgment on the merits of Yukos' petition in respect of the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision.523 In her decision, Judge Cheburashkina wrote that the seizure of such assets would \"cause significant damage to the Applicant's activities and make it impossible to execute the judicial act\" and that \"the Applicant has presented evidence demonstrating that the consequences indicated in Article 90(2) of the RF Arbitrazh Procedure Code might arise, and that serious damage and disruption might be caused to production activities.\"524\n\nRuling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to suspend the effect of Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14 April 2004, Case No. A40-21839/04-75-276 p. 2, 19 May 2004, Exh. C-112.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n524.\n\nOn 26 May 2004, Yukos made a motion in the collection proceedings (those initiated by the Tax Ministry) to join the Republic of Mordovia in those proceedings.525 The motion was not successful. Presumably, Yukos sought the joinder of Mordovia, by far the major focus of its trading companies' activities and investments, in the expectation that Mordovian officials would support the legitimacy of Yukos' tax optimization procedures and attest to the value of Yukos' substantial investments in Mordovia.\n\nMotion to join a third party to the proceeding, Case No. A40-17699-04-09-241, 26 May 2004, Exh. C-115.\n\n525.\n\nIn the collection proceedings, the court had also denied Yukos' motion to stay the proceedings.526 In a decision dated 26 May 2004 and released on 28 May 2004, Judge Grechishkin of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court granted the Tax Ministry's petition, allowing the collection of tax arrears, interest and fines in the amount of RUR 99,375,110.548 (USD 3.48 billion) pertaining to the 2000 Decision.527\n\nRuling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-17699-04-09-241, 14 May, 2004, Exh.

C-116.\n\n526.\n\nJudge Grechishkin found that Yukos had acted in bad faith,528 that the use by the trading companies of tax benefits was illegal because it was \"not aimed at strengthening the economy of the Republic of Mordovia\" but rather was used to \"evade payment of taxes.\"529 The judge adopted the same reasoning as the Tax Ministry on the VAT issue, writing that: \"In order to use its right to the benefit, the taxpayer had to declare its right and confirm its right by documents in accordance with the current legislation.... The taxpayer\u2014OAO Yukos Oil Company\u2014did not declare its desire to use its benefit either in 2000 or later.\"530 However, this judgment could not be executed by the Tax Ministry as the interim relief in the parallel proceedings prevented enforcement until a determination of the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision was made.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 14.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 15.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 19.\n\n527.\n\nOn 11 June 2004, Judge Cheburashkina, the presiding judge in the case brought by Yukos against the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision, was challenged by the Tax Ministry for bias towards Yukos in the granting of interim relief on 19 May 2004.531 The Tax Ministry cited several reasons as a basis for her removal for bias towards Yukos, including: the allegation that the interim measures \"did not comply with the principles of justice in a democratic constitutional State\";532 the allegation that the judge granted a \"recess solely for OAO Yukos Oil Company to file a petition to stay proceedings in the [parallel] case to collect tax arrears, interest and fines,\" which the Tax Ministry saw as \"evidence of the Judge's interest in the outcome of the proceedings in favor of the taxpayer\";533 her \"behavior\" in the preliminary court proceedings;534 the allegation that the judge declined the petition of the Tax Ministry to abandon these proceedings in favour of the other set of collection proceedings initiated by the Tax Ministry;535 and the allegation that the Tax Ministry was not granted extra time to copy documents to bring to court.536 The challenge was upheld by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court the same day.\n\nRussian Federation Ministry of Taxes and Levies, Challenge to Judge N.P.

Mikhailova, a deputy chair of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, was appointed to replace Judge Cheburashkina.537 On 22 June 2004, Judge Mikhailova set the date of 19 July 2004 for the hearing of the merits phase of the case on the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision. She also directed the Tax Ministry to provide originals of the documents rather than photocopies and to organize the documents, including explanations \"in order to confirm which circumstances they support.\"538\n\nRuling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. 21839/04-76-276 p. 1, 22 June 2004, Exh.

On the same day, the Field Tax Audit Report for 2001 was released.545 It assessed taxes, interest, and fines totaling approximately USD 4.1 billion.546\n\nRepeat Field Tax Audit Report No. 30-3-14/1 (2001), 30 June 2004, Exh.

The Tribunal notes that while this seizure was not directly related to Yukos' trading companies, as will be seen later, it limited the options available to Yukos to satisfy the payment demands it was facing.\n\nResolutions of Bailiff A.Yu.

In the letter, Yukos petitioned the Ministry, \"[i]n consideration of the unprecedented nature of the sum that is subject to collection from OAO Yukos Oil Company\" for deferral of, or the opportunity to pay in installments, the amount imposed by the collection decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued on 28 May 2004.552 When he gave evidence, Mr. Theede acknowledged that the letter was not perfect (the proposals did not have a great deal of detail) but he described the letter as an attempt \"to create a dialogue [between Yukos and the Russian Federation].\"553\n\nLetter from Steven Theede to Alexei Kudrin, signed by Bruce Misamore, 16 July 2004, Exh.

The same day, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court found that a 14 July 2004 bailiff's resolution to seize shares of YNG was issued in error and that, instead, Yukos' 20 percent stake in Sibneft should have been seized.558 The court ruled that federal law on enforcement proceedings outlines a priority order for enforcement against a debtor's assets and enforcement against lower assets is only possible when the higher assets are insufficient to settle the debts.559 Since the shares in YNG were of a lower priority than the more liquid Sibneft shares, they should not have been seized before the Sibneft shares.560 Claimants consider this to be a \"rare victory\" by Yukos before the Russian courts.561\n\nDecision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-36718/04-79-445, p. 26, 6 August 2004, Exh.

The court quashed the 6 August 2004 decision to give priority to enforcement against the 20 percent stake in Sibneft. The court found that, as the shares in YNG had been issued by YNG after its privatization, they were not related to primary production and thus could be considered as a higher priority.564 As Yukos had not discharged its debt \"voluntarily,\" the court found that the YNG shares were part of an inventory legally open to seizure by the bailiffs.565\n\nResolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, Case No. 09AP-1554/04-AK, p. 4, 23 August 2004, Exh.

The court stated that \"[t]he tax legislation does not stipulate any deadline for voluntary fulfillment by the taxpayer of the demand to pay taxes. Upon issue of the Claim, the Inspectorate is entitled to stipulate a time period for its voluntary execution.\"586 This decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court was announced on the same day as a *one* -day payment demand, relating to Decision No. 52/896 holding the taxpayer liable for a tax offense (\" **2002 Decision** \"), became due.

C-201.\n\n**(f) Observation**\n-------------------\n\n579.\n\nThis chronology of the five tax assessments against Yukos for the years 2000-2004 and related decisions of the Tax Ministry, the Russian courts and the bailiffs is lengthy and tedious. But it is very much part of the factual matrix which will inform the Tribunal when it answers the question posed at the outset of the chapter: \"Why would Russia have treated Yukos as it did if its purpose was to collect taxes?\"\n\n**3. The Taxes Assessed Against Yukos**\n---------------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nThe principal taxes assessed against Yukos were profit tax and VAT. Together they account for over 95 percent of the total amount of more than USD 24 billion including related fines and interest. Details in relation to profit tax and certain other revenue-based taxes are provided in Subsection (a) below. Details in relation to VAT are set out in Subsection (b) below.\n\n**(a) Profit Tax and Other Revenue-based Taxes**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nAs shown in the table below, for the tax years 2000 to 2004, the tax authorities imposed a demand for the payment of profit tax (including interest and fines) ranging from USD 261 million to USD 4 billion per year, for a total of **USD 9.5 billion**. This represents some 39 percent of the total tax claims levied against Yukos in the reassessments for those years. Other revenue-based taxes (also including interest and fines) assessed against Yukos added approximately USD 1 billion to the total. The breakdown by individual tax year is as follows:617\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (IN USD BILLION) | **2000** | **2001** | **2002** | **2003** | **2004** | **Total** | **%** |\n| Profit tax | 1,356 | 1,695 | 4,005 | 2,184 | 0,261 | 9,502 | 39.3 |\n| Property tax | 0,006 | 0,010 | 0,009 | 0,013 | 0,003 | 0,039 | 0.2 |\n| Road users tax | 0,258 | 0,002 | 0,001 | - | - | 0,261 | 1.1 |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (IN USD BILLION) | **2000** | **2001** | **2002** | **2003** | **2004** | **Total** | **%** |\n| Tax for the maintenance of housing, social and culture facilities | 0,209 | - | - | - | - | 0,209 | 0.9 |\n| Tax on sales of combustibles and lubricants | 0,570 | - | - | - | - | 0,570 | 2.4 |\n| Advertisement tax | - | - | - | 0,006 | 0,002 | 0,008 | 0.03 |\n| **Total** | **2,399** | **1,707** | **4,015** | **2,203** | **0,266** | **10,589** | **43.93** |\n\nFigures derived from Details of Yukos' Alleged Tax Reassessments, Exh. C-593; *see also* Claimants' Opening Slides, pp. 62-63.\n\n582.\n\nThe reasoning by the tax authorities for the imposition of profit tax and the other sundry revenue-based taxes did not vary substantively from year to year. For purposes of the present chapter, the Tribunal will therefore consider the documents relating to the 2000 tax year.\n\n583.\n\nThe 2000 Audit Report concludes that, during the year 2000, Yukos knowingly and deliberately operated a tax evasion scheme through the use of \"sham dependent entities\". The Audit Report describes the \"discovery\"618 of the scheme as follows:\n\nDuring the field tax audit, non-payment by OAO Yukos Oil Company of corporate profit tax, road users tax, property tax and housing support tax, arising from the use of an unlawful scheme involving evasion of tax through artificial creation of sham companies in the oil and oil product movement chain, which were registered in territories with a beneficial tax regime, was discovered.\n\nThe aim of using this scheme was non-payment of taxes on the sum of revenue (income) received from the sale of oil and oil products. For this purpose OAO Yukos Oil Company created sham dependent entities, which functioned as oil and oil product owners (hereinafter - the \"owners\"). These entities were registered in territories in which a beneficial tax regime applied (Closed administrative-territorial formations) [CATF], regions of the Russian Federation, providing tax benefits on investments). OAO Yukos Oil Company had control over the operations, conducted by the oil and oil product \"owners\", by participating in the transactions as an intermediary (confirmed by documents shown in Attachment No. *14* to the field tax audit document) or by bringing in other entities dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company to participate in transactions as an intermediary.619\n\nAccording to Mr. Konnov the use of the term \"discovered\" at the end of the first paragraph of the cited passage of the Audit Report (\"[...] non-payment [...] of corporate profit tax [...] arising from the use of an unlawful scheme involving evasion of taxes [...] was discovered.\") is a mistranslation. Mr. Konnov suggested that the original wording in Russian is better translated as \"the audit concluded or established that [...].\" Transcript, Day 13 at 167; *see also* Respondent's Closing Slides, p. 97.\n\n2000 Audit Report, pp. 7-8, Exh. C-103.\n\n584.\n\nThe 2000 Audit Report continues:\n\nThe audit established that the actual owner of the oil and oil products was OAO Yukos Oil Company. The oil was in fact acquired and transferred for refining, and the oil and oil products sold, by OAO Yukos Oil Company, as evidenced by the actual movement of oil and oil products from production entities to oil refineries or to oil bases controlled by OAO Yukos Oil Company, as confirmed in the trade and transport documents, and also the direct participation by OAO Yukos Oil Company in all the operations. The following also provides proof that the oil and oil products actually belonged to OAO Yukos Oil Company [ *sic* ] and that the tax evasion scheme applied by them was illegal:\n\n- interdependence of persons participating in the transactions and their control by OAO Yukos Oil Company;\n\n- registration of the \"owners\" in territories with beneficial tax regimes;\n\n- non-activity by the \"owners\" in their places of registration;\n\n- the fictitious commission payments to OAO Yukos Oil Company, which are much smaller than the actual payments made on the intermediary market;\n\n- the understated prices of acquisition of oil from production entities and from other sham companies;\n\n- the conduct of accounting in all the entities by OOO Yukos-Invest, or by Yukos-FBTs OOO, which are dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company;\n\n- the opening of accounts for all the entities in the same banks, which are dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company;\n\n- the utilisation of promissory note settlements between the entities, or settlements by means of mutual set-off.620\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 8-9.\n\n585.\n\nThe 2000 Audit Report goes into great detail in explaining the tax benefits that were claimed by each of the trading entities. The Audit Reports for subsequent tax years generally follow the same form. They audit OAO Yukos Oil Company and the trading companies. They are divided into separate sections for each trading company; some of the later reassessments also include sums assessed directly against OAO Yukos Oil Company. The sections on the trading companies generally begin with an overview of the incorporation, ownership, and capital of the company. They then affirm that the directors of the company and its operations are not based in the region in which it had been incorporated, which according to the authors of the Audit Reports, shows that the company could not benefit from preferential taxation agreements offered to companies operating in the low-tax regions. The reassessments then assert that the trading companies are \"interrelated\" and thus \"dependent\" on OAO Yukos Oil Company, thereby allowing OAO Yukos Oil Company to fraudulently claim taxation benefits.\n\n586.\n\nThe 2000 Audit Report concludes in relation to the tax evasion by Yukos as follows:\n\nThe tax evasion by OAO Yukos Oil Company, through registration of sham companies in territories with preferential tax rates, with the exclusive aim of evading tax, and which... did not actually trade or engage in any activity in those territories or indeed anywhere else, or invest any money in the economies of the relevant constituent entities of the Russian Federation, and which, therefore, illegally applied the additional tax benefits, indicates that OAO Yukos Oil Company acted in bad faith.\n\nAccording to the Russian Federation Constitutional Court's 25 July 2001 Ruling No. 138-O interpreting the provision contained in Article 3(7) of the RF Tax Code, in the area of taxation there is a presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers.\n\nAs is evident from the above-mentioned Ruling, the presumption of taxpayer good faith, enshrined in the RF Tax Code, presupposes an obligation on the tax authorities to prove any bad faith on the part of taxpayers in the manner set out by the Russian Federation Tax Code, and to conduct the necessary audits in order to establish such bad faith with the aim of ensuring a balance between state and private interests.\n\nSimilar provisions are contained in RF Constitutional Court Rulings Nos. 4-O dated 10.01.2002 and 108-O dated 14.05.2002.\n\nThe Judgements of the Presidium of the RF Supreme Court of Arbitration Nos. 9408/00 dated 18.09.2001, 7374/01 dated 18.06.2002, 6294/01 dated 05.11.2002 and 11259/02 dated 17.12.2002, and a letter from the Deputy President of the RF Supreme Court of Arbitration No. S5-5/up-342 dated 17.04.2002, also point out the need to examine the question of bad faith on the part of taxpayers, that is, their commission of deliberate acts aimed at not fulfilling the constitutional obligation to pay taxes.\n\nThe above-mentioned circumstances, namely OAO Yukos Oil Company carrying out operations involving the purchase and sale of oil and oil products, indicate Yukos Oil Company's OAO bad faith, which evidences its deliberate actions in evading payment of taxes through the application of illegal schemes.\n\n... According to the Regulations of 01.01.2000 on the accounting policy for the year 2000, in OAO Yukos Oil Company for purposes of taxation (in order to calculate corporate profit tax, value added tax, Road users tax and housing support tax) revenue from the sale of products and goods (work, services) was determined on the basis of actual payments.\n\nFor purposes of taxation revenue was indicated by the entity in the accounts in the line 010 of the account using form No. 2 \"Profit and Loss Account\" taking into account the Information on the procedure for determination of data indicated in line 1 of \"Calculation of tax on actual profit\" in a sum of RUR 36,396,312.000 (RUR 36,264,009.000 in Form No. 2, \"Profit and Loss Account\" + RUR 132,303,000 according to the Information on the procedure for determination of data indicated in p. 1 of \"Calculation of tax on actual profit\").\n\nAccording to the data of the audit, revenue from the sale of goods (work, services) amounted to RUR 245,907,712.162.\n\nThus, the revenue from the sale of goods (work, services) in the sum of RUR 209,511,400.162 was understated as a result of non-indication in the accounting registers of the revenue which had been received as a result of utilising a scheme with the participation of sham entities which were dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company and which had been created for the purpose of tax evasion on the part of OAO Yukos Oil Company....621\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 14-15.\n\n587.\n\nThe 16 November 2004 decision of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal upheld the 2000 Decision to hold Yukos liable for all these taxes. The English translation of the judgment is 25 pages long. The key passages, which the Tribunal believes should be set out so as to give visibility to the court's reasoning (which the Tribunal will consider later as part of the totality of the evidence), follow:\n\nOAO Yukos Oil Company did not agree with the decision of the Court and filed an appeal requesting that the decision of the Court of First Instance be quashed and that the presented claim be granted in full: to declare unlawful the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and Levies Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 to Hold the Taxpayer Fiscally Liable for a Tax Offense.\n\n... The interested party, the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and Levies, argues that the Court of First Instance legally and justifiably found that the decision and resolution issued in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241 [ *i.e*., the 26 May 2004 decision], which involves the same parties as Case No. A40-21839/04-76-276 [ *i.e.*, the case before the Court of Appeal], established the legality and validity of the disputed RF Tax Ministry Decision, the circumstances surrounding OAO Yukos Oil Company's performance of actions aimed at evading taxes through the artificial formation of entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates and their \"participation\" in the chain of movement of oil and oil products, and the illegality and invalidity of OAO Yukos Oil Company's arguments regarding the illegality of the RF Tax Ministry's disputed Decision.\n\n\u2026\n\nPursuant to Article 69(2) of the RF Arbitrazh Procedure Code, facts established by the legally effective judicial act of an arbitrazh court in connection with a previously heard case do not need to be proven again when the arbitrazh court hears another case involving the same parties.\n\nThe Court Decision of 26.05.2004 in Case No. A40-17669/ 04-109-241 established that the tax authority did not breach the requirements of Article 87 of the RF Tax Code when issuing Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004. The Court found that RF Tax Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 is consistent with the Russian Federation Tax Code, federal laws adopted pursuant to the RF Tax Code, and other tax laws that were in effect during the audit period.\n\n... The Court found that the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates and named in the RF Tax Ministry's Decision (Yu-Mordovia OOO, Alta-Trade OOO, Ratmir OOO, Mars XXII OOO, Jupiter XXIV OOO, ZAO Yukos-M, Saturn XXV OOO, Yuksar OOO, Siberian Transportation Company OOO, Quercus OOO, Muskron OOO, Nortex OOO, Grace OOO, Colrain OOO, Virtus OOO, Plast OOO, Mitra OOO, Vald-Oil OOO, Business-Oil OOO, Staf OOO, Petroleum-Trading OOO) were related to each other and dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. The relationship of all the entities and their dependence on OAO Yukos Oil Company, as one of the items of evidence of bad faith on the part of the Applicant which applied the illegal tax evasion scheme is also confirmed by the fact that the same individuals were the founders and (or) officers in the aforementioned entities.\n\n... The Court rightly found that control of the oil and oil-product transactions performed by the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates was exercised OAO Yukos Oil Company by means of participation in the transactions as an intermediary or by means of involvement of other entities, dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company, as intermediaries in the transactions. The entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates concluded agency agreements for the purchase of crude oil with OAO Yukos Oil Company. In turn, OAO Yukos Oil Company, acting on behalf of entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates, purchased oil from producing entities or from other suppliers. Thereafter, the crude oil purchased via the agent (OAO Yukos Oil Company) was sold to buyers (Russian or foreign) via this same OAO Yukos Oil Company (as the commission agent or the agent) or transferred for refining to refineries which were subsidiaries of OAO Yukos Oil Company. Apart from agency agreements, purchase and sale agreements were drawn up for purchase of oil, according to conditions thereof, OAO Yukos Oil Company \"sold\" oil from the resources of its producing entities - OAO Yuganskneftegaz, OAO Samaraneftegaz, and OAO Tomskneft. Unlike OAO Yukos Oil Company and its producing companies, which according to the customs cargo declarations were shippers, the entities registered in regions with preferential tax rates were not mentioned in the export documents.\n\nThe dependence of entities, registered in territories with preferential tax rates, on OAO Yukos Oil Company and the control by OAO Yukos Oil Company of all transactions is also confirmed by the fact that the records of all transactions associated with the purchase and transfer of oil for refining, as well as with the sale of oil and oil products (including accounting records) were kept by Yukos-Invest OOO and Yukos-FBTs, which are dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. Furthermore, the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates entered into production management service contracts with OOO Yukos RM, which is also dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. The financial statements and tax filings were submitted to the tax authorities by post from the address at which OAO Yukos Oil Company was located according to the invoices. Furthermore, this address was the mailing address of OOO Yukos-Moscow, which is the executive body of OAO Yukos Oil Company.\n\nThe accounts of all entities are opened with the same banks, i.e. OAO Trust Investment Bank, OAO Bank Menatep St. Petersburg and Bank Solidarnost, where OAO Yukos Oil Company was a shareholder.\n\nIn addition to concluding agreements on the purchase and sale of oil and oil products, these entities also conducted activities involving the purchase and sale of promissory notes, which they used in settlements with one another and with OAO Yukos Oil Company for oil and oil products. Or by purchasing and selling promissory notes, these entities returned to OAO Yukos Oil Company funds supposedly earned for oil they sold. Therefore, the business of these entities related to the purchase and sale of promissory notes is a business related to the purchase and sale of oil and oil products. Therefore, the Court lawfully and justifiably rejected the Applicant's argument that the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates engaged in business activities other than the sale of oil and oil products.\n\nThe Applicant's assertion that the determination of bad faith is possible exclusively in the instances of payment of taxes through insolvent banks is unfounded, as the finding that it is necessary for the tax authorities to conduct audits and determine bad faith was made by the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation based on the interpretation of Article 3(7) of the RF Tax Code, i.e. the presumption of the taxpayers' good faith. From this follows the obligation of taxpayers to act in good faith when conducting any actions associated with the discharge of their tax liability and the right of the tax authorities to determine bad faith on the part of taxpayers committing actions (inaction) intentionally aimed at tax evasion.\n\nIn light of the foregoing circumstances, the Court rightly found that the owner of the oil and oil products was OAO Yukos Oil Company. The purchase and transfer of the oil for refining and the sale of oil and oil products were actually carried out by OAO Yukos Oil Company as the owner.\n\n... The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, in Ruling No. 138-O of 25.07.2001, points out that, according to the tenor of Article 3(7) of the RF Tax Code, the presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers is in effect in the area of tax relations. For the purpose of determination of bad faith on the part of taxpayers, the tax authorities have the right\u2014in order to ensure a balance between State and private interests\u2014to carry out the necessary audit and to file with the arbitrazh courts claims that ensure the receipt of taxes into the budget. In light of the above, in order to ensure a balance between State and private interests, the tax authorities have the right to conduct audits for the purpose of determination of the actual owner of sold property and for determination of bad faith on the part thereof, expressed in the application of a tax evasion scheme.\n\nThe fact that OAO Yukos Oil Company had the rights of possession, use and disposal with respect to the oil and oil products, and at its own discretion performed with respect thereto any actions, including alienation, transfer for processing, etc. through sham entities dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company was established by the legally effective judicial acts in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241.\n\nThe Court therefore rightly does not accept the argument of the Applicant and the third party regarding the non-compliance with law and the factual circumstances of the assessment of taxes to OAO Yukos Oil Company as the owner of the oil and oil products.\n\n...The circumstances established by the Court concerning the transactions of OAO Yukos Oil Company associated with the purchase and sale of oil and oil products and in their interconnection and collectively indicate bad faith on the part of OAO Yukos Oil Company, which is reflected in the intentional actions aimed at tax evasion by means of application of illegal schemes, as a result of which the RF Tax Ministry lawfully held OAO Yukos Oil Company liable pursuant to Article 122(3) of the Russian Federation Tax Code, for the intentional failure to pay or an incomplete payment of tax as a result of reduction of the tax base, other incorrect tax calculations, or other unlawful actions (inaction), in the form of a fine in the amount of 40 percent of the unpaid tax amount, as established by the judicial acts in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241.\n\n...Therefore, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in its decision legally and justifiably found that RF Tax Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 to Hold the Taxpayer Fiscally Liable for a Tax Offense is legal and well-founded in part and complies with the Russian Federation Tax Code, federal laws adopted pursuant to the RF Tax Code, and other tax laws that were in effect during the audit period (the Russian Federation Law No. 2116-1 of 27.12.91 \"On Corporate Profit Tax\", the Russian Federation Law No. 1759-1 of 18.10.1991 \"On Road Funds in the Russian Federation\", the Russian Federation Law No. 2118-1 of 27.12.1991 \"On Fundamentals of the Tax System\", the Russian Federation Law No. 2030-1 of 13.12.1991 \"On Corporate Property Tax\" and the Russian Federation Law No. 1992-1 of 06.12.1991 \"On Value Added Tax\").622\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nResolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, Case No. 09AP-4078/04-AK, 16 November 2004, Exh. C-147.\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal will discuss the key elements of this decision, notably its endorsement of the assessment of taxes against Yukos on the basis that Yukos was the \"actual owner\" of the oil and oil products, in Section VIII.B.5 below.\n\n**(b) VAT**\n-----------\n\n589.\n\nAs shown in the table below, for the tax years 2000 to 2004, the tax authorities imposed a demand for the payment of VAT (including interest and fines) ranging from USD 1 billion to USD 4 billion per year, for a total of **USD 13.59 billion**. This represents some 56 percent of the total tax claims levied against Yukos in the reassessments for those years. The breakdown by individual tax year is as follows:623\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **2000** | **2001** | **2002** | **2003** | **2004** | **Total** | **%** |\n| **VAT** | Tax Arrears | 0.49 | 0.99 | 1.24 | 1.93 | 1.73 | 6.38 | 26.39 |\n| Interest & Fines | 0.59 | 1.40 | 1.50 | 1.97 | 1.75 | 7.21 | 29.82 |\n|  | **Sub-total** | **1.08** | **2.39** | **2.74** | **3.90** | **3.48** | **13.59** | **56.2** |\n| Other taxes | Tax Arrears | 1.19 | 0.75 | 1.91 | 1.16 | 0.16 | 5.17 | 21.38 |\n| Interest & Fines | 1.21 | 0.96 | 2.11 | 1.05 | 0.10 | 5.42 | 22.46 |\n|  | Sub-total | 2.40 | 1.71 | 4.02 | 2.21 | 0.26 | 10.59 | 43.8 |\n| TOTAL | 3.48 | 4.10 | 6.76 | 6.11 | 3.74 | 24.18 | 100 |\n\nFigures derived from Details of Yukos' Alleged Tax Reassessments, Exh. C-593; *see also* Claimants' Opening Slides, pp. 62-63.\n\n590.\n\nThe reasoning of the tax authorities for the imposition of VAT payments did not change from year to year. For purposes of this chapter, the Tribunal will therefore consider solely the documents relating to the 2000 tax year.\n\n591.\n\nBut before turning to the reasoning for the imposition of VAT payments on Yukos, the Tribunal will review some features of the VAT regulations of the Russian Federation.\n\n592.\n\nIn Russia, VAT is a federal tax levied at uniform rates throughout the Federation. As a result, all companies pay VAT regardless of the region where they are registered, under identical terms and conditions. There are accordingly no additional VAT benefits for companies incorporated in low-tax regions. The applicable rate of VAT to oil and oil products was 20% in 2000 to 2003 and 18 percent in 2004.624\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 56. *See also* Articles 165(9) and 164(3), Russian Tax Code, Exhs. R-1484 and R-1483.\n\n593.\n\nIf the products were exported, they were either exempt from VAT (2000) or subject to a zero percent VAT rate (2001 onwards).625 The zero percent rate is not automatic, but available when the taxpayer files a monthly or quarterly VAT return.626 It is common ground between the Parties that, in the years 1999 to 2003, the Yukos trading companies filed the VAT returns for their exports of oil.627\n\nAs a result, exporting companies did not charge VAT to their foreign customers and were entitled to the refunds on the VAT charged by their own suppliers. *See* Dubov WS \u00b6 37; *see also* Memorial \u00b6 319.\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 53-58.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 320-21. *See also* Decision No. 23 on partial refusal to refund/offset VAT (Alta-Trade), 15 June 2000, Exh.

C-1117.\n\n594.\n\nThe 2000 Decision notes that Yukos failed to reflect revenue from the sale of products \"arising from the use of an unlawful scheme involving evasion of tax through artificial creation of sham companies in the oil and oil product movement chain, which were registered in territories with a beneficial tax regime.\"628 The 2000 Decision then states:\n\nThe aim of using this scheme was non-payment of corporate profit tax value added tax, road users tax, tax on sales of fuel and lubricants (hereinafter referred to as F&L) and housing support tax on the sum of revenue (income) received from the sale of oil and oil products.629\n\n2000 Decision, p. 1, Exh. C-104.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n595.\n\nThe VAT at issue was the VAT in relation to which the Yukos trading companies had already obtained an exemption or zero percent rate, not VAT that could be said to arise from new or additional transactions or from a finding that the oil or oil products had not actually been exported. During his cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Konnov explained that the reasoning behind the imposition of VAT on Yukos is very clear from the original Russian-language version of the decision. The 2000 Decision states (in the Russian language original) that it is Yukos, as the actual exporter, which must file the VAT return in order to get the VAT tax benefit which had earlier been granted to its trading entities. Mr. Konnov explained:\n\nA. And then there is a sentence which I don't see in the English text, which says:\n\n\"Based on the foregoing, the actual export operations were conducted by OAO NK Yukos and tax claim were provided to ZAO Yukos-M.\"\n\nAnd that's the sentence on the point; for some reason it's not in the English text.\n\nSo I agree maybe it's not a detailed sentence, but what it clearly tells to any tax lawyer, or to Yukos, I think: that Yukos - sorry, Yukos-M claimed the tax benefits and was provided the tax benefits, and the actual exporter who must file the return is Yukos.630\n\nTranscript, Day 14 at 236.\n\n596.\n\nIn other words, while it was the trading companies that were set up in Yukos' tax structure as the entities exporting oil and oil products to purchasers abroad that filed VAT returns to claim the exemption or zero percent rate that applies to export transactions, and in spite of the fact that the trading companies had already qualified for the exemption or zero percent rate on the basis of duly submitted VAT returns, the tax authorities subsequently determined that Yukos itself was the \"actual exporter\", and that it was Yukos, instead of the trading entities, that had to qualify for the exemption or zero percent rate. Since Yukos had not filed the returns itself, it was deemed to have failed to file the VAT returns required to benefit from the exemption or zero percent rate.\n\n597.\n\nThe judgment of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that confirmed the decision for the 2000 tax year rejected Yukos' appeal against the VAT assessments:\n\nThe court does not accept the arguments of OAO Yukos Oil Company regarding unlawfulness of the RF Tax Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 relating to assessment of the value added tax. It follows from the RF Tax Ministry Decision that the tax authority assessed VAT reimbursed to entities registered in the territories with preferential tax rates upon their applications on export transactions. Pursuant to Law No. 1992-1 of 06.12.1991 \"On Value-Added Tax,\" effective during that period, exemption from payment of value-added tax when exporting goods (work, services) was a benefit. In order to use its right to the benefit, the taxpayer had to declare its right and confirm its right by documents in accordance with the current legislation. The taxpayer - OAO Yukos Oil Company - did not declare its desire to use its benefit either in 2000 or later.631\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nDecision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241, 26 May 2004, p. 19, Exh. C-116.\n\n598.\n\nAt the Hearing, Mr. Konnov described as follows \"the essence\" of the reasoning in the decision and subsequent judgment:\n\n[T]hat Yukos did not file tax return, and in the absence of the tax return it is not eligible for a 0% VAT rate.632\n\nMr. Konnov also confirmed at the Hearing that the same reasoning was applied for subsequent tax years.633\n\nTranscript, Day 14 at 240\n\n*Ibid.* at 240-51.\n\n**4. The Fines Assessed Against Yukos**\n---------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nAs shown in the table below, for the tax years 2000-2004, the tax authorities imposed fines against Yukos ranging from USD 670 million to USD 2.5 billion per year, for a total of **USD 8.5 billion**. This represents some 35% of the total tax claims levied against Yukos in the reassessments for those years. The breakdown by individual tax year is as follows:634\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **2000** | **2001** | **2002** | **2003** | **2004** | **Total** | **%** |\n| Tax Arrears | 1.68 | 1.74 | 3.15 | 3.09 | 1.90 | 11.55 | 47.73 |\n| Interest | 1.13 | 0.97 | 1.10 | 0.54 | 0.38 | 4.13 | 17.14 |\n| **Fines** | **0.67** | **1.39** | **2.51** | **2.47** | **1.46** | **8.50** | **35.13** |\n| TOTAL | 3.48 | 4.10 | 6.76 | 6.10 | 3.74 | 24.18 | 100 |\n\nFigures (in USD billions) derived from Details of Yukos' Alleged Tax Reassessments, Exh. C-593. The fines levied in relation to unpaid VAT alone account for a total of some USD 4.8 billion for the tax years 2000-2004, with the balance of USD 3.7 billion levied in relation to all of the other types of taxes (the majority\u2014USD 3.3 billion\u2014of the remaining amount being levied in relation to profit tax).\n\n600.\n\nArticle 122 of the Russian Tax Code establishes a taxpayer's liability for \"non-payment or underpayment of taxes.\" Pursuant to paragraph 1 of this provision, the sanction is a 20 percent fine on the unpaid amount of taxes. Under paragraph 3 of this provision, this fine can be increased to 40 percent of the unpaid amount if the offense is committed intentionally. This fine has been referred to in this case as the \"willful offender\" fine. Under Articles 110(2) and 110(4) of the Russian Tax Code, the intention of a company requires, *inter alia*, that the awareness of the company's executives of the unlawful nature of their actions (or failure to act) be established. Finally, under Articles 112(2) and 114(4) of the Russian Tax Code, the fines can be increased to 80 percent, concretely, be doubled, in cases of so-called \"repeat\" offenses, *i.e.* offenses committed by \"a person, which has been previously held liable for a similar tax offense.\"635 This fine has been referred to in this case as the \"repeat offender\" fine.\n\nRussian Tax Code, Part I, Exh. C-401.\n\n601.\n\nYukos was assessed both the \"willful offender\" and the \"repeat offender\" fines by the authorities.\n\n602.\n\nThe Tax Ministry, referring to Article 110(2) of the Russian Tax Code, claimed that for the year 2000, \"[Yukos] deliberately committed the acts aimed at evading payment of taxes, and its officers were aware of the unlawful nature of such actions.\"636 On this basis, the fines on Yukos were doubled from the standard rate of 20 percent to 40 percent. Yukos was thus charged, by reference to Article 122(3), with a 40 percent fine on the amount of its alleged tax arrears.637 The same reasoning was used by the tax authorities to impose fines on Yukos for the years 2001-2004.638\n\n2000 Decision, p. 8, Exh.

C-200.\n\n603.\n\nThe Tax Ministry then doubled the fines once more for the years 2001 to 2004 (the year 2000 being considered as the first \"offense\"), in order to reach an 80 percent fine on the alleged tax arrears.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nIn Chapter VIII.A of the present Award, the Tribunal has found that Yukos had run afoul of the tax authorities prior to December 2003 in some of the low-tax regions, notably in the ZATOs (Lesnoy and Trekhgorny) and in Kalmykia. The Tribunal noted earlier that Yukos had wound up its trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny, and merged them into two separate companies based outside of the ZATOs. These companies later merged to form Investproekt, based in yet another region of Russia. The shuffling of these companies, as the Tribunal observed in Chapter VIII.A, while completed before any decisions were issued against the companies for being shams and for their use of promissory notes to pay (and even overpay) its tax bills, does raise troubling questions which were never answered to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. It suggests that Yukos was aware of the vulnerability of its tax optimization scheme and took steps to minimize its exposure when elements of the scheme were being investigated. This evidence has been thoroughly reviewed and commented upon by the Tribunal in Chapter VIII.A.\n\n605.\n\nIn principle, therefore, both Yukos and members of its management were exposed to further findings of civil and/or criminal liability in connection with these activities as there is no evidence in the record that any tax payable as a result of the investigation of the trading entities in the ZATOs was ever paid. It is in this context that the Russian Federation charged Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev with tax offenses, and reassessed taxes against Yukos as of December 2003.\n\n606.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal considers the Parties' specific arguments in respect of each element of the tax assessments that began in December 2003 and continued at a very rapid pace throughout 2004 (covering the tax years 2000 through 2004). As described in the earlier subsections of the present chapter, these elements included assessments for profit tax and other revenue-based taxes, VAT and fines. While the Tribunal considers the Parties' arguments for each discrete element of the tax assessments, ultimately its conclusions are based on a consideration of the tax assessments as a whole as well as the two trials and convictions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. The Tribunal adopts this totality-of-the-evidence approach for several reasons.\n\n607.\n\nFirstly, the Parties' arguments regarding the tax assessments rest on all-or-nothing propositions. On the one hand, Claimants argue that the tax assessments *as a whole* were conceived and crafted to fabricate debt \"under the guise of taxes,\" and in amounts deliberately large enough to bankrupt Yukos. Respondent, on the other hand, insists that the tax assessments were *entirely* legitimate, and that Yukos' demise was self-inflicted.\n\n608.\n\nSecondly, the discrete elements of the tax assessments are, in fact and in law, closely intertwined. For example, as explained in greater detail below, the enormous liability imposed on Yukos for non-payment of VAT (and for the multiple fines associated with their non-payment) was made possible only because the revenues of Yukos' trading entities were \"re-attributed\" to Yukos itself. It would therefore be artificial to deal with the complexity of this case by deconstructing the various elements of the tax assessments without, in the end, taking the broader perspective that is required to properly appreciate each one of them.\n\n**(a) Profit Tax and Other Revenue-Based Taxes**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n609.\n\nClaimants submit that the revocation of regional tax benefits on revenue-based taxes (principally the regional and local shares of profit tax) was the first step in the Russian Federation's fabrication of taxes targeting Yukos. Claimants argue that the revocation of these benefits was arbitrary because (a) such benefits were expressly provided for in Russian federal and regional legislation with which the Yukos entities complied, and (b) the tax benefits were known to and approved by the relevant authorities (with whom, in some cases the trading entities entered into tax investment agreements).640\n\nClaimants' Opening Statement, pp. 49-80; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 7-11.\n\n610.\n\nRespondent submits that the Russian Federation's revocation of the tax benefits was a legitimate and appropriate response to Yukos' tax optimization scheme under Russia's antiabuse doctrine. Respondent contends that all of the Yukos trading entities were sham letter-box companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, that were managed by Yukos itself.641\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, pp. 11-22.\n\n**ii. Was the \"Bad-Faith Taxpayer\" Doctrine Available at the Time of the Yukos Tax Assessments to Challenge a Tax Evasion Scheme?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that it has already confirmed, in Chapter VIII.A of the present Award, that the \"bad-faith taxpayer doctrine\" existed in the Russian Federation at the time of the issuance of the 2000 Tax Audit in December 2003 and, therefore, at the time of subsequent audits as well.642 Indeed, even Claimants acknowledged the existence of the doctrine.643\n\n*See* above at paragraph 497.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 219-28.\n\n612.\n\nClaimants cannot, therefore, impugn the Russian Federation's revocation of the benefits related to profit tax solely on the basis that the low-tax regions were competent to grant such tax benefits under that applicable legislation, and that \"no breach of that legislation has been alleged.\"644 However, such an argument does not seem to take account of the impact of Russia's anti-abuse doctrine or \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine which, as the Tribunal has already concluded, may constitute a ground for the reassessment of a party's tax liabilities.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 7.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls however that, at the time of the tax assessments against Yukos, the \"business purpose\" doctrine (a variant of the \"substance over form\" and \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrines) had not yet been explicitly adopted into Russian law. As noted earlier in Chapter VIII.A, the \"business purpose\" doctrine was not adopted until October 2006, in Resolution No. 53 dated 12 October 2006 of the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court. As also mentioned in Chapter VIII.A, Russian tax scholars and practitioners appear divided as to whether Resolution No. 53 represented a break with the doctrines that existed at the time of the Yukos assessments, or was a natural evolution of those doctrines.\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal, recalling that Mr. Pepeliaev alluded to something akin to the \"business purpose\" doctrine in his commentary on Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O (published in 2002), is of the view that it was open to the Russian authorities and the courts to rely on the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine to challenge a tax evasion scheme at the time of the Yukos tax assessments, whether based on \"substance over form\" or \"business purpose.\" Although this was an area of the law that was evolving at the time, this alone cannot be determinative. Indeed, the anti-abuse doctrine was a judicial doctrine, and the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to criticize the Russian Federation only because such a doctrine had not yet fully crystallized. To the contrary, the circumstances surrounding Yukos' tax optimization scheme suggest to the Tribunal that this is precisely the kind of case in which the doctrine could be relied upon by the authorities and the judiciary. Nevertheless, Claimants argue that the decision to revoke the profit tax benefits was illegitimate because of the manner in which the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine was applied. In particular, Claimants submit that the \"re-attribution\" of the trading companies' revenue to Yukos was unprecedented and had no basis in law. Further, Claimants submit that there were glaring violations of due process throughout the tax assessment and tax enforcement proceedings. The Tribunal addresses each of those arguments in turn.\n\n**iii. Was \"Re-attribution\" an Appropriate Remedy to Apply to Yukos?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nClaimants argue that the authorities should have applied the transfer-pricing rules of Articles 20 and 40 of the Russian Tax Code to address any concerns about Yukos' avoidance of tax in the low-tax regions. Instead, the authorities \"re-attributed\" to Yukos the revenues of all of its trading companies. According to Claimants, this remedy was unprecedented, had no basis in law and was obviously another ploy in the Russian Federation's fabrication of taxes against Yukos.645\n\nClaimants' Opening Slides, p. 60.\n\n616.\n\nAs mentioned, Claimants submit that the proper decision, and indeed the only decision, that the tax authorities should have issued would have been to apply the transfer-pricing provisions of Articles 20 and 40 of the Russian Tax Code. In this context, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants argue as follows:\n\n11. Similarly, the Respondent's attempt to dismiss the relevance of the ubiquitous references to Yukos in the tax authorities' documentation relating to the trading companies ignores the realities of the Russian context. There was no domestic market for crude oil in Russia, and as Dresdner observed, \"[o]il sales on the Russian internal market consist[ed] mainly of internal sales between the sister companies of the large integrated Russian oil companies\". In this context, when conducting a tax audit of a company whose activities consisted of trading crude oil produced by Yukos' production companies, it would have been natural for the tax authorities to examine whether the trading company and the production company were \"interdependent\" under Article 20 of the Tax Code, and if so, whether the sales transactions complied with the transfer pricing provisions of Article 40. This is precisely what the tax authorities did, finding no violations of Article 40 prior to the December 2003 Audit Report.646\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 11 (citing Transcript, Day 15 (Konnov) at 177:6-180:7; Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation, Analytical Note \"On the Economic and Financial Situation of Natural Monopolies\", 2003, p. 183 (noting \"the absence of a full-fledged domestic market of crude oil in the Russian Federation\"), Exh. C-416; ZAO Dresdner Bank Valuation Report of Yuganskneftegaz, 6 October 2004, p. 95, Exh. C-274 (hereinafter \"Dresdner Valuation Report\"); Table: Field tax audits of Yukos' trading companies in Mordovia, April 2002-October 2003 (noting that audits of Fargoil and Mars XXII in 2003 found no violations of Art. 40), Exh. C-1758).\n\n617.\n\nClaimants add:\n\nMr. Konnov has conceded that the transfer pricing provisions of Articles 20 and 40 were available to the tax authorities and, although cumbersome to apply, could have fully dealt with any allegedly improper tax savings, yet as he has confirmed, the tax authorities never offered any explanation as to why they did not use Article 40 and instead invented a reattribution theory. As Mr. Savseris has written, referring specifically to the Yukos case, it was wholly inappropriate for the tax authorities to resort to judicial doctrines to address a situation covered by these express statutory provisions, noting that \"[i]f the generally established principles in the West for the application of judicial doctrines were respected, this would have been impossible\".647\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 40 (citing Transcript of Mr. Konnov's cross-examination in the *Quasar* arbitration, 24 October 2011, pp. 55-56, 58-59, Exh. C-1697; S.V. Savseris, \"Bad Faith of the Taxpayer as Judicial Doctrine Against Tax Evasion\" (2005), p. 5, Exh. C-1748).\n\n618.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Respondent asserted that re-attribution \"is an entirely appropriate application of the \u2018substance over form' anti-abuse doctrine.\"648 Respondent referred to what it called \"pre-December 30, 2003 cases\" (*Bashkirian refineries* case (2003-2005); Lukoil (2002) and VAT cases) as well as what it called \"post-Yukos authorities\" (*Korus-Holding* (2005-2006), *MIAN* (2007-2008) and *Syktyvkarsky Milk Factory* (2008-2009)).649\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 105\n\n*Ibid*. pp. 105-15. *See also* First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n\n619.\n\nHowever, Mr. Konnov, when asked a specific question by the Chairman of the Tribunal, had great difficulty in explaining the existence of a pre-Yukos precedent for the re-attribution that was imposed on Yukos with the assessments. Claimants recall this incident in their Post-Hearing Brief in the following words:\n\n*First*, as the Tribunal will recall, when asked point blank by the President to identify a precedent for reattribution, Mr. Konnov was unable to do so. The next day Mr. Konnov sought to \"correct\" this answer by referring to cases involving the \"Bashkirian oil refineries\" and a Lukoil assessment that never went to court. However, Mr. Konnov then corrected the correction by noting, with respect to the Bashkirian cases, that \"the court decisions... are not particularly helpful because the lower court decided in favour of the taxpayer, and only in 2005 the court decided in favour of the tax authorities.\"650\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 38 (citing Transcript, Day 14 at 221-23 (Mr. Konnov) (\"I don't think I can give you any reference to the pre-Yukos precedent where attribution was applied in an identical way.\"); Transcript, Day 15 at 83-84 (Mr. Konnov); Transcript, Day 15 at 215 (Mr. Konnov)). Claimants cite their Reply \u00b6 233 to note that: \"Moreover, these alleged precedents involved alleged evasion of excise taxes rather than alleged abuses of profit tax incentives, and were decided on entirely different legal grounds).\" *Ibid*. n.85.\n\n620.\n\nHaving reviewed the decisions cited by Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that none of them is truly apposite to Respondent's argument:\n\n(1) the \" *Bashkirian refineries* case\": in this case (cases, actually), the tax authorities did \"reattribute\" sales revenue from a Baikonur entity to the three selling oil refineries, and they did so by assessments dated 16 July 2003. However, these assessments were overturned, in each of the three cases, by the first instance arbitrazh court in November 2003, and the tax authorities' appeals in early 2004 were initially unsuccessful. It was only in 2005 that the Supreme Arbitrazh Court overturned the lower court decisions, and upheld the July 2003 assessments (Exhibits R-1488, 1489, and 1490). Thus, this case cannot serve as a pre-Yukos precedent.\n\n(2) the \" *Lukoil* case\": this case involved the invalidation of a lease between OAO Lukoil-Ukhtaneftepererabotka and a Baikonur shell, and the resulting claim against the former for taxes. While the court decisions (first instance, appellate and cassation levels) all date back to 2002, they do not show that the taxes of the Lukoil entity were \"re-attributed\" to Lukoil. In the view of the Tribunal, therefore, this case does not support Respondent's reattribution theory.\n\n(3) the \"VAT cases\": Respondent argues that \"[b]oth before and after the Yukos assessments, the Russian tax authorities routinely assessed VAT on purchasers with respect to revenues representing value that had been added by their suppliers, rather than the purchasers themselves.\"651 Respondent points to one pre-Yukos example in the record, a decision that dates from 22 September 2003 (Exhibit R-3372). On the Tribunal's reading of this decision, it is difficult to make out the re-attribution from seller to purchaser, since the Court's attention is quite definitely on the purchaser in its analysis of the transaction. In any event, it is not a situation which is at all analogous to the Yukos case.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 110.\n\n621.\n\nBy contrast, the *Korus-Holding* case appears to be on all fours with the Yukos case, in terms of the re-attribution remedy, but it was decided in 2006, well after the assessments against Yukos in 2003 and 2004.\n\n622.\n\nThe Tribunal notes another factor that supports Claimants' position, namely the contrast between the first and second decisions involving Investproekt. In the first decision, dated 2 April 2002,652 the tax authorities refused to impose any tax liability on Investproekt for the past tax offenses of Business-Oil, Vald-Oil, Forest-Oil and Mitra. In the second decision, dated 8 August 2003,653 Investproekt was held liable for those offenses. The Tribunal observes that the basis for reversing, in August 2003, the earlier decision of April 2002, was not explained in the August 2003 decision,654 and the latter decision followed soon after the arrest of Mr. Lebedev on 2 July 2003. Moreover, neither of these earlier assessments purported to reattribute the tax burden to Yukos, but rather to the successor entity of the trading companies\u2014 Investproekt.\n\nDecision No. 02-11/1/1, 2 April 2002, Exh. R-303.\n\nDecision No. 2.6-23, 8 August 2003, Exh. R-305.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n623.\n\nRegarding the transfer-pricing provisions of the Russian Tax Code as a proposed alternative remedy for whatever mischief is connected to the use of the Yukos trading entities, Respondent in its Rejoinder argues:\n\n701. Claimants suggest that the \"proper course of action\" for the authorities \"would have been to pursue\" Yukos' trading shells as opposed to Yukos. But the tax authorities looked to the economic substance and concluded that Yukos was the real taxpayer. That was both legally proper and practically sensible. As illustrated by the authorities' inability to collect unpaid taxes from the Lesnoy trading shells, Yukos deliberately engineered its scheme so that its trading shells, if they were ever audited and reassessed, would have no assets with which to pay any such assessment, with the result that Yukos' fraudulent scheme would have enjoyed *de facto* impunity. Yukos was at all times the real party in interest in the challenged transactions. It was thus entirely appropriate for the tax authorities to pursue their claims against it, instead of the trading shells it had created to evade taxes.\n\n702. Equally unavailing is Claimants' reliance on Article 40 of the Tax Code. The Yukos \"tax optimization\" scheme was not an ordinary \"transfer pricing\" scheme, but rather a tax evasion scheme involving the abusive exploitation of the low-tax region program through dozens of sham entities which had no genuine business operations. It was therefore entirely appropriate for the authorities to challenge that scheme by reference to anti-abuse rules, rather than the transfer pricing rules set forth in Article 40, insofar as Yukos had deliberately constructed its tax evasion scheme so as to circumvent the application of Article 40, including by (a) using chains of shells which increased the likelihood that, if audited, each link in the chain could avoid an assessment under the 20% \"safe harbor,\" and (b) owning most of the trading shells through call options, offshore companies, and other devices, which would make it more difficult for the authorities to establish an \"interdependence\" within the technical meaning of Article 40 between Yukos and its trading shells.655\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 701-702 (citing \u00b6\u00b6 599, 597-600 of Rejoinder; Second Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24-25 and 63). Respondent also notes: \"This also confirms the lack of merit in Claimants' contention that Respondent's \"multiple allegations about non-arm's length pricing [...] contradict\" Respondent's \"concession that Yukos' alleged tax liabilities [are] not premised on any violation of transfer pricing rules\" [citing Reply \u00b6 214]. In reality, there is no such contradiction, because it is well-settled in Russian tax law that the transfer pricing rules set forth in Article 40 of the Tax Code are not the exclusive remedy available to the Russian tax authorities to combat abusive tax practices based on price manipulations (*see* First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 40-44). In other countries too, the general view is that the existence of specific statutory anti-avoidance rules does not prevent the authorities from deploying their anti-abuse arsenal, including general anti-avoidance rules, whether enacted by statute (as is the case, for instance, in Germany) or developed by the judiciary (as is the case, for instance, in the United States)....  \n In the Yukos case, the authorities' reliance on alternative theories of liability was not only proper but particularly appropriate, because the Yukos tax evasion scheme was deliberately engineered so that Yukos, through its trading shells, could circumvent the transfer pricing rules, which require an under- or over-statement of prices of more than 20 percent of the market price. Yukos evaded those rules by running inventories through chains of multiple trading shells in a series of nominally independent transactions, none of which individually exceeded the 20 percent threshold. *See* Protocol of Witness Interrogation of Vladislav P. Brazhkov (15 February 2008), 4, 6 (Exh. R-3370).\" *Ibid*. n.1098  \n Respondent further notes: \"Yukos' internal communications confirm that it was a \"headache\" for Yukos' employees to ensure that the transactions among the trading shells were structured to prevent detection of the scheme by the tax authorities. [citing Counter-Memorial \u00b6 304 and e-mail from A.V. Brazhkov to A.P Kuchusheva, 9 October 2001, Exh. R-325].\" *Ibid*. n.1099.\n\n624.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Respondent argued that the \"substance over form\" doctrine would be illusory if re-attribution were precluded, since it would permit tax evasion with impunity as the taxpayer could simply cause the relevant income or revenues to be recorded, on paper, in the books of a judgment proof domestic affiliate or a foreign affiliate that was solvent but territorially beyond the reach of any enforcement measure.656 Respondent also referred to other jurisdictions where a \"general anti-avoidance provision\" allows the tax authorities to allocate \"any income\" to \"any person\" in connection with \"an avoidance transaction\".657\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 115.\n\n*Ibid*. p. 118.\n\n625.\n\nThe Tribunal sees some merit, in principle, to Respondent's argument that the \"anti-abuse\" doctrine would be eviscerated if the tax authorities were unable to attribute income to the person responsible for the wrongdoing. The Tribunal also notes with interest Respondent's reference to the anti-avoidance provisions of other countries, such as the United States, France, Germany, Canada and Australia, which grant the taxation authorities similar powers, as well as to some decisions from other jurisdictions.658 In the Russian context, however, it is clear to the Tribunal that there was no precedent for re-attribution at the time that the tax assessments and related decisions were issued in respect of Yukos.\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, pp. 95-103.\n\n626.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal could have been persuaded to accept Respondent's argument if the tax authorities had only imposed revenue-based taxes against Yukos on the basis of re-attribution. However, and as already noted, the tax authorities attributed to Yukos the trading companies' revenues while, at the same time, refusing to attribute to Yukos the trading companies' VAT refunds and it did so for purely technical reasons. This leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that the authorities used the \"re-attribution\" formula not only so as to be able to collect the revenue-based taxes, but also so as to establish a basis for imposing the massive VAT liability and excessive fines that followed.\n\n627.\n\nIn short, the Tribunal accepts the following conclusion, as expressed in paragraph 41 of Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief:\n\nThe obvious explanation for the Respondent's use of a novel and arbitrary re-attribution theory rather than correctly applying existing law on interdependence and transfer pricing is that this was not a *bona fide* exercise of taxation powers; instead, the novel re-attribution theory provided a pretext to impose US$ 13.59 billion in VAT claims that, as Mr. Konnov confirmed, could not have been made in the absence of the unprecedented re-attribution of revenues.659\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 41 (citing Transcript, Day 15 at 94-95).\n\n**iv. Did the Russian Federation Violate Due Process?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nClaimants submit that the Russian Federation violated due process by (a) ensuring that the courts were obedient and did not question the legality of the tax assessments; (b) ensuring that Yukos could not present its case; and (c) ensuring that neither the trading companies nor the Mordovian authorities could participate in the proceedings.\n\n629.\n\nRegarding the legality and legitimacy of the tax assessments which Claimants say the courts should have scrutinized, the Tribunal recalls its finding in Chapter VIII.A that, during the period relevant for the tax assessments against Yukos (2003-2004), the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine included the following principles:\n\n\u2022 The good faith (honesty) of the taxpayer is presumed.\n\n\u2022 The tax authorities have the burden to prove the taxpayer\u2019s bad faith (dishonesty), and in doing so \"may not construe the concept of \u2018good faith taxpayers' as imposing on the taxpayer additional obligations which are not provided for in the legislation.\"\n\n630.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, questions can be asked about whether the tax assessments disclose a record establishing that the tax authorities discharged their burden of proving Yukos' bad faith in respect of all the trading entities said to be an integral part of its tax evasion scheme. Some of these questions were raised by Yukos' tax lawyers immediately after the 2000 tax assessment was issued. They commented:\n\nThe act of inspection of OAO NK YUKOS contains the amounts of revenues of each company however it is absolutely unclear what control actions produced this information and what documents confirm it, etc.660\n\nS. Pepeliaev, *Summary of the tax inspection of OAO NK Yukos*, p. 2, 5 January 2004, Exh. C-1128.\n\n631.\n\nThis question was developed in the Objections against the tax assessment filed by Yukos on 12 January 2004. Under objection no. 6 (\"Breach of the procedure for conducting an audit\"), Yukos complained that the auditors referred to materials from the criminal case, but did not indicate \"what specific documents of the criminal case confirm the fault of the taxpayer.\"661 Yukos' detailed objection continued:\n\nAttention should also be paid to the failure to analyze and indicate taxation objects on additionally assessed taxes for all re-assessments under 17 companies. Furthermore, audit materials do not contain any source documents (waybills, statements, commercial invoices, etc.) and does not contain contracts for sale and purchase of goods and information about payment for goods. At the same time the auditors concentrated only on the matter of unlawfulness of tax benefits' application, although does not review at all the basic matter that shall be proved in the course of tax audit - the value of taxation objects of these 17 companies. It should be mentioned that it is impossible to state the fact of non-payment of taxes without analysis of business operations and economic results obtained thereunder (revenues, profits). However, the auditors do not bother themselves with study of business operations, under which billions of Rubles are imputed to OAO NK YUKOS for payment.\n\nThis directly contradict to Article 100 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which indicates that the Audit Report must contain information about tax offense confirmed by the documents and Instruction of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies the Russian Federation No. 60 of 10.04.2000 \"On Procedure for Compilation of Field Tax Audit Report and Proceedings in the Case of Violation of the Legislation on Taxes and Levies\", according to which the Audit Report must contain references to source accounting documents (with indication, in case of necessity, according transactions and order for reflection the respective operations in the accounting registers) and other evidences confirming the fact of violation. The Instruction also stipulates that the Report must be based on results of audit of all documents that may be related to the stated facts, and on results of performance of all other actions necessary for exercising tax control.\n\nAccording to this Instruction, the following must be attached to the Audit Report:\n\n\u2022 clarified calculations by types of taxes (levies) drawn up by the auditors in connection with the discovered tax offence (except for the cases when the specified calculations are presented in the body text of the report). Calculations must be signed by the auditor (the auditors), the head of the company or private entrepreneur or their representatives; and\n\n\u2022 materials of cross audits (in case these were performed).\n\nHowever, these requirements are not met and source documents and tax returns of 17 companies mentioned in the Report are not attached to the Report, which virtually deprives OAO NK YUKOS of opportunity to assess accusations of tax offence brought against it.\n\nIt is also necessary to mention that in violation of the requirements of the abovementioned Instruction about fairness and reasonableness of the reflected facts, the Audit Report was written in obviously biased manner, with accusative tendency and starts with conclusions on presence of a certain tax evasion \"scheme\". The obvious prejudice of the auditors does not allow to consider the Audit Report as the evidence of committed tax offence.662\n\nObjections against Report No. 08-1, p. 13, 12 January 2004, Exh. R-335.\n\n*Ibid*. at 14-15.\n\n632.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 100(2) of the Russian Tax Code requires a tax audit to contain \"documentarily attested references to facts of tax offenses revealed during the audit....\"663\n\nArt. 100(2), Russian Tax Code, Exh. C-1704.\n\n633.\n\nThe Russian Tax Code also requires the Director of the Tax Authority to consider the taxpayer's objections prior to issuing a decision (which may hold, or not hold, the taxpayer liable for a tax offense, or direct further tax control measures).664 Article 101(3) provides:\n\n3. The decision to hold the taxpayer liable for a tax offense shall indicate the circumstances of the committed tax offence, how they were established by the audit, the documents and other evidence, which attest to these circumstances, arguments presented by the taxpayer for his defense and the results of their verification, the decision to hold the taxpayer for specific tax offenses with a reference to the articles of this Code providing for such tax offenses and liability incurred.665\n\nArt. 101(1) and (2), Russian Tax Code, Exh. C-1704.\n\nArt. 101(3), Russian Tax Code, Exh. C-1704.\n\n634.\n\nThe 2000 Decision summarizes Yukos' objections, but selectively so. Notably, Yukos' specific objection regarding the tax authorities' failure to document the facts allegedly underpinning the conclusions in the tax audit is omitted from the description in the Decision of Yukos' objection no. 6.666 Moreover, while the decision contains responses or comments regarding some of Yukos' other objections, it does not contain any response to this specific objection.667\n\n2000 Decision, pp. 86-87, Exh. C-104.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 87-90.\n\n635.\n\nThe court decisions that affirmed the legality of the decision, both in first instance and on appeal, used similar wording to dismiss Yukos' objection based on breach of procedure for conducting an audit:\n\nResults of the audit and the Decision were formalized in compliance with requirements of Articles 100 and 101 of the Russian Federation Tax Code. The Decision indicates its subject, essence and features of the tax offense imputed to the taxpayer, with reference to Article 122(3) of the Russian Federation Tax Code. Demand for the payment of tax arrears, interest and fines indicated in the Decision of the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and Levies No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 are well-founded, comply with the current legislation and are supported by the primary documents of audit materials, presented by the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and levies to the Court for substantiation of its claim.668\n\nResolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, Case No. 09AP-4078/04-AK, 23 November 2004, p. 5, Exh. C-147; *see also* Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241, 26 May 2004, p. 21, Exh. C-116.\n\n636.\n\nThe Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal added that \"[Yukos'] reference to a lack of documents and information confirming bad faith on the part of the taxpayer is unfounded.\"669 The Tribunal observes, however, that neither court identifies any specific documents in coming to these conclusions; nor did Respondent submit to the Tribunal the record that was before those courts, or present a witness who could attest to it. This makes it impossible for the Tribunal to assess whether the tax authorities did indeed discharge their burden against Yukos in issuing and defending their tax assessments.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 9.\n\n637.\n\nClaimants sum up their argument on this important point in their Post-Hearing Brief with the following submission. The Tribunal notes that these crucial allegations of Claimants were never rebutted by Respondent:\n\nIn addition, the December 29, 2003 Audit Report did not comply with the requirements of the Russian Tax Code, including, in particular, by failing to document the factual allegations made and by relying on unidentified and undisclosed documents from the criminal investigation against Mr. Khodorkovsky. Continuing this flagrant breach of due process, the tax authorities refused to allow Yukos access to the documents upon which the purported claims were based, making it impossible for Yukos to defend itself. Notwithstanding the fact that the results of the court cases were determined in the Kremlin and it therefore could not possibly have made any difference how Yukos presented its defense, this refusal even to subject the purported claims to the scrutiny of Yukos' lawyers attests to the Russian authorities' complete lack of belief in the validity of those claims and their determination to destroy the company at a rapid pace.670\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 24.\n\n638.\n\nRespondent avers that \"the unbroken thread of Yukos' tax evasion\" demonstrates that the Russian Federation's assessments against Yukos were entirely proper, and marshalled a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that Yukos was abusing at least some of the low tax regions prior to 2003.671\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 3-35.\n\n639.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal observes that nearly all of the evidence on this point relates to the entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. The Tribunal has not found any evidence in the massive record that would support Respondent's submission that there was a basis for the Russian authorities to conclude that the entities in Mordovia, for example, were \"shams\". Indeed, instead of pointing to any specific evidence on which the tax authorities might have based their finding that the Mordovian entities were shams, Respondent reversed the burden and asserted that \"there is no evidence that the Mordovian shells ever had any greater substance than the Lesnoy shells\";672 and that \"[f]actually, Yukos did not even attempt to demonstrate that any genuine trading activities had ever been conducted in Mordovia.\"673 While the incomplete record before the Tribunal may not, in point of fact, establish that the Mordovian trading companies conducted genuine trading activities in Mordovia, the Tribunal notes that the Russian courts systematically denied Yukos' motions to join to the proceedings its trading companies and the Government of the Republic of Mordovia. This leads the Tribunal to conclude that the Russian courts may have prevented Yukos from adducing evidence bearing on the nature of its activities in Mordovia.674 The record, insofar as the Tribunal has been able to find, does not reveal reasons, still less persuasive reasons, for denial by the Russian courts of joinder of the Mordovian government and the trading companies.\n\n*Ibid*. p. 33.\n\n*Ibid*. p. 98.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 286.\n\n640.\n\nIn the specific context of determining whether, in relation to the tax assessments against Yukos, the tax authorities discharged their own burden of proving Yukos' bad faith so as to be able to rely on the \"bad-faith taxpayer\" doctrine, the Tribunal makes two observations. Firstly, the tax authorities failed to address at the time of the 2000 Decision, Yukos' reasoned objection based on the absence of specific documents in the tax audit. Secondly, Respondent failed to identify during the Hearing any satisfactory evidence that the abuses found in the trading firms operating in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny were also found in the trading companies operating in Mordovia and all the other low-tax regions where Yukos entities were present. While it is true, and suggestive, that Claimants did not introduce evidence at the Hearing showing that trading companies which operated in Mordovia were not \"shams\", it is first and foremost the conduct of the tax authorities that the Tribunal must examine in the context of the tax assessments that these authorities imposed on Yukos. Focusing exclusively on Claimants' failure to demonstrate that the Mordovian entities were not \"shams\" would empty of meaning the important principle that the tax authorities had the burden of proving the taxpayer's bad faith under Russian law. On this point, the following extract from the *Pribrezhnoye* decision issued by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District on 5 June 2002 (well before the tax assessments against Yukos) is instructive:\n\nIn addition, the IMNS's reference to the absence of presentation of evidence by the Company on the conduct of its business in the ZATO territory, which was supported by the court, is erroneous.\n\nPursuant to Article 53 (part one) of the Arbitrazh Procedure Code of the Russian Federation in considering disputes on the invalidity of acts of State authorities, local selfgovernment authorities and other authorities; it is up to the relevant authority to prove the circumstances, which provided the grounds for issuing the said acts. Due to the fact that the disputed tax benefit had been granted to the defendant by a competent ZATO authority, and that the IMNS issuing the challenged non-regulatory decision found the granting of the benefit unlawful, the courts erroneously imposed the burden of proof on the Company.675\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Pribrezhnoye*, p. 5, Exh. C-1278.\n\n641.\n\nLooking at the tax assessments themselves, the Tribunal observes that, if there is an \"unbroken thread\" running through the tax authorities' analysis of Yukos' tax optimization scheme, it is the consistent and uniform finding that each trading entity is \"interdependent\" with Yukos. But that interdependence in the view of the Tribunal of itself does not establish bad faith on the part of all the trading entities.\n\n642.\n\nIn its objections to the Tax Audit (objection No. 1: \"Illegal conclusions concerning legal definition of interdependent persons\"), Yukos complained about the authorities' reliance on interdependence as the principal factor motivating their conclusion that Yukos' tax optimization scheme was a tax evasion scheme, noting that interdependence has a specific meaning under the Russian Tax Code (in Article 20), and with strictly determined legal consequences (under Article 40).676 These provisions allow authorities to disregard prices used in transactions between interdependent persons when those prices deviate by more than 20 percent from the market price, and to assess additional taxes and interest calculated as if the transactions were concluded at the market price. Again, the Tribunal notes that this objection was not directly addressed in the 2000 Decision.677\n\nObjections against Report No. 08-1, pp. 1-5, 12 January 2004, Exh. R-335.\n\n2000 Decision, pp. 87-90, Exh. C-104. There is also only a minor reference to the objection in the Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241, 26 May 2004, p. 19, Exh. C-116. (\"The court considers unfounded the Respondents' arguments that the status of interdependent entities has legal importance solely for the possibility of applying market prices to determine the results of the transactions for tax purposes. Interdependence of entities in this case is one of the circumstances by which the tax authority substantiates bad faith of the taxpayer.\").\n\n643.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the relevant audit reports and decisions do refer generally to various factors that would seem to be relevant to a finding that the legislation in low-tax regions was being abused by Yukos. For example, they refer to the absence of trading activity in the regions and the absence of sufficient or even of any investment by the trading entities in the low tax regions. However, a close analysis of the tax assessment for 2000, for example, reveals that it was not established by the tax authorities that each of the trading entities which it labelled as a \"sham\" had no trading activity whatsoever, as opposed to just being \"interdependent\" on Yukos or not having physical facilities to handle oil and oil refining.\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants (and apparently also with Mr. Konnov) that it is nonsense to require a trading company to demonstrate physical interaction with the goods or commodities that it is trading, especially in the era of electronic communications. In this sense, the Tribunal is highly skeptical of the reasoning in the 2000 Audit Report (and subsequent reports) that the absence of physical movement of oil in and out of the low-tax region where the respective trading entity is located is evidence of a sham. The Tribunal observes that the reasoning on this point in the 2000 Audit Report is also inconsistent with the decision in the *Pribrezhnoye* case.\n\n645.\n\nIn that case, the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District reversed decisions of lower courts that had accepted the tax authorities' efforts to impose additional eligibility requirements on a ZATO-based oil trading company beyond those laid out in the ZATO law. It explicitly noted that:\n\nUnder these circumstances the examination of whether the Company had fixed assets for oil products storage and transportation in the ZATO territory is beyond the scope of this case, because operations of trade in oil products, i.e. conclusion of contracts of sale, do not require the Company to own such fixed assets or for the oil products to be present within the ZATO territory.678\n\n*Pribrezhnoye*, p. 3, Exh. C-1278\n\n646.\n\nThe court added\n\nThe references by the courts to the facts that transfer and acceptance of crude oil occurred outside the ZATO territory; that [the manager of a customer company was in a different ZATO when the transfer was signed]; that the phone numbers of the rented office premises are recorded to the name of a person other than the Company; and that the defendant had not paid the office electricity bills are equally unfounded. The said circumstances per se do not refute the fact that the Company was doing business as a trade company in the territory of the ZATO, and they have no relevance for the case because they are not taken into account by tax legislation in determining eligibility for tax benefits.\n\nThe examination of the said circumstances by the first instance court and the court of appeal reveals their misinterpretation of Article 5(1) of the ZATO Law, in that the court went beyond the eligibility criteria for tax benefits that are explicitly set forth in this provision. In violation of Article 3(7) of the TC, the first instance court and the court of appeal regarded the absence of any criteria on doing business in ZATO territory other than fixed assets, workers on payroll and salary payments as grounds for the independent establishment of such criteria by a tax authority or a court.679\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Ibid,* p. 4.\n\n647.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the criterion of \"proportionality\" seems to be difficult to apply as a stand-alone basis to invalidate the structure in the low-tax regions. This is due to the fact that the proportion between the tax savings and the investment in the low-tax region should have been readily apparent to the tax authorities on the face of the tax filings and related tax documents. On the other hand, where properly evidenced, a grossly disproportionate arrangement combined with an \"empty shell\" structure could, in the Tribunal's view, validly attract the attention of the authorities under the \"anti-abuse\" doctrine.\n\n648.\n\nTo conclude, it thus appears to the Tribunal that the Tax Ministry, in its assessments against Yukos, painted all of the Yukos' entities in the low tax regions with the same brush, even though it marshalled little, if any, documented evidence that all, and not only some, of the trading entities were abusing the low tax regime in which they had respectively been constituted. On the one hand, the Tribunal accepts that, if Claimants had evidence of genuine business activity of the trading companies in the low-tax regions, they would have introduced it or referred to it orally. Accordingly, resolution of these critical issues is not free from doubt. But on the other hand, and on balance, where neither side was able to demonstrate the facts, but where Yukos' files were in the hands of Respondent, the Tribunal feels justified in holding Respondent bound by the burden of proof. Respondent failed to meet that burden. Moreover, it refused to join Mordovian authorities and the trading companies to the litigation. Furthermore, the re-attribution remedy was unprecedented at that time in the Russian Federation. Respondent's resort to re-attribution appears to be linked to its determination to impose a massive VAT liability on Yukos.\n\n**(b) VAT**\n-----------\n\n**i. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n649.\n\nClaimants argue that the imposition of VAT by the tax authorities, and more specifically their refusal to attribute to Yukos the trading companies' VAT returns and refunds, is arbitrary because (a) it is undisputed that the goods at issue in the underlying transactions were exported and that the trading entities timely and duly filed VAT returns (and thus that the transactions benefited from the exemption from VAT or zero percent rating, depending on the year);680 (b) the refusal to attribute the trading companies' VAT returns and refunds to Yukos is inconsistent with Respondent's attribution to Yukos of the trading companies' revenues for purposes of calculation of tax (be it profit tax or VAT or any of the other taxes); and (c) Yukos' refilings of VAT returns were rejected on the basis of technicalities, thus demonstrating that Respondent had no intention of treating Yukos in good faith.681\n\n*See* Second Konnov Report \u00b6 84, n.137. Mr. Konnov explains: \"Prior to entry into force on January 1, 2001 of Chapter 21 of the Russian Tax Code governing VAT, VAT was governed by Law of the Russian Federation No. 1992-1, On the Value Added Tax, December 6, 1991 (the \u2018VAT Law'). Under the terminology of the VAT Law, exports were \u2018exempt' from VAT whilst under the Russian Tax Code they are subject to 0% VAT rate. In substance, exemption from VAT on exports was similar to the 0% tax regime.\" *Ibid*.\n\nClaimants' Opening Slides, p. 63.\n\n650.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the VAT assessments against Yukos were perfectly proper, and consistent with the corporate profit tax assessments. In both cases, Respondent argues, the assessments were based on the application of Russian tax law to the true situation, established by the tax authorities, that Yukos was the \"real taxpayer\" and \"actual exporter\" in the various transactions that the trading companies had entered into. Respondent's position is also based on its assertions that under Russian law, the granting of a zero percent VAT rate is subject to compliance with stringent documentary requirements; and that it is undisputed that Yukos itself never filed regular VAT returns or proper amended VAT returns in relation to the transactions in question.682\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 111.\n\n651.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that there was no element in Yukos' tax scheme that enabled Yukos to benefit improperly or illegally from a VAT exemption or a zero percent rating. As noted earlier in this Award, VAT is a uniform federal tax that benefits from an exemption or a zero percent rating if the transaction involves an export to a foreign purchaser. In other words, even if Yukos' tax scheme was entirely unlawful (or unlawful in some respects), and the authorities were justified in attributing the trading companies' revenues to Yukos for tax purposes, there is no suggestion by Respondent that the trading companies (or Yukos) did anything \"wrong\" vis-\u00e0-vis VAT with their tax scheme. The Tribunal must consider the propriety of the multibillion dollar VAT assessments against Yukos in this context.\n\n652.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses the specific questions arising on the topic of the VAT assessments in the following subsections.\n\n**ii. Was the Imposition of VAT Payments on Yukos Inconsistent with the Attribution to Yukos of the Trading Companies' Revenues?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n653.\n\nClaimants assert that when the Russian Tax Ministry reattributed to Yukos all of the revenues (including the export revenues) of its trading companies, it should have attributed to Yukos the VAT refunds previously obtained by the trading companies with respect to their exports. Instead, in what Claimants characterize as a \"contradiction with its own theory,\" the Tax Ministry chose to impose the amounts on Yukos, justifying the VAT payment demands on the failure by Yukos, as the \"real taxpayer\", to file on time \"the documentation required to validate the VAT exemption or the 0% VAT rate\".683\n\nMemorial \u00b6 321-22.\n\n654.\n\nClaimants sum up their argument in their Memorial as follows:\n\nThis formalistic position, systematically challenged by Yukos before the arbitrazh courts, but endorsed without any thorough analysis by these courts, was obviously circular: the trading companies, not Yukos, had exported oil and oil products and filed all the necessary documentation; under the applicable laws, Yukos did not have to file and could not have filed such documentation at the relevant times. The fact that, even when Yukos attempted to submit the updated VAT returns in its own name to satisfy the Tax Ministry, its submissions were simply rejected as improper and untimely, amply shows the Tax Ministry's bad faith and true intentions.684\n\nMemorial \u00b6 322 (citing as regards Yukos' tax reassessment for the year 2000, Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 26 May 2004, 28 May 2004, p. 19 of the Russian original, Exh.

This approach simply reflected reality.\"685 As such, Respondent argues, Yukos could have benefited from exemption (or \"zero-rating\") only if, as \"the true exporter\", it had timely filed \"the requisite documentation in the correct manner.\"686\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1073.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1074.\n\n656.\n\nClaimants reaffirm their position in their Reply, stating that Respondent's position on VAT \"was wholly inconsistent with the entire re-attribution theory upon which all of the other purported tax claims were premised.\"687 In short, Claimants argue that \"it was arbitrary and contradictory for the authorities to re-attribute the trading companies' oil, revenues, profits, tax liabilities and activities to Yukos but to refuse to re-attribute to Yukos those companies' entitlement to VAT refunds.\"688\n\nReply \u00b6 244.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n657.\n\nMore specifically, Claimants note that \"there is no support in Russian law for the tax authorities to conclude that the \u2018true exporter' could be someone other than the legal owner as reflected in the relevant documentation.\"689 In particular, Claimants assert that neither Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code nor the decision of the Constitutional Court690 affirming the constitutionality of Article 165, on which Respondent relies, say anything about \"true exporters\".691\n\nReply \u00b6 245.\n\nResolution of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 12-P, 14 July 2003, Exh.

For example, in Decision No. 23 in respect of Alta-Trade, the decision notes that \"Oil products are being exported through commission agent OAO NK Yukos and ZAO Trading House Angarsk-Nefto.\"692 To prove that exports in fact took place, more than ten commission agreements were provided to the authorities, along with \"certificates of transactions entered into by the commission agent, bank statements evidencing crediting of funds to the commission agent's accounts, bank statements evidencing crediting of funds to OOO Alta-Trade's accounts, commission agents reports, copies of complete custom freight declarations and shipping documents confirming export of goods by sea outside the CIS member states[,]... complete customs freight declarations [with] the necessary notes made by customs authorities - \"clearance allowed\", \"goods exported\", and also notes made on shipping documents - \"loading allowed\" on loading instructions, notes made on marine bills of lading concerning acceptance of cargos for transportation.693\n\nDecision No. 23 on partial refusal to refund/offset VAT (Alta-Trade), 15 June 2000, p. 1, Exh. C-1110\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n659.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in these audits, the taxation authorities did not appear to be concerned with these relationships. Several other audit reports and decisions also mention the use of export agents.694\n\n*See* Decision No. 48 to deny refunding (offset) VAT (Alta-Trade), 29 October 2001, p. 1, Exh. C-1116; Decision No. 53 on partial refusal to refund/offset VAT (Mars XXII), 27 December 2004, p. 1, Exh. C-1117; Field Tax Audit Report No. 02-52, 19 April 2002 \u00b6 1.7, Exh.

C-1121, p. 3, which notes Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code, and states \"No offense were discovered during the audit as to whether the value added tax actually paid to suppliers for materials acquired/booked, work performed or services provided, to the extent they were used to produce export goods, has been properly refunded/credited; whether OOO Ratmir had documents to support actual exports of such goods, and whether it properly assessed tax on domestic sales of goods.\"\n\n660.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains its position regarding the propriety of the VAT assessments and their consistency with the profit tax assessments against Yukos. Respondent explains why Claimants are wrong, in its view, for characterizing the VAT assessments as being arbitrary and contradictory:\n\nOnce again, Claimants are wrong. The authorities' approach with respect to Yukos' VAT liability was consistent with their approach to Yukos' corporate profit tax liability. In both instances, they treated Yukos as the actual owner and exporter of the oil and oil products, and therefore the actual entity responsible for both profit tax and VAT. Thus, the authorities found that:\n\n(i) Yukos was the real party in interest in the challenged transactions.\n\n(ii) The profit generated through those transactions was Yukos' own profit, which Yukos had fictitiously allocated to the trading shells for no purpose other than to evade taxes which it otherwise was obligated to pay.\n\n(iii) Yukos, not its trading shells, was the real exporter of the oil and oil products that were the subject matter of those transactions.\n\nThe inescapable conclusion from these findings is that Yukos, not its trading shells, should have filed the requisite documents to claim a 0% VAT rate, which as discussed below Yukos did not do properly. The VAT was thus due from Yukos and the Yukos VAT assessments were proper.695\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 706-7.\n\n661.\n\nClaimants sum up their position in their Post Hearing Brief:\n\nIf the tax authorities had authority to reassign items from the debit side of the trading companies' taxpayer accounts to the debit side of Yukos' taxpayer account, then they must also have had the corresponding authority to transfer the entries on the credit side -particularly in light of the tax authorities' own prior determinations that the 0% export VAT rate applied to all of the transactions in question.696\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 43 (citations omitted).\n\n662.\n\nDuring his cross-examination of Mr. Konnov, Professor Gaillard recalled that the revenue of the trading companies was attributed to Yukos:\n\nQ. So can we agree that the revenues were found in the books of separate legal entities, which were the trading companies; can we agree on that?\n\nA. I think you already asked that question, and I said that, yes, the tax authorities used the books of the domestic offshore companies to get the figures.\n\nQ. Right. And they took this amount and deemed this amount to be revenues of the Yukos; correct?\n\nA. That is correct: they treated that revenue as revenue of Yukos.697\n\nTranscript, Day 13 at 85-86.\n\n663.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Konnov confirmed that if there had been no attribution of revenue to Yukos the VAT issue would not have arisen:\n\nQ. I may disagree with you on some aspects of that, but I'm not reopening that. I am just talking about VAT.\n\nIf the tax authorities had decided that the trading companies themselves had violated, say, the Mordovian Law, or the Law which is applicable to them, or the Federal Anti-Abuse Law, or whatever Law, but they have violated that Law; and if the tax authorities had said, \"Okay, they abused, so all these tax benefits which they had, they should never have had these benefits, because there is no proportionality, because it's form over substance\", whatever reason, \"So they should pay, they should reimburse all these benefits\", and possibly pay interest, fines, whatever -okay? -- if that had been the case, would the VAT issue have arisen at all?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. You are with me on that?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. So it would not. And the VAT issue arises only because it's Yukos which has been deemed to be the person having the revenues, and hence not having declared those revenues, and hence not having paid the VAT corresponding to the sales which generated those revenues; correct?\n\nA. To be more specific, the VAT issue arises because VAT returns were not refiled.\n\nQ. No, because they were not filed in the first place, right?\n\nA. No, because they were not refiled by Yukos. So the basis is not attribution; the basis is failure to file VAT returns.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: That's not the question. If there had been no reattribution, if the trading companies had been assessed the profit tax, et cetera, there would not have been a VAT issue.\n\nA. Right. But I think I responded to that.\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Yes.\n\nA. I responded to that. That's correct.698\n\nTranscript, Day 14 at 227-28.\n\n664.\n\nMr. Konnov acknowledged that the trading companies had filed their VAT returns and had claimed the VAT refunds as required:\n\nQ. Right. Do you agree with me that it's not disputed that the trading companies themselves have filed properly the VAT returns, and have requested and they have been granted the 0% rate because the goods were exported? Correct? Do we agree on that?\n\nA. I agree, they were. As we discussed earlier today, there were a few minor issues. But apart from these minor issues, this is correct: the domestic companies filed VAT returns, claimed refund, and obtained refund.699\n\n*Ibid*. at 230.\n\n665.\n\nMr. Konnov confirmed that Yukos was assessed the massive VAT liability because it failed to file in its own name VAT returns in respect of the trading entities' exports, since it had been found by the tax authorities to be the true exporter:\n\nPROFESSOR GAILLARD: Okay, the next question is: is it your understanding of what happened that when the VAT issue did arise for Yukos, because Yukos was deemed to be the person having received the revenues from the sales, when it did arise, is it your understanding of the case that the reason why they had to pay this massive amount of VAT is from the outset because they were criticised for not having submitted themselves the tax returns in time? Is that your understanding of what happened?\n\nA. Right: VAT returns primarily, and the documents that need to be attached to that. But the main issue relates to the failure of Yukos to file the VAT returns with respect to these exports.\n\n\u2026\n\nA. I thought I had responded to that in my reports. But in essence the Tax Code requires VAT returns to be filed by the exporter. There is a formalistic procedure. Tax authorities have historically applied the law very formally. They said that Yukos had to refile. There is nothing difficult in refiling, and Yukos did not refile.\n\nSo therefore the basis for VAT assessment is not failure of Yukos to export, as we agreed; but the basis is failure of Yukos to file the documentation in its own name.700\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Ibid*. at 229 and at 230-31\n\n666.\n\nHowever, Mr. Konnov did not perceive any inconsistency between the attribution of revenue to Yukos and the position of the tax authorities and the courts that Yukos itself needed to file the VAT returns:\n\nQ. Do we agree that for the revenues themselves, the authorities applied a substance over form principle? Do we agree on that?\n\nA. The tax authorities applied substance over form for both profits tax and VAT purposes.701\n\n*Ibid*. at 231.\n\n667.\n\nIn his First Report, Mr. Konnov explains his position in the following terms:\n\nAt the outset, I should note that the tax authorities and courts were fully consistent in treating YUKOS for profit tax and VAT purposes. Revenue of the Domestic Offshore Companies was recognized as revenue of YUKOS for both profit tax and VAT purposes.702\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 54\n\n668.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that while the approach taken by the Tax Ministry was consistent in the sense that revenue was recognized as revenue of Yukos for both profit tax and VAT purposes, it was inconsistent in that, while the burden of the substance over form doctrine was imposed on Yukos, its corresponding benefit was not. Put another way, while technicalities and formalism are said to preclude the attribution of the VAT filings of the trading entities to Yukos, it does not appear that the Tax Ministry was concerned with technicalities and formalism when it came time to attribute their revenue to Yukos.\n\n669.\n\nA member of the Tribunal put the pertinent question to Mr. Konnov. The following exchange with the witness is important:\n\nJUDGE SCHWEBEL: In substance, Russian courts treated the activities of the trading companies as the activities of Yukos itself, while at the same time they did not attribute to Yukos a critical element of those activities, namely their filing for VAT refunds.\n\nIn the interests of obvious justice, why did not the Russian courts treat the filings for VAT by the trading companies as filings by Yukos?\n\nA. If I may, I see two aspects in your question. First, I do not think that Russian tax authorities -- as I think was suggested in your question -- treated the activities of trading companies as the activities of Yukos. I think it would be more correct, if I may, to say that they established that trading companies conducted no activity, and therefore they simply ignored that for tax purposes.\n\nAs regards... the substance of your question, the reason is very simple: is that, as I mentioned, in order to get the tax benefit, you need to comply with the substance and with the documents. And here the documentary requirement was not burdensome; it was not difficult to refile the VAT return. The tax authorities did look at the substance, but simply said, \"You need to comply with the documentary requirement,\" and consistently Yukos failed to comply with that.\n\nSo I don't see contradiction.703\n\nTranscript, Day 15 at 231-32.\n\n670.\n\nRespondent relies on both Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code and Constitutional Court Resolution No. 12-P. Neither of these texts, however, appears to the Tribunal to provide a clear basis for the authorities' refusal to attribute to Yukos the VAT filings that had been made by the trading entities when they were considered the taxpayer. On the other hand, they do support the basic proposition that the Russian Tax Code requires the VAT return to be filed by the \"taxpayer.\"704\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6 89.\n\n671.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the jurisprudence of the Russian courts does not support the imposition of VAT payments on Yukos as happened in this case. In particular, the *Energomashbank* decision of the Russian Constitutional Court stands for the proposition that courts must not limit themselves to a purely formalistic analysis in assessing tax claims by the State, but rather must examine the actual facts in order to respect the taxpayer's right to a fair opportunity to defend itself against the claim.705\n\nResolution of the Russian Constitutional Court No. 14-P \u00b6 4, 28 October 1999, Exh. R-293 (the right to judicial defense is infringed when courts fail to investigate actual facts and limit themselves to establishing \"formal conditions for the application of the law\"). *See also* Reply \u00b6 236 and Second Konnov Report \u00b6 72.\n\n**iii. Would any Illicit Conduct by a Taxpayer Justify the Denial of a VAT Exemption, Irrespective of Whether the Illicit Conduct was Connected to VAT, and without any Regard to Proportionality?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n672.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent raises an additional argument in support of the authorities' denial of the VAT exemption to Yukos. Respondent asserts that, in any event, \"the denial of [a] VAT exemption is appropriate when the exporter, like Yukos, has been involved in flagrantly illicit conduct.\"706 In support of its argument, Respondent relies on what it characterizes as the practice in many countries to deny \"the benefit of exemption or 0% rating, even where documentary requirements have been punctually satisfied, if the relevant export transaction is tainted by illegality (as was the case with Yukos) or even simply by impropriety.\"707 In particular, Respondent relies on the decision of the ECJ in *R. v. Germany*.708\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1076.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1206.\n\n*R. v. Germany*, ECJ, Case C-285/09, Judgment, 7 December 2010, Exh. R-1401 (hereinafter \" *R. v. Germany* \").\n\n673.\n\nRespondent summarizes the *R. v. Germany* decision as follows in its Counter-Memorial:\n\nMore recently, the European Court of Justice, in the case of R. v. Germany,upheld the imposition of VAT by the German tax authorities on export transactions that had been carried out by an individual who had made fraudulent misrepresentations in his applications for exemption from German VAT, notwithstanding the fact that the fraud had not deprived Germany of any tax revenues, since the goods in question had effectively been exported out of Germany and therefore\u2014but for the fraud in the attendant documentation\u2014would have been unquestionably entitled to full exemption from German VAT. The ECJ rejected the argument that imposition of VAT on the exporter would violate \"principles of fiscal neutrality or legal certainty, or... legitimate expectations,\" holding that none of those principles can \"legitimately be invoked by a taxable person who has intentionally participated in tax evasion...\" This was true, the court held, even though the tax evaded was not one that the taxpayer himself would normally have had to pay, and even though the result was that Germany ended up with a windfall, collecting a tax that, in the absence of fraud, it would never have been able to assess.709\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1208 (citing *R. v. Germany* \u00b6 22). Respondent notes: \"In fact, as made clear by the ECJ, the German taxpayer had not himself evaded any tax for which he might have been liable, because the sole purpose and effect of his fraudulent conduct had been to assist unrelated third parties\u2014his foreign customers\u2014to evade taxes in their home country of Portugal.\" *Ibid.* n. 1878.   \nRespondent adds further: \"The ECJ stated that \"[t]hose principles cannot legitimately be invoked by a taxable person who has intentionally participated in tax evasion and who has jeopardized the operation of the common system on VAT\". *Ibid*. \u00b6 54. The ECJ also summarily dismissed the argument that imposition of VAT on an exporter (who, as had been pointed out by the Advocate General, would probably never be able to recover it from his customer) would violate the general EU principle of proportionality. The court held that the exporter's involvement in the third party's tax evasion scheme was \"decisive\" in this regard. Specifically the court stated that \"[a]s regards the principle of proportionality, it must be observed that this does not preclude a supplier who participates in tax evasion from being obliged to pay VAT subsequently on this intra-community supply, inasmuch as his involvement in the evasion is a decisive factor to be taken into account in an assessment of the proportionality of a national measure....\") *Ibid*. n.1879.\n\n674.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants contend that this decision is of no assistance to Respondent, because it \"does not suggest that the tax authorities may deny VAT exemptions because of allegations of illegality unrelated to actual compliance with the VAT law.\"710 Indeed, contrary to the *R. v. Germany* decision (in which, Claimants assert, the ECJ expressly rejected a punitive approach), Claimants argue that the \"staggering demands for VAT payment\u2014plus fines and interest\u2014 made by the Tax Ministry\"711 constitute an entirely disproportionate response to the alleged defects in the paperwork submitted by Yukos, and are evidence of \"the tax authorities' manifest bad faith on this issue.\"712\n\nReply \u00b6 248.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 249.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 252.\n\n675.\n\nAccording to Respondent, however, the decision is directly applicable to the present case because, in that case, the ECJ held \"that it is entirely appropriate for a State to deny VAT refunds (or exemptions) to an exporting company whose conduct, like Yukos', involves \u2018 *evasion, avoidance or abuse,* ' even though the scheme did not deprive that State of any VAT or other revenues.\"713 Respondent asserts that Claimants' attempt to distinguish the *R. v. Germany* decision on the grounds that, in that case, the scheme involved an attempt to evade VAT charges, whereas Yukos' fraud was designed to evade a tax on profits, is \"sophistic.\"714 Respondent explains:\n\nWhat makes the European Court of Justice's decision relevant to these arbitrations is its holding that, because the export transactions in that case were part of an abusive scheme, Germany was entitled to levy VAT on those exports, notwithstanding the fact that no German tax (of any kind) had been evaded. Reasoning by analogy, Russia's VAT assessments against Yukos were appropriate *a fortiori*, since Yukos' fraudulent scheme\u2014 unlike the one in *R v. Germany* \u2014most assuredly involved a revenue loss for Russia, to wit, the loss of huge amounts of corporate profit tax that the Yukos tax evasion scheme was engineered to evade.715\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 709 (emphasis in original) (citing *R. v. Germany* \u00b6 51, Exh. R-1401).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 710.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n676.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent again invokes the ECJ's decision in *R. v. Germany*.716 Claimants, in their own Post-Hearing Brief, reiterated that \"Yukos' tax optimization structure was not aimed at, and indeed could not possibly achieve, any reduction in VAT liabilities.\"717 Claimants conclude that this decision is of no assistance to the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 42.\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 42.\n\n677.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the Russian Federation's imposition of massive VAT liabilities on Yukos can be excused or justified on the basis of the *R. v. Germany* decision. Firstly, no element of Yukos' tax optimization scheme could be said to constitute an abuse of the VAT system. In the *R. v. Germany* case, however, the taxpayer who was denied the VAT exemption was convicted on two counts of tax evasion by means of which he had evaded more that \u20ac1 million of VAT in 2002 and more than \u20ac1.5 million of VAT in 2003. Secondly, the Tribunal considers the imposition of VAT on Yukos to be a disproportionate response to whatever abuse took place in the low-tax regions, considering that the tax authorities had already imposed all of the revenue-based taxes deemed to be owed by the trading entities on Yukos. In the *R. v. Germany* decision, the ECJ reminded Member States that they\n\nmust observe the general principles of law that form part of the European Union legal order, which include, in particular, the principles of legal certainty and proportionality and the principle of protection of legitimate expectations (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-286/94, C-340/95, C-401/95 and C-47/96 *Molenheide and Others* [1977] ECR 1-7281, paragraph 48; Case C-384/04 *Federation of Technological Industries and* others [2006] ECR 1-4191, paragraphs 29 and 30; and Case C-271/06 *Netto Supermarkt* [2008] ECR 1771, paragraph 18). As regards, in particular, the principle of proportionality, the Court has already held that, in accordance with that principle, the measures which the Member States may thus adopt must not go further than is necessary to attain the objectives of ensuring the correct levying and collection of the tax and the prevention of tax evasion (see, in particular, Case C-188/09 *Profaktor Kulesza, Frankowski J\u00f3zwiak, Orlowski* [2010] ECR 1-0000, paragraph 26).718\n\n*R. v. Germany* \u00b6 45, Exh. R-1401.\n\n678.\n\nIn the present case, with respect to the denial by the Russian tax authorities of the VAT exemption to Yukos, the Tribunal finds that the Russian Federation did go much further than was necessary to attain a legitimate objective of collecting taxes.\n\n**iv. Did Yukos Contribute to its Own Demise by Failing to File Proper VAT documentation, or Does the Evidence Suggest that Any Efforts by Yukos to Minimize its Liability would have been Thwarted by the Authorities?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n679.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent also contends that Yukos acted self-destructively in relation to VAT, in as much as:\n\n(a) Yukos could have avoided further VAT assessments \"easily and at no cost, simply by having Yukos itself (or one of the other genuine companies of the Yukos group) acknowledge its status as the real exporter and file the requisite documentation itself\".719\n\n(b) Yukos, when it belatedly filed amended VAT returns for some prior periods, \"submitted those returns in a format that was incapable of being processed by the authorities' computer, with the result that, as any tax expert would have predicted, they were rejected.\"720\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1078.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1079.\n\n680.\n\nIn relation to the format for filing the VAT returns, Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial, wrote:\n\nFor an unexplained reason, Yukos belatedly filed yearly VAT returns, whereas quarterly or monthly returns were required. See Konnov Report, \u00b6 58. See Article 163 of the Tax Code, providing with respect to VAT that \"1. Tax period shall be established as a calendar month, unless otherwise provided by paragraph 2 of this Article (this applies to taxpayers performing the obligations of tax agents, hereinafter referred to as tax agents). 2. For taxpayers (tax agents) whose monthly revenues from the sale of goods (works, services) within a quarter, excluding the tax and sales tax, do not exceed one million rubles, the tax period shall be established as a quarter.\" With effect from Jan. 1, 2004, Article 163 was amended to read: \"1. Tax period shall be established as a calendar month, unless otherwise provided by paragraph 2 of this Article (this applies to taxpayers performing the obligations of tax agents, hereinafter referred to as tax agents). 2. For taxpayers (tax agents) whose monthly revenues from the sale of goods (works, services) within a quarter, excluding the tax, do not exceed one million rubles, the tax period shall be established as a quarter.\" [Exh. R-1502]. Not surprisingly, the courts have rejected such returns. See, e.g., Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-4338/05-107-9/ A40-7780/05-98-90 (Apr. 28, 2005), 59 [Exh. C-196] (\"The tax return submitted by OAO Yukos Oil Company for value added tax for 2003 cannot be considered, since it does not meet the requirements of tax legislation regarding submission of a VAT tax return for each tax period, which is a month or quarter \").721\n\n[emphasis added by Respondent]\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1079, n.1707\n\n681.\n\nFor Claimants, the particular format of the VAT filings was just a pretext by the tax authorities for refusing to credit Yukos for the VAT refunds obtained by the trading companies:\n\nThe Respondent accuses Yukos of having \"acted self-destructively\" by filing yearly VAT returns instead of quarterly or monthly returns and, by way of support, refers to the Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court regarding the alleged tax reassessment for the year 2003. However, the monthly reporting requirement relates solely to the periodicity at which, in the ordinary course of events, companies are required to file VAT returns. In circumstances where the documentation was being submitted four years after the fact, it would have made no sense\u2014and would likely have generated unnecessary additional work for the tax authorities\u2014to disaggregate the annual information into monthly data.722\n\n[emphasis in original]\n\nReply \u00b6 250. Claimants note that: \"The Respondent is unable to make up its mind as to whether the documents needed to be filed on a monthly or quarterly basis or whether either is permissible, a position whose vagueness cannot be reconciled with the purported certainty with which it affirms that yearly submissions were improper. [citing Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1079, n.1707.]\" *Ibid*. n.440.  \n Claimants add further: \"The Respondent offers no support for its assertion that the returns submitted by Yukos were \"incapable of being processed by the authorities' computer\", an assertion which is implausible on its face, particularly in light of the Respondent's own uncertainty as to whether monthly or quarterly submissions were required, and was in any event not relied on as a basis for the original rejection.\" *Ibid*. n.442.\n\n682.\n\nClaimants add in their Reply that \"the text of Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code seriously undermines this pretext in that it imposes no timing restrictions whatsoever in relation to the submission of the required documentation for obtaining a VAT refund.\"723\n\nReply \u00b6 251 (citing Russian Tax Code, Article 165, Exh. R-1484 (\"In the event that no documents (copies thereof) referred above are provided by the taxpayer within 180 days after the expiry of 180 days of the date of the release by the regional customs authority under export or transit customs procedure, said transactions involving the sale of goods (performance of works, provision of services) shall be taxed at a rate of 10 percent or 18 percent accordingly. In the event that subsequently the taxpayer submits to the tax authorities any documents (copies thereof) proving eligibility of the zero percent tax rate application, the tax paid shall be refunded to the taxpayer in the manner and on terms and conditions expressly provided by article 176 of this Code.\").\n\n683.\n\nRespondent disagrees:\n\nEqually meritless is the allegation that the \"monthly reporting requirement relates solely to the periodicity at which, in the ordinary course of events, companies are required to file VAT returns\" and is not applicable when \"the documentation is being submitted four years after the fact.\" Contrary to Claimants' suggestion, the Russian Tax Code does not contemplate any exception for non-\"ordinary course\" filings, and in particular allows no derogation from the requirement that filings be made on a monthly (or, in cases not relevant to Yukos, quarterly) basis. Rather, it clearly provides what a taxpayer must file to claim a 0% VAT rate on exports, and neither Yukos nor any other taxpayer is entitled to decide for itself whether or not to comply with the law based on \"convenience\".724\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 719(iii) (citing Reply \u00b6 250-51, stating that \"Claimants also rely on Article 165 of the Tax Code in making this argument, but Article 165 had nothing to do with the period (*i.e.*, monthly or annual) that Yukos' VAT filing should have covered.\" and also citing Second Konnov Report \u00b6 93).\n\n684.\n\nIn his Second Expert Report, Mr. Konnov refers to the strict formalism of Russian tax legislation with respect to VAT and cites, in support of the decision of the tax authorities, a decision of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court issued in 2011:\n\n86. The strict formalism of Russian tax legislation with respect to VAT was recently confirmed in the *Forward* VAT case (unrelated to YUKOS) which has reached the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court. *Forward* was a construction company. In relation to the construction of a residential building in the city of Bryansk, it was collecting investment contributions. *Forward* failed to assess VAT on its remuneration when due. Based on a field audit, the tax authorities assessed VAT (and profit tax) on *Forward*. The taxpayer claimed input VAT credit in court. Neither the amounts of input VAT, nor the payment made by the suppliers was disputed by the tax authorities. The taxpayer submitted to the court documents evidencing input VAT, but failed to file an amended VAT return claiming the respective amounts of input VAT. Even though the amount of the input VAT paid by the taxpayer was undisputed, the court denied the input VAT credit solely on the basis that the taxpayer failed to file an amended VAT return.\n\n87. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court concluded that, in accordance with the Russian Tax Code and the prevailing court practice, input VAT credit had to be claimed by a taxpayer in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Russian Tax Code, and that the tax authorities were not obliged to identify and credit undeclared input VAT on their own:\n\n\"The fact that documents confirming, in the taxpayer's opinion, a right for tax credit are available without reflecting (showing, claiming) the amount of the tax credit in a tax return is not a ground for reduction of VAT payable to the budget for a tax period. Availability of documents confirming the right for VAT credit does not replace an obligation to claim it in a tax return.\"\n\n88. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court unequivocally confirmed that, as concerns VAT, Russian tax legislation is very formal and no VAT benefit can be allowed if it was not properly claimed by a taxpayer in a tax return.725\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 86-88 (citing Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation No. 23/11, 26 April 2011, Exh. R-3270).\n\n685.\n\nWhen he gave evidence, Mr. Konnov also offered a practical justification for the monthly/quarterly requirement:\n\nBut secondly, you cannot simply amend VAT law to allow annual return, because there are a few corresponding provisions. For instance, there is a provision on the chamber audit, on which I was questioned by Professor Gaillard: it is three months. And what that means: that if one taxpayer is on a monthly VAT return and the other one is on a quarterly return, the three months are sufficient for the tax authorities to do a counter-audit with respect to all the suppliers and other interested parties.\n\nIf, however, you simply introduce annual return, and without corresponding changes to other provisions in the Tax Code, the tax authorities -- basically the VAT law will not function properly. So you can do that, but that would mean not only allowing acceptance of annual return, but redrafting the whole VAT chapter of the Tax Code to work it properly.726\n\nTranscript, Day 15 at 199.\n\n686.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that while this practical justification does seem to support the monthly/quarterly filing requirement when the tax authorities are auditing the underlying transactions, it is more difficult to understand how that justification applied to Yukos' attempts to obtain credit for the trading companies' VAT refunds, in a situation where those VAT refunds had already been vetted and approved by the authorities at the time they had been claimed (for the first time) by the trading entities.\n\n687.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants assert that there was no reason to believe that, if Yukos had disaggregated the VAT data into monthly submissions as Respondent suggests it should have done the tax authorities would have accepted the filings:\n\nIndeed, the Claimants note that if such resubmissions were a genuinely available option, the Respondent offers no explanation as to why, once Yukos' allegedly self-destructive management had been replaced with a bankruptcy receiver, that receiver, Mr. Rebgun, failed to resubmit the VAT returns in the allegedly required format, given that if such an option had existed, Mr. Rebgun's fiduciary duties to the creditors would have required him to take advantage of it.727\n\nReply \u00b6 252 (citing Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1079, 1105(viii), 1237(vii), 1272, 1279(vii), 1322(vii)).\n\n688.\n\nIn respect of this point, Professor Gaillard opined that the Russian authorities, including the courts, would certainly have found another reason to deny Yukos the VAT exemption if Yukos had filed monthly amended returns. Professor Gaillard referred Mr. Konnov to the following extract from the Moscow Arbitrazh Court's decision relating to the 2003 tax year:\n\n\"The tax return submitted by... Yukos Oil Company for value added tax for 2003 cannot be considered, since it does not meet the requirements of tax legislation regarding submission of a VAT tax return for each tax period, which is a month or quarter, and documents were not submitted at these times confirming the sale of goods for export and tax deductions... \"728\n\nTranscript, Day 14 at 259 (referring to Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case Nos. A40-4338/05-107-9 and A40-7780/05-98-90, 28 April 2005, p. 59, Exh. C-196).\n\n689.\n\nProfessor Gaillard then put the following question to Respondent's expert:\n\nQ. Simply, Mr Konnov, when you look at this sentence which the Chairman directed you to, do you also see that the court says that the tax return cannot be considered because:\n\n\"... documents were not submitted at these times.\"\n\nDo you see that?\n\nA. Yes, I do.\n\nQ. So the reason the court is articulating is that: (1) it's not monthly or quarterly; and (2) it was not submitted at the right time. Correct?729\n\n*Ibid.* at 260.\n\n690.\n\nMr. Konnov disagreed with Professor Gaillard's interpretation:\n\nNo, no. It says that you need to submit supporting documents, which are in Article 165, with your VAT return. Article 165 says VAT return and supporting documents.730\n\n*Ibid*. at 261.\n\n691.\n\nEarlier in his evidence, Mr. Konnov had also supported the court's reasoning in the following words:\n\nAnd this is exactly the reason I explain in my report, I believe, that Yukos had to file monthly returns, and there is no such thing as an annual return. And the document that is in the record suggests that Yukos filed an annual return by even using a pen, I believe, or one way or another just crossing out and filling in the form the way it electronically cannot be done. And the court addresses it here, and says that, \"What you filed is not a proper VAT return.\"731\n\n*Ibid.* at 259.\n\n692.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the following exchange between Professor Gaillard and Mr. Konnov of particular interest. Professor Gaillard asked Mr. Konnov for his reaction to another reason which could have been invoked by the Russian authorities/courts to deny the VAT refunds to Yukos even if it had filed \"proper\" monthly VAT returns:\n\nQ. Okay. Do you see the sentence pursuant to which the court [the Moscow Arbitrazh Court rejecting Yukos's VAT argument in relation to the 2002 tax year] says:\n\n\"The court did not accept the argument of... YUKOS [Oil Company] that tax returns submitted to tax authorities by the said organisations [ *i.e.*, the trading entities] shall be deemed as tax returns of. YUKOS [Oil Company] since such returns were signed by persons who had no powers to submit tax returns on behalf of. YUKOS [Oil Company].\"\n\nDo you see that?\n\nA. Right.\n\n\u2026\n\nPROFESSOR GAILLARD: So what interests me is this sentence which we read, the court saying that they:\n\n\"... did not accept the argument of. Yukos that tax returns submitted... by the [trading companies] shall be deemed as tax returns of \u2026 YUKOS [Oil Company] since such tax returns were signed by persons who had no powers to submit tax returns on behalf of \u2026 YUKOS [Oil Company].\"\n\nCan you confirm that this is a correct translation of the Russian original?\n\nA. I think it is. And I think, again, as you have read out, the court responds to \"the argument of... Yukos\". So this sentence suggests that Yukos argued that they should be deemed as if they were filed by Yukos. And probably the question was: how can someone act on behalf of Yukos? And the court said, \"Look, they cannot be accepted as Yukos tax returns, at least because someone who signed them, in the name of Yukos-M here, could not act on behalf of Yukos.\"\n\nQ. But conversely the papers themselves would say that Ratibor -- or Yukos-M, in this example -- is the exporter. The documentation they could file would say Yukos-M, Ratibor, Fargoil, whatever, has sold abroad. So the documents are not going to bear the name of Yukos, are they?\n\nA. Absolutely.\n\nQ. Right. So Yukos loses one way or the other, because either the documents do not say that they are the exporter, or they are not deemed to be the beneficiaries of the revenues, right?\n\nA. No, Yukos wins one way: it simply refiles.732\n\n*Ibid.* at 248-250.\n\n693.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants' submission that there was no reason to believe that, had Yukos made proper filings, the tax authorities would have accepted them, is \"gratuitously self- serving\".733 According to Respondent, \"Russian law clearly indicates what Yukos should have done, but inexplicably failed to do.\"734\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 719(iv).\n\n*Ibid.* (citing Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-4338/05-107-9 and A-40-7780/05-98-90, 28 April 2005, p. 59, Exh. C-196 (\"The tax return submitted by OAO Yukos Oil Company for value added tax for 2003 cannot be considered, since it does not meet the requirements of tax legislation regarding submission of a VAT tax return for each tax period, which is a month or quarter[\u2026]\"); Resolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Appellate Court, Case No. 09AP-7979/05-AK, 16 August 2005, p. 60, Exh.

The Tribunal observes that this determination of the Russian Federation to do whatever it deemed necessary to impose massive tax liabilities on Yukos is also evidenced by the second trial and conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. After having been convicted of various tax-related crimes in May 2005,735 largely stemming from his leadership of Yukos, for which he was sentenced to a term of nine years of imprisonment, Mr. Khodorkovsky was implausibly convicted of money laundering and theft of oil in December 2010.736 This second verdict, for which Mr. Khodorkovsky was sentenced to an additional thirteen years and six months in prison, was based on essentially the same circumstances surrounding Yukos that led to the original conviction for tax evasion. This shows how far the Russian Federation was willing to go to keep Mr. Khodorkovsky imprisoned, and supports the Tribunal's conclusion that it was Respondent's intent to impose VAT liability on Yukos no matter what Yukos did.\n\nJudgment of the Meshchansky District Court for the City of Moscow, 16 May 2005, Exh.

C-1057.\n\n695.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard submissions from the Parties on the responsibility of the bankruptcy trustee (Mr. Rebgun) for his failure to file VAT forms in the proper format.\n\n696.\n\nOn this issue, Respondent contends as follows:\n\nFinally, while the Russian Federation does not speak for Mr. Rebgun or know the circumstances of his treatment of the VAT issue, it is specious for Claimants to attempt to blame Mr. Rebgun for Yukos' failure to file proper amended VAT returns for 2000-2003 (or any amended VAT return at all for 2004). Mr. Rebgun took office only in August 2006. Until then, Yukos had been managed by a team that Claimants themselves had appointed. That team, as noted above, had submitted non-processable amended VAT filings for years 2000-2003 in August 2004, and had done nothing in the ensuing two-year period to correct those errors. As for the 2004 tax year, the managers appointed by Claimants failed to submit any amended returns at all. Accordingly, Claimants and their appointees bear sole responsibility for Yukos' mishandling of the VAT filings. Mr. Rebgun cannot be blamed, if only because by the time he finally took office (a) the 2000-2004 tax assessments had already been issued and become due and payable for all five of the relevant years, (b) the court rulings that had upheld the 2000-2003 tax assessments had become *res judicata*, and (c) in any event, the three-year time limits to file amended VAT returns had already expired for the whole of the 2000, 2001, and 2002 tax years, as well as for more than half of the 2003 tax year. In any event, as established at paragraphs 388-395 above, it is clear as a matter of public international law that the Russian Federation is not responsible for acts or omissions of bankruptcy receivers such as Mr. Rebgun.737\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 719(v) (citing Reply \u00b6 252; Second Konnov Report \u00b6 95; *Kotov v.

The State's involvement in the liquidation procedure resulted only from its role in establishing the legislative framework for such procedures, in defining the functions and the powers of the creditors' body and of the liquidator, and in overseeing observance of the rules. It follows that the liquidator did not act as a State agent. Consequently, the respondent State cannot be held directly responsible for his wrongful acts in the present case. The fact that a court was entitled to review the lawfulness of the liquidator's actions does not alter this analysis.\")  \n Respondent further notes: \"In particular: (a) the 2000 tax assessment became final and irreversible on 30 December 2005, when the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow District dismissed Yukos' appeal of the Ninth Arbitrazh Appellate Court decision in proceedings upon Yukos' challenge of the 2000 tax assessment. *See* Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow District, Case No. KA-A40/12571-04, 30 December 2005, Exh.

Right. It's absolutely clear to me\u2014whether you call it \"error\" or whether that was intentional action, I don't know\u2014but the defect in the VAT return was so apparent for not only a professional tax advisor and not only for Yukos, which, as we know, had a big tax team and was filing and processing this VAT return on a routine basis, but we also -- I think I referred to documents, correspondence by Golub where she admitted that it should be monthly and they required it monthly.\n\nSo I think I have absolutely no doubt that they perfectly understood that the amended returns cannot and will not be accepted.\n\nJUDGE SCHWEBEL: And can you find any rational explanation for such behaviour?\n\nA. I have difficulties finding the rational behaviour, and there is nothing in the record. My only guess, and that would only be a guess: that what Yukos was trying to do, it was trying to take a position that in its view will not compromise its position with respect to the profits tax.\n\nIn other words, if Yukos\u2014Yukos clearly would not follow my advice, and my advice, as you have seen, will be to refile both. If they refiled proper VAT return without refiling\u2014sorry, if they refiled proper\u2014if they refiled proper VAT returns without refiling proper profit tax return, I think they were\u2014my guess, my speculation, is they thought that court would look at that and would see that as them taking an inconsistent position for VAT and profits tax purposes.\n\nSo therefore my guess, again, is that they filed something\u2014which I would not call even maybe a VAT return, but something that they knew was apparently not acceptable\u2014just to take procedural actions. But, as came during the crossexamination by Professor Gaillard, I think I mentioned that they file in August and they don't even refer to these returns till the\u2014till late 2005\u2014till 2005.\n\nSo that's my only guess: that they tried to put in\u2014to file something with the tax service which could later on be used in argument, but would not compromise, in their view, their position on the profits tax.\n\nJUDGE SCHWEBEL: Could the Trustee in Bankruptcy, who was charged with maximising the resources available for creditors, himself have filed the monthly forms for VAT return?\n\nA. Yes, he could have refiled, subject to the three-year limitation that I referred to previously. So you look at the date when he came to power, if I may say, and for the previous three years he could have refiled.\n\n\u2026\n\nTHE CHAIRMAN: Should he be criticised for that?\n\nA. I would say so. But it's easy now to criticise, when I look back. So I would say I would\u2014\n\nYes, I would say I would criticise him738\n\nTranscript, Day 15 at 232-35.\n\n**v. Extracts from Other Yukos-Related Awards**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nThe *Quasar* tribunal, citing the *RosInvestCo* tribunal's holding, traversed the VAT issue in the following words and concluded without any hesitation that Respondent's position on this issue was indefensible:\n\n**D) The rejection of the VAT refund**\n\n80. The unattractiveness of the Respondent's position in this connection is readily apparent. The amounts involved were vast - in excess of $13.5 billion. The export sales in question undoubtedly qualified for VAT refunds. The trading company sellers had duly applied for them. But once the tax authorities had invalidated the transactions by which the sellers had come into possession of the goods, they concluded that Yukos was the true original owner and therefore should be deemed to be the true export seller. If this was so, one would expect that by a parity of reasoning under their basic premise, the tax authorities should have held that the true applicant for the refund was also Yukos - and that Yukos was therefore entitled to the VAT credit in the same way as it was assigned the debit for the profit tax. To try to have it both ways would surely bespeak unprincipled hostility towards the taxpayer.\n\n81. Yet that is precisely what the tax officials did - with the subsequent endorsement of the courts.\n\n82. Unsurprisingly, *RosInvest* viewed this conduct in the harsh light it deserves:\n\n\"The extremely formalistic interpretation of the VAT lax law regarding Yukos and its trading companies to the effect that, though exports were undisputedly not subject to VAT, the documentation also undisputedly submitted by the trading companies could not be used in relation to Yukos and thus Yukos was liable far more than US$ 13.5 billion in VAT related taxes is difficult to accept as a justification for a tax liability the size of which was sufficient to lead Yukos into bankruptcy.\" (\u00b6452)\n\nThe present Tribunal entirely endorses this conclusion, and agrees with the Claimants that the ECHR appears, in \u00b6\u00b6 601-602, to have entirely missed the point being made, namely that if the tax authorities were going to attribute to Yukos the transactions carried out in the names of its trading companies, they should also have attributed to Yukos the submission of normal VAT documentation by the trading companies. Given that the export transactions in question were indisputably zero-rated for VAT purposes, the refusal to do so can only seem confiscatory to a degree which comes close to validating the claims in their entirety on this basis alone.739\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6\u00b6 80-82, R-3383.\n\n699.\n\nThe following extract from the judgment of the ECtHR, which found in favour of the Russian Federation on this issue is of interest:\n\n601. The Court notes that both Section 5 of Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 \"On Value-Added Tax\" governing the relevant sphere until 1 January 2001 as well as Article 165 of the Tax Code applicable to the subsequent period provided unequivocally that a zero rate of value-added tax in respect of exported goods and its refund could by no means be applied automatically, and that the company was required to claim the tax exemptions or refunds under its own name under the procedure set out initially in Letter no. B3-8-05/848, 04-03-08 of the State Tax Service of Russia and the Ministry of Finance and subsequently in Article 176 of the Tax Code to substantiate the requests in order to obtain the impugned refunds (see paragraphs 326-336). In view of the above, the Court finds that the relevant rules made the procedure for VAT refunds sufficiently clear and accessible for the applicant company to able to comply with it.\n\n602. Having examined the case file materials and the parties' submissions, including the company's allegation made at the hearing on 4 March 2010 that it had filed the VAT exemption forms for each of the years 2000 to 2003 on 31 August 2004, the Court finds that the applicant company failed to submit any proof that it had made a properly substantiated filing in accordance with the established procedure, and not simply raised it as one of the arguments in the Tax Assessment proceedings, and that it had then contested any refusal by the tax authorities before the competent domestic courts (see paragraphs 49 and 171, 196, 196 and 216). The Court concludes that the applicant company did not receive any adverse treatment in this respect.740\n\nECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6\u00b6 601-602, Exh. R-3328.\n\n700.\n\nIn the view of this Tribunal however, far from not receiving \"any adverse treatment in this respect\" as the ECtHR held, Yukos received some thirteen billion dollars worth of adverse treatment by reason of the imposition on it of VAT liabilities earlier excluded by the undisputed export of the oil in question.\n\n**(c) Fines**\n-------------\n\n**i. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n701.\n\nClaimants contend that neither the \"willful offender\" nor the \"repeat offender\" fines should have been assessed, and that \"the animating, confiscatory purpose behind the Respondent's actions is palpable.\"741 Claimants also assert that the imposition of fines for the year 2000 was barred by the statute of limitations, and that the authorities' reliance on what Claimants characterize as a new, retroactive, and judicially-created exception to the statute is further demonstration of its expropriatory intent.742\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 47.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 45.\n\n702.\n\nRespondent insists that the authorities' conduct was proper, that the Russian courts properly rejected Yukos' arguments against the fines, and that the Tribunal should do the same here in the present arbitration.\n\n703.\n\nThe following questions with respect to fines arise from a review of the Parties' written and oral submissions:\n\n\u2022 Were the fines levied in relation to the 2000 tax year barred by the statute of limitations?;\n\n\u2022 Were the \"willful offender\" fines properly imposed?;\n\n\u2022 Were the \"repeat offender\" fines properly imposed?;\n\n\u2022 Could Yukos have avoided the fines?; and\n\n\u2022 Was the quantum of the fines reasonable, in terms of both the rate and the absolute amount?\n\n**ii. Were Fines Levied in Relation to the 2000 Tax Year Barred by the Statute of Limitations?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n704.\n\nArticle 113 of the Russian Tax Code establishes a three-year statute of limitations for all tax offenses.743 In respect of the 2000 tax year, Yukos had argued before the Russian courts that it was improper for the authorities to levy any fine because their assessment was not issued until 14 April 2004, *i.e.*, a few months after the posited expiration of the statute of limitations for fines. Yukos' argument was considered by Russia's courts and ultimately rejected on the ground that the statute of limitations had been tolled by Yukos' \"interference\" with the authorities' following the December 2003 tax audit.\n\nRussian Tax Code, Article 11(1), Exh. C-1276. Mr. Konnov opines, in his Second Expert Report, that, under Russian law, the statute of limitations applies to fines only, and does not apply to tax arrears or default interest. Second Konnov Report, \u00b6 109.\n\n705.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that after the 2000 Audit Report was issued, Mr. Pepeliaev, in his first opinion to his client Yukos, on 5 January 2004, concluded that:\n\nThe Russian tax law envisages a legal process to collect fines. However the fine cannot be actually collected in 2004 due to the expiration of the 3-year limitation period.744\n\nS. Pepeliaev, *Summary of the tax inspection of OAO NK Yukos*, p. 1, 5 January 2004, Exh. C-1128.\n\n706.\n\nIn a later opinion, Mr. Pepeliaev wrote:\n\nIn accordance with the currently applicable procedure set out in Art. 101 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, a decision to hold the company liable pursuant to the Inspection Report of December 29, 2003 may be passed no earlier than in 2004. Moreover, by virtue of art. 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation no one may be held liable for a tax offence if three years have expired (limitation period) from the date of this tax offence or from the date following the end date of the tax period in which this offence was committed. In breach of this rule of law, the Inspection Report says that YUKOS should be held liable for the activities of 17 companies that took place in 2000.745\n\nS. Pepeliaev et al., Opinion regarding compliance with legislation of Inspection Report No. 08-1/1 of 20 December 2003 issued by the Tax Ministry of Russia, 15 January 2004, p. 3, Exh. C-1129.\n\n707.\n\nRespondent, in its Counter-Memorial, objects that Claimants did not raise the statute of limitations argument in their Memorial. In any event, Respondent submits, the argument is meritless. Respondent adopts the reasoning of the Russian Courts.746 Respondent adds: \"[T]he statute of limitations provided a windfall to Yukos, insofar as the tax authorities never disturbed Yukos' abuses of the low-tax region regime prior to 2000. Yukos thus obtained a \u2018free ride' for the frauds it perpetrated in 1999, which involved significant amounts.\"747\n\n*See also* Respondent's Skeleton Argument, 1 October 2012 \u00b6 13 (hereinafter, \"Respondent's Skeleton\") (\"no taxpayer\u2014in Russia or elsewhere\u2014could legitimately claim to be surprised that it may not invoke a limitations period that has expired only because of its own obstruction of tax audits.\").\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1081, n.1708. Claimants reply that the 1999 audit report relating to Investproekt (Exh. R-304) was issued with ten months remaining on the statute of limitations, but that no Decision or Tax Payment Demand was issued (or, at least, none is in the record of this arbitration). *See* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 63, n.36.\n\n708.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants invoked the limitations period. They argue that it was unlawful for the tax authorities to seek to collect fines in relation to 2000 because \"the decision of the Russian tax authorities to hold Yukos liable in respect of alleged tax offenses committed in 2000 was issued on 14 April 2004, several months after the three-year statute of limitations had expired in relation to the year 2000 (*i.e.*, after 31 December 2003).\"748\n\nReply at \u00b6 258 (emphasis in original).\n\n709.\n\nClaimants respond to Respondent's reliance on the decisions of the Russian courts in the following words:\n\nThe Respondent's assertion (see Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, April 4, 2011, footnote 1708) that the Russian courts approved its circumvention of the statute of limitations against Yukos is unavailing given that, as discussed below, the ECtHR has found the Russian courts' decisions to violate the principle of legality embodied in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights, notwithstanding the extraordinary broad deference it accords to States under that provision.749\n\n*Ibid*., n.453\n\n710.\n\nClaimants assert that the tax authorities were able to circumvent the statute of limitations only because the Constitutional Court \"creat[ed] for the first time an exception to the statute of limitations for any taxpayer who \u2018resisted' tax inspection, so long as an audit report was issued before the end of the limitations period.\"750\n\n*Ibid*. (referring to Resolution of the Russian Constitutional Court No. 9-P, Exh. C-1141).\n\n711.\n\nRespondent resists Claimants' submission that the Constitutional Court's resolution allowing tolling of the statute of limitations in cases of taxpayer obstruction was \" *tailor-made* \" for Yukos.751 In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues that Claimants' submission is unsupported by any evidence and contradicted by the fact that this exception has been applied to numerous taxpayers, all unrelated to Yukos.752 As to the specific Constitutional Court Resolution No. 9 P, Respondent says that it was issued in response to two different complaints, only one of which was related to Yukos.753\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 725.\n\n*Ibid. \u00b6* 724, n.1151.\n\n712.\n\nIn his Second Expert Report, Mr. Konnov explains that the Constitutional Court ruled, in Resolution No. 9-P, as follows:\n\na. if a taxpayer obstructs tax control and tax audits, the arbitrazh court may rule that the tax authority was justified in acting after expiration of the limitations period; and\n\nb. in any event, the limitations period for tax offenses ends at the moment of execution of a tax audit report summarising documented facts of tax offenses identified in the course of the audit.754\n\nSecond Konnov Report \u00b6 111.\n\n713.\n\nMr. Konnov addresses Claimants' argument on this point:\n\nThe Claimants' allegation (Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 258) that the Russian Constitutional Court created an \"exception to the statute of limitations for any taxpayer who \"resisted\" tax inspection, so long as an audit report was issued before the end of the limitations period\" is misleading (emphasis added). The Constitutional Court made two separate conclusions not dependent on each other. The Claimants' contention that the \"tax audit report\" rule was \"tailor-made\" for YUKOS is not correct either. The tax authorities would have nonetheless been deemed within the statute of limitations period under the obstruction of the audit limb of the Resolution.755\n\n[emphasis in original]\n\n*Ibid*., n.177.\n\n714.\n\nMr. Konnov also adds:\n\nThe ruling of the Constitutional Court issued in July 2005 is described by the Claimants as \"tailor-made\" to YUKOS and in conflict with the ruling of the Constitutional Court issued in January 2005. I cannot agree. There is no inconsistency between these two rulings. Rather, in the July 2005 ruling, the Constitutional Court analyzed, in particular, the impact on the limitations period resulting from obstruction of the audit, an issue which was not addressed in any way in the January 2005 ruling.\n\nThe Claimants' reliance on the dissenting opinions in the July 2005 ruling is incomplete. The Claimants refer only to two dissenting opinions relating to the July 2005 ruling. However, they fail to mention the third dissenting opinion to the same ruling in which Judge G.A. Gadzhiev has taken an approach which, in my opinion, is even harsher than the approach taken by the Constitutional Court. In the view of Judge G.A. Gadzhiev, the statute of limitations should be applied differently depending on the amount of the tax arrears at issue. He believes that the non-differentiated statute of limitation, as it is provided in the tax legislation, contradicts the constitutional principle of equality before the law.756\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 112-13.\n\n715.\n\nFinally, Respondent adds in its Rejoinder on this point:\n\nIt is also worth reiterating that, as noted above, the Russian authorities' long-standing position, including when the Yukos cases were being argued in the Russian courts, has been that the three-year limitation period runs from the end of the taxable period in which payment was due (because this is the period when the tax offense actually occurred), and not from the end of the taxable period in which the relevant income or revenue accrued (and therefore, here, that the statute of limitations expired on December 31, 2004 rather than December 31, 2003). While this position was rejected by the courts in the Yukos case, it was upheld in other cases, and ultimately endorsed by the Supreme Arbitrazh Court. As a result, if the Yukos case were before the Russian courts today, it would be undisputable that the fines for tax year 2000 were assessed in a timely manner.757\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 731 (citing Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 4134/11, 27 September 2011, Exh. R-3298, interpreting a rule on calculation of the statute of limitations in Article 113 that was identical to the one in effect in 2003-2004. As Mr. Konnov points out \"the panel of three judges when transferring the case to the Presidium of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court noted that courts had previously issued inconsistent rulings on this subject.\"; Second Konnov Report \u00b6 121).\n\n716.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants assert that \"it is factually untrue that alleged obstruction by Yukos caused the tax authorities to miss the statute of limitations: the audit was completed in just 3 weeks and before t he limitations period had expired.\"758\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 45 (emphasis in original).\n\n717.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent asserts that \"Yukos unquestionably obstructed the field tax audit leading to the 2000 assessment, and it was completely foreseeable that Russian law would not allow Yukos to invoke a limitations period so as to benefit from its own obstruction.\"759\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 45 (citations omitted).\n\n718.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, on the basis of the record, that Respondent has made a credible argument regarding Yukos' obstruction of the field tax audit leading to the 2000 assessment.760 However, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants, and with the ECtHR, that the retroactive application of Resolution 9-P violated a fundamental principle of legality.761 The Tribunal concludes that the fines levied in relation to the 2000 tax year were therefore barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 355; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 723-30\n\nReply \u00b6 258; ECtHR Yukos Judgment, Exh.

Were the \"Willful Offender\" Fines Properly Imposed?**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n719.\n\nClaimants contest the imposition of the \"willful offender\" fines for the years 2000 through 2003 because \"for Yukos' executives to be \u2018aware of the unlawful nature of such actions', there must have existed an enforceable decision of the tax authorities to that effect.\"762 Such a decision, Claimants note, did not come until 14 April 2004, and thus only *after* Yukos filed its tax returns for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.763 Consequently, for the years 2000 through 2003, Yukos' executives could not have been \"aware\" of the alleged \"unlawful nature of the[ir] actions.\"764\n\nMemorial \u00b6 330.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n720.\n\nIn respect of the 2004 tax year, Claimants have a different argument:\n\nAs regards the 2004 tax reassessment, the regional and local tax benefits that these companies had enjoyed were significantly reduced by the federal legislator as from January 1, 2004. With the change in legislation, the alleged tax offenses for which Yukos was held liable with respect to the year 2004 could therefore not have been considered similar to those which had allegedly been committed by Yukos in 2000-2003 under the former legislation. In this context, the reference made by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in 2006 to the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions in order to justify the 40% fines for the year 2004 appear to be nothing less than a manifest misapplication of the law to Yukos.765\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 331 (citing Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 2 October 2006, 4 October 2006, confirming lawfulness of fines imposed on Yukos with respect to its tax reassessment for the year 2004, p. 31, Exh. C-201). Claimants note that \"[a]s from 1 January 2004, the benefits on corporate profit tax that the regions were authorized to grant to taxpayers out of the regional and local shares of this tax were limited to four percent.\"\n\n721.\n\nIn response, Respondent asserts, in its Counter-Memorial, that \"\u2018willfulness' does not require criminal *mens rea* : it is sufficient that the taxpayer's underassessment indicate a degree of awareness of the potential unlawfulness of its conduct.\"766 Nor does Respondent accept Claimants' argument that, in order for a violation to be deemed \"willful\", the taxpayer must already have been found liable. Respondent counters that:\n\nEven if Yukos, *quod non*, had been transparent and subjectively in good faith with respect to its \"tax optimization\" scheme, the very complexity of its scheme made it unavoidable that it would, at a minimum, be deemed \"willful\": one does not create a network of trading companies carelessly or as a result of honest mistake. In any event,... Yukos' managers knew perfectly well that their scheme was illegal when they first implemented it -- an aggravated form of \"willfulness.\"767\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1082 *. See* Konnov Report \u00b6 72.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1082.\n\n722.\n\nMr. Konnov supported Respondent's position with the following observations in his First Report:\n\nAt the time, YUKOS was one of the major Russian companies with substantial tax, legal and accounting departments. It knew that: (i) its tax minimization practices in ZATO Lesnoy had been investigated and challenged since late 1999; and (ii) its Sibirskaya Domestic Trading Company had been challenged by the tax authorities in 2001 and had lost its tax case in 2002. It also must have known that Russian authorities have been regularly challenging transactions involving other taxpayers aimed at tax evasion, including by means of abuses of companies registered in low-tax jurisdictions, and that Russian highest courts had introduced anti-abuse doctrines, including \"bad faith.\" Accordingly, in my view, YUKOS was a clear target for assessment of a \"wilful offender fine,\" which would have been justified even under far less extreme circumstances.768\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 76 (citations omitted).\n\n723.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants argue that Respondent is wrong in its contention that the Tax Ministry was merely required to show a \"degree of awareness of the potential unlawfulness of Yukos' conduct.\"769 Claimants contend that Respondent's theory is \"refuted by the plain text of the provision itself as well as the Respondent's own expert, who accepts that the statute requires the Authorities to prove that the offender \u2018was aware of the unlawful nature of his action (or inaction)'.\"770 Claimants contend that Respondent's position requires it to \"attempt to rewrite the statute.\"771\n\nReply \u00b6 260\n\n*Ibid*. (citing First Konnov Report \u00b6 72).\n\nReply \u00b6 260.\n\n724.\n\nClaimants take particular issue with the imposition of fines in respect of the VAT refunds:\n\n[A]s a general point, the imposition of fines in circumstances where no violation of statutory law has been alleged is a matter of dubious legitimacy. Particularly improper was the imposition of fines in relation to the revocation of VAT refunds. In circumstances where it was not alleged that any tax was owed, much less unpaid or underpaid, there was no statutory basis for such fines.772\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 257 (citations omitted).\n\n725.\n\nClaimants elaborate this argument in their Post-Hearing Brief:\n\nParticularly egregious is the imposition of such inflated fines in relation to VAT, where it is not even alleged that there was any intent to evade VAT nor any actual evasion of VAT. In any case, as set out above, Yukos was not, and could not possibly be \"aware of the unlawful nature of its actions\".773\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 46 (citations omitted).\n\n726.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent reiterates its argument that the relevant inquiry for purposes of the \"willful offender\" fine is whether Yukos' management was aware of the illegality of its tax scheme.774 Respondent states that Yukos did not implement the tax optimization scheme by accident, and that it knew that the scheme was unlawful. In support of its submission, Respondent raised several arguments:\n\n\u2022 Yukos masked its affiliation with the trading shells and falsely denied to the Russian authorities and courts that it had any knowledge of their documents or officers\n\n\u2022 Yukos knew from its experience with its sham Lesnoy trading shells that its scheme was unlawful\n\n\u2022 Yukos's senior management was warned at least twice that the authorities would have challenged Yukos' \"tax optimization\" scheme if they had known the names and details of Yukos' trading shells and their affiliation with Yukos\n\n\u2022 No legal counsel ever provided Yukos with an opinion that its \"tax optimization\" scheme was lawful\n\n\u2022 Yukos lied about its affiliation with its sham trading companies to the Russian tax authorities and courts, the ECtHR, and PwC\n\n\u2022 Yukos had access to the case law and commentaries published by its own tax counsel, which confirmed its scheme was unlawful.775\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 734.\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 130.\n\n727.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues:\n\nThe Tribunal should reject Claimants' contention that the willful offender fines were improper because Yukos' tax practices were purportedly based on the trading shells' investment agreements with local tax authorities, which as Mr. Konnov opined - without contradiction - were not sufficient to establish compliance with federal anti-abuse doctrines.776\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 44 (citations omitted).\n\n728.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the willful offender fines were clearly improper insofar as they related to VAT. This follows necessarily from the Tribunal's findings that there was no valid basis to impose the VAT liability on Yukos.\n\n729.\n\nOn the totality of the evidence, the Tribunal is also of the view that the willful offender fines as they related to the revenue-based taxes were improperly assessed against Yukos. The Tribunal recalls its findings, above, that those taxes, considering all of the evidence, were not properly assessed against Yukos.\n\n730.\n\nMoreover, while he did not appear at the Hearing, the contemporaneous quote from Mr. Kasyanov to journalists in January 2004 shows just how unlikely it was that Yukos could have been certain that its tax optimization plan was illegal:\n\n[Question:] The Tax Ministry claimed from Yukos to pay an additional 98 billion rubles, which the company allegedly saved on taxes in 2000 with the help of the schemes, which was also used by other companies. Until autumn 2003, neither the Ministry of Finance nor the Tax Ministry, though criticizing the schemes, had challenged their legality. How do you react to the fact that the tax optimization is retroactively declared unlawful?\n\n[Answer:] If lawful actions for tax optimization are declared unlawful retroactively, then I react to that negatively. For the simple reason that there were loopholes in the law allowing the optimization of payments. The Tax Code did not forbid Yukos and other companies to conduct transactions through domestic offshore zones.777\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nMemorial \u00b6 330 (quoting Alexander Bekker, Vladimir Fedorin, *Interview: Mikhail Kasyanov, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation*, Vedomosti, 12 January 2004, p. 5, Exh. C-677).\n\n731.\n\nThe opinion of Mr. Kasyanov, the Prime Minister at the time the assessment was made, is persuasive. It confirms the conclusion of the Tribunal that, even if the legality of Yukos' tax optimization scheme was, in certain regions and respects, questionable and vulnerable to attack by the tax authorities, it could not be characterized as a \"willful offense\".\n\n732.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls Claimants' position as to the governing statutory provision in the Russian Tax Code:\n\nWhereas the Tax Code clearly provides that fines may be increased for willfulness only \"if the person who committed it was aware of the unlawful nature of his actions (inaction) and intended or consciously allowed the harmful consequences of such actions (inaction)\" the Respondent claimed that such fines could be imposed if the taxpayer had \"a degree of awareness of the potential unlawfulness of its conduct\". The Respondent\u2019s position is obviously not the law.778\n\n[emphasis in original]\n\nClaimants' Post Hearing Brief \u00b6 46 (citations omitted).\n\n733.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees. Respondent's interpretation of the standard is inconsistent with the Russian Tax Code. The strict language of the Russian Tax Code makes it difficult for the Tribunal to conclude that Yukos should have been assessed the willful offender fines, even if there were a basis to conclude (as the Tribunal has held earlier) that some of the revenue-based taxes could legitimately have been imposed against Yukos.\n\n**iv. Were the \"Repeat Offender\" Fines Properly Imposed?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n734.\n\nClaimants contend that the 100 percent increase of the fines imposed on the basis of the \"Repeat Offender\" provision of the Russian Tax Code was even less justified than the imposition of the \"Willful Offender\" fine:\n\n[T]he plain wording of Article 112(2) of the Russian Tax Code directs that such increase be only permitted in cases in which a taxpayer has been held liable for a similar tax offense *prior* to the commission of the disputed offense. The Presidium of Highest Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation has been unequivocal in considering that the previous similar offense must not only be committed, but also be *detected and sanctioned*. No such sanction came before April 14, 2004. As a result, in declaring that the tax offenses allegedly committed by Yukos in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were repeat offenses triggering a further 100% increase, both the Russian tax authorities and the Russian courts grossly misapplied Article 112(2). As regards the 2004 fines, their 100% increase was all the more egregious that the tax offenses purportedly committed by Yukos in 2004 were not similar to those allegedly committed in 2000-2003.779\n\nMemorial \u00b6 332 (citing Resolution of the Presidium of the Highest Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation No. 15557/07, 1 April 2008, Exh. C-415).\n\n735.\n\nClaimants also rely on the Resolution of the Presidium of the Highest Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation No. 15557/07 of 1 April 2008 (Annex (Merits) C 415) for the proposition that, in order for a taxpayer to be considered a \"Repeat Offender\", the taxpayer's previous similar offence must have been \"detected and sanctioned\" before the commission of the repeat offence. Respondent takes issue with Claimants' reliance on this decision adopted in 2008, \"years after Yukos' appeals against the assessments at issue had run their course.\"780 Respondent contends that the jurisprudence prior to 2008, at the time that the authorities imposed the \"Repeat Offender\" fines, supported the authorities' approach:\n\nPrior to the issuance of the 2008 Resolution, there had been a number of cases, unrelated to Yukos, in which the courts had upheld the assessment of repeat offender fines in the same manner as was done in the Yukos cases. Thus, when the tax authorities levied repeat offender fines against Yukos -- an egregious repeat offender if there ever was one -- they were not deviating from established practice but rather, applying one of the interpretations of the relevant statute that was in current use at the time. As much was effectively conceded by Yukos' own lawyer who, while urging that Yukos not be assessed a repeat offender fine, noted the \"unclarity\" of the law.781\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1084.\n\n*Ibid.* (citing First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 77-82; Article 112(2) of the Russian Tax Code, Exh. R-2248). Respondent also points to the following in support of its position: First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 79-80; Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Far-Eastern District, Case No. F-03-A73/05-2/244, 14 March 2005, Exh. R-1506; Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Povolzhsky District, Case No. A65-7415/04-CA1-32, 5 October 2004, Exh. R-1504); Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Western District, Case No. A44-498/ 2006-8, 21 August 2006, Exh. R-3282; Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court of West-Siberian District, Case No. F04-5193/2007 (36847-A75-43), 3 August 2007, Exh.

R-1505.\n\n736.\n\nClaimants contend, in their Reply, that Respondent's argument should be rejected. According to Claimants, Respondent does not contest the existence and significance of the 2008 decision, but merely contends that because this decision came in 2008, it should not be considered by the Tribunal. Claimants conclude:\n\nIn other words, while the Respondent concedes that the repeat offender fines were unlawful under the correct interpretation of the provision, it seeks to justify the fines on the basis of an alleged uncertainty about the correctness of that interpretation.782\n\nReply \u00b6 261.\n\n737.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants also criticize Respondent's reliance on the pre-2008 jurisprudence:\n\nThe Respondent and its expert concede that the imposition of repeat offender fines against Yukos was contrary to the interpretation of the Highest Arbitrazh Court issued in 2008. The Respondent's only defense is to argue that some other courts had previously applied the statute in the same (incorrect) way. Thus, notwithstanding the requirement in Article 3(7) of the Tax Code to resolve doubts in favor of the taxpayer, the Respondent insists it was appropriate for the tax authorities to apply an interpretation that was both incorrect and nearly US$ 4 billion less favorable to the taxpayer. The animating, confiscatory purpose behind the Respondent's actions is palpable.783\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 47 (citing Transcript, Day 15 at 20-23 (Mr. Konnov); Transcript, Day 18 at 101 (Respondent's closing)).\n\n738.\n\nMr. Konnov was cross-examined at length about the 2008 Arbitrazh Court decision.784 Throughout, he maintained his support for the authorities' treatment of Yukos, prior to the 2008 decision. He did not concede that it was incorrect, but merely that it was a function of the uncertainty inherent in the provision.\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 15 at 5-23.\n\n739.\n\nMr. Konnov had indeed referred to the \"uncertainty\" or ambiguity surrounding Article 112(2) of the Russian Tax Code in his First Expert Report:\n\n77. The Claimants argue that the imposition of repeat offender fines on YUKOS was unjustified and ignored the plain language of the governing law and the Supreme Arbitrazh Court guidance. I cannot agree with the suggestion by the Claimants that the language of Article 112(2) of the Tax Code was \" *plain* \" and that there is only one possible interpretation of that provision. The relevant provision of the Tax Code reads as follows:\n\n\"Aggravating circumstance means commitment of a tax offence by a person previously held liable for an analogous violation\".\n\n78. YUKOS itself admitted during the court hearings related to the 2000 tax year there was more than one possible reading of Article 112(2) of the Tax Code. The minutes of the court hearing read as follows:\n\n[A representative of YUKOS] \"... believes that there is unclarity in interpretation of Article 112 of the Russian Tax Code.\"785\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\n740.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent's position is untenable, given that \"Article 3(7) of the Tax Code requires doubts as to the proper interpretation of its provisions to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\"786\n\nReply \u00b6 261 (citing Russian Tax Code, Article 3(7), Exh. C-1276; Reply \u00b6 231 and n.250).\n\n741.\n\nIn relation to Article 3(7) of the Russian Tax Code, Respondent makes the following final argument in its Post-Hearing Brief:\n\nClaimants' contention that purported ambiguities in the statute governing repeat offender fines had to be resolved in Yukos' favor is baseless (Claim. Reb., Day 20 Tr. 196:18:23; Konn. Test., Day 15 Tr. 33:14-33:25, 34:25-35:8). As Mr. Konnov explained without contradiction (Konn. Test., Day 15 Tr. 34:1-34:24), and as is confirmed in a 2004 article written by Mr. Zaripov (Exh. R-3223), only those doubts that courts cannot resolve must be decided in favor of the taxpayer. Here, however, the relevant Tax Code provision was interpreted consistently with prior caselaw, confirming that it did not give rise to any irresolvable doubts. Konn. Rep. 1, \u00b6 79; Konn. Rep. 2, \u00b6 102.787\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 46, n.140. For the exchange between Dr. Poncet and Mr. Konnov on the principle \" *in dubio contra fiscum*,\" *see* Transcript, Day 15 at 37-42.\n\n742.\n\nRespondent has another defense for the \"repeat offender\" fines, namely that Yukos would have been deemed a repeat tax offender even under the approach adopted by the 2008 Resolution, because it had been subjected to fines for underpayment of taxes well before any of the assessments was issued. Respondent refers in this connection to paragraphs 81 and 82 of the First Konnov Report, which reads as follows:\n\n81. Furthermore, there could have been additional grounds for imposition of repeat offender fines on YUKOS. Based on my experience, any Russian company of a size comparable to that of YUKOS at the end of 1990s and the beginning of this decade was regularly subject to tax audits. Almost all of these audits resulted in discovery of tax violations and imposition of fines, even though in some instances the amounts were relatively insignificant. The Nefteyugansk Tax Inspectorate imposed fines on YUKOS pursuant to Decision No. 289 dated June 9, 2003. Even before that, the tax authorities conducted a tax audit of YUKOS. The Report of the Nefteyugansk Tax Inspectorate No. 66, dated April 28, 2003, notes that on April 16, 2001 the Inter-Regional Inspectorate of the Tax Ministry for Operational Oversight of Problem Taxpayers issued a report No. 34-03-10/6. Although I have not been able to review that act, it would not be unreasonable to assume that fines were imposed on YUKOS based on that act. Moreover, the US GAAP financials produced by YUKOS suggest that in each of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, YUKOS was subject to substantial fines and interest for tax violations.\n\n82. In accordance with the prevailing court practice, a repeat offender fine may be levied so long as the prior fine involved the same provision of the Tax Code with respect to the same taxes, even if the nature and the amount of the violations were different. Accordingly, even minor violations with respect to the same taxes imposed in connection with different arrangements would have sufficed to justify the repeat offender fines even under the approach taken by the 2008 Resolution.788\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 81-82 (citations omitted).\n\n743.\n\nClaimants counter Respondent's alternative argument as follows:\n\nThe Respondent's alternative theory, according to which any previous violation on profit tax, on whatever basis and in whatever amount, would be sufficient to justify these US$ 3.92 billion in repeat offender fines is far-fetched to say the least, relying on Mr. Konnov's dubious assertion as to the content of \"prevailing court practice\", his speculation that Yukos may have had a previous violation at some point in time and his assumption that that hypothetical violation involved the same provision of the Tax Code with respect to the same taxes. In any event, since by the Respondent's own admission its tax claims were not premised on alleged violations of any provision of the Tax Code, Mr. Konnov's theory has no conceivable application in relation to Yukos.789\n\nReply \u00b6 262 (citing Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 993, 1085).\n\n744.\n\nOn the issue of the \"repeat offender\" fines, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants' argument that these fines should not have been imposed.\n\n**v. Could Yukos Have Avoided the Fines?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent draws the attention of the Tribunal to Article 81(4) of the Russian Tax Code which allows taxpayers to avoid all penalties for past misdeeds provided only that they file amended tax returns before being formally notified of the onset of the audit relating to the relevant tax years. If the taxpayer takes advantage of Article 81(4) in a timely fashion, it needs to pay only the tax previously evaded (and interest), but no fine. This provision, combined with the Russian practice (followed in the Yukos case) of auditing \"open\" tax years (*i.e.,* tax years not time-barred by the statute of limitations) one after the other, rather than simultaneously, gives tax offenders an opportunity to eliminate their exposure to fines by filing last-minute amended returns.790\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1087 (citing First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 83-85).\n\n746.\n\nOn the basis of this provision, Respondent contends that Yukos could have easily avoided the fines associated with the assessments for tax years 2001, 2002 and 2003, if only it had taken advantage of Article 81(4) of the Russian Tax Code:\n\nIn Yukos' case, the authorities had made clear their complete condemnation of Yukos' scheme when they delivered their audit report for 2000 to Yukos, *i.e.*, on December 29, 2003. They did not, however, announce commencement of their audit of the next year (2001) until March 23, 2004, *i.e.*, 84 days later. As a result, Yukos had a window of opportunity of nearly three months duration in which it could have legally avoided any penalty whatsoever for tax year 2001 (including a willful offender fine and a repeat offender fine), simply by filing amended returns and paying the respective taxes and interest. The authorities' audit for 2002 and 2003 did not start until August 9, 2004 and October 28, 2004, respectively, and Yukos could likewise have avoided all penalties simply by filing amended returns for 2002 and 2003 before those dates and paying the overdue taxes and interest. Instead, Yukos' managers recklessly squandered this opportunity.791\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1088 (citing Field Tax Audit Report No. 30-3-14/1, 30 June 2004, p. 3, Exh. R-345; Field Tax Audit Report No. 52/852, 29 October 2004, p. 3 Exh. R-346; Field Tax Audit Report No. 52/907, 19 November 2004, p. 2, Exh. R-260; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 353-65).\n\n747.\n\nAs an additional point for the tax year 2003, Respondent asserts that Yukos had only itself to blame \"for filing a fraudulent annual return for that year, which ended on or around 28 March 2004, the filing deadline.\"792 It is Respondent's position that instead of continuing to pretend that its scheme was lawful, some three months after the December 2003 audit, Yukos could have filed an amended return.793\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1089.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n748.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent submits that Yukos could have filed a \"lawful tax return\" for the 2004 tax year. On the basis of this reasoning, Respondent sums up its position as follows:\n\nHad Yukos filed lawful tax returns beginning as of January 1, 2004 (*i.e.*, after its receipt of the December 29, 2003 tax audit report) and exercised in timely fashion its right to file amended returns for years 2001 and 2002, and paid the respective taxes and default interest, it would have reduced its overall tax liabilities in an amount that would have ensured that Yukos would have not faced bankruptcy proceedings, and that would in all likelihood also have avoided the need for the YNG auction.794\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1090.\n\n749.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's suggestion that Yukos should have pre-emptively conceded the validity of the December 2003 tax audit for the 2000 tax year and filed amended tax returns for subsequent years prior to being notified of the audits for those years. Claimants assert that Respondent's position \"confirms the Russian authorities' complete disregard for due process and fundamental rights of taxpayers.\"795 According to Claimants, Yukos had every right to avail itself of its rights under Russian law to challenge these unlawful tax reassessments and fines in court, or even await the results of the tax authorities' own review of Yukos' objections and declaration of their final position in the decision to hold Yukos liable with respect to the year 2000.796 Claimants note that Respondent decided to carry out additional control measures and to review the 29 December 2003 audit report in light of Yukos' objections but communicated no information about this review prior to issuing its Decision to hold Yukos liable on 14 April 2004 when it dismissed Yukos' objections.797\n\nReply \u00b6 264.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n*Ibid*., n.475.\n\n750.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept that, if Yukos had acted as Respondent maintains, it would have been able to escape the imposition of fines. As with the issue of VAT liability, the Tribunal is convinced that had Yukos done so, the Russian Federation would still have found a way or a reason to impose the fines on Yukos.\n\n**vi. Was the Quantum of the Fines Reasonable, in Terms of Both the Rate and the Absolute Amount?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n751.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent compares the regime for fines in the Russian Federation with those that exist in other countries. Respondent notes that fines for taxpayers that have underpaid their taxes, whether or not associated with tax evasion, can lead to fines at rates ranging up to 300 percent of the evaded tax (this highest rate applies, according to Respondent, in Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland). On this basis, Respondent concludes: \"It is clear from the foregoing that the fines levied on Yukos were not excessive by international standards.\"798\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1224.\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants did not address this last submission of Respondent. In any event, given the Tribunal's conclusions regarding the legitimacy of the willful and repeat offender fines imposed by the tax authorities on Yukos, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to deal with this contention.\n\n**vii. Extracts from Other Yukos-Related Awards**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n753.\n\nIn respect of the limitations period as it applied to the 2000 tax year, the ECtHR found, \"notwithstanding the State's margin of appreciation\", against the Russian Federation:\n\n571. Turning to the facts of the case, the Court would note firstly that the rule which, in the present case, underwent changes as a result of the decision of 14 July 2005, was contained in Article 113 of Chapter 15 \"General provisions concerning the liability for tax offences\" of the Tax Code (see paragraph 403) and thus formed a part of the domestic substantive law. Even though the rule in itself did not describe the substantive elements of the offence and the applicable penalty, it nevertheless constituted a *sine qua non* condition with which the authorities had to comply in order to be able to prosecute the relevant taxpayers in connection with the alleged tax offences. Accordingly, Article 113 of the Tax Code defined a crime for the purposes of the Court's analysis of lawfulness. It remains to be determined whether in the circumstances the decision of 14 July 2005 could be seen as a gradual clarification of the rules on criminal liability which \"[was] consistent with the essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen\" (see *Kafkaris*, cited above, 141).\n\n572. In this connection the Court may accept that the change in question did not change the substance of the offence. The Constitutional Court interpreted the existing rules on time-limits in relation to taxpayers who acted abusively. At the same time, the Court is not persuaded that the change in question could have been reasonably foreseen.\n\n573. It observes that the decision of 14 July 2005 had changed the rules applicable at the relevant time by creating an exception from a rule which had had no previous exceptions (see paragraphs 86 and 88). The decision represented a reversal and departure from the well-established practice directions of the Supreme Commercial Court (see, by contrast, *Achour,* cited above, \u00a7 52) and the Court finds no indication in the cases submitted by the parties suggesting a divergent practice or any previous difficulty in connection with the application of Article 113 of the Tax Code at the domestic level (see paragraphs 407-408). Although the previous jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court contained some general references to unfavourable legal consequences which taxpayers acting in bad faith could face in certain situations, these indications, as such, were insufficient to provide a clear guidance to the applicant company in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n574. Overall, notwithstanding the State's margin of appreciation in this sphere, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the change in interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-bar resulting from the Constitutional Court's decision of 14 July 2005 and the effect of this decision on the outcome of the Tax Assessment 2000 proceedings.\n\n575. Since the applicant company's conviction under Article 122 of the Tax Code in the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings laid the basis for finding the applicant company liable for a repeated offence with a 100% increase in the amount of the penalties due in the 2001 Tax Assessment proceedings, the Court also finds that the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part ordering the applicant company to pay the double fines was not in accordance with the law, as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.799\n\nECtHR Yukos Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 571-75, Exh. R-3328.\n\n754.\n\nOn the issue of the \"repeat offender\" fines, the *RosInvestCo* tribunal held as follows against the Russian Federation:\n\nFrom the evidence on file, the Tribunal concludes that the interpretation of Articles 122 and 114 of the Tax Code used on Yukos was not used before or thereafter in any comparable cases. Again, this resulted in an extremely large liability in the range of US$ 3.8 billion.800\n\n\u2026\n\n**Repeat offender fines:** The US$ 3.8 billion repeat offender fines on the basis of conduct pre-dating the tax audit again appears to the Tribunal as a departure from practice applied earlier and from that granted to other companies and thus to be one part of a cumulative effort to prevent Yukos' ongoing existence.801\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 454, Exh. C-1049.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 620(c).\n\n**(d) Concluding Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, at the outset of this chapter, it referred to the question put by Counsel for the claimant to the arbitral tribunal in the *Quasar* arbitration. \"Why would Russia have treated Yukos as it did if its purpose was to collect taxes?\"802\n\n*See* above at paragraphs 504 and 579.\n\n756.\n\nAfter having now traversed, at some length, the treatment of Yukos by Russian tax authorities, the bailiffs and the courts, and having considered the totality of the evidence, especially the VAT evidence, the Tribunal has concluded that the primary objective of the Russian Federation was not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its valuable assets.\n\n757.\n\nThe principal reasons, discussed in this chapter, which lead the Tribunal to this conclusion include:\n\ni) the attribution to Yukos of the revenues earned by its trading companies, even though there was no precedent in Russia for such attribution based on the theory of \"actual owner\", and the refusal at the same time to give Yukos any of the benefits of the VAT filings made by the trading companies, with the result that Yukos was assessed USD 13.5 billion or 56 percent of the total tax claims levied against Yukos;\n\nii) the imposition on Yukos of the \"willful offender\" fines, at the very least as they related to VAT;\n\niii) the refusal of the tax authorities to give Yukos the benefit of Article 3(7) of the Russian Tax Code to resolve doubts as to the interpretation of Article 112(2) of the Russian Tax Code in favor of the taxpayer, with the resulting imposition of nearly USD 4 billion in \"repeat offender\" fines; and\n\niv) the imposition of \"repeat offender\" fines on Yukos when the conduct that was punished occurred prior to the determination by the courts that the conduct was wrongful; for example, the \"repeat offender\" fine assessed against Yukos for the 2001 tax year is based on the finding by the courts in 2004 that the conduct in 2000 was wrongful.\n\n758.\n\nIn reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal has also taken into account the fact that, in February 2007, before Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had served half of their prison terms, the Prosecutor General's Office levelled new charges against them, this time for theft of oil and funds from Yukos, embezzlement and money laundering.\n\n759.\n\nAs will be seen in subsequent chapters of this Part VIII of the Award which now follow, the Tribunal is sustained in this central and all important conclusion by its analysis of other disturbing facets of the Yukos saga, including:\n\ni) the campaign of harassment carried out by the Russian authorities under the cloak of \"investigative activities\" including arrests, interrogations, searches and seizures against Yukos senior executives, mid-level employees, in-house counsel, external lawyers and related entities;803\n\nii) Yukos' repeated, reasonable attempts to settle its tax debts with the Russian Federation, all of which proved futile;804\n\niii) the seizure of YNG, Yukos' main production subsidiary, and its auction in questionable circumstances for an inadequate price;805\n\niv) the way in which Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings were initiated and conducted;806 and\n\nv) the pressure brought to bear by the Russian authorities on PwC, which ultimately conduced to the withdrawal of PwC's audits of Yukos' financial statements.807\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.C.\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.E.\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.F.\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.G.\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.H.\n\n760.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine later in this Award how these conclusions impact the liability of Respondent under the ECT.\n\n**C. HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION AND ARRESTS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n761.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent carried out a campaign of harassment and intimidation of Yukos, its management, employees, external advisers and associates with a view to destroying the company and removing Mr. Khodorkovsky as a political threat:\n\nIn what has been described as \"a literal orgy of lawlessness\", the Russian Federation instigated and conducted a campaign of terror aimed at depriving Yukos of its ability to run its business, and thus facilitating the destruction of the company. This was achieved through an escalating process of arrests, intimidation, harassment, searches and seizures. The breadth of the campaign, which targeted not only Yukos and its management but also entities and individuals associated with the company, and the flagrant violations of due process that characterized the actions of the Russian Federation, underscore both the ruthlessness with which the Russian Federation sought the destruction of Yukos and the coordinated nature of the attack.\n\nThe undeniable effect of the actions described below was to undermine the viability of Yukos, placing the Russian Federation in a position to carry out the dismantling of the Company.808\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 106-7. *See also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 65, 83-197; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 17-94; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 156-65.\n\n762.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent's harassment campaign has \"continued throughout the time period at issue in these arbitrations and continues even today,\" most notably with a second round of charges in 2007 against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev leading to a trial described as a \"travesty of justice\" that resulted in a sentence of a further thirteen and a half years in prison.809\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 17, 41.\n\n763.\n\nRespondent for the most part does not question the facts underlying Claimants' allegations, though it does question the credibility of some of Claimants' witness accounts. Rather, the events described by Claimants as constituting a campaign of \"harassment and intimidation\" are, according to Respondent, better characterized as legitimate acts of law enforcement undertaken in full compliance with Russian law and Russian practices as well as standards of other countries.810\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 673; Transcript, Day 18 at 113-21 (Respondent's closing).\n\n764.\n\nIn any event, Respondent considers the events complained of to be largely irrelevant to the Tribunal's enquiry in these arbitrations. That is because Article 26 of the ECT limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to disputes alleging the breach of an obligation under Part III of the ECT, of which Articles 10(1) and 13 are directed only to investments, and afford no personal protection for nationals. Respondent observes that \"the alleged violations of the human rights of Messrs. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and others... are outside the scope of this Tribunal's jurisdiction, unless Claimants can establish that any such violations directly impaired the management or operation of their investments.\"811 Respondent argues Claimants have failed to do so,812 and that the prosecutions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev did not destroy Yukos. To the contrary, Yukos exceeded its 2003 performance in 2004.813\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1335.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1331.\n\n*Russia's Yukos says interim oil output up 5.3% on year in 2004*, Prime-TASS Energy Service (Russia), 21 March 2005, Exh. R-509.\n\n765.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that it is not a human rights court. Nevertheless, it is within the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider the allegations of harassment and intimidation as they form part of the factual matrix of Claimants' complaints that the Russian Federation violated its obligations under Part III of the ECT. The Tribunal's task includes determining whether the Russian Federation \"in any way impair[ed] by unreasonable or discriminatory measures [Claimants'] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of its investment, or subjected Claimants' investment to measures having the effect equivalent to an expropriation. In the context of that inquiry, the Tribunal will set out the evidentiary record with respect to the alleged \"campaign of harassment and intimidation.\"\n\n**2. Chronology of Facts**\n--------------------------\n\n**(a) Yukos Grows; Mr. Khodorkovsky Becomes More Politically Engaged; Yukos Leaders Receive Warnings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n766.\n\nClaimants allege that by early 2003 \"Mikhail Khodorkovsky's participation in the social policy and political spheres in Russia, coupled with Yukos' growing economic power, came to be perceived as a threat by the Russian authorities.\"814\n\nMemorial \u00b6 63.\n\n767.\n\nAs already noted in Chapter VIII.B above, President Putin's former Chief Economic Advisor, Dr. Illarionov alleged in his witness statement that around late 2002, a \"special unit was set up at the General Prosecutor's office, comprised of approximately 50 people and working exclusively on fabricating evidence against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos.\"815 The special unit came up with approximately 15 possible theories to justify Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, amongst them \"tax evasion schemes allegedly set up either for Mr. Khodorkovsky's personal benefit or for the benefit of Yukos.\"816 Upon cross-examination, Dr. Illarionov declined to identify his source, a \"high-placed official in the Russian Administration at the time\" who still lives in Moscow, out of concerns for the official's safety.817 Dr. Illarionov testified that the official told him the unit had \"been created to \u2018zanyatsa' Khodorkovsky... \u2018take care of' Khodorkovsky.. which means one day some kind of security services and officers did receive an order so-called to solve the problem.\"818\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n*Ibid*\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 156-57.\n\n*Ibid*. at 158. As discussed below in Subsection 3(a), Respondent describes Dr. Illarionov's evidence as \"rank hearsay\" and a \"lie\", Transcript, Day 18 at 114-16.\n\n768.\n\nThe turning point, according to Claimants, was a meeting at the Kremlin between President Putin and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on 19 February 2003, to which the Tribunal has referred earlier, at which Mr. Khodorkovsky delivered a speech about corruption in Russia.819 President Putin responded by alluding to some companies, including Yukos, having accumulated considerable wealth from non-payment of tax, and thus told Mr. Khodorkovsky that he was \"passing the puck back to you.\"820 At this point, according to Dr. Illarionov, the tone became \"steely and menacing,\"821 and from then on, the \"gloves were off.\"822 The Tribunal has observed earlier in this Award that the Russian authorities, particularly in the ZATOs, were questioning the legality of Yukos' tax optimization scheme prior to the February 2003 meeting and that this meeting was not a \"turning point\" in terms of being the catalyst for challenging the Yukos tax scheme.823 Nevertheless the record does show that from around the time of the February 2003 meeting, the Russian authorities escalated the intensity and extent of their investigations into Yukos and associated individuals and entities.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 63, 86-91.\n\nExcerpt of Television Report \"Un milliardaire en Sib\u00e9rie\" broadcast on TF1 on 1 October 2006, Exh.

For example, Mr. Dubov testified that President Putin had advised Mr. Khodorkovsky in April 2003 to restrict his political activities and not to finance the Communists.824 Similarly, former Prime Minister Kasyanov testified to the ECtHR that a conversation with President Putin had left him in no doubt that \"by funding the communists Khodorkovsky had crossed a line so far as Putin was concerned and that the criminal prosecution case of Yukos employees was started exactly because of the funding of political parties not sanctioned by Putin.\"825\n\nDubov WS \u00b6 69.\n\nStatement of Prime Minister Mikhail Mikhailovich Kasyanov to the ECtHR, 8 July 2009, in *Khodorkovskiy v.

Khodorkovsky and Nevzlin were summoned for questioning in what Mr. Nevzlin described as an \"absurd\" investigation.830 That same day, the Russian authorities raided the office of the registrar of Yukos' shares and confiscated documents.831\n\nMemorial \u00b6 108; \u2018Chronology', *Attack on Yukos*, Yukos Review, Special Issue, 2003, p. 5, Exh.

Yukos' then Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bruce Misamore, describes it as:\n\nan incredible scene full of armed, masked officers\u2014during which they trawled through our computer records for approximately 17 hours. This was to begin a wave of raids on Yukos' Moscow headquarters and other companies affiliated with Yukos by investigative officers... sometimes accompanied by... heavily armed police officers.832\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 31. *See also* \"Police raid Russian oil giant,\" BBC News, 11 July 2003, Exh.

He describes how the staff was forced to stop work during the raid, that a Deputy Chief Accountant had been told by the authorities that they \"knew that she had grandchildren, a dacha *etc* and that she had better tell them what they wanted to hear,\" another staff member resigned having been told by the prosecutors it would be best for him, and that the authorities regularly seized \"lorry loads of documents\" in an unsystematic fashion, without leaving copies or any record of the documents seized.833\n\nRieger WS \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. *See also* Misamore WS \u00b6 32.\n\n774.\n\nAccording to Mr. Misamore, the loss of key documents \"created great difficulties not only in managing the company, but in preparing the annual financial statements.\"834 Mr. Misamore elaborated that \"these raids with the guys in their balaclavas and their AK47s coming in and harassing our employees, taking original documents away from our offices, not leaving us with any copies, we couldn't even accomplish accounting.... We lost our entire U.S. GAAP consolidation accounting group by the end of 2004: they all left the company because they didn't want to be harassed.\"835 Steven Theede, who joined Yukos as Chief Operating Office in August 2003 noted that by the end of 2003:\n\nIt was obvious that... the Government was out to get us; it was that simple. The number of raids we had in the office, police coming and charging through our accounting department, knocking computers off desks,... tipping desks up on their side.

A kompromat is a document which gives you leverage on somebody, and practically forces him or her to follow whatever instructions he or she is given. And we asked, \u2018What kind of kompromat do they mean?' \u2018Well', he said, \u2018all I have to do is write two lines: I committed criminal deeds.' And then I said, \u2018And what will happen if you sign such a kompromat?' He said, \u2018Nothing. They will just keep it, and from time to time I'll receive a phone call asking me for some favour.' And I asked again, \u2018But for Yukos\u2014so will you sign it?'... He said, \u2018No, I don't want to live like that with my children.' And then I said, \u2018But under the assumption that you would sign it, what would happen?' And his words were, \u2018Well, if I would sign such a two-line letter, the problems of Yukos would disappear faster than it takes to switch off the light in this room.'... And I did not leave this meeting in a very optimistic mood on future events. And indeed two months later he was in jail, in pre-trial detention.

According to Dr. Illarionov, President Putin explained that Mr. Khodorkovsky had \"behave[d] badly\" and stopped \"cooperating,\" for example by negotiating with an American oil company about a possible merger and supporting the Communist Party in advance of the Duma elections. Following these actions, President Putin decided to \"step aside\" and allow Mr. Khodorkovsky to fend for himself against \"the boys.\"848 Dr. Illarianov also recalled that there was wide \"public outrage\" in the mass media. The then Prime Minister, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, publicly disapproved of the arrest. Dr. Illarionov referred to President Putin's order that \"I would ask everybody in the Government to shut up on Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest,\" and it was very clear to him that this comment was addressed to Mr. Kasyanov, who was later removed from his position.849\n\nTranscript, Day 7 at 155.\n\n*Ibid.* at 159-60.\n\n781.\n\nMr. Dubov testifies that a Kremlin official informed him on 27 October 2003 that his name had been struck off the list of candidates running for the Duma, at the direction of President Putin.850 At the Hearing Mr. Dubov elaborated on the conversation he had with the Kremlin official, to whom he had asked \"What will happen to Yukos?\" Mr. Dubov received the answer \"Yukos will be taken away from you gentlemen\" and that there would be criminal claims against every single shareholder.851 He was told President Putin had \"gone berserk over Khodorkovsky.\" Upon advice from the official, Mr. Dubov left Russia that night and has never returned. Mr. Nevzlin also left Russia late in 2003 and has not returned since. Shortly thereafter Mr. Dubov, Mr. Nevzlin and Mr. Brudno were charged with embezzlement and money laundering.852 International arrest warrants were issued in January 2004 for Messrs.

Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and on Yukos' lawyers and personnel was always meticulously calculated to correspond to the critical stages in the dismantlement of Yukos.\"860 Thus, at a time when Yukos was deeply engaged in its defense of tax proceedings brought against it, the Head of Yukos' Legal Department, Mr. Gololobov, was arrested and his computers and documents confiscated. In July 2004, at the time of the enforcement proceedings by the court bailiffs for the tax assessments and the service by the Tax Ministry of the Field Tax Audit Report for 2001, an estimated 100 officials raided Yukos' headquarters on a Saturday afternoon, confiscating computer servers. At the time of the forced sale of YNG in December 2004, there were further raids on Yukos offices and personnel.861 Searches were carried out in the offices of Yukos' external lawyers, ALM Feldmans, who also faced an extensive audit of their own after the search.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 16(3) and 17.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 155.\n\n785.\n\nOn May 31, 2005, the Meshchansky Court of the city of Moscow sentenced Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to nine years in prison on charges of fraud and tax evasion, following a trial that was widely criticized for its lack of due process.862 Mr. Schmidt, himself intimately involved with the trial, stated he had never seen \"such a mockery of justice and violations of the most basic standards of due process and fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial, at all stages of a case.\"863 Similar observations were made by Russian and international media outlets and opposition parties within Russia.864 Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were transferred to Siberia to serve their sentences in remote penal colonies, and their sentences were reduced on appeal to 8 years, which Claimants maintain was in violation of Russian law at the time.865\n\nMemorial \u00b6 520-47, Reply \u00b6 30.\n\nSchmidt WS \u00b6\u00b6 16(4)(5), 23, 26.

Mr. Nevzlin mentioned his trial *in absentia* and Israel's refusal to extradite him to Russia.866 In 2005 and 2007, courts in the United Kingdom refused to extradite former financial and business managers of Yukos, on the basis that the prosecutions were \"so politically motivated that there is a substantial risk that the Judges of the Moscow City court would succumb to political interference in a way which would call into question their independence.\"867 Courts in Lithuania, Cyprus and the Czech Republic also refused to extradite former Yukos managers or former Yukos service providers on the basis of the political dimensions of the underlying requests.868\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6 14, Transcript, Day 8 at 28.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 189-92, *The Government of the Russian Federation v.

However, in June 2004, the Swiss Federal Tribunal overturned the freeze orders and released the shares. Over the following years, the Swiss courts were also engaged in mutual legal assistance requests for searches and seizures of documents of various Yukos-related entities, culminating in the Swiss Federal Tribunal expressing the view that the case against Mr. Khodorkovsky was politically motivated and \"orchestrated by the regime in power with a view to subordinating the class of rich \u2018oligarchs' and eliminating potential or sworn political opponents.\"870\n\nMemorial \u00b6 167.\n\nJudgment of the Swiss Federal Tribunal, 13 August 2007, *Mikhail Khodorokovsky v.

Several of the remaining senior executives decided not to return to Russia.871 In August 2006, the Russian Prosecutor General's office announced criminal investigations against senior level executives, including Messrs. Misamore and Theede. Mr. Misamore, noting he had never been formally notified of the charges, considers that they were part of a \"general campaign to intimidate those associated with Yukos.\"872 Mr. Rieger also testified about being interrogated by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office, when he was presented with a series of questions for which the investigator had already prepared his answers. He described this as:\n\na kind of never expected story. And if I wouldn't have been the witness of such an event, I couldn't believe this: being called as a witness, arriving, and seeing, \"Here, Mr Rieger, we'd like to talk to you today. These are the questions, and wouldn't you mind to look at this document?.... I think this is what you'd like to say to us.\"873\n\nMr. Rieger refused to sign and was kept for eight hours of questioning. The next morning, the German Embassy advised him to leave the country. He has not returned to Russia since May 2006.874 Similarly, Mr. Theede was advised by the U.S. State Department that it was not safe for him to return to Russia.875\n\nMemorial \u00b6 123.\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 35.\n\nTranscript, Day 6 at 69.\n\nRieger WS \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 16.\n\n789.\n\nBy the time bankruptcy proceedings had started against Yukos at the end of March 2006, approximately 35 senior managers, employees and in-house counsel of Yukos had been interrogated, arrested and/or sentenced.876 At that time, Mr. Theede appointed Vasily Aleksanyan as Executive Vice President of Yukos to serve as the main point of contact for the bankruptcy.877 Shortly afterwards, on 6 April 2006, Mr. Aleksanyan was arrested at home by masked and armed men and charged with embezzlement allegedly committed when he was head of the Yukos legal department.878 A few months after his detention, he was diagnosed with lymphoma and AIDS. It is alleged that he was offered medical treatment and freedom in return for evidence against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, an offer which he refused.879 He remained in pre-trial detention for almost three years in conditions described by Russia's own human rights council as \"simply monstrous.\"880 His treatment was criticized by the ECtHR, whose initial interim measures were ignored by the Russian Federation, but after the ECtHR issued a final judgment, the authorities released Mr. Aleksanyan on bail (for USD 1.8 million) and finally dropped charges against him due to the statute of limitations.881 Claimants' expert witness on the independence of the Russian judiciary, Dr. Sergei Kovalev, whom Respondent chose not to cross-examine, described Mr. Aleksanyan's treatment as \"[o]ne of the most glaring examples of pressure exerted on individuals associated with Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Yukos.\"882 Mr. Theede testified that the plight of Mr. Aleksanyan (who after his release from prison died at age 39)883 demonstrated the severe risks which other persons in Russia associated with Yukos faced constantly and stated that it had become extremely difficult to manage the company.884\n\n*Ioukos, un deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00e9sident en prison*, Lib\u00e9ration, 8 April 2006, Exh.

Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had served half of their prison terms, the Prosecutor-General's Office levelled new charges against them, this time for theft of oil and funds from Yukos, embezzlement and money laundering.885\n\n*Procuracy-General of the Russian Federation completes investigation of criminal case with respect to Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev*, News, 16 February 2007, The Procuracy-General of the Russian Federation Website, Exh. C-423.\n\n791.\n\nClaimants describe the second trial as a \"travesty of justice,\" a view shared by international organizations and human rights NGOs such as the International Bar Association and Amnesty International.886 Before the verdict was issued, President Putin responded to a question during his annual televised address that: \"It is my conviction that a \u2018thief should be in jail.'... we must start from the fact that Khodorkovsky's guilt has been proved in court.\"887\n\nReply \u00b6 42. *The Khodorkovsky trial: A report on the observation of the criminal trial of Mikhail Borisovich Khodorkovsky and Platon Leonidovich Lebedev*, International Bar Association Human Rights Institute, March 2009 to December 2010, September 2011, Exh.

Khodorkovsky and Lebedev guilty of charges of embezzlement and money laundering. He sentenced them to the maximum penalty requested by the prosecution, thirteen and a half years. The verdicts were widely criticized.888 Judge Danilkin questioned over 90 fact witnesses and reviewed an extensive documentary record. His verdict focused on a holding that in the period 1996-2003, Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev \"stole\" the entire oil output of the Yukos production entities, concealed the fact that the oil was \"stolen\" both from Yukos' shareholders and the Russian tax authorities, orchestrated the \"theft\" through Lesnoy and Trekhgorny entities, which led to tax evasion, and then \"laundered\" the proceeds of the \"theft.\" Judge Danilkin rejected all of Mr. Khodorkovsky's arguments, including those relating to double jeopardy.889\n\nReply \u00b6 48.

C-1057 (\"Arguments of the defence that the charges of embezzlement of oil and tax evasion are the same crimes because taxes, as per their theory, were paid on the stolen oil, are unsustainable. Taxes were paid on profit, and the organized group participants stole property in the form of oil. Profit is not property because it is a calculated accounting value which is a difference between income and expenses. It is impossible to steal figures, which exist in accounting records, but it is possible to commit theft of oil, which is a material value, which is property. Relations concerning the making of tax payments (taxes) to the budget are the object of a tax offence (crime)... While relations concerning right, title, and interest in certain property are the object of embezzlement (theft)...\").\n\n793.\n\nWithin a few months, the 689-page verdict was upheld on appeal, a decision noted with concern by the European Parliament, which condemned \"political interference with the trial.\"890 Russia's own Human Rights Council reviewed the second criminal case at the request of then President Medvedev. The Council issued a report in December 2011 which concluded that the trial was unlawful and should be annulled. The author of the report told local media there was \"no evidence or substance behind the accusations of embezzlement,\" and that Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had received \"punishment for carrying out legal activities.\"891 Other members of the Council described the verdict as \"profoundly unjust\", \"contradictory, arbitrary and malicious,\" \"illegal,\" containing \"numerous legal errors and inaccuracies\" and selectively prosecuted.892\n\nEuropean Parliament, Resolution of 9 June 2011 on the EU-Russia summit \u00b6 16, Exh.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n794.\n\nAs demonstrated above, the record of this case is replete with evidence pertaining to the events underlying the so-called campaign of harassment and intimidation. The following section addresses (a) the credibility of Claimants' allegations of a campaign of harassment and intimidation, (b) the characterization of such events in the context of the Russian Federation's law enforcement efforts against Yukos' tax optimization scheme and (c) the actual impact of the events on Claimants' investment.\n\n**(a) Are Claimants' Allegations about a Campaign of Harassment Credible?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n795.\n\nRespondent does not deny that the investigations, searches, seizures, arrests, interrogations and criminal trials took place. Respondent's main defence to the allegations is not that they are not true, but that the events complained of were legitimate and justified for purposes of law enforcement, that they were in line with practice in Russia and other countries, and that in any event they were not expropriatory and did not impair Claimants' investment.893\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 184-85.\n\n796.\n\nThere are, however, some portions of the witness testimony with which Respondent takes issue. Respondent contends that Claimants' \"conspiracy theory relies heavily on circumstantial evidence and sheer innuendo, attributable to the Oligarchs' public relations and lobbying campaign.\"894 Respondent argues that:\n\nif the assessments and the subsequent enforcement measures were the product of a massive political conspiracy spanning several years and implemented by hundreds if not thousands of officials, including no fewer than 60 judges at four different levels of courts, along with a large cast of third parties worldwide, then surely, after nearly a decade of vigorous challenges, at least one document referring to this purported conspiracy would have surfaced, or one disgruntled conspirator would have reported having participated in it. Conspicuously, Claimants have offered no such evidence at all. To the contrary, they rely on double and triple hearsay renditions of purported conversations, provided by vocal opponents of the Russian Government, inaccurate and uninformed reports by political commentators, and mere speculation.895\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 777-823; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 56.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 57, citing Transcript, Day 2 at 104-7 (Respondent's opening); Respondent's Closing Slides, pp. 282-92, 723-24.\n\n797.\n\nRespondent also argues that \"Claimants' hearing testimony on this issue is not credible, in light of its reliance on those who stand to gain billions of dollars if Claimants prevail.\"896\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief n.163, citing Respondent's Closing Slides, pp. 282-92.\n\n798.\n\nFor example, Respondent decries Dr. Illarionov's testimony about a special unit established to come up with a theory to put Mr. Khodorkovsky away as \"rank hearsay of the most grotesque sort, because Dr. Illarionov declined to identify the person who supposedly told him that.\"897 Respondent described Dr. Illarionov's report as \"manifestly not credible\" because he had said nothing about it for seven years, and because he continued to serve President Putin for more than two years after hearing that report.\"898\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 114.\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 114-15 (Respondent's closing). For the explanation from Dr. Illarionov about safety concerns for his source, see Transcript, Day 7 at 156.\n\n799.\n\nThe Tribunal found Dr. Illarionov to be a credible and convincing witness. He offered a satisfactory explanation for protecting the source of his information about the special unit. The Tribunal does not consider his evidence impeached merely because he had not come forward earlier with his evidence about the special unit nor that he stayed for a certain period in his position working for the President.\n\n800.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent attacks the credibility of Mr. Nevzlin's testimony on the basis that he had waited until 2010 to disclose certain facts, such as what Mr. Abramovich had told him about Mr. Khodorkovsky being targeted for political reasons.899 When pressed as to why he had not disclosed the information in the earlier Russian criminal proceedings or the ECtHR proceedings, Mr. Nevzlin gave the following explanations:900\n\n[I]f I had spread the information about Abramovich and Putin fairly broadly, and if it had become available to the public, then from the perspective of Khodorkovsky, who is in Russian prison, I would have damaged him.... I would have caused him tremendous amounts of harm.... in the other corner facing him were Putin, Sechin and others; but I also would have turned Abramovich into an enemy of Khodorkovsky by disclosing this information.\n\n\u2026\n\n[After] things moved to a second absurd set of charges and a second trial, Khodorkovsky's position changed radically. He was no longer wary of a political... confrontation with Putin's regime because he realised that he was not going to be able to find truth in a Russian court if he tried to defend himself based on the laws...\n\n\u2026\n\nRussian courts have no interest in my position: it would be either ignored or rejected by them. Because it's not a judge who makes decision on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev; the judge just rubber-stamps decisions that are made by investigative committee and Prosecutor's Office.... The fact that I trust this court and tell this court a lot more than I've ever said on the matter, this is a typical position for me, because... if we're able to defend our interests, that would be either in courts in free countries or international courts.\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6 35; Transcript, Day 8 at 4-5. The Tribunal notes that in the judgment issued by the High Court in London, Mrs. Justice Gloster DBE was \"not impressed\" by Mr. Nevzlin as a witness (*Berezovsky v Abramovich, Berezovsky v Hine & Others* [2012] EWHC 2463 (Comm) \u00b6\u00b6 485-90, Exh. R-4654; *see also* Transcript, Day 8 at 39-40).\n\nTranscript, Day 8 at 17-25.\n\n801.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Mr. Nevzlin's explanations. The Tribunal notes again that the Russian Federation called no fact witnesses of their own to contradict or weaken the testimony of Claimants' fact witnesses. Respondent chose not to cross-examine Mr. Schmidt, simply noting instead that as he was Mr. Khodorkovsky's criminal lawyer his statement is \"special pleading.\"901 Respondent also chose not to cross-examine Dr. Kovalev, whose evidence, accordingly, also stands unchallenged.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 696.\n\n802.\n\nDuring the Hearing on the Merits, the Chairman of the Tribunal invited Respondent's counsel:902\n\nto address the allegations of harassment: Rieger being presented by the Prosecutor's Office with a statement, \"Just sign here on the bottom line\"; the number of Yukos employees who were detained; Misamore, who was told \"You shouldn't go back to Russia\"; the campaign to make life impossible for Yukos-related officials, officers? That stands uncontradicted on the record right now. And it bothers us, my colleagues and me, and we would like to hear from the Respondent in respect of these matters.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 46 (Respondent's closing).\n\n803.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Rieger, Respondent's counsel pointed out that the incident had occurred in 2006, several years after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and that \"it's not atypical that an investigatory agency would have an idea of what they think a witness does or doesn't know, and might suggest to that [witness] what that evidence is and then find out from the witness whether they agree with it or disagree with it. Mr. Rieger said he didn't agree, and he didn't sign it.\" The Chairman recalled: \"He was threatened, he was detained at the airport. This is background that speaks about the atmosphere. The Russian authorities are seen as being out to get Yukos.\" Respondent's counsel explained that: \"I think that what you are seeing is the authorities having established that there was quite substantial fraud at many, many different levels of activity within a large company.\"903\n\n*Ibid*. at 47.\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the evidence of Claimants' witnesses who testified with respect to the campaign of harassment and intimidation conducted by Respondent against Yukos. The Tribunal will now turn to the nature and consequences of the events described above.\n\n**(b) Were the Actions of the Russian Federation Justified as Legitimate Law Enforcement Measures?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n805.\n\nRespondent explains that its actions were consistent with a legitimate wide-scale investigation as part of \"an attempt to enforce and try to understand what turned out to be one of the largest frauds in the experience of the modern Russian State.\"904 Thus, in response to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet's evidence recounting Mr. Khodorkovsky's *kompromat*, Respondent observes that this \"is absolutely consistent with the fact that the authorities had valid grounds to bring criminal charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky.\"905 Likewise, Respondent describes as \"no surprise\" that Mr. Dubov would have been advised to leave the country and warned that every shareholder of Yukos would face criminal charges. Respondent states that this is \"not inconsistent with the unbroken thread of tax evasion in which Yukos engaged and for which it was held to account.\"906\n\n*Ibid*. at 49-52.\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 118-19 (Respondent's closing); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 205(iv).\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 116-17 (Respondent's closing); Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 205(ii).\n\n806.\n\nIn a similar vein, while acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances surrounding Mr. Aleksanyan's illness, Respondent remarked that \"it is not shocking\" that the Russian authorities were interested in Mr. Aleksanyan, given his role since 2001 in suppressing information about vulnerabilities of Yukos in the low-tax regions.907\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 50 (Respondent's closing).\n\n807.\n\nRespondent argues that the \"searches of Yukos offices and the seizures of its records as part of Russian law enforcement authorities' investigations have parallels in other countries as proper instruments of law enforcement, especially when those authorities are faced with the types of egregious violations in which Yukos engaged.\" Respondent cites the EU and the U.S. as jurisdictions that authorize expansive and aggressive, even armed, searches and seizures to combat financial crimes.908\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 209-10. For example, in the European Union, companies are often subjected to \"dawn raids\", in which EU officials, without prior judicial authorization, conduct searches and seizures. *See* Transcript, Day 19 at 49-50 (Respondent's closing) (\"[I]n the United States a search warrant is never executed unarmed; it's always executed by armed officers, sometimes wearing other gear that suggests something more than a simple commercial exercise. That's the way it happens. In Russia, that's the way it's always done. It's just their practice. It doesn't reflect or project anything unique to Yukos.\"). Claimants however point to the \"very exacting standard of proof\" at the ECtHR requiring \"incontrovertible and direct\" evidence, but that the ECtHR nevertheless accepted that \"the circumstances surrounding the applicants' criminal case may be interpreted as supporting the applicants' claim of improper motives\" and that \"it is clear that the authorities were trying to reduce political influence of \u2018oligarchs' and that the State was one of the main beneficiaries of the dismantlement of Yukos.\" *See Khodorkovsky v.

Khodorkovsky and Lebedev in 2005, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not criticized the conduct of the Russian appellate judges who upheld the convictions.909 Respondent points to the ECtHR as having \"rejected the central premise of Claimants' argument that Mr. Khodorkovsky was prosecuted in 2005 for political or other improper reasons.\"910\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 204, 206.\n\n*Khodorkovsky v. Russia 1* ; Rejoinder \u00b6 1334.\n\n809.\n\nWith respect to the second criminal trial of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, Respondent notes that it \"had no effect on the investments at issue in these arbitrations and that, regardless, Claimants have not contested the factual bases of the charges in that trial. Their attempt to portray the charges as concerning the physical theft of oil, rather than complicated schemes of corporate abuse and sham auctions to secure underpayments of oil purchased from Yukos' subsidiaries for the Oligarchs' benefit, is manifestly baseless.\"911 Respondent contends that the IBA Report was prepared without access to the full court file and without any knowledge of Russian criminal law, and that other criticisms reported by Claimants were biased and ill-informed.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief n.484. *See also* Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1371-86.\n\n810.\n\nRespondent also contends that its actions were necessary due to Yukos' attempts to obstruct Russia's investigative efforts.912 Claimants deny that Yukos was obstructing the investigation, and note that most of the evidence relied upon by Respondent was based on interrogation records of individuals that Respondent has failed to put forward as witnesses. Claimants urge the Tribunal to treat the interrogation records with skepticism, \"[g]iven the campaign of terror being waged against persons associated with Yukos and the relentless pressure deployed by the prosecutors to get Yukos' former employees or other Yukos-related persons to give false incriminating evidence against Yukos and Yukos' management.\"913\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 674-79.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 77.\n\n811.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Russian Federation had the power to conduct searches and seizures in Yukos' premises during the ongoing criminal investigations. Nevertheless, having reviewed the record, the Tribunal finds that the investigation of Yukos was carried out by the Russian Federation with excessive harshness. Respondent's counsel acknowledged that in the context of the large-scale fraud investigation \"not everything is pretty in those circumstances, and we may each of us have circumstances that we would regret or have done differently.\"914 The Tribunal considers \"not pretty\" to be an understatement in this case. The treatment of Yukos senior executives, mid-level employees, in-house counsel, external lawyers and related entities as described in this chapter support Claimants' central submission that the Russian authorities were conducting a \"ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate Mr. Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.\"915 The legal consequences of Claimants' submission will be analyzed later in Part X of this Award when the Tribunal considers the alleged violations of Chapter III of the ECT.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 51 (Respondent's closing).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 165.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine the effect on Yukos, as a matter of fact, of the campaign of harassment and intimidation waged against it by Respondent.\n\n**(c) Did the Events Complained of Impact Claimants' Investments or was Yukos Able to Carry on Unaffected?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nHaving noted that the record is replete with evidence of intimidation and harassment of Yukos personnel by the Russian authorities, the key question for the Tribunal is whether such intimidation and harassment actually disrupted Yukos' operations and thus adversely affected Claimants' investment.\n\n814.\n\nClaimants maintain that the harassment and intimidation campaign \"crippled\" Yukos by prosecuting its management and paralyzing its operations through massive raids and seizures with a view to undermining the viability of Yukos.\n\n815.\n\nClaimants' witnesses spoke of the impact that the searches, seizures and, generally, the campaign of intimidation had on the company. As noted earlier, Mr. Misamore testified that the loss of key documents created difficulties in running the company and preparing the annual financial statements.916 Mr. Rieger stated that 60 to 70 percent of the accounting department's documents were confiscated. He explained in his witness statement: \"[w]hen you take into account the fact that all the day to day business operations of the company were reflected in paperwork, such as invoices, bills, *etc.*, we soon reached a stage where Yukos employees didn't have access to the basic data they needed to perform their functions.\" He recalled that \"[t]he constant threats and harassment caused many of my former colleagues to leave the company and, in the worst case, the country; a fate that I would soon share.\"917\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 32.\n\nRieger WS \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\n816.\n\nMr. Misamore described how staff retention became extremely difficult for Yukos. For example, he said that in the GAAP section of the accounting department \"they all left the company because they didn't want to be harassed.\"918 Similarly, in defending the company's decision to pay bonuses in 2004, Mr. Theede testified that:\n\n[I]t was a Stalinesque-type of environment there. It was a fearful kind of a place to have to work. We never knew when we were going to have another raid, and people would come in and, as I said yesterday, knock computers off the desks, tip desks over, and just roughneck through the place; or when someone would be called in for questioning to the Prosecutor's Office with totally unknown and illogical results. And in that kind of an environment, Yukos was not a particularly friendly place to work. We had huge concerns about retaining our employees. And if we didn't meet contractual obligations to them to pay the bonuses, it was our view that they would begin to leave. And so it was in that light that we felt it was really very important that we lived up to the obligations we had to these people, just so we could retain them and so that we could continue to operate the company. Because if we lost those people, hiring others was going to be almost impossible, because people just\u2014it was a scary place to be, and to bring new people in\u2014in fact, I don't really recall us being able to hire any new employees after the attack started...919\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 244-45.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 15-16.\n\n817.\n\nRespondent denies that Claimants have proven, as a matter of fact, that the harassment campaign impaired their investment.920 As mentioned earlier, Respondent notes for example that Mr. Khodorkovsky resigned voluntarily, that Yukos' revenues in 2003 and 2004 were higher than before the arrests of Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev, and that Yukos issued public statements following the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky to the effect that Yukos' operations were proceeding normally.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1338-45, \u00b6\u00b6 1387-99; \u00b6\u00b6 1400-34.

C-23.\n\n819.\n\nThe Tribunal views these statements of Yukos officers pertaining to the well-being of the company as an attempt by Yukos to project to its investors an image of stability and thus maintain their confidence. It is obvious to the Tribunal that a company which was targeted in the way Yukos was during those many years had to be severely affected and that its operations could not be managed by its officers and other employees in the normal and usual manner. In short, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, as a matter of fact, Respondent's aggressive campaign against Yukos impacted significantly the management of the company.\n\n820.\n\nHaving reviewed the abundant evidence in the record of the intimidation and harassment of Yukos' senior executives, mid-level employees, in-house counsel and external lawyers by the Russian authorities, the Tribunal is convinced that such intimidation and harassment not only disrupted the operations of Yukos but also contributed to its demise and thereby damaged Claimants' investment.\n\n821.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn its attention to another chapter in Claimants' litany of conduct by the Russian Federation alleged to have negatively impacted their investment.\n\n**D. The Unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n822.\n\nIn April 2003, Yukos, which was then Russia's largest oil company, announced plans to merge with Sibneft, then Russia's fourth largest oil company, into a new entity that would be called YukosSibneft Oil Company and constitute the world's fourth largest private oil producer.\n\n823.\n\nSteps were taken to effectuate the merger between April and October 2003. By 3 October 2003, the main components of the transaction (a share purchase and a share exchange between Yukos' and Sibneft's principal shareholders) had been completed. An Extraordinary General Meeting (\" **EGM** \") of Yukos' shareholders was scheduled for 28 November 2003 for the approval of the merger's final details.926 However, shortly before the scheduled meeting, the Sibneft shareholders announced their intention to halt the merger process.927\n\nMinutes No. 120/1-21 of the Board of Directors of Yukos, 25 September 2003, pp. 8-9, Item 11, Exh. C-1103.\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 37; Memorial \u00b6 208; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 326.\n\n824.\n\nUltimately, the share exchange component of the merger was invalidated through a series of court cases in Moscow and the Russian Far Eastern province of Chukotka,928 and Sibneft was acquired by the Russian Federation through the State-owned company Gazprom.929\n\nAppeal Resolution of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 31 May 2004, Exh. C-72; Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District of 26 August 2004, Exh. C-73; Resolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Far-East District, 25 April 2006, Exh. C-78.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 231-37.\n\n825.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent was responsible for the unwinding of the merger, making it \"one of the first casualties\" of the Russian Federation's assault on Yukos.930 According to Claimants, Sibneft's decision to halt the merger process was the direct result of Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest. The arrest led Sibneft to insist on a change of the senior executives of the merged entity. This request was not acceptable to Yukos and the deal was aborted. Claimants also argue that the Russian courts were then \"only too happy to lend their assistance\" by invalidating parts of the merger on spurious grounds, paving the way for the Russian Federation's acquisition of Sibneft.931 Claimants' primary damages claim of USD 114,174 billion reflects the value of YukosSibneft as a successfully merged entity. Alternatively, Claimants submit that if the Tribunal does not hold Respondent responsible for the unwinding of the merger, the damages claim should be reduced by approximately USD 6 billion.932\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 199; Reply \u00b6 95.\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 135-37.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 859, 861; Second Expert Report of Brent Kaczmarek, 15 March 2012 \u00b6\u00b6 65; 75-76.\n\n826.\n\nRespondent denies any responsibility for the unwinding of the merger. Sibneft, Respondent argues, was neither exercising governmental authority nor acting under the instructions of Russian state organs. The Russian Government in fact supported the merger. Moreover, Sibneft's leaders had every right to insist on changes to the management of the merged entity due to concerns about Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest and charges of criminal activities against him; in so doing, they were acting \"in the pursuit of their own legitimate commercial interests.\"933 As for the Moscow and Chukotka courts, Respondent submits that they acted in accordance with Russian company law. Respondent also suggests that Yukos acquiesced in the court proceedings as they allowed Yukos to cancel the merger without obtaining the approval of minority shareholders and thus risking further claims being brought against it.934\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 322-30; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 776-79.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 805-06.\n\n827.\n\nIn this chapter, the Tribunal will consider the circumstances of the Yukos-Sibneft merger and seek to determine whether the Russian Federation is responsible for the unwinding of the merger. The Tribunal's view on this issue may have an impact on the quantum of damages the Tribunal may ultimately award Claimants. The Tribunal will also consider in this chapter whether the merger was an important factor, as Claimants submit, in Yukos' decision not to pursue its ADR listing on the NYSE. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent argues that Yukos' decision was taken because the company had concerns about elements of its tax optimization scheme. The Tribunal will also consider Yukos' declaration of a USD 2 billion interim dividend in November 2003 (\" **2003 Interim Dividend** \"), which Respondent argues was intended to shield this sum from the reach of the Russian tax authorities.935\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 809-23.\n\n**2. Chronology**\n-----------------\n\n828.\n\nIn the context of arguments about the Yukos-Sibneft merger, Respondent has accused Claimants of fighting a \"losing battle with the calendar,\"936 while Claimants have accused Respondent of attempting \"to rewrite history\".937 The Tribunal therefore considers it useful to lay out a short chronology of key events.\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 18 (Respondent's opening).\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 11 (Claimants' closing).\n\n**(a) Merger is Announced; NYSE Listing is Put on Hold; Steps are Taken to Complete Merger**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n829.\n\nOn 22 April 2003, Yukos and Sibneft announced their merger in a press release describing the principal features of the transaction.938 The merger would be achieved in two parts. Firstly, Yukos would acquire 20 percent (minus one share) of Sibneft shares from Sibneft's principal shareholders for a cash consideration of USD 3 billion pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (\" **Share Purchase Agreement** \"). Secondly, Yukos would acquire 72 percent (plus one share) of Sibneft shares from Sibneft's principal shareholders in exchange for 26.01 percent of the fully diluted share capital of Yukos pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the \" **Share Exchange Agreement** \").939\n\n*Yukos and Sibneft Agree in Principle to Merger*, Yukos Press Release and Sibneft Press Release, 22 April 2003, Exh. C-629.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 47 & n.61.\n\n830.\n\nA few days after the merger was announced, President Putin stated that he had approved the transaction in a meeting with Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Roman Abramovich (a Board member and significant shareholder of Sibneft) and Mr. Evgeny Shvidler (Sibneft's CEO).940\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6 26; Dubov WS \u00b6 69; *Sibneft President Eugene Shvidler comments on upcoming merger with Yukos to create YukosSibneft, a new international energy super major*, BusinessWeek Online, 21 May 2003, Exh. C-634.\n\n831.\n\nConcurrently with this announcement, the proposed listing of Yukos on the NYSE, which Yukos and a team of external advisers had been preparing for over a year, was put on hold. By then, Yukos and its advisers had conducted an extensive review of the company's operations for purposes of drafting the required SEC form.941 A first draft had been circulated in June 2002 and a near final draft had been circulated on 19 March 2003.942\n\n*See* Memorandum from Mr. Maly to Mr. Sheyko, 22 April 2002, Exh.

On 30 April 2003, Yukos and Sibneft's principal shareholders signed the Share Purchase Agreement943 and the Share Exchange Agreement.944 The share exchange component of the merger was broken down into two tranches: the exchange of 57.5 percent of Sibneft shares for newly issued shares in Yukos representing 17.2 percent of Yukos' fully diluted share capital and the exchange of 14.5 percent of Sibneft shares for 8.8 percent of Yukos shares (consisting of a mixture of newly issued shares, treasury shares and shares acquired through a share buy-back).945\n\nDeed of Share Purchase between Kravin Investments Limited, White Pearl Investments Limited, Marthacello Co Limited, N.P.

Yukos then issued a press release which named the persons it would nominate to the new management board of the merged YukosSibneft entity.957 Mr Khodorkovsky was not on that list.

The agenda included: (a) early termination of the powers of board members and election of a new board; (b) approval of new articles of association (including a name change to YukosSibneft); and (c) payment of the 2003 Interim Dividend.

Yukos' shareholding in Sibneft was then reduced to 34.5 percent.971\n\nAt the time of the application, the two petitioners were Yukos shareholders. NP Gemini Holding Limited was a former principal shareholder of Sibneft and had participated in all the steps of the merger. Nimegan Trading Limited was already a shareholder of Yukos when the Share Exchange Agreement was signed, with less than 0,001 percent of Yukos shares. According to Claimants, both companies were linked to Mr. Abramovich through Millhouse Capital, an investment company that manages Mr. Abramovich's assets.

In order to confer jurisdiction to the Chukotka Court, a defendant related to Mr. Abramovich had opened a bank account in the Chukotka province on the day that Nimegan paid the filing fee. The other nominal defendants all supported the court action.972 The Chukotka Arbitrazh Court invalidated the second tranche of the share exchange on 14 September 2004. After a series of appeals, this decision was ultimately confirmed by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Far-East District in April 2006,973 following which Yukos returned the 14.5 percent shareholding in Sibneft obtained through the second tranche of the share exchange to Sibneft's shareholders. Yukos' shareholding in Sibneft was then reduced to the 20 percent minus one share acquired pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\nPayment Order for filing fee for the Chukotka proceedings, 27 May 2004, Exh.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Was Yukos' NYSE Listing Put on Hold Because of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger or Fears of Exposing Yukos' Tax Optimization Scheme?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n850.\n\nClaimants maintain that Yukos' proposed NYSE listing was put on hold in April 2003 as a result of the proposed Yukos-Sibneft merger and the need to conduct further due diligence.980\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6 104.\n\n851.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr. Misamore stated that\n\nYukos' plan to obtain a Level 2 or 3 ADR listing on the NYSE was put on hold because of the decision in the beginning of 2003 to merge with Sibneft... and the need for further due diligence with respect to Sibneft to ensure complete transparency and financial statement accuracy before proceeding with any kind of listing of the merged company.981\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 20.\n\n852.\n\nMr. Misamore confirmed this statement in his re-direct examination before the Tribunal:\n\nMr. Khodorkovsky informed me early in 2003 that he was working on a significant transaction\u2014that turned out to be Sibneft\u2014and he asked me to put the F-1 registration process on hold. Certainly I could not have gone ahead with an F-1 in a significant transaction mode anyway. So we put it on hold solely as a result of what subsequently became the Sibneft transaction.982\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 240.\n\n853.\n\nMr. Kosciusko-Morizet also confirmed this explanation when he testified. After referring to the considerable work done in preparation for the NYSE listing and the extensive disclosure involved, he said:\n\nSo work was pursued during and until the end of the year and the beginning of 2003, and then in April it was interrupted by the prospect of the Sibneft-Yukos merger, which obviously was material to any filing. So negotiations were going on, and that prevented the filing of an ADR 3.983\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 72-73.\n\n854.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in the April-June 2003 edition of the *Yukos Review*, it was reported that the merger plans were \"likely to push back Yukos' listing on the New York stock exchange from later this year into 2004.\"984\n\nYukos Review, Issue 13, April-June 2003, p. 79, Exh. C-19.\n\n855.\n\nClaimants also refer to an e-mail of 29 April 2003 from a lawyer at Akin Gump\u2014the firm advising Yukos on its proposed NYSE listing\u2014to Mr. Misamore reporting that the lawyer had spoken to an SEC official \"to let him know about the proposed merger... and to tell him that although the timetable for the listing has been extended due to the merger, the company still intends to pursue a listing after the merger....\"985\n\nE-mail from Mr. Robert Langer to Mr. Bruce Misamore, 29 April 2003, Exh. C-1384.\n\n856.\n\nRespondent, however, maintains that the NYSE listing project was \"abandoned\" not because of the merger but because of \"fears that, as a result of the extensive disclosures required by the [SEC], the process would publicly reveal Yukos' \u2018tax optimization' program, and this in turn would lead to major tax reassessments.\"986 According to Respondent:\n\nWhatever excuse Yukos may have provided to the SEC in March 2003 for halting its proposed NYSE listing, the possibility of a 2003 listing was in fact called off in February of that year as the result of Mr. Khodorkovsky's refusal to sign the company's registration statement out of an understandable concern for his own personal liability.987\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1019.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 77.\n\n857.\n\nIn support of its submission, Respondent refers to an exchange of e-mails of 19 and 20 February 2004 between Mr. Oleg Sheiko, Yukos' Director of Corporate Finance, and Mr. Khodorkovsky, in which Mr. Sheiko notes that Mr. Misamore had been asked by Mr. Khodorkovsky to delay the NYSE, and Mr. Khodorkovsky replies:\n\nIf the lawyers do not confirm to me that my personal risks are limited by a reasonable period of time, I will not sign the form, because if my political career develops in 5 years, the American hook will become dangerous. I warned about this.988\n\nE-mail from Mr. Oleg Sheiko to Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, 19 February 2003 and reply e-mail from Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky to Mr. Oleg Sheiko, 20 February 2003, Exh. R-3611.\n\n858.\n\nClaimants did not comment on this e-mail. In the Tribunal's view, this e-mail is consistent with Mr. Misamore's testimony that, in \"early 2003\", Mr. Khodorkovsky had asked him to put the listing on hold due to a substantial transaction, which turned out to be the merger with Sibneft.\n\n859.\n\nRespondent also relies on a \"blackline\" version of Yukos' draft filing for the SEC sent by PwC to Yukos on 23 July 2002.989 As telling as that document may be with respect to Yukos' awareness of its tax risks,990 the Tribunal notes that this document pre-dates by more than 9 months Yukos' decision to suspend the NYSE listing.\n\nExtract from Yukos' Draft F-1 Form, 23 July 2002, Exh. R-1477.\n\nAs to which, see paragraph 491 above.\n\n860.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Yukos' decision to put the NYSE listing project on hold in the spring of 2003 appears to have been motivated by the anticipated Yukos-Sibneft merger.\n\n**(b) Was the 2003 Interim Dividend a Component of the Yukos-Sibneft Merger or a Means to Siphon Funds out of Russia?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nClaimants submit that the timing and amount of the 2003 Interim Dividend were solely related to and dictated by the Yukos-Sibneft merger. They write:\n\nYukos and Sibneft had agreed to target specific levels of net debt intended to reflect the relative values of the individual companies prior to the completion of the merger. At that time, Yukos was substantially underleveraged as compared to Sibneft, with significant cash reserves. It was therefore agreed that in order to leverage up and meet its target net debt level, Yukos would undertake the payment of dividends, a share buy-back and/or the taking out of a loan. The 2003 interim dividend was therefore part of the Company's efforts to match the capital structure of Yukos and Sibneft, and return value to its shareholders prior to the completion of the merger, as is confirmed by the contemporaneous documentation.991\n\nReply \u00b6 115 (footnote omitted); *see* Transcript, Day 17 at 7-11 (Claimants' closing).\n\n862.\n\nWith respect to the \"contemporaneous documentation\", Claimants refer to Yukos' press release of 22 April 2003 announcing the merger, which stated that\n\n[p]rior to completing the transaction, YUKOS intends to increase its leverage and is considering, among other things, cash distributions to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. It is expected that after such capital restructuring and the completion of the transaction, YukosSibneft will have a moderate level of leverage and a strong working capital position.992\n\n*Yukos and Sibneft Agree in Principle to Merger*, Yukos Press Release and Sibneft Press Release, 22 April 2003, Exh. C-629.\n\n863.\n\nClaimants also refer to analysts' reports from the same period, which are all consistent with their submission. For example, a Brunswick UBS Report dated 23 April 2003 stated that \"Yukos has every reason to leverage up further\u2014if its leverage reached levels similar to Sibneft..., implying $3.75 bn of new debt, Yukos could return $5.15 bn to shareholders... *before* the deal.\"993 An internal Yukos PowerPoint presentation about the merger also referred to the plan to declare a dividend in order to achieve the targeted net debt level.994 Mr. Misamore testified that the 2003 Interim Dividend was \"an integral part\" of the merger transaction:\n\n[The approval and payment of the dividend] was entirely related to the Sibneft transaction... [A]s part of the Sibneft transaction it was a desire of both of the shareholder groups to have a capital structure in YukosSibneft which did not disadvantage either of the two shareholder groups. And therefore there were a series of transactions in association with the Sibneft merger/acquisition that were undertaken, including share repurchases, the bank debt, the payment of the dividend... and that was the reason for the dividend[, it] was the very last step in the consummation of the Sibneft transaction.995\n\nBrunswick UBS Report \"YukosSibneft\", 23 April 2003, p. 9, Exh. C-1370 (emphasis in the original). *See also* a Credit Suisse First Boston Report which predicted a dividend distribution in excess of USD 1.7 billion to shareholders as a means for Yukos to increase its net debt in the context of the merger.

C-1068.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 21, 236.\n\n864.\n\nClaimants explain that the decision to pay the 2003 Interim Dividend was taken in three steps.996 Firstly, on 25 September 2003, when the Yukos Board of Directors scheduled for 28 November 2003 an EGM of Yukos' shareholders for purposes of approving the merger, the agenda included as an item \"payment of dividend for 9 months of 2003.\"997 Secondly, on 28 October 2003, the Yukos Board of Directors set the amount of and process for approving and paying the dividend.998 Thirdly, Yukos shareholders approved the 2003 Interim Dividend at the EGM on 28 November 2003. According to Claimants, this sequence of events undermines Respondent's argument that the 2003 Interim Dividend was declared with unprecedented haste as a \"clever\", \"eleventh hour\" ploy to siphon funds out of Russia.999\n\nFor a description of these steps, see Joint Stock Companies Law of the Russian Federation, Arts. 42-43, Exh. R-3604.\n\nMinutes No. 120/1-21 of the Board of Directors of Yukos, 25 September 2003, p. 8, Item 11, Exh.

R-3606.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 351.\n\n865.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent argues that the 2003 Interim Dividend \"betrays an unusual sense of urgency on the part of those who proposed it... who evidently sensed the gathering storm, wanted to get as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, out of the company, and out of Russia, and into their pockets.\"1000 In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues that, while the dividend might have had its origins in the Yukos-Sibneft merger, \"by the time the dividend was actually declared, on November 28, 2003, the Sibneft merger had been halted and there was no longer any merger-related reason for the dividend.\"1001 Respondent recalls that Sibneft's principal shareholders informed Claimants before the EGM that they no longer wished to proceed with the merger, and points out that Claimants agreed with the Sibneft shareholders not to vote for items 1 and 2 of the EGM's agenda (changes to the board and the company's articles of association), but proceeded to vote in favour of the dividend. Thus, Respondent argues, \"the giga-dividend can only be explained by Claimants' desire to transfer outside the reach of the Russian authorities US$ 2 billion that could otherwise have been used to pay Yukos' taxes and other liabilities.\"1002\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 350.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 821.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n866.\n\nDuring the hearing, in response to a question from the Tribunal regarding the fact that the 2003 Interim Dividend had been planned since the spring of 2003, counsel for Respondent explained that, between this planning stage and the declaration of the dividend, \"the world had changed,\" Mr. Khodorkovsky had been arrested and Sibneft had called off the merger, so that the \"link between the declaration of the dividend and the Sibneft merger had been severed, and any prudent company, frankly, would have marshaled its resources rather than declared and paid a dividend that was unprecedented in size, at a time when it was under considerable financial pressure.\"1003\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 162 (Respondent's closing).\n\n867.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Tribunal when Yukos' shareholders found out about the decision of Sibneft's shareholders to withdraw from the merger.1004 However, the exact timing does not matter. The Tribunal accepts that Sibneft's decision was communicated to Yukos shortly before the EGM, but in time for Yukos' shareholders to agree with Sibneft's principal shareholders not to vote on the first two items of the agenda.\n\nSome sources suggest that the announcement was made on the day of the EGM (*e.g.*, Misamore WS \u00b6 37), while others state it took place on the eve of the meeting (*e.g.*, *Yukos Oil Company v. Kravin Investments and others*, LCIA Arbitration No. 4589, Statement of Case, 2 May 2005, Exh. R-3601).\n\n868.\n\nMr. Misamore testified that the Sibneft shareholders, Hulley and YUL \"agreed between themselves to agree to vote for the dividend\" because it was \"an integral part of that [merger] transaction,\" although one of the parties had, at that point, changed its mind.1005 Claimants submit that, after the Sibneft announcement, as at 28 November 2003, the completed merger transaction was still in place and the 2003 Interim Dividend was a final step in consummating the merger. The status of the transaction was not affected and there were ongoing negotiations to resolve outstanding issues with Sibneft.1006 In fact, in an announcement by GML in December 2003, it was stated that the merger agreement remained in full effect.1007\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 20 (cross-examination of Mr. Misamore). However, as Respondent pointed out in its closing statement, Sibneft shareholders were not yet Yukos shareholders of record and could therefore not have voted for the dividend. S *ee* Transcript, Day 18 at 147-48.\n\n*See e.g.,* Yukos Review, Issue 16, January-February-March 2004, p. 58, Exh. C-23.\n\n*Yukos Sibneft Merger*, Company News, Group Menatep Website, 2 December 2003, Exh. C-670.\n\n869.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the decision to approve the 2003 Interim Dividend at the EGM on 28 November 2003 was an integral part of the merger process, which was still legally alive at the date of the EGM. Whether it was practically still alive is questionable. On balance, the evidence does not support Respondent's contention that the dividend was simply an \"eleventh hour\" device to siphon funds out of Russia for improper purposes. Nevertheless the Tribunal sees some force in Respondent's contention that Yukos' stockholders might have more prudently acted to conserve Yukos' resources rather than to proceed with a massive dividend whose essential rationale was evaporating.\n\n**(c) Was the Unwinding of the Merger Caused by the Russian Federation?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n870.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Russian Federation initially supported the Yukos-Sibneft merger. President Putin expressed his approval of the transaction in a meeting with Mr. Khodorkovsky and Messrs. Abramovich and Shvidler in April 2003.1008 In May 2003, Mr. Shvidler stated in an interview that President Putin and Prime Minister Kasyanov had encouraged him to promote the merged YukosSibneft entity as a \"national-champion\".1009 On 22 July 2003, the Russian Federal Commission for the Securities Market approved the registration of new Yukos shares to be issued in connection with the merger.1010 On 14 August 2003, the Russian Ministry for Antimonopoly Policies and Support to Entrepreneurship approved Yukos' acquisition of the Sibneft shares.1011\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6 26; Dubov WS \u00b6 69; President of Russia, Official Web Portal, 24 April 2003, Exh.

Rejoinder \u00b6 792.\n\n871.\n\nFollowing the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky in October 2003, Sibneft declared that it would halt the merger process unless the management team was changed.\n\n872.\n\nClaimants argue that the Russian Federation is responsible for the unwinding of the Yukos-Sibneft merger, despite its initial support for the transaction. Claimants frame the question as one of causation. As Claimants' counsel put it: \"[B]ut for the Russian Federation's attack on Yukos, the Yukos-Sibneft merger would never have been unwound. And that point is not seriously challenged by the Respondent.\"1012 Claimants describe the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky as having \"marked a radical escalation in the Russian Federation's attack on Yukos and... also marked the beginning of the end for the YukosSibneft merger.\"1013 According to Mr. Theede:\n\n[A]fter [Sibneft] saw what the Russian Federation was doing to Yukos,... saw it being destroyed... and in my opinion it was a direct result of that that caused Sibneft to want to detach itself from Yukos.... I knew Sibneft was doing everything they could to get out of this, and they were fairly panicked because they wanted to get out before the Government destroyed our company... [A]s soon as Sibneft saw and learned what was happening to Yukos, they wanted out of the deal.... [W]e had completed the merger, we were moving ahead with it; everything was really going along quite smoothly, and I think we were all excited about it. But Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest and the political fallout from that, and then the subsequent attack on the company that was related to Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, scared Sibneft off. And there's no question in my mind that they were afraid that the attack on Yukos was going to carry over to them....1014\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 16 (Claimants' closing).\n\nReply \u00b6 127.\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 39-41, 46.\n\n873.\n\nMr. Nevzlin also testified that \"[a]fter it became apparent that Mikhail Khodorkovsky was being targeted by the Kremlin, Roman Abramovich abruptly changed his mind and sought to unwind the merger.\"1015\n\nNevzlin WS \u00b6 27.\n\n874.\n\nIn support of their submission, Claimants mention that Mr. Abramovich met with President Putin only a few days before Sibneft's announcement of its decision to cancel the merger.1016\n\nMemorial \u00b6 211 (citing *Abramovich met Putin before vetoing Yukos-Sibneft merger*, The Sunday Telegraph, 30 November 2003, Exh. C-669).\n\n875.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that concerns over Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest led Sibneft to change its mind about the merger. Respondent says that Sibneft's decision\n\nwas not at all surprising, as Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, Yukos' two leading Directors, had recently been arrested and charged with various criminal acts.... [Their] future leadership of the company was thus in serious doubt, and any proposed partner would have understandably been concerned....1017\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 326.\n\n876.\n\nOne London newspaper speculated that \"[a]nalysts believe Mr. Abramovich's decision to cut ties with Yukos is an attempt to insulate himself from an apparently politically motivated campaign by the Kremlin against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos.\"1018\n\n*Abramovich pulls out of $11bn merger with Yukos*, The Independent, 29 November 2003, Exh. C-667.\n\n877.\n\nHowever, Respondent forcefully denies that Mr. Abramovich's decision was made \"at the behest\" of President Putin. It writes in its Counter-Memorial that\n\nMr. Abramovich did not need the President of the Russian Federation to tell him that Sibneft's proposed merger partner was the subject of a contentious tax dispute.... In the circumstances, any reasonable company would have sought to extricate itself from the planned merger, or at least to ensure that the new company was not led by two executives recently indicted for tax evasion.1019\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 767(iv); *see* Rejoinder \u00b6 786.\n\n878.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the meeting between Mr. Abramovich and President Putin, if at all relevant, only demonstrates that the Russian President welcomed Sibneft's proposal of a change in the management of the merged entity.1020\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 328.\n\n879.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that Sibneft was firmly of the view that the only way for the merger to be saved would be if there was a change in the senior management of the merged company, *i.e.*, if Mr Shvidler was appointed as President. Yukos was equally \"adamant\" that management issues were \"not negotiable.\"1021 As the BBC reported on 28 November 2003, the \"breaking point [of the merger] came when Yukos was not ready to hand over management of the company.\"1022\n\n*Abramovich met Putin before vetoing Yukos-Sibneft merger,* The Sunday Telegraph, 30 November 2003, Exh.

R-397 (quoting Mr. Boris Berezovsky).\n\n880.\n\nClaimants characterize Mr. Abramovich's insistence on a change of management as \"a manifestly unreasonable proposal which sought to turn the agreed terms of the merger upside-down.\"1023 They refer to the terms of the initial merger agreement which provided that Yukos would nominate the \"Senior Management Positions\" including the President,1024 and to the 22 April 2003 press release which announced that Mr. Khodorkovsky would be CEO.1025 Claimants contend that Yukos' refusal to change the agreed terms of the merger was \"hardly surprising\" and that Respondent's \"attempt to rely on such refusal to exonerate itself from responsibility for the consequences of its own actions should be rejected.\"1026\n\nReply \u00b6 134.\n\nShareholders' Agreement in respect of Yukos Oil Company among YUL, Hulley, White Pearl Investments Limited, N.P.

With respect to causation, Respondent argues that it was \"Yukos' stubborn refusal to consider Sibneft's change-in-management proposal\u2014 and not any action on the part of the Russian Federation\u2014that ultimately doomed the Yukos-Sibneft merger.\"1028\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 786.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 330.\n\n882.\n\nRespondent also argues that it cannot bear any responsibility for the unwinding of the merger because Claimants and/or Yukos voluntarily agreed to it. It is a matter of public record that, in early 2004, Yukos retained external advisers for negotiations with Sibneft.1029 Respondent also alleges that Claimants signed two protocols dated December 2003 and February 2004 to unwind the merger.1030 The Tribunal notes that these protocols are not in the record of this arbitration. Under cross-examination, Mr. Misamore stated that he did not recall ever seeing the protocols.1031\n\n*Yukos Oil Company retains consultants for negotiations with former Sibneft core shareholders*, Yukos Press Release, 2 February 2004, Exh.

R-3602.\n\n*Ibid.*, Flowchart.\n\n886.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this e-mail was sent after the commencement of the Moscow lawsuit. Respondent's theory is also inconsistent with the fact that Yukos applied to an LCIA tribunal to prevent the former Sibneft shareholders from pursuing actions for the invalidation of the share issuance before the Moscow and Chukotka courts. The Tribunal finds this argument of Respondent unpersuasive.\n\n887.\n\nThe central question remains. Did the Russian Federation cause the demerger? In the view of the Tribunal, it did not. It is abundantly clear that Sibneft wanted out of the merger after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky. It was perfectly understandable for Sibneft to have second thoughts about the merger under the leadership of a CEO who was under arrest and embroiled in controversy.1038 The Tribunal does not see the fingerprints of Respondent in Sibneft's decision to insist upon a change in management after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky or in Sibneft's subsequent announcement that it would not proceed with the merger.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Sibneft's position was not inconsistent with the spirit of the Shareholders' Agreement, which contained a provision allowing the Sibneft shareholder group to remove any Yukos-appointed senior managers if they committed fraud or embezzlement. Shareholders' Agreement in respect of Yukos Oil Company among YUL, Hulley, White Pearl Investments Limited, N.P. Gemini Holdings Limited, Marthacello Co. Limited, Kindselia Holdings Limited, Heflinham Holdings Limited and Kravin Investments Limited, 1 May 2003, Article 6.1, Exh. C-1102.\n\n888.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimants have not established any basis which would allow them to claim damages based on the assumption that the merged YukosSibneft company would have been successful.1039\n\n*See* Part XII on Quantification of Damages at paragraph 1779.\n\n889.\n\nHowever, the circumstances of the Yukos-Sibneft merger are instructive in evaluating Yukos' attempts to settle its tax debts with the Russian authorities, which will be discussed in the next chapter.\n\n890.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review the attempts by Yukos to settle its tax debts and the reaction of the Russian authorities to Yukos' offers.\n\n**E. ATTEMPTS TO SETTLE**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n891.\n\nIn the second half of 2004, Yukos made several proposals to the Russian authorities for the settlement of its tax debts. None of these proposals was accepted by the Russian Federation, which moved to auction off YNG in December 2004 in spite of Yukos' protests.\n\n892.\n\nThis chapter examines the context of Yukos' settlement offers, their content and the Russian Federation's reaction to them, with a view to determining whether the conduct of the Russian Federation was more consistent with the goal of collecting taxes or, as Claimants argue, with the aim of leading Yukos to bankruptcy and appropriating its most valuable assets.\n\n893.\n\nClaimants submit that, through its settlement offers, Yukos sought to initiate a dialogue with the Russian Federation that could lead to Yukos paying its tax debts while \"preserv[ing] the company as a going concern.\"1040 However, the settlement offers were met with a \"complete lack of responsiveness\" and utter inflexibility from the Russian Federation.1041 For Claimants, this reaction is \"one of the strongest testaments\" to the fact that Respondent was not interested in tax collection, but only the destruction of Yukos.1042 As put by Claimants' counsel at the Hearing:\n\nthe bottom line is: if the Russian Federation was interested in collecting taxes, it would have responded to Yukos; it would have worked with Yukos to try and find a way for the company to pay its alleged tax debt.... And we say that this is consistent and supports the Claimants' conclusion that this was not about paying taxes but was about the expropriation of the company.1043\n\nTheede WS \u00b6 9; *see also* Transcript, Day 17 at 126.\n\nReply \u00b6 321.\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 216 (Claimants' closing); *see also* Rieger WS \u00b6 24.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 105 (Claimants' closing).\n\n894.\n\nClaimants add that the Russian Federation's real intent with respect to Yukos is also revealed by the fact that it did settle the tax debts of other oil companies, such as Rosneft, Sibneft and TNK-BP.1044\n\nClaimants' Skeleton Argument, 1 October 2012 \u00b6 26 (hereinafter \"Claimants' Skeleton\").\n\n895.\n\nClaimants also submit that, in addition to rejecting Yukos' settlement offers, the Russian authorities actively prevented Yukos from discharging its tax liabilities by freezing and seizing Yukos' assets (through the April 2004 injunction of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court and the bailiffs' resolutions of June and July 2004).1045 As a result, Yukos could only pay its tax debts from the proceeds of the business operations of its subsidiaries, which did not suffice to meet Yukos' liabilities in the short time allowed by the Russian authorities.1046\n\nMemorial \u00b6 351.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 351, 353.\n\n896.\n\nFor its part, Respondent submits that the Russian authorities responded to each of Yukos' offers1047 and, moreover, were entitled to reject these offers because none of them amounted to a serious proposal.1048 From Respondent's perspective, Yukos' settlement offers were a mere posturing exercise intended to give \"an appearance of cooperation, while fostering the image\u2014 embellished by their public relations machines\u2014that Yukos was a victim of the authorities' conduct.\"1049 Yukos' offers were \"invariably unacceptable, either because they were contrary to Russian law, or because they involved impaired assets, or because they were otherwise inadequate.\"1050\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 895; *see also* Rejoinder \u00b6 893.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 419.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 897.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 419; *see also* Rejoinder \u00b6 893.\n\n897.\n\nRespondent further submits that, by the second half of 2004, \"Yukos' management faced a serious credibility problem, among other things because it had made manifestly false claims that it was unable to pay any of its tax bills.\"1051 Given Yukos' bad faith, the Russian authorities' refusal to negotiate was reasonable.1052 Respondent concludes that Yukos caused its own demise by failing to pay its tax debts in full in the first quarter of 2004 (instead making disingenuous and inadequate settlement proposals), thereby attracting mounting interest and fines.1053\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 418.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 804-806.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 220-21.\n\n898.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the *Quasar* tribunal found that the Russian Federation's failure \"even to respond\" to the offers made by Yukos, \"the largest private taxpayer in Russia\" and a major force of the national economy, raised \"significant doubts as to whether the Respondent acted in good faith in attempting to resolve its tax dispute with Yukos.\"1054\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 102, Exh. R-3383.\n\n**2. Yukos' Settlement Offers (and the Russian Federation's Replies)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nTo place the settlement offers in context, it is helpful to recall the dates of some key events.1055\n\nFor a complete narrative, *see* Chapter VIII.B of this Award.\n\n900.\n\nThe 2000 Audit Report, the first audit report to assess tax arrears against Yukos, was issued on 29 December 2003.1056 The 2000 Decision holding Yukos fiscally liable for a tax offense and concluding that an amount of approximately USD 3.48 billion was due within two days, was issued on 14 April 2004.1057\n\n2000 Audit Report, Exh. C-103.\n\n2000 Decision, Exh.

C-108.\n\n902.\n\nIn a decision dated 23 June 2004 and published on 30 June 2004, the Appeal Panel of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court reversed a 19 May 2004 ruling that had provisionally suspended the effect of the 2000 Decision.1059\n\nDecision of Judge Cheburashkina to Suspend the Effect of Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14 April 2004, Exh.

The resolution granted Yukos a 5-day period for voluntary payment of the full amount due, failing which the Bailiff would consider imposing a 7 percent enforcement fee.1062 The Bailiff then issued several more resolutions, freezing cash in 16 Yukos bank accounts.1063\n\nResolution of the bailiff to initiate enforcement proceeding 10249/21/04, 30 June 2004, Exh.

These proposals may be classified in four categories: (a) proposals made to the bailiffs, requesting enforcement against specific assets; (b) proposals for a global settlement conveyed by the Right Honourable Jean Chr\u00e9tien, PC, OM, CC, QC, former Prime Minister of Canada; (c) requests for a deferral or payment in instalments; and (d) other proposals (which are not in the documentary record in this arbitration). The Rehabilitation Plan, proposed by Yukos' management in the bankruptcy proceedings and discussed in greater detail in Chapter VIII.G of this Award, can be seen as Yukos' final attempt to discharge its tax liabilities while continuing as a going concern.\n\n**(a) Proposals Made to the Bailiffs**\n--------------------------------------\n\n912.\n\nOn 2 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov, Yukos' legal counsel, wrote to Bailiff Solovyeva, explaining that the April 2004 Injunction and the Bailiff's 30 June 2004 seizure of 16 Yukos bank accounts prevented Yukos from voluntarily complying with the 30 June 2004 enforcement resolution and requesting that Bailiff Solovyeva accept, by way of voluntary enforcement, the transfer of a 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft, corresponding to the 20 percent minus one share stake obtained by Yukos under the Share Purchase Agreement plus the 14.5 percent stake obtained by Yukos as the second tranche under the Share Exchange Agreement.1071 Mr. Gololobov's letter stated that the value of the 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft was approximately USD 4 billion.\n\nPetition for voluntary enforcement of the Resolution of 30 June 2004 to initiate enforcement proceedings and the Demand of 30 June 2004, 2 July 2004, Exh. C-126.\n\n913.\n\nOn 9 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov again requested Bailiff Solovyeva to accept Yukos' 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft in payment of Yukos' tax debts.1072 Respondent has described this request dated 13 July 2004 as being \"in clear violation of the Chukotka [I]njunctions.\"1073 However, Claimants correctly point out that, while 13 July 2004 may have been the date when the letter was received by the Bailiff, the letter itself is dated 9 July 2004.1074\n\nApplication on the procedure of performance of the Resolution on commencement of enforcement proceedings dated 30 June 2004 and the Demand dated 3 June 2004, 9 July 2004, Exh. R-554.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 425.\n\nReply \u00b6 328 n.630.\n\n914.\n\nOn 14 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov amended Yukos' previous requests and lowered the offer to a 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft ostensibly to take account of the Chukotka Injunctions dated 9 July 2004.1075 Mr. Gololobov indicated that the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft was worth between USD 2.3 and 2.5 billion.1076\n\nAddendum to petition regarding the process of enforcement of the Resolution of June 30, 2004 to initiate enforcement proceedings and the Demand of June 30, 2004, 14 July 2004, Exh. C-137.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n915.\n\nOn 6 August 2004, Mr. Gololobov wrote to Chief Bailiff Melnikov, requesting that the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft, as well as Yukos' holdings in 15 other companies with a purported value of approximately USD 1.1 billion, be used for enforcement purposes as a matter of priority.1077 The letter incorrectly stated that the 20 percent stake comprised 1,637,633.048 shares (a number that in fact corresponds to a 34.5 percent stake), prompting Respondent to argue that Yukos sought to conceal from the bailiffs that at least a 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft was encumbered pursuant to the Chukotka Injunctions.1078 The letter also stated that the total value of the assets offered in payment was USD 3.4 billion.1079 But, the annex to the letter valued the shareholdings in Sibneft at USD 2,351 billion, which corresponds to the value of a 20 percent minus one share stake (as stated in Yukos' letter of 14 July 2004), and all the assets offered at USD 3.4 billion.1080 It is obvious that the letter contained some errors, which could have been corrected by the bailiffs by comparing it to its annex and the letter of 14 July 2004.\n\nLetter from Mr. Gololobov to Chief Bailiff A.T.

C-140.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n916.\n\nOn 16 September, 24 November and 16 December 2004, Yukos wrote further letters to the bailiffs (in response to the issuance of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions),1081 again proposing that enforcement be made as a matter of priority against its stake in Sibneft and 15 other entities.1082 These proposals did not specify the number or percentage of Sibneft shares that Yukos was offering, but the total value of the assets offered in each case was said to be USD 3,407 billion. This figure is identical to the total amount of assets referred to in the annex to the 6 August 2004 letter, and it appears to have been calculated on the basis of a 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft.1083\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 354, 356.\n\nPetition for voluntary enforcement of Resolution of 09.09.2004 to initiate an enforcement proceeding and Demand of 30.06.2004, 16 September 2004, Exh.

C-195.\n\nWith respect to the Sibneft shares, in addition to the proposals listed here, Yukos also applied on 22 April 2004 to the Moscow Arbitrazh Court for a replacement of the April 2004 Injunction with a new injunction that would instead freeze Yukos' 57.5 percent stake in Sibneft (*see* Exhs. R-476 and R-477). Yukos' application was rejected the following day (Exh. R-452). Respondent discussed this application in the context of Yukos' settlement offers (Counter-Memorial \u00b6 420). However, since the purpose of the application was the unfreezing of Yukos' assets in the context of interim measures ordered against it, rather than a final settlement of the tax claims, the Tribunal considers that this application cannot properly be characterized as a settlement proposal.\n\n917.\n\nThe bailiffs did not respond to the proposals made by Mr. Gololobov in July 2004. Yukos challenged the bailiffs' silence before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, which found, in a decision dated 17 August 2004, that the bailiffs had acted lawfully because both the 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft, which was attached pursuant to the Chukotka Injunctions, and the remaining 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft, were disputed by Sibneft's former shareholders.1084\n\nDecision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 17 August 2004, Exh. C-143.\n\n918.\n\nThe Department of Bailiffs within the Russian Ministry of Justice responded to Yukos' 6 August 2004 letter on 9 September 2004, referring in particular to the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 17 August 2004 and concluding that the Russian judiciary had \"affirmed the right of the bailiff to make the final decision regarding the sequence for seizures.\"1085\n\nLetter from Mr. Sazanov, Deputy Head of the Bailiffs Department to Mr. Gololobov, 9 September 2004, Exh.

Respondent submits that the bailiffs did not need to respond as, by then, Yukos had already been put on notice by the 17 July 2004 decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that its offers of Sibneft shares were unacceptable.1086 The Tribunal notes, however, that the bailiffs also failed to react to Yukos' offer of shares in companies other than Sibneft, in respect of which the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had not commented.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 893(c).\n\n**(b) Proposals for a Global Settlement Conveyed by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n920.\n\nMr. Chr\u00e9tien wrote to Prime Minister Fradkov on behalf of Yukos for the first time on 6 July 2004, offering a \"global settlement\" of USD 8 billion for the taxes assessed against Yukos in 2000-2003, with 2 billion to be paid in cash in July 2004 and two more tranches to be paid in July 2005 and July 2006.1087 As security for the payment of the July 2005 tranche, Yukos offered its 35 percent stake in Sibneft.1088\n\nLetters from Jean Chr\u00e9tien to Prime Minister Fradkov of 6 and 15 July 2004, and to President Putin of 30 July 2004, 10 September 2004 and 17 November 2004, Exh. C-129 (hereinafter \"Chr\u00e9tien letters\").\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n921.\n\nHaving received no reply, Mr. Chr\u00e9tien reiterated the global settlement proposal in another letter to Prime Minister Fradkov dated 15 July 2004 and in letters addressed to President Putin dated 30 July, 10 September and 17 November 2004.1089\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n922.\n\nNoting that Mr. Chr\u00e9tien's letter of 30 July 2004 offered an \"uncontested\" 35 percent stake in Sibneft as collateral, Respondent again argues that Yukos sought to conceal from Respondent that at that time at least a 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft was encumbered pursuant to the Chukotka Injunctions. However, as Mr. Chr\u00e9tien's letter in this respect contradicted Mr. Gololobov's letter to the bailiffs of 14 July 2004, the Tribunal views the reference to the uncontested stake in Sibneft as a mistake rather than a deliberate attempt by Yukos to mislead the Russian authorities.\n\n923.\n\nReferring to Mr. Chr\u00e9tien's letters of 30 July 2004 and 17 November 2004, Respondent submits that, while Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin did not respond to Mr. Chr\u00e9tien in writing, they did discuss with him the tax claims against Yukos.1090\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 302, 324.\n\n924.\n\nIn his letter of 30 July 2004, Mr. Chr\u00e9tien refers to a discussion with President Putin during a \"meeting in July.\"1091 In his letter of 17 November 2004, he describes a meeting with President Putin as follows:\n\n[w]hen we last met in Moscow, you told me that I could take the mandate to represent the interests of Group Menatep, and possibly other minority shareholders of Yukos, to find a solution to the tax problems confronting them.... When you and I last spoke after our meeting, you asked for a letter outlining our proposal to settle this matter and you assured me that a response from the Minister responsible for this file would be forthcoming. I sent you the letter at the end of July, but have received no communications from your government as yet.1092\n\nChr\u00e9tien letters, Exh. C-129.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n925.\n\nFrom these excerpts, it appears that President Putin initially encouraged the overture of a dialogue regarding Yukos' tax liability, but that neither he nor any other Russian authority ever responded to the concrete proposal made by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien on Yukos' behalf.\n\n926.\n\nUnder cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Theede expressed Yukos' frustration with the lack of response from the Russian Federation:\n\nBy this time it was really becoming obvious that Mr. Chr\u00e9tien's, you know, admirable efforts just weren't going to get us where we needed to go, because he had been made\u2014a lot of promises had been made to him about \u2018All I want Yukos to do is pay taxes, you know? That's all I want out of them: I just want them to pay taxes. And if you can get them to do that, then send me a proposal and it will work.'\n\nAnd he did all that, and never got a response. And it's now several months after the original proposal. I suppose\u2014I suppose, you know, no question in my mind\u2014the authorities probably already by July had in mind the amount of money that they were going to rack up against us in tax liabilities. They probably knew that they were going for something in the order of $30 billion, and so to them the $8 billion was low. And of course, they couldn't come back and say, \u2018Look, our plan is to tax you $30 billion, and so you guys are well off the mark.' They couldn't say that, because it would have blown their cover.\n\nBut we were trying, and thought Mr Chr\u00e9tien was a very credible way to open the dialogue I've been talking about all afternoon. But by this time, I don't\u2014I had pretty much lost hope, and was, I guess, impressed that Mr Chr\u00e9tien was continuing to try, but to no avail.1093\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 100-101.\n\n**(c) Requests for a Deferral or Payment in Instalments**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n927.\n\nOn 16 July 2004, Mr. Steven Theede sent a letter signed by Mr. Bruce Misamore to the Minister of Finance, Mr. Kudrin, then Minister of Finance, requesting a six-month deferral or payment in instalments of the tax arrears and interest for the year 2000.1094 The letter referred to the \"unprecedented nature\" of the sum subject to collection and the potentially negative consequences of rapid enforcement on Yukos' production operations and the Russian budget.1095 During the Hearing, Mr. Theede acknowledged that the letter was not perfect (the proposals were not detailed) but he described the letter as an attempt to \"create a dialogue\" between Yukos and the Russian Federation.1096 The Ministry of Finance rejected Mr. Theede's request by letter dated 30 August 2004, relying on Art. 62(1)(2) of the Russian Tax Code, which provides that the term for the payment of tax cannot be changed if the entity applying for such a change is the subject of proceedings for a tax offence.1097\n\nPetition for deferral or payment in instalments, 16 July 2004, Exh.

Judge Grechishkin denied the petition, stating that while he had discretion under the law to order payment in instalments, in this case the circumstances did not justify such an order.1098\n\nRuling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 12 August 2004, Exh. C-142.\n\n**(d) Other Proposals**\n-----------------------\n\n929.\n\nClaimants submit that the settlement offers described above are \"just a sample\" of the \"roughly 80 proposals and attempts to communicate with various authorities\" made by Yukos.1099 They say that other settlement proposals were made, but did not leave a paper trail.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 105 (Claimants' closing), referring to Theede WS \u00b6 9.\n\n930.\n\nFor example, Mr. Rieger recounts in his witness statement that, in the summer of 2004, he and Mr. Gololobov had a meeting with Chief Bailiff Belyakov during which they \"explained that Yukos could start selling off its assets within a month in order to pay off its alleged tax debts\" and \"left a two-page letter for the Russian authorities setting out Yukos' settlement proposal.\" Mr. Rieger adds that the authorities did not respond to this proposal.1100 Noting that Mr. Rieger could not recall the exact terms of the proposal, Respondent suggests that, in the light of the timing, there is no reason to believe that the proposal differed from that made in Mr. Golobolov's 6 August 2004 letter (described in paragraph 915 above).1101\n\nRieger WS \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 319, referring to Transcript, Day 6 at 130 (cross-examination of Mr. Rieger).\n\n931.\n\nIn their respective witness statements, Messrs. Theede and Misamore also recount that, in October 2004, \"the company put everything it could into a last settlement effort\" and presented to the Russian authorities a USD 21 billion settlement proposal that included Yukos shares, Sibneft shares, non-core assets and \"a concession to re-elect a new board of directors that would include a number of people selected by the Government.\"1102 While Yukos was initially \"cautiously optimistic\", the negotiations ended abruptly when Mr. Temerko, Yukos' chief negotiator in the process, was threatened with arrest and fled Russia.1103\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 47; Theede WS \u00b6 21.\n\nTheede WS \u00b6\u00b6 22-23; Misamore WS \u00b6 48.\n\n932.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that there is no written record of this proposal and no witness statement by Mr. Temerko. Respondent also contends that \"[i]f there were such a proposal in any amount, there is no rational basis for believing it totalled US $21 billion, because after it was allegedly made in October 2004, Yukos continued to make proposals it valued at US$ 3.4 billion, and Mr. Chr\u00e9tien kept reiterating his \u2018global settlement' proposal of US$ 8 billion.\"1104\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 102(iii).\n\n933.\n\nWhen asked in cross-examination whether there was a record of this offer, Mr. Theede replied \"[y]ou have no record, but you do have my word. And I believe certainly Bruce Misamore and I have exactly the same recollection.\"1105 Mr. Misamore was not cross-examined regarding this settlement proposal.\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 75.\n\n**3. Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Did Yukos Contribute to its Own Demise by Failing to Discharge Tax Debt in the Amount of USD 9 Billion in the First Quarter of 2004?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n934.\n\nAs discussed in paragraphs 679-80 and 745-48 above, Respondent submits that Yukos could have avoided some of the taxes, fines and interest eventually assessed against it, in the first quarter of 2004, by filing amended VAT returns in its own name, amended tax returns for 2000-2002 and a tax return for 2003 recognizing all of Yukos' income without assigning it to its trading entities. According to Respondent, had Yukos taken these steps, it would have faced only USD 9 billion in unavoidable tax debt, comprising the full amount assessed against it for the year 2000 and the amounts assessed against it for 2001-2003 minus VAT, willful and repeat offender fines and a part of the default interest accrued on the taxes for those years.1106\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 228.\n\n935.\n\nRespondent also contends that Yukos could have paid this amount\u2014USD 9 billion\u2014in the first quarter of 2004. At that time, Respondent argues, Yukos had both the ability to calculate its tax liabilities for 2001-2003 based on the amounts assessed against it for the year 2000 and sufficient funds.1107 Specifically, Respondent submits that Yukos had \"unrestricted access\" to: (a) over USD 6.8 billion in cash, constituting revenue from Yukos' trading entities paid out in dividends to Brittany Ltd., a British Virgin Islands indirect subsidiary of Yukos;1108 (b) USD 3 billion in cash, which Yukos was entitled to receive in the context of the unwinding of the Sibneft merger for the 20 percent minus one share stake it had acquired under the Share Purchase Agreement;1109 (c) over USD 1.1 billion in cash generated by Yukos' continuing operations;1110 (d) the USD 2 billion \"giga-dividend\" Yukos paid out to its shareholders in December 2003 and January 2004;1111 and (e) at least USD 1.55 billion in offshore nonmonetary assets.1112 Respondent also points out that, until the April 2004 Injunction, all of Yukos' assets in Russia were available to it to pay its tax debts.1113\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 247, referring to Exh. C-1756.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 79, n.199; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 838-41. For a description of Brittany's place in the Yukos corporate structure and revenue flow structure see Supplemental Expert Report of Thomas Z. Lys, 15 August 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 105, 114, 130-37 and Appendix I.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 79, n.199; Rejoinder \u00b6 842.\n\n*Ibid*.; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 843-44.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Rejoinder \u00b6 845.\n\n*Ibid*.; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 372, n.500.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 267.\n\n936.\n\nRespondent submits that, by re-filing its VAT and tax returns and paying USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004, Yukos could have avoided the 7 percent enforcement fee imposed by the bailiffs and \"all of the enforcement measures about which Claimants complain, including the April 14, 2004 injunction, the June 30, 2003 cash freeze orders, the seizures of shares, and the YNG auction.\"1114 Yukos would thus \"have survived as a going concern and still could have pursued a claim for a refund of any amounts the courts found it did not need to pay.\"1115\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 834. Respondent adds that even if Yukos had waited until after the 2000 Decision was issued in April 2004, it could have avoided all enforcement measures by paying only USD 10.8 billion (Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 84).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 250.\n\n937.\n\nRespondent insists that, as Mr Konnov stated in his second expert report, \"[t]he filing of tax returns and the payment of the tax would not have prejudiced Yukos' appeal rights.\"1116 According to Respondent, Mr Konnov's opinion is confirmed by Yukos' counsel Mr Pepeliaev who, in a commentary published in 2002, wrote:\n\nWe often recommend for the sake of a client's safety to pay tax for a short period (a month) in a maximum amount which can possibly be inferred from interpretation of the relevant provision. And immediately thereafter we file an application to the tax inspectorate requesting a refund or offset of an overpaid amount. It basically reads, \u2018Hey! We used to interpret this norm this way but our consultants tell us that we overpaid tax, so please refund it.' Of course, the inspectorate refuses to refund implying that we paid correctly - the more the better. Then a court claim is filed and it is up to court to decide. As a result a precedent is established.1117\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 248, referring to Second Konnov Report \u00b6 104.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 849, referring to S.G. Pepeliaev, *Tax Law Should Be Understandable*, Raschet, No. 4, 2002, Exh. R-3287.\n\n938.\n\nHowever, Respondent submits, despite this possibility to discharge the totality of its tax debt at an early stage for a fraction of the amounts eventually assessed against it, Yukos \"failed to use the time and its resources to pay its tax debt,\" its managers choosing to \"ignore that payment was due as provided in the assessment, not months later.\"1118 Instead, Yukos only started making payments and considering a payment plan in July 2004.1119\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 292.\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 264-65, referring to Transcript, Day 10 at 21 (cross-examination of Mr. Theede).\n\n939.\n\nRespondent submits that, in the light of Yukos' conduct, the Russian authorities were entitled to view Yukos' settlement offers with \"caution and scepticism\".1120 In addition, by the time of the first settlement offers, Yukos' untrustworthiness had become manifest in other ways, particularly when Yukos: (a) accused the Russian authorities of running a \"tax racket\"; (b) denied affiliation with, or the ability to get information about, its trading entities; (c) asked that the April 2004 Injunction be substituted with an injunction against already-encumbered Sibneft shares; and (d) engaged in serial corporate dissolution to frustrate tax collection.1121\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 265.\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 265.\n\n940.\n\nRespondent concludes that the destruction of Yukos is therefore \"the consequence of the contributory fault and failure to mitigate of Yukos, under the control of Claimants.\"1122\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 250.\n\n941.\n\nClaimants reject the argument that they could have avoided enforcement of the tax assessments by the Russian Federation and the bankruptcy of Yukos by paying USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004, asserting that, to be convinced by this argument, \"the Tribunal would need to ignore the most salient facts\u2014the Respondent's breaches\u2014and assume... that the very same Russian authorities who committed those breaches would have acted differently if only Yukos had taken the actions specified by the Respondent.\"1123 Claimants argue that there is no \"duty to appease\" and that \"a victim of extortion is not to blame if the threats against it are carried out after it refuses to pay.\"1124\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 276.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 275.\n\n942.\n\nIn addition, Claimants are of the view that taking the steps suggested by Respondent would have prejudiced Yukos' position for subsequent litigation.1125 As Mr. Theede stated at the Hearing, \"you don't run a business by talking about paying taxes until they become an official tax.\"1126\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 21.\n\n943.\n\nMoreover, Claimants submit that, as a matter of fact, Yukos \"did everything it could to pay off the tax assessments as soon as they became due.\"1127 The obligation to pay arose on 16 April 2004,1128 and Yukos made its first payment shortly thereafter on 6 July 2004. However, contrary to Respondent's contention, Yukos did not have enough cash available to settle an alleged tax debt of USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Mr. Theede explained at the Hearing that the USD 6.8 billion on the balance sheet of Brittany Ltd. \"were basically loans of cash that had already been repatriated into Russia to fund our capital programs and operating expenses and so forth\" and thus represented a \"zero-sum\" game.1129 The offer by the former Sibneft shareholders to buy back the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft that Yukos had acquired pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement for USD 3 billion was only made in October 2004 (and was rejected because it significantly undervalued the shares).1130 The 2 billion dividend could not be reversed and the sale of Yukos' offshore assets would have taken longer than three months to realize.1131 As for Yukos' assets in Russia, Yukos was prevented from using them by the April 2004 Injunction, which was \"grossly disproportionate\" to the debt it was intended to secure, and subsequent seizures.1132\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 83.\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 112-13.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 41-42.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 291.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 85-86, 91.\n\n944.\n\nThus, according to Claimants, by adding the \"wide-ranging freeze and seizures\" of the company's non-cash assets to the \"massive payment demands\" and \"impossibly short deadlines,\" the Russian Federation itself \"engineer[ed] the circumstances of non-payment.\"1133 In the circumstances, \"it was evident that Yukos would not be able [to] settle its alleged tax debts or discharge them in full without the cooperation of the Russian authorities.\"1134\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 88.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 84.\n\n945.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Yukos cannot be held responsible (even in part) for the rejection of its settlement offers and the enforcement measures subsequently taken by the Russian Federation merely because it did not pay USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Although the 2000 Audit Report was issued at the end of 2003, Yukos' obligation to pay its tax debt for the year 2000 did not arise until the 2000 Decision was issued in April 2004. Similarly, Yukos' obligation to pay its tax debts for 2001-2003 arose only with the issuance of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions in September-December 2004. Although some of the amounts that became due under these decisions could have been estimated based on the findings set out in the 2000 Audit Report, the Tribunal does not see why Yukos, at a time when it considered the tax assessments to be ill-founded, should have made any payments before a legal obligation to pay the tax arose. The Tribunal notes that Yukos began making payments toward its tax debts on 6 July 2004, less than a week after the issuance of the appeals decisions in its challenge proceedings against the 2000 Decision and the enforcement proceedings initiated by the Russian Federation. In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it unreasonable for Yukos to have delayed payment of its tax debts until these decisions were issued.\n\n**(b) Did Yukos' Settlement Offers Constitute Real Alternatives to Enforcement?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n946.\n\nRespondent invokes several reasons why Yukos' settlement offers could not be accepted by the Russian Federation, all of which are disputed by Claimants. Principally, the Parties disagree as to whether (i) all the Sibneft shares were either encumbered or disputed; (ii) Yukos sought to enter into negotiations that are not permissible under Russian law; and (iii) Russian law permits payment in kind of tax arrears.\n\n947.\n\nFor Respondent, because of the flaws in Yukos' offers, the Russian authorities were justified in doubting the sincerity of Yukos' intention to pay. This justified distrust explains why the Russian authorities did not respond to each one of Yukos' offers (although, according to Respondent, they did respond to all the sound offers).\n\n948.\n\nDisputing that Yukos' offers suffered from any insurmountable defects, Claimants repeat that it was Yukos' genuine intention to commence a dialogue with the Russian Federation aimed at finding a workable solution to pay off its tax debts.\n\n949.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal first addresses the specific areas of disagreement between the Parties and then makes some general observations regarding Yukos' settlement offers and the Russian Federation's responses.\n\n**i. Whether all the Sibneft Shares were Either Encumbered or Disputed**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n950.\n\nRespondent submits that the Sibneft shares could not be accepted in payment of Yukos' tax debts because Yukos' ownership of these shares was disputed by Sibneft's former shareholders.1135 This defect, says Respondent, affected all the offers made to the bailiffs, all the offers conveyed by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien to Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin, as well as the USD 21 billion settlement proposal allegedly made by Yukos in October 2004.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 420-30; Respondent's Skeleton \u00b6 47.\n\n951.\n\nClaimants recognize that Yukos' ownership of the 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft corresponding to the second tranche under the Share Exchange Agreement was challenged by Nimegan Trading Limited before the Chukotka Arbitrazh Court in proceedings initiated on 6 July 2004 and that those shares were attached by the Chukotka Injunctions of 9 July 2004, pending resolution of the merits of the dispute. Claimants assert, however, that the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft acquired by Yukos under the Share Purchase Agreement was never encumbered or challenged in any legal proceeding.1136\n\nMemorial \u00b6 229; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 92, referring to Transcript, Day 6 at 95-97, 112, 116 (Mr. Rieger); Transcript, Day 9 at 242-43 (Mr. Misamore); Transcript, Day 9 at 36-39, 44-45, 48-49, 71, 74, 92-93 (Mr. Theede); Day 17 at 106-12 (Claimants' closing).\n\n952.\n\nAs explained in paragraphs 2-915 and 922 above, the Tribunal considers that, although Yukos initially offered a 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft in payment of its tax debts to the bailiffs, after the Chukotka Injunctions it sought only to offer in payment the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft that was not the object of the Injunctions.\n\n953.\n\nAs for this 20 percent stake, the Tribunal notes that a number of Sibneft's original shareholders wrote to the Russian authorities in July and August 2004, opposing Yukos' proposals to use Sibneft shares to settle its tax debts, since the shares' ownership was disputed between them and Yukos. Thus, on 6 July 2004, these former shareholders wrote to the bailiffs, claiming that \"rights to the shares of OAO Sibneft held by OAO NK YUKOS are the subject of the dispute and OAO NK YUKOS is unable to exercise its ownership rights to such shares.\"1137 On 13 July 2004, the same former shareholders wrote to the Deputy Minister for Taxes, stating that \"OAO NK YUKOS is not entitled to use the whole block of shares in OAO Sibneft held by it for settlements with its creditors, including with respect to tax liabilities.\"1138 In a further letter dated 16 August 2004, the former shareholders specifically asserted that the Share Purchase Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement constituted \"a single transaction\" and that \"all 92 percent of shares in [Sibneft] that were transferred to [Yukos] under both agreements are in dispute.\"1139\n\nApplication of White Pearl Investments Limited, Kindselia Holdings Limited, Heflinham Holdings Limited, Marthacello Co.

Limited to the Deputy Minister of Taxes and Levies of the Russian Federation, 16 August 2004, Exh. R-559.\n\n954.\n\nDespite these allegations, it is clear to the Tribunal that the Share Purchase Agreement was never formally challenged. The 6 July 2004 letter refers to an LCIA proceeding; yet, the only LCIA proceeding related to Sibneft shares that is in the record in this arbitration is LCIA Arbitration No. 4589, in the context of which Yukos sought damages arising out of the purported termination of the Share Exchange Agreement, but made no claim in relation to the Share Purchase Agreement.1140\n\nLCIA Arbitration No. 4589: *Yukos Oil Company v. Kravin Investments and others*, Statement of Case \u00b6 94, Exh. R-3645.\n\n955.\n\nIn light of these findings, the Tribunal considers the bailiffs' failure to respond in July 2004 to Yukos' settlement offers to be inexcusable. On 2 July 2004, when Yukos first wrote to the bailiffs to request enforcement against its 34.5 percent shareholding in Sibneft, its ownership of these shares had not yet been challenged. The Chukotka court proceedings (challenging the transfer of the 14.5 percent stake) were commenced four days later, on 6 July 2004. This was also the date on which the former Sibneft shareholders, for the first time, wrote to the bailiffs claiming that Yukos was \"unable to exercise its ownership rights\" to the Sibneft shares. For four days, therefore, the bailiffs had no reason to believe that ownership of these shares by Yukos was disputed. Yet the bailiffs did not respond to Yukos' offer during that period or at any time thereafter.\n\n956.\n\nIn addition, after Yukos, on 14 July 2004, reduced its offer to the 20 percent minus one share holding in Sibneft, the only basis for Respondent's assertion that \"the bailiffs had reason to believe that Yukos' title to even this block of proffered shares was in dispute\"1141 were the \"warnings\" received from the former Sibneft shareholders. The Tribunal is not persuaded that mere letters to the bailiffs from a third party asserting a claim to an asset held by the debtor (without asserting this claim vis-\u00e0-vis the debtor itself) can constitute a sufficient reason for the bailiffs to disregard the debtor's request to use this asset for enforcement purposes.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 426.\n\n**ii. Whether Yukos Sought to Enter into Negotiations that are Not Permissible under Russian Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n957.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Yukos management believed erroneously that tax assessments provided an opportunity for a \"business negotiation\" that could end in a \"compromise\".1142 Such negotiations, says Respondent, seeking a reduction, deferral or payment in instalments of tax arrears, are not permitted under Russian law.1143 Specifically, Respondent contends that, once \"a resolution of the highest tax authority or a court judgment has entered into force, the tax authorities and bailiffs cannot reduce the amount of the tax that's due.\"1144 Nor, avers Respondent, can the tax authorities agree to a delay for payment of more than 6 months, or change the term for payment when the entity applying for such a change is the subject of proceedings for a tax offence..1145 Moreover, adds Respondent, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court was justified in rejecting Yukos' request for payment in instalments of its tax arrears due to the absence of exceptional circumstances.1146\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 101, referring to Transcript, Day 10 at 7 (cross-examination of Mr. Theede); Transcript, Day 6 at 110-11 (cross-examination of Mr. Rieger).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 101.\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 270; *see also* Respondent's Closing Slides, p. 299.\n\nTranscript, Day 18 at 270-71; Respondent's Closing Slides, p. 315.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 316-18, referring to Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 12 August 2004, Exh. C-142.\n\n958.\n\nRespondent maintains that a major problem with Yukos' settlement proposals was that the amounts offered were insufficient to cover the tax arrears, fines and interest assessed against Yukos at that time and thus demonstrated that Yukos never intended to pay its tax debts in full.1147\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 292.\n\n959.\n\nRespondent contends that, even if it accepted that Yukos' 20 percent minus one shareholding in Sibneft was formally unencumbered, its value was nevertheless uncertain, since Yukos was unable to offer a controlling block of shares and the public controversy with respect to the shares could affect their market value.1148 The fact that Yukos did not itself sell the Sibneft shares is also proof of their illiquidity.1149 Respondent notes that Yukos' Board, when authorising the sale of the shares in August 2004, expressly acknowledged that \"certain terms of the sale of these stakes may differ from the existing market terms because of the need to sell the assets as soon as possible in order to discharge the Company's tax liabilities.\"1150 When the 20 percent minus one shareholding in Sibneft was tendered on 14 July 2004, it was valued by Yukos at USD 2.3 billion, which was insufficient to cover Yukos' liabilities for the year 2000. The value of the Sibneft shares plus the shares in the other 15 companies offered by Yukos in its letters of 16 September, 24 November and 16 December was also insufficient having regard to Yukos' tax debt assessed in the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions.1151\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 423.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 216, 313.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 295, referring to Minutes No.120-18 of Meeting of Yukos' Board of Directors, 19 August 2004, Exh. C-210.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 308-309.\n\n960.\n\nAs for Mr. Chr\u00e9tien's offer of USD 8 billion to settle the claims for the years 2000-2003, asserts Respondent, it would have covered only about half the amount then assessed against Yukos.1152 The USD 21 billion settlement offer allegedly made by Yukos in October 2004 was also insufficient, submits Respondent, since Yukos' tax liabilities for the years 2000-2004 totalled USD 24.2 billion.1153\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 296.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 896, n.1425.\n\n961.\n\nClaimants deny that Yukos was asking the authorities for a reduction in the amount of the tax arrears that were due.1154 As Mr. Theede testified at the Hearing, Yukos \"never tried to make any kind of proposal that was less than the tax that was due... we didn't try to negotiate the amount; we were willing to pay all the taxes back.\"1155 Mr. Theede further observed that Yukos \"could never in a million years have anticipated the level of taxes that would ultimately be presented to the company; and fines and VAT.\"1156 Claimants submit that the Russian authorities could have ascertained the sincerity of Yukos' intention if only they had bothered to discuss the settlement offers.1157\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 215; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 93.\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 8-12.\n\n*Ibid.* at 9.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 93.\n\n962.\n\nA dialogue, say Claimants, was necessary given the enormous amounts assessed against Yukos. During the Hearing, when asked by a member of the Tribunal: \"when a State assesses taxes and the taxpayer has exhausted administrative and judicial recourse in respect of the assessments, is it normal for the State to enter into a dialogue to negotiate a settlement of the assessments with the taxpayer?,\" Mr. Theede replied that while he was not \"sure what is normal..., there was no way that we would have been able to pay the taxes without being able to talk to the authorities and come to some agreement. We felt like our feet were nailed to the floor and we were being asked to jump. It was very frustrating.\"1158\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 40.\n\n963.\n\nConcerning the value of the Sibneft shares, Claimants assert that they were Yukos' most liquid asset.1159 Yukos' assessment of the value of its 20 percent minus one shareholding at USD 2.3 billion in its letters to the bailiffs was not exaggerated since, as stated above, in the bankruptcy proceedings in 2006, Gazprom acquired these shares for USD 4.1 billion.1160 Under cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Theede acknowledged that Yukos did not try to sell the Sibneft shares itself.1161 He explained that Yukos did not know what the Russian authorities wanted. He testified that if the bailiffs had said to Yukos \"\u2018[w]e don't want the shares, but we will take the $3 billion. You can sell the Sibneft stock without any interference,' [Yukos] would have done that in a second.\"1162\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 92.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 49-50.\n\n*Ibid.* at 48.\n\n964.\n\nClaimants also note that the settlement offers conveyed by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien in July 2004 were well in excess of the tax debt that had been assessed at that time\u2014USD 3.42 billion for the year 2000.1163 At the Hearing, Mr. Theede explained that the USD 8 billion figure was arrived at by considering the 2000 tax assessment of USD 3.4 billion and scaling it back for subsequent years to account for the shorter period over which interest would be calculated.1164 In terms of Yukos' ability to honor the proposal, Mr. Theede confirmed that Yukos would have been in a position to pay the first installment of USD 2 billion in July 2004, and states that, despite the absence of a response from the Tax Ministry, Yukos \"did take immediate action to start accumulating the offshore cash... within a day or two of this letter.\"1165 When asked to explain why the settlement offer remained at the level of USD 8 billion in the proposal of 10 September 2004, when the amount of taxes assessed against Yukos (for 2000 and 2001) had reached USD 7.5 billion, Mr. Theede stated as follows:\n\n[W]hat [the 10 September proposal] is saying is: with what we've already paid, plus the [VAT] that you haven't refunded us, we've nearly paid our 2000 tax arrears. I think it's important to maybe explain... this [VAT], because by the end of the attack that... unrefunded [VAT] amounted to nearly [USD] 5 billion of the total assessment against the company. And what it was is: when you sell oil in Russia, you pay a [VAT] on it; and then, if you export it, you automatically get that [VAT] back.1166\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 92.\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 82-85.\n\n*Ibid.* at 89.\n\n*Ibid.* at 96.\n\n965.\n\nAnd Mr. Theede testified that in October 2004 Yukos made a USD 21 billion offer. Mr. Theede's evidence on this alleged offer was confirmed by Mr. Misamore. However, the Tribunal notes that there is no documentary evidence of this offer in the record.\n\n966.\n\nAs for Respondent's argument that the amounts and payment modalities of tax arrears cannot be negotiated under Russian law, Claimants submit that it is disingenuous, since the Russian Federation has entered into negotiations and agreed settlements of tax assessments with other Russian and international oil companies such as Sibneft, TNK-BP and Rosneft.1167\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 93.\n\n967.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that according to press reports submitted by Claimants Sibneft was able to settle a 1 billion tax arrears claim by paying only 300 million,1168 while the one billion tax arrears claim against TNK-BP was reduced by \"hundreds of million of dollars,\" after a meeting took place between Lord Browne, BP's chief executive, and President Putin.1169 As for Rosneft, the Tribunal notes that its financial statements reveal that, after Rosneft purchased YNG, the Russian authorities approved a restructuring plan allowing it to pay the tax arrears that had been assessed against YNG in February and October 2004 in quarterly payments over a period of 5 years starting in March 2008.1170\n\n*Sibneft Pays Off Tax Claim*, The Moscow Times, 19 April 2005, Exh. C-1418; \"Sibneft \u2018settles its tax demand',\" BBC News, 18 April 2005, Exh. C-752.\n\n*TNK-BP Tax Bill Slashed by Moscow*, Financial Times, 11 August 2005, Exh.

C-378.\n\n968.\n\nClaimants also affirm that Rosneft received a concession from Respondent in the guise of an 83 percent reduction in the amount of YNG's tax arrears and a corresponding 89 percent reduction in fines.1171\n\nMemorial \u00b6 278.\n\n969.\n\nRespondent answers that Yukos' case is \"totally different\" from those of Sibneft or TNK-BP, because there is no evidence that these companies, contrary to Yukos, engaged in \"knowing and longstanding tax evasion\" and lied to the courts and tax authorities. From the limited record available in this arbitration in this respect, it does appear as if these companies cooperated with the tax authorities in order to settle the amount due. Moreover, there is no evidence that the authorities compromised after having reached a final assessment of liability.1172 For Respondent, \"considering the flagrancy of Yukos' violation, the not[o]riety of its failure to accept responsibility and indeed its efforts to undermine tax enforcement, common sense and straightforward deterrent interest would dictate different results.\"1173\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, p. 326.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 327.\n\n970.\n\nRegarding Rosneft, Respondent explains that, unlike Yukos, it was eligible for a \"tax restructuring process\" because it had, also unlike Yukos, been designated as a \"strategic company\" by the Russian Government. According to Mr. Konnov's first expert report, Article 191 of the *Federal Law on Insolvency* \"contemplates a possibility to restructure federal tax debt of certain \u2018strategic' companies in order to prevent their bankruptcy.\"1174 A list of \"strategic\" companies was approved in early 2004, and Rosneft (contrary to Yukos) was eligible for inclusion on the list given its status as a state-owned company.1175\n\nFirst Konnov Report \u00b6 91.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n971.\n\nAt the Hearing, counsel for Respondent provided the following explanation as to the requirements for a \"strategic\" company:\n\nIt was necessary to be State-owned. It was necessary that one of the ministries request that the company qualify to be a strategic company and to undertake responsibilities of a strategic company, and ultimately to be approved by the relevant federal agency, which involved the defence services; and in the case of Rosneft involved committing to supply petroleum products to the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. So these were all things that were not open to Yukos.1176\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 30.\n\n972.\n\nWhile Claimants appeared to suggest at the Hearing that, since \"it's the Government that decides which company is strategic,\" it would have been \"fairly easy\" for Respondent to accept Yukos as a strategic company. The Tribunal notes that no specific requirements for purposes of designating a strategic company were proffered by either side.1177\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 253.\n\n**iii. Whether Russian Law Permits Payment in Kind of Tax Arrears**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n973.\n\nRespondent submits that the Russian Federation could not accept Yukos' shares in Sibneft and other companies as payment because Russian law does not allow a taxpayer to settle its liabilities in kind.1178 Specifically, Article 45(3) of the Russian Tax Code stipulates that \"[t]he obligation to pay taxes/duties shall be executed in the currency of the Russian Federation.\"1179 This defect affected all of Yukos' settlement offers with the exception of those conveyed by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 423.\n\nRussian Tax Code, Article 45, Exh. R-550.\n\n974.\n\nClaimants reply that Respondent misrepresents \"both the legal context and the substance of Yukos' settlement proposals.\"1180 While Article 45(3) of the Russian Tax Code requires the payment of taxes in Russian rubles, Article 45(1) expressly provides that in case of late or incomplete payments, outstanding taxes may be collected through a forced sale of the taxpayer's assets other than cash, as provided for in Articles 47 and 48 of the Russian Tax Code and Article 46 of the *Federal Law \"On Enforcement Proceedings\"*.1181 Respondent itself relies on the latter provision for the proposition that, for the purposes of the settlement of Yukos' alleged tax liabilities, the company's assets seized by the bailiffs were subject to a coercive sale.\n\nReply \u00b6 326.\n\n*Ibid.*, referring to Federal Law No. 119-FZ of 21 July 1997 \"On Enforcement Proceedings\" (as amended), Article 46, Exh. C-1274.\n\n**iv. Concluding Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n975.\n\nHaving reviewed the totality of the evidence and the Parties' representations, the Tribunal is of the view that Yukos' settlement offers represented a good faith attempt by the company to initiate a dialogue with the Russian Federation regarding the payment of Yukos' tax arrears. While it is true that these offers were for less than the total amount of taxes, fines and arrears assessed against Yukos, the Tribunal observes that, at the time when each offer was made, it either would have been sufficient to cover the amounts for which decisions had been issued by the Tax Ministry at the time, or was close enough to those amounts to allow the Russian Federation to assume that Yukos did indeed intend to discharge its tax liabilities. As for Yukos' offer of its 20 percent minus one share holding of Sibneft shares, in the opinion of the Tribunal, since this shareholding was never formally disputed, it should have convinced the Russian Tax authorities that Yukos was serious in wishing to settle its tax liabilities.\n\n976.\n\nRespondent's argument that the Russian Federation does not negotiate tax liabilities is belied by the fact that it agreed to tax settlements with other companies. Given the paucity of evidence before this Tribunal regarding the settlements actually reached by Sibneft and TNK-BP, the Tribunal cannot judge the extent to which their situations were similar to that of Yukos. However, the simple fact that these companies were able to negotiate the reduction of tax arrears initially claimed by the tax authorities suggests to the Tribunal that such negotiations can in fact take place under Russian law and practice.\n\n977.\n\nThus, even if Yukos' settlement offers may not have resolved definitively all of its tax liabilities, the Tribunal sees no valid reason why the Russian Federation, if it sought only to collect taxes (and, presumably, to allow its largest taxpayer to continue in business) would not have reacted more positively to Yukos' settlement offers at the very least to the extent of engaging constructively in discussion.\n\n978.\n\nThe Russian Federation never showed any interest in Yukos' offers. With the exception of the letter of 9 September 2004, the bailiffs never replied to Yukos, never even troubling to explain why they considered its offers inadequate. The Tribunal finds this silence very revealing, particularly in circumstances where the bailiffs' views as to the unacceptability of the offers were based in part on correspondence they had received from a third party (the former Sibneft shareholders), which had not even been copied to Yukos. The settlement offers conveyed by Mr. Chr\u00e9tien, at the end of the day, were also met with silence.\n\n979.\n\nWhen the Russian authorities did provide responses to Yukos' proposals, these were in the nature of blanket rejections. It is manifest that the authorities never seriously considered any one of Yukos' proposals. The only letter from the bailiffs to Yukos (dated 9 September 2004) relies on the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 17 July 2004, which merely addressed the issue of the Sibneft shares, but fails to explain why the shares in the other 15 companies offered by Yukos could not be accepted in payment. The Tribunal notes that the letter has a ring of finality to it, emphasizing as it does \"the right of the bailiff to make the final decision.\"1182 In the entire period from July to December 2004, the Russian authorities did not make a single counter-proposal to Yukos or even state that they were prepared to engage with the taxpayer. Mr. Rieger testified at the Hearing that \"it was like a one way road: making proposals, talking, offering, and... no substantial feedback... no sitting down and willing to discuss.\"1183 This statement aptly describes the impression that the Tribunal garners from the record.\n\nLetter from Mr. Sazanov, Deputy Head of the Bailiffs Department to Mr. Gololobov, 9 September 2004, Exh. C-146.\n\nTranscript, Day 6 at 40.\n\n980.\n\nIn conclusion, Respondent's total failure to engage with any of Yukos' settlement proposals raises significant doubts in the Tribunal's mind as to whether Respondent's true and sole concern in its dealings with Yukos after the tax assesments were issued was the collection of taxes.\n\n**F. THE AUCTION OF YNG**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n981.\n\nAfter having reviewed these futile attempts by Yukos to settle its tax debts to the State, the Tribunal comes to one of the most striking episodes in the saga of Yukos' demise, the December 2004 auction of its core asset, the oil production company Yuganskneftegaz (\" **YNG** \") and the subsequent acquisition of YNG by State-owned Rosneft.\n\n982.\n\nClaimants argue that the auction was a sham, \"carefully orchestrated to achieve the transfer of Yukos' crown jewel to the State at the lowest price that could be achieved while maintaining a fa\u00e7ade of legality.\"1184 Claimants accuse Respondent of having depressed the value of YNG by fabricating USD 4.6 billion in tax claims against the company. They argue that Respondent set a low starting price which ignored both a valuation by Dresdner and Dresdner's advice on how to conduct the auction in order to maximize the sale price. Claimants deny that their own actions contributed to the low price achieved at the auction. They maintain that the sole bidder at the auction, a previously unknown entity called Baikal Finance Group (\" **Baikal** \"), was a dummy that was used to mask the Russian State's interest and involvement in the process.1185\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 97; *see* Press Conference with Russian and Foreign Media, 23 December 2004, Russian President Official Website, Exh. C-422; *see also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 334, 409; Reply \u00b6 293; Claimants' Skeleton \u00b6 45.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 110-14; Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 386-95; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 370-76; Claimants' Skeleton \u00b6\u00b6 40-43.\n\n983.\n\nRespondent answers that the decision to sell YNG to satisfy Yukos' massive debt was a direct consequence of Yukos' misconduct and the only realistic way to collect Yukos' unpaid taxes in circumstances where Yukos had fiercely obstructed audits, resisted payment and attempted to make itself judgment proof.1186 Although YNG was sold during a 10-minute auction attended by two bidders on a Sunday afternoon in the outskirts of Moscow, Respondent observes that it was done in compliance with Russian law. Respondent avers that the price realized\u2014 USD 9.35 billion\u2014was consistent with the formal appraisal conducted by Dresdner and other market estimates, and notes that this price reflected YNG's own tax liabilities.1187 If the price was lower than it might otherwise have been, says Respondent, the fault lies solely with Claimants and Yukos, who sabotaged the auction through a sham bankruptcy proceeding in Texas and published threats of \"a lifetime of litigation\" which kept potential bidders away. Respondent rejects Claimants' theory that Baikal was a veneer for the Russian Government. Rather, Respondent submits that it was a special purpose vehicle associated with Surgutneftegaz. When Baikal suddenly found itself unable to finance its purchase (due to the Temporary Restraining Order (\" **TRO** \") obtained by Yukos in Texas), Rosneft simply seized a commercial opportunity that presented itself as a result of Claimants' misconduct.1188\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 87-121; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 450-527; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 951-1008; Respondent's Skeleton \u00b6\u00b6 36-54.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Deutsche Bank, Project Chekov, December 2004, Slide 6, Exh.

[Rosneft] is a State-owned company. It has insufficient reserves and should increase them. Some other oil companies, such as Yukos, have a surplus of reserves.1189\n\nVideo recording and transcript of meeting of the members of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs with President V. Putin held in the Ekaterininsky Hall, Kremlin, 19 February 2003, Exh. C-1396.\n\n985.\n\nAs will be seen, after having reviewed the totality of the circumstances leading to the YNG auction and the auction itself, the Tribunal concludes that this episode provides yet more compelling evidence that the Russian Federation was not engaged in a true, good faith tax collection exercise but rather was intent on confiscating the most valuable asset of Yukos and effectively transferring it to the Russian State.\n\n986.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its findings are consistent with those of the *RosInvestCo* and *Quasar* tribunals, which found \"many aspects of the YNG auction more than suspect\"1190 and concluded that \"the auction of YNG was rigged.\"1191\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 116, Exh.

Chronology**\n-----------------\n\n987.\n\nAs is evident from the chronology of events recounted in Chapter VIII.B, and as observed by the ECtHR, the Russian authorities \"were unyieldingly inflexible as to the pace of the enforcement proceedings, acting very swiftly.\"1192 This chronology reviews the key events as of the date when the sale of YNG was announced to the auction itself on 19 December 2004, and the transfer of the YNG shares to the Russian State-owned Rosneft three days later on 22 December.\n\nECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6 656, Exh.

Essentially, Rosneft, a 100% state owned company, has bought the well-known asset Yuganskneftegaz. That is the story. In my view, everything was done according to the best market rules. As I have said, I think it was at a press conference in Germany, a state-owned company or, rather companies with 100% state capital, just as any other market players, have the right to do so and, as it emerged, exercised it.\n\nNow what would I like to say in this context? You all know only too well how the privatisation drive was carried out in this country in the early 90s and, how, using all sorts of stratagems, some of them in breach even of the then current legislation, many market players received state property worth many billions. Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1011.\n\nThe Tribunal now returns to the Parties' central arguments in respect of the YNG auction which it summarized at the outset of this Chapter and will seek to determine whether the events which it has traversed are consistent with a genuine attempt by the Russian Federation to collect taxes, or whether they disclose that the auction was rigged so as to enable YNG to fall into the hands of the State through the veneer of a legitimate process. The Tribunal will review, in turn, (a) the fairness of the price achieved at the auction, (b) the role of Baikal and its acquisition by Rosneft, and (c) the impact of the YNG auction on the future of Yukos.\n\n**(a) Did the Auction Price Reflect the True Value of YNG; If not, was Either Party Responsible for the Price Reduction?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1012.\n\nThe Parties have different views as to whether the sale price of USD 9.35 billion reflected the fair value of YNG. Claimants argue that if the purpose of the auction had been to collect revenues in order to pay legitimate tax debts, the Russian Federation would have been expected to make every effort to maximize the proceeds. Instead, Claimants allege that Russia took steps to reduce the price so that it could, via Rosneft, acquire YNG for a derisory amount, and still be able to enforce the remaining tax liabilities against other Yukos assets.1246 Respondent maintains that the price for which YNG was acquired was not a \"knock down\" price but, to the extent it was, only Yukos was to blame.1247\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 101.\n\nRespondent's Closing Sides, pp. 354-65.\n\n1013.\n\nClaimants complain that the auction price paid by Baikal represented less than half of the enterprise value of YNG, which the Dresdner Valuation Report had assessed to be in the range of USD 18.6-21.1 billion. Respondent answers that other contemporaneous valuations, including Morgan Stanley's, estimated a much lower value (USD 8.9 billion).1248 Respondent also recalls that it was necessary to adjust the value of the enterprise to account for the fact that only the 76.79 percent stake of Yukos in YNG was being auctioned. Respondent put these issues to Dr. Illarionov, when challenging his claim that the price achieved was \"well below even the most conservative estimates prepared by experts.\"1249 Dr. Illarionov admitted that his figure of USD 14.7-17.3 billion was based on a full enterprise value that did not take into account the tax liabilities.1250 At the end of his cross-examination, however, Dr. Illarionov maintained that he did not think \"this discount rate of 60% that has been applied by the Russian authorities produces a number that [he] would consider... a legitimate valuation.\"1251\n\n*See* Dresdner Valuation Report; *see also YNG Sale: A Shock and Awe Negotiating Tactic?,* Morgan Stanley Equity Research Report on Yukos, 22 July 2004, Exh.

The tax liabilities, say Claimants, related to transfer pricing and were applied to oil trading revenue that had already been re-attributed to Yukos, thus resulting in double taxation.1253 Respondent argues that YNG's transfer pricing issues had arisen over many years and that the allegation of double taxation was misconceived. Respondent says the assessments were made in accordance with Russian law, since Yukos had forced YNG to sell oil to the trading companies at very low prices which exposed it to liability.1254\n\nDresdner Summary Letter, p. 6.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 269-75; Reply \u00b6 266.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 958-60; First Konnov Report \u00b6\u00b6 86-92.\n\n1015.\n\nClaimants also argue that the sale price was affected by the nature and speed of the process adopted by the Russian authorities. While it is common ground that the time frame for the auction was within the minimum statutory requirements, Claimants recall that the Government ignored Dresdner's recommendation for a two-stage auction process to allow for proper due diligence, and its warning that failure to provide access to full information could lead to a reduction in the number of potential purchasers and the price they would be willing to pay.1255 No due diligence was provided beyond a \"data room\" that consisted of the report itself, auction rules and 89 pages of additional documents. Respondent answers that Russian law requires no due diligence, that Gazpromneft was still able to undertake a thorough assessment, and that any due diligence issue was due to Yukos' lack of cooperation with Dresdner.1256\n\nDresdner Valuation Report \u00b6\u00b6 11.2, 12.8.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 978-81.\n\n1016.\n\nThe bare minimum time frame meant that the auction was conducted on a Sunday, which Dr. Illarionov described as \"highly unusual... since the Russian Government agencies are closed on Saturdays and Sundays.\"1257 Respondent's suggestion at the Hearing that Sunday was chosen to reduce the impact of Moscow's traffic was scoffed at by Claimants as \"absurd.\"1258\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 104; *see* Transcript, Day 7 at 137-40.\n\n1017.\n\nClaimants conclude that by any measure \"the auction process was perfunctory and did not involve genuine competition.\"1259 Although the auction process complied with the letter of Russian legislation,1260 Claimants insist that it is not a defence to an expropriation claim under international law that the State complied with its own domestic law.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6109.\n\nA point also noted in the ECtHR Yukos Judgment. *See* ECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6 647, Exh.

Respondent adds that Yukos caused YNG to default on at least USD 586 million of mineral extraction tax, imperilling its oil licenses. Yukos' press service issued a statement on 11 October 2004 attributing the non-payment of mineral extraction tax to YNG's accounts having been frozen.1263\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 955.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 966.\n\n*Yuganskneftegaz may lose licenses in three months*, RIA Novosti, 11 October 2004, Exh.

Dr. Illarionov was cross-examined about Claimants' media campaigns aimed at warding off prospective bidders from the auction.1267 When he was asked whether these statements likely encouraged or discouraged bidders from participating in the auction, he answered that Gazpromneft and Baikal probably \"felt very well protected, maybe by the Russian Government.\"1268\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 982; *see Yukos Says Asset Sale Could Prove Fatal Blow*, NY Times, 23 July 2004, Exh.

The amount of the tax liabilities imposed which were subtracted from the Dresdner valuation cannot be justified. In addition, in the view of the Tribunal, the failure by YNG to pay its mineral extraction tax was inextricably linked to the asset freeze of Yukos' cash.\n\n1022.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the Russian authorities deliberately ignored the advice of Dresdner that haste in carrying out the auction could decrease the price. The Tribunal notes that the *Quasar* tribunal criticized Respondent's decision to hold the auction only one month after its announcement, and found that \"the auction procedure was highly irregular in a number of ways that all relate to the extraordinary speed with which it was conducted.\"1269\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 117, Exh. R-3383.\n\n1023.\n\nWhile the Tribunal accepts, as did the *RosInvestCo* and *Quasar* tribunals,1270 that the actions of Claimants in warding off prospective buyers through a media campaign and the TRO may have deterred some potential buyers and may have resulted in a low winning bid,1271 these actions, at the end of the day, had no relevant impact on the bankruptcy of Yukos.1272 The circumstances surrounding the appearance and disappearance of Baikal make the auction process seem all the more questionable to the Tribunal. The Tribunal now turns to these events.\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 522, Exh. C-1049 (accepting that \"had Claimant not discouraged international bidders and without the bankruptcy proceedings in the United States, more bidders might have participated, and that the process seems to have been conducted within the limits of discretion awarded by Russian law\"); *Quasar* \u00b6115, Exh. R-3383 (the tribunal was \"receptive to the Respondent's argument that some of the blame associated with the poor turnout and low winning bid at the YNG auction should be attributed to the Claimants for their media campaign... and for initiating bankruptcy proceedings... that led to the TRO\" and to the \"argument that Yukos' actions reasonably could have deterred potential bidders from participating in the YNG auction\") Both tribunals contrasted these findings with their serious doubts about the bona fide nature of the auction, stemming largely from the dubious identity of Baikal and the circumstances of its acquisition by Rosneft.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the Russian Justice Minister on 14 October 2004, in a commentary on the auction price, is reported to have said that this value \"takes into account the \u2018high risk to a potential buyer' of the Yukos asset.\" *In the Yukos Saga, Yet Another Gloomy Chapter*, The Wall Street Journal (Europe), 14 October 2004, Exh. C-713.\n\n*See* Chapter X.E at paragraph 1625.\n\n**(b) Who was Behind Baikal and were They a Front for the Russian State?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1024.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, one of the most opaque facets of the YNG auction is the identity of Baikal, the sole and successful bidder at the auction which was acquired by State-owned Rosneft three days after its successful bid. Baikal did not exist until less than two weeks before the YNG auction. It was obviously a vehicle created solely for the purpose of bidding for YNG at the auction. As noted earlier, it was incorporated with capital of USD 359.\n\n1025.\n\nDuring the closing oral arguments, the Chairman told Respondent's counsel: \"you still have to convince us that Baikalfinance... was not a sham company. That's your challenge.\"1273\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 33.\n\n1026.\n\nRespondent sought to explain that Baikal was a special purpose vehicle established strictly for bidding at the auction. Respondent added that \"it was well known that those lying behind Baikal was [sic] Surgutneftegaz.\"1274 Respondent stated that Baikal was represented at the auction by two managers of Surgutneftegaz, Mr. Igor Minibayev and Ms. Valentina Komarova. Ms. Valentina Davletgareeva, the person who incorporated Baikal, was also connected to companies affiliated with Surgutneftegaz. According to Counsel for Respondent, she sold 100 percent of her interest in Baikal to Makoil, a company owned in part by a secretary to the Board of Surgutneftegaz.1275 Accordingly, Respondent submits that \"all of those who had a connection to the company in a formal manner or who were identified with it can be identified as having significant positions or relationships with respect to Surgutneftegaz.\"1276 Baikal's Tver office was close to a subsidiary of Surgutneftegaz, which in turn was located directly across the river from YNG.1277 In addition, there had been reports in the media since September 2004 that Surgutneftegaz was interested in the auction.1278\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 151; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 36, 1002, 1007.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1002 nn.1690-91.\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 151; Respondent's Closing Slides, pp. 772-80.\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 21 at 151, Respondent's Closing Sides, pp. 782, 790.\n\n*Surgut drops first hint of interest in Yukos assets*, AFP, 28 September 2004, Exh. C-704 (stating that \"President Vladimir Putin and his entourage of secret service agents and Soviet era officials would be delighted with the transaction\").\n\n1027.\n\nClaimants insist that, even accepting Respondent's theory that Baikal was a front for Surgutneftegaz, the \"facts in the record... compel the conclusion that Baikal served the interests of the State, and any involvement of Surgut, a company known to be \u2018friendly with the Kremlin', was solely to mask the State's involvement.\"1279\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 110 (footnote omitted).\n\n1028.\n\nThe fact that Baikal was incorporated only a few weeks before the auction and had the minimum-required capital is, according to Respondent, irrelevant. The other three entities who had antimonopoly clearance for the auction were also relatively new companies with little capital. Respondent alleged that Baikal paid the USD 1.77 billion deposit itself after having received the financing from a third party.1280 Respondent submitted that Surgutneftegaz had sufficient resources to enable Baikal Finance to pay the deposit, but not the full purchase price without recourse to international capital markets.1281 Respondent's theory is that such financing was foreclosed on the day of the auction by the TRO, leaving Baikal (and Surgutneftegaz) with a stark choice of defaulting on the obligation to pay the balance, and lose the USD 1.77 billion deposit, or find someone else to buy the asset.1282 On the other hand, Respondent's counsel agreed that the transaction \"turned out to be very productive for Rosneft; there's no question about it.\"1283\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 34.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 34-35.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 34-35, 43.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 35.\n\n1029.\n\nClaimants contend that the nature and speed of events that followed the auction cannot be reconciled with Respondent's suggestion that Rosneft's acquisition of Baikal was entirely fortuitous and unplanned. On 20 December 2004, the day after the auction, they point out that Rosneft sought and obtained, in less than a day, antimonopoly clearance to acquire Baikal.1284 Respondent's attempts to explain these events by pointing out that Rosneft and the authorities were familiar with such filings confirm, according to Claimants, that the authorities did not perform even a perfunctory review of the 13-page application and its 98 pages of attachments.1285\n\nRosneft's request to Federal Antimonopoly Service to approve acquisition of a 100 percent interest in Baikal, 20 December 2004, Exh.

R-3814.\n\n1030.\n\nClaimants also refer to the fact that Rosneft filed for antimonopoly clearance on a Monday, the day after the auction. Thus, Respondent's allegation that Surgutneftegaz was obliged to sell \"the bid\" because the TRO prevented it from accessing financing rings hollow since Surgutneftegaz would have needed to seek and be denied financing by every commercial bank on the Sunday of the auction. Claimants ask whether Baikal would have risked a deposit of USD 1.77 billion by making a bid without first having financing in place.1286\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 112.\n\n1031.\n\nRespondent claims Rosneft had no ownership interest in Baikal prior to the auction, and that Rosneft put together a finance package for the purchase of Baikal after the auction, on an emergency basis, and, in so doing, even breached covenants related to its prior borrowings.\n\n1032.\n\nWhen Rosneft completed the acquisition of YNG on 22 December 2004, using funds borrowed from State-owned banks, the transaction was described in the Russian Press as \"the State budget via a State bank help[ing] a State company acquire from the State a very profitable asset.\"1287 Claimants urge the Tribunal to reach the \"inescapable conclusion\"1288 that it was determined in advance that Rosneft would acquire YNG, and that the elaborate sham involving Baikal was set up to mask the State's involvement and thus reduce legal risks.\n\n*From the Editors: The State Whirligig*, Vedomosti, 15 August 2005, Exh. C-764.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 113.\n\n1033.\n\nClaimants also submit that the events *after* the auction speak for themselves. YNG's tax debts were reduced from USD 4 billion to less than a billion. In addition, after having filed claims by YNG of almost USD 10 billion in Yukos' bankruptcy, the net cost to Rosneft for the purchase of Yukos' jewel was, according to Claimants, less than USD 3 billion. Thus, bearing in mind that in 2006 Rosneft's IPO valued YNG at USD 55.78 billion, Rosneft's description of the transaction as \"the most monumental bargain in Russia's modern history\" was, conclude Claimants, an understatement.1289\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 114; *see* \"Place in economy of Russia, Rosneft: About company,\" Rosneft Website, p. 14, Exh. C-381.\n\n1034.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *RosInvestCo* tribunal in reaching its conclusion that the auction was rigged observed that \"the winning bidder was a completely unknown company just created before the auction and disappearing right after the auction and assigning its interests to Ru[ss]ian state-owned Rosneft.\"1290 To the *RosInvestCo* tribunal, \"[t]he circumstances that this bidder was further found to have no real offices and nevertheless was able to raise the deposit in the range of US$ 1.7 billion and then the purchase price with the apparent help of Rosneft further contribute to the impression that the scheme was set up under the control of respondent to bring Yukos' assets under Respondent's control.\"1291\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 523, Exh. C-1049.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1035.\n\nThe identity of Baikal was also of \"[p]aramount\"1292 concern for the *Quasar* tribunal, which described its unease with the circumstances of Baikal's purchase as follows:\n\nan unknown entity, placed a $9.3 billion, uncontested winning bid for YNG, the largest oil production company in Russia, and was then acquired a mere three days later by state-owned Rosneft, even before payment of the purchase price was due.... The Respondent's argument... to the effect that [the] YNG auction was of a public nature, and that [Baikal] bid $500 million above the starting price, are insufficient to remove the suspicion of collusion, particularly when [Baikal] was quickly taken over by Rosneft before payment of the purchase price was due.1293\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 118, Exh. R-3383.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1036.\n\nHaving assessed the evidence with respect to the identity and role of Baikal, and the timing and nature of Rosneft's acquisition of that company, this Tribunal agrees with the conclusions of the *RosInvestCo* and *Quasar* tribunals that the YNG auction was rigged.\n\n1037.\n\nThe additional evidence placed before this Tribunal connecting Baikal to Surgutneftegez does not erase the suspicion that Baikal was created by instruments of Respondent in order to facilitate the acquisition of YNG by State-owned Rosneft. The statement by Rosneft that the purchase was a \"monumental bargain\", the remarks by President Putin acknowledging that the State had looked after the State's interest1294 by increasing its reserves, and the good fortunes of YNG once it was in the hands of a State-owned company all support the Tribunal's conclusion that the auction of YNG was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the State to acquire Yukos' most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos. In short, it was in effect a devious and calculated expropriation by Respondent of YNG.\n\nPress Statement and Answers to Questions Following Russian-German Bilateral Consultations, Russian President Official Website, 21 December 2004, p. 2, Exh.

On the basis of the totality of the evidence and, in particular, the testimony of Messrs. Misamore and Theede and Dr. Illarionov, the Tribunal answers that question in the affirmative.\n\nECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6 653; *Yukos Says Asset Sale Could Prove Fatal Blow*, NY Times, 23 July 2004, Exh.

C-698.\n\n1039.\n\nMr. Misamore testified that with the auction of YNG, \"Yukos lost over 60% of its total production capacity.\" This \"meant a massive downsizing of the company's activities.\" Mr. Misamore hoped it \"was not the end of the company,\" and Yukos started 2005 on the basis that it would carry on operations on a smaller scale with the remaining production assets and refineries. However, \"it soon became evident there was little that Yukos' management could do to protect the company's Russian assets. Despite our best efforts to challenge the tax reassessments, the Russian courts were biased against us. Bankruptcy proceedings in Russia were increasingly likely and the Yuganskneftegaz auction had highlighted the real risk that company assets would be transferred to State-owned entities at substantial undervalue.\"1296\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\n1040.\n\nMr. Theede considered the announcement of the auction as the point in time when \"the die was finally cast\" for Yukos. The auction put an end to settlement discussions with the Russian Government. He considered the sale of YNG at a \"grossly undervalued price through a sham auction\" to be a \"clear theft by the Russian State,\" which became all the more obvious in the context of the IPO by Rosneft in July 2006.1297\n\nTheede WS \u00b6 25-27 (evoking the Rosneft IPO as a moment \"where Rosneft was valued at approximately US $ 80 billion, with YNG accounting for 70% of its crude oil production\").\n\n1041.\n\nDr. Illarionov described the confiscation of YNG as the \"culminating point of th[e] attack\" on Yukos, following which the Russian authorities took no further steps to satisfy Yukos' alleged tax debts. Such conduct was inconsistent with a genuine attempt to collect taxes.1298\n\nIllarionov WS \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n1042.\n\nAt the time, Claimant YUL and its subsidiaries (including Hulley), as majority shareholders of Yukos, acknowledged that they had \"lost the power to govern the financial and operating policies of Yukos so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\"1299 It was noted in the 2004 Annual Report for YUL that Yukos had become \"incapable of operating as a business as evidenced by the forced sale of [YNG].\"1300\n\nYUL (and its subsidiaries), Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2004, p. 2, Exh. R-4229. Deloitte, auditors of YUL, in their report on the financial statements, after referring to the auction of YNG, wrote: \"These events indicate a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on Yukos's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.\" *Ibid*. at 3.\n\n*Ibid*. at 2.\n\n1043.\n\nThe effect of the auction on Yukos' prospects did not escape the attention of the ECtHR, which acknowledged that YNG had been Yukos' \"only hope of survival.\"1301 It was \"rather obvious\" to the ECtHR that the choice of YNG as the first Yukos asset to be auctioned to satisfy Yukos' tax debts was \"capable of dealing a fatal blow to its ability to survive the tax claims and to continue its existence.\"1302 This Tribunal agrees. This Tribunal also agrees with the *Quasar* tribunal's characterization of the seizure of YNG as an extreme measure capable of \"drastic\" consequences for Yukos.1303\n\nECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6 654.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 653.\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 116, Exh.

The dim prospects of resuscitation of Yukos after the \"fatal blow\" of the YNG auction are discussed in the next chapter on Bankruptcy.\n\n**G. THE BANKRUPTCY OF YUKOS**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1045.\n\nClaimants' case is that Yukos' bankruptcy, announced by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on 4 August 2006 and followed by the removal of Yukos from the companies' register on 21 November 2007, was the \"final act of the destruction of the Company by the Russian Federation and the expropriation of its assets for the sole benefit of the Russian State and State-owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom.\"1304 Claimants allege that Respondent \"instigated\" a syndicate of western banks led by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (the \" **Western Banks** \")1305 to commence bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos based on Yukos' default under a loan agreement concluded between Yukos and the Western Banks for the purposes of funding the Sibneft merger.1306 Claimants contend that Respondent ensured, through the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings and discriminatory treatment of bankruptcy claims, that the Russian State and Rosneft would hold over 97 percent of the alleged claims against Yukos in the bankruptcy.1307 Having made certain that Yukos' proposed Rehabilitation Plan would be rejected at the general creditors' meeting, the Russian Federation completed its expropriation scheme by auctioning Yukos' remaining assets. Through the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos, the Russian State directly received more than 60.5 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds and, indirectly, through Rosneft, received more than 39.21 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds and all of Yukos' main production assets.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 411-13.\n\nThe Western Banks included BNP Paribas S.A., Citibank N.A., Commerzbank Akziengesellschaft, Calyon S.A., Deutsche Bank A.G., Hillside Apex Fund Limited, ING Bank N.V., KBC Bank N.V., Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale S.A., Stark Trading, Shepherd Investments International Limited, Thames River Traditional Funds PLC (High Income Fund), UFJ (Holland) N.V., and V.R.

Moreover, Respondent argues that the bankruptcy proceedings are irrelevant to the Tribunal's determination because the conduct that directly caused Yukos' liquidation\u2014the initiation of Yukos' bankruptcy and the vote to liquidate Yukos\u2014is either not attributable to Respondent or not an exercise of its sovereign power. Respondent's case is that \"the insolvency of the Yukos holding company was the consequence of the Oligarchs' and Yukos' management's disastrous strategy of tax evasion, resistance to and obstruction of the collection of overdue taxes, self imposition of massive non-tax and intercompany liabilities on the company, and failure to draw on Yukos' ample offshore assets.\"1308\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 445.\n\n**2. Chronology**\n-----------------\n\n**(a) The Initiation of the Bankruptcy**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1047.\n\nThe initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos is inextricably tied up in the history of two loans connected with the Sibneft merger, one from the Western Banks (\" **A Loan** \") and the other from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (\" **B Loan** \"). It is therefore important to review the key facts relating to each of those loans.\n\n1048.\n\nFor purposes of funding the Sibneft merger, Yukos entered into two loan agreements. The A Loan consisted of USD 1 billion borrowed by Yukos from the Western Banks, which was secured by certain of Yukos' oil export contracts and by YNG. This loan was entered into on 24 September 2003.1309\n\nMemorial \u00b6 374, Guarantee between YNG and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 24 May 2004, Exh. R-581.\n\n1049.\n\nThe B Loan consisted of USD 1.6 billion borrowed by Yukos from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which was fully collateralized in cash by GML, Yukos' ultimate parent company. This loan was entered into on 30 September 2003.1310\n\nB Loan Agreement, 30 September 2003, Exh. R-468.\n\n1050.\n\nOn 3 October 2003, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale drew on the collateral under the B Loan, making GML the lender. GML's rights were then assigned to Moravel, which was GML's wholly-owned indirect subsidiary in Cyprus.1311\n\n*Yukos Oil Company Arranges 1.6 Billion Loan*, Yukos Press Release, 6 October 2003, Exh.

Following this development, the Western Banks notified Yukos that they would not demand immediate payment, but would instead rely on the security supporting the A Loan, namely payments through the proceeds of export sales of crude oil.1312\n\nAppeal Resolution of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 29 June 2004, Exh.

C-122; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 118.\n\n1052.\n\nSoon after, however, as described in the previous chapter, the tax authorities seized and auctioned YNG, depriving Yukos of its primary oil producing asset. Claimants contend that when YNG was taken from Yukos in December 2004, YNG stopped shipping oil under the export contracts and \"[i]t was thus the actions of the Russian Federation, not Yukos, which obstructed the payment of [the A Loan].\"1313\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 118.\n\n1053.\n\nSince Yukos ceased making payments under the A Loan, the Western Banks brought a claim against Yukos for approximately USD 472.8 million, plus interest under the A Loan. The claim was recognized by the High Court of England and Wales on 24 June 2005 (\" **English Judgment** \").1314 Respondent contends that, by this time, Yukos had already paid Moravel over USD 1 billion under the B Loan, and thus had more than enough cash to have repaid the Western Banks in full under the A Loan.\n\n*BNP Paribas v. Yukos Oil Company*, High Court of England and Wales, Judgment, 24 June 2005, Exh. R-455 (hereinafter \"English Judgment\").\n\n1054.\n\nDuring this same time period, Yukos management implemented two restructurings that transferred Yukos' non-Russian assets, previously held through Yukos' wholly-owned Dutch and Armenian subsidiaries Yukos Finance and Yukos CIS into two \"stichting administratiekantoor\".\n\n1055.\n\nA stichting is a Dutch \"foundation.\"1315 It does not have members or shareholders. All management powers are vested in a board of directors, subject only to the stichting's articles of association and Dutch law.1316 In the case of a stichting administratiekantoor or \"foundation trust,\" the stichting issues depository receipts for shares in exchange for shares transferred to it.1317 This trust-like structure separates legal ownership and beneficial ownership: the stichting is the legal owner of the shares and the holder of the depositary receipts for shares is the beneficial owner of the shares.1318\n\nDutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) art. 285(2), Exh.

(\" **Small World** \"),1320 another Dutch company wholly-owned by Wincanton.

Respondent puts particular emphasis on proceedings in Dutch courts, where the Western Banks attempted to enforce the English Judgment.1326 On 15 July 2005, the Western Banks petitioned the District Court of Amsterdam to enforce the English Judgment, and to issue a judgment permitting the sale and transfer of Yukos' share interest in Yukos Finance.1327 The Western Banks informed the court that the creation of the Stichtings had rendered Yukos' shares in Yukos Finance, over which the Western Banks had obtained a prejudgment attachment, \"worthless\" and \"more or less unsellable.\"1328 Respondent asserts that the Western Banks' failure to enforce the English Judgment in the Netherlands was \"the death knell of Yukos' pretense of cooperation in its negotiations with the syndicate.\"1329\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1073-75; English Judgment, Exh.

Reydik, 22 September 2005, Exh. C-301.\n\n1062.\n\nThe Western Banks proceeded to seek to enforce the English Judgment against Yukos in Russia. The Western Banks succeeded in the first instance, before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, but the Court's favourable ruling (issued on 28 September 2005) was reversed on \"procedural\" grounds by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District on 5 December 2005.\n\n1063.\n\nFollowing the unfavourable decision by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District, the Western Banks entered into a confidential sale agreement with Rosneft (\" **Confidential Sale Agreement** \").1331\n\nSale Agreement Relating To Certain Rights And Benefits Arising Under A Credit Agreement dated 24 September 2003 Between, Amongst Others, \"Yukos Oil Company\" and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA, 13 December 2005, Exh. C-300 (hereinafter \"Confidential Sale Agreement\").\n\n1064.\n\nPursuant to this Confidential Sale Agreement, Rosneft agreed to satisfy the outstanding debt owed by Yukos to the Western Banks (the outstanding principal being at the time USD 455,124,215.03), in exchange for the assignment of the banks' rights of claim against Yukos under the A Loan to Rosneft.1332\n\n*Ibid*, p. 4.\n\n1065.\n\nSignificantly, the payment of the purchase price by Rosneft was predicated upon the Western Banks agreeing to take the steps described in Schedule 8 of the Confidential Sale Agreement, entitled \"Application For Bankruptcy.\" Schedule 8 sets out the Western Banks' obligations under three steps: \"1. Proceedings on recognition and enforcement of the English Judgment in Russia (the \u2018Enforcement Case')\"; \"2. Execution proceedings against the Borrower [ *i.e.*, Yukos] (based on the Enforcement Case) (the \u2018Execution Proceedings')\"; and \"3. Bankruptcy proceedings against the Borrower.1333\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 37-38.\n\n1066.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Confidential Sale Agreement between the Western Banks and Rosneft, the enforcement of the A Loan was back before the Russian courts. On 21 December 2005, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally recognized the English Judgment against Yukos in favour of the Western Banks and issued a writ of enforcement with respect to the judgment.\n\n1067.\n\nOn 29 December 2005, the Western Banks submitted the enforcement writ to the bailiffs, who then initiated enforcement proceedings to recover from Yukos the amounts ordered under the English Judgment, namely USD 455,124,214.99 in principal and USD 9,459,143.18 in interest. These enforcement proceedings failed. Claimants assert that they were bound to fail due to the seizure of Yukos' assets, which had been imposed since July 2004.\n\n1068.\n\nThe order of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that recognized the English Judgment was challenged by Yukos, and upheld by the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow District. In its decision of 2 March 2006, the Federal Arbitrazh Court reasoned as follows:\n\nWhen re-examining the case, the Court did comply with the directions given by the cassation Resolution of December 5, 2005. The Court fully and comprehensively reviewed the circumstances of the case. Its conclusions on the application of legal rules are consistent with the established circumstances and evidence in the case.1334\n\nResolution of the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District, 2 March 2006, p. 4, Exh.

At that meeting, Yukos' creditors would, under the options available under Russian Bankruptcy Law, vote either in favour of a Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos or for the alternative of a liquidation of Yukos.\n\n1078.\n\nIn anticipation of these steps, on 1 June 2006, Yukos convened an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting and approved, by majority vote, the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos' management.1344 Also, the shareholders appointed Mr. Osborne as their representative in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nMinutes of Extraordinary General Meeting of Yukos' Shareholders held on 1 June 2006, Exh. C-311.\n\n1079.\n\nClaimants' Rehabilitation Plan was based on, *inter alia* :1345\n\ni) The remaining assets valued at USD 31 billion exceeding the USD 29.5 billion in tax claims filed with Mr. Rebgun;\n\nii) a two year program to pay off the claims in bankruptcy;\n\niii) the creation of a \"Cash Pool separate from the Company,\" funded by constant cash flows generated by Yukos' production, refining and marketing subsidiaries (approximately USD 3-3.5 billion of annual Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortification (\" **EBITDA** \");\n\niv) the sale of non-core assets: approximately USD 8.9 billion from the sale of Russian assets (20 percent stock of Sibneft ordinary shares, approximately USD 4.2 billion; 23.7 percent of YNG's outstanding share capital in the form of preferred shares (estimated at USD 3.6 billion); 100 percent of shares in Arctic Gas, approximately USD 1.1 billion) and approximately USD 1.5 billion from foreign assets (from the sale of its 53.7 percent stake in Lithuanian oil company Mazeikiu Nafta and 49 percent stock in Slovakian oil transport major Transpetrol); and\n\nv) supplementing the Cash Pool with amounts awarded in pending international arbitrations and Russian litigation where Yukos was seeking approximately USD 18 billion.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 458; Letter from Fulbright & Jaworski LLP to Chadbourne & Parke LLP, 1 June 2006, enclosing Yukos' Outline of Proposed Financial Rehabilitation Plan, Exh.

The Court decided that Yukos, not the trading companies, was liable to pay for the purchased oil. Thus, YNG's registered claims (Rosneft's) were USD 4.42 billion (including penalties) or 22.16 percent of the claims admitted into the bankruptcy proceedings at the time.1352\n\nResolutions of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, 31 August 2006 and 7 September 2006, Exh.

Creditors were offered two alternative scenarios: (1) the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos' management; and (2) the Analysis of Yukos' Financial Situation proposed by Mr. Rebgun. At the request of Federal Taxation Service, the meeting was adjourned to 25 July 2006 to allow Mr. Rebgun to complete his Analysis with a separate exhibit analyzing the possibility of Yukos' breakeven activities.1353\n\nAnalysis of Yukos' Financial Situation, 2006, Exh.

Instead, Mr. Rebgun concluded that Yukos' remaining assets, totalling approximately USD 17.75 billion after a deduction of a 24 percent profit tax, were not sufficient to cover the USD 18.3 billion of registered bankruptcy claims. On this basis, Mr. Rebgun recommended that Yukos be declared bankrupt and that receivership proceedings against Yukos be initiated.1354\n\nSummary Analysis of the Debtor's Financial Situation submitted by Mr. Rebgun to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in the Chapter 15 Case as Exhibit B to his Status Report of 7 August 2006, pp. 7-8, Exh.

Twenty-four creditors were admitted as voting participants to the creditors' meeting. The Tribunal notes that Respondent, through the Federal Taxation Service, and indirectly through Rosneft (which had acquired the Western Banks' claim under the A Loan) and YNG (now Rosneft's subsidiary), had 93.87% of the votes.1355\n\nProtocol of the First Meeting of Yukos' Creditors held on 20 July 2006, 25 July 2006, Exh.

These claims, worth USD 5.5 billion, were for alleged \"lost profits\" during 2000 to 2003.

The Tribunal observes that Respondent held (directly or through Rosneft) 97.67 percent of all claims against Yukos and received (directly or through Rosneft) approximately 99.71 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds.1365 The most important assets were auctioned off as follows:1366\n\n\u2022 Lot 1 (27 March 2007): remainder of Yukos' stake (9.44 percent) in YNG sold to Rosneft, acting through its indirect subsidiary OOO RN-Razvitiye, for USD 7.59 billion;\n\n\u2022 Lot 2 (4 April 2007): 20 percent minus 1 share in Gazpromneft (ex-Sibneft), Urengoil and Arctic Gas sold to OOO EniNeftegaz (the Russian subsidiary of Italian companies Eni (60 percent) and Enel (40 percent)) for USD 5.83 billion; transferred to Gazprom in 2009; immediately announced that EniNeftegaz would cede control of the assets to Gazprom under option agreements signed prior to the auction.\n\n\u2022 Lot 5 (18 April 2007): Manoil sold to Rosneft.\n\n\u2022 Lot 10 (3 May 2007): Tomskneft, Achinsk, Angarsk, East Siberian and Strezhevskoy sold to Rosneft (via Neft-Aktiv) for $6.82 billion.\n\n\u2022 Lot 11 (10 May 2007): Samaraneftegaz, Syzran, Novokuybyshevsk and Kuybyshev sold to Rosneft for USD 6.4 billion.\n\nReceiver's Report, pp. 30-43, Exh.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1100.\n\nIn broad terms, Claimants allege that the Russian Federation decided to \"push Yukos into bankruptcy in order to redistribute its remaining assets.\" In their Memorial, Claimants set out what they characterized as Russia's orchestrated plan to bankrupt and liquidate Yukos:\n\nThe Russian Federation ensured, through the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings at the behest of Rosneft and using the cover of a consortium of Western banks (1), and through the biased and discriminatory conduct of the proceedings by its courts, that the Russian State and Rosneft would hold over 97% of the alleged claims against Yukos in the bankruptcy (2). Having also made certain that Yukos' rehabilitation plan would be rejected (3), the Russian Federation completed its expropriation scheme by auctioning the Company's remaining assets. As a result of the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos, the Russian State received directly more than 60.5% of the bankruptcy proceeds and, through Rosneft, more than 39.21% of the bankruptcy proceeds and all of Yukos' main production assets (4).1372\n\nMemorial \u00b6 412.\n\n1101.\n\nRespondent rejects this suggestion, and argues instead that it was Yukos' management that forced the company into bankruptcy:\n\n[T]he bankruptcy and ultimately the liquidation of Yukos was not the aim or the result of a massive, global plot orchestrated by the Russian Government, but rather the inevitable consequence of the consistent and repeated lawless and reckless misconduct of the Oligarchs and the Yukos management they installed to conduct their\u2014including Claimants'\u2014investment.1373\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 540.\n\n1102.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"Claimants have failed to establish their primary contentions regarding Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings: that the bankruptcy was instigated \u2018by the Russian Federation through State-owned Rosneft,' that \u2018the only logic behind the decision to liquidate Yukos was to expropriate the company,' and that the proceedings were conducted improperly so that the Russian Federation could \u2018take its assets.'1374\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 122 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n1103.\n\nThe Parties' arguments are related to and can be organized under the following two headings: (a) why was the bankruptcy initiated and who was truly behind it? And (b) were the bankruptcy proceedings conducted properly and fairly?\n\n1104.\n\nThe Parties' arguments and the Tribunal's observations on each of these are presented below.\n\n**(a) Why was the Bankruptcy Initiated and Who was Truly Behind It?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1105.\n\nIt is not contested that the non-payment of the A Loan was an important factor leading to the bankruptcy of Yukos, since it was the creditor under the A Loan, the Western Banks, who initiated the bankruptcy (consistent with terms agreed with Rosneft in the Confidential Sale Agreement). There is disagreement, however, over the following two issues related to the non-payment of the A Loan:\n\ni) Who was responsible for the non-payment of the A Loan - was Yukos prevented from paying by Respondent's conduct, or did Yukos have some control over the matter?\n\nii) Was the Confidential Sale Agreement a reasonable commercial arrangement between the Western Banks, as creditor, and Rosneft, as parent of YNG, the guarantor of the A Loan, or was it imposed on the Western Banks as part of Respondent's deliberate plan (executed through or with the assistance of Rosneft) to expropriate the remaining assets of Yukos?\n\n1106.\n\nEach of these issues is analyzed in the respective subsections below, followed by the Tribunal's observations on why the bankruptcy was initiated and who was truly behind it.\n\n**(i) Non-Payment of the A Loan**\n---------------------------------\n\n1107.\n\nThe Parties present opposing views on the reasons for which the A Loan had not been paid off by Yukos by the end of 2005.\n\n1108.\n\nRespondent argues that the Western Banks were not paid simply because \"Yukos adamantly refused to pay.\"1375 In other words, according to Respondent, \"Yukos' dilatory and obstructionist treatment of its commercial creditors paralleled closely its treatment of its tax creditors.\"1376 Respondent advances four arguments, as summarized at paragraphs 125 to 129 of its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 124.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1052.\n\n1109.\n\nFirstly, starting in January 2004, Yukos refused the syndicate's requests for full prepayment of the loan and denied the syndicate's requests to subordinate the B Loan to the A Loan. Secondly, Yukos \"re-routed\" its exports and chose to leave the banks with an unsecured nonperforming loan. Thirdly, Yukos failed to satisfy the English Judgment even though it had the available resources to pay it, frustrating collection efforts in the United States and in the Netherlands. Fourthly, Yukos engaged in \"bad-faith negotiations\" with the syndicate, which eventually led the syndicate to contact Rosneft and come to an agreement with it.\n\n1110.\n\nClaimants generally argue that \"Yukos worked closely with [the syndicate] to ensure payment of the debt\" but that \"at each step, the Russian Federation's actions impeded the Company's efforts.\"1377 Claimants submit that \"[h]ad the A Lenders not received an offer from Rosneft in the interim, they too would have been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the Dutch assets, along with Moravel.\"1378\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 117 (footnote omitted).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6119.

Reply \u00b6 391; Transcript, Day 20 at 229 (Claimant's rebuttal): \"Indeed, Moravel would eventually be paid out from the proceeds of the sale of Mazeikiu Nafta, and pursuant to a court order, and the banks would have similarly been paid out from the proceeds of the sale of that asset had they not in the meantime received an offer that was difficult to refuse.\"\n\n1111.\n\nEach of Respondent's specific arguments in relation to the non-payment of the A Loan is addressed in the respective subsections below.\n\n*(a) Yukos' Refusal to Fully Prepay the A Loan or to Subordinate the B Loan*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1112.\n\nRespondent argues that \"[t]rouble arose almost immediately after the A Loan was funded.\"1379 It claims that the syndicate \"first raised the possibility of Yukos' bankruptcy\" in early 2004.1380 In January 2004, the following options were discussed: full prepayment of the A Loan; partial acceleration of the A Loan; additional security; and subordination of the B Loan to the A Loan.1381 Respondent, relying on a news article, claims that the syndicate was \"especially concerned\" with the so-called \"giga-dividend.\"1382\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1057.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1057; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Meeting Agenda, Paris, 22 January 2004, Exh.

SocGen drew on the collateral before making the loan through an intermediary bank. And as a result, ultimately GML's rights in the loan were assigned to Moravel, which was its wholly owned subsidiary.

Respondent contends that that the creation of the Stichtings \"constitutes a blatant violation of Russian bankruptcy and criminal law.\"1406 Respondent also submitted with its Rejoinder an expert report by Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg (the \" **Van den Berg Report** \"), arguing that the creation of the Stichtings was illegal under Dutch law.1407\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 127; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1076-92.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1076; Transcript, Day 19 at 66-67 (Respondent's closing); Transcript, Day 21 at 165 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 537-38; *Criminal Code of the Russian Federation No. 63-FZ*, 13 June 1996, Article 195, Exh.

In particular, Claimants place great emphasis on the Confidential Sale Agreement that was entered into between the Western Banks and Rosneft on 13 December 2005. Pursuant to that Agreement, Rosneft agreed to satisfy the outstanding debt owed by Yukos to the Western Banks (over USD 455 million plus interest) in exchange for the Western Banks agreeing to take the steps described in Schedule 8 of the Confidential Sale Agreement, entitled \"Application for Bankruptcy.\"\n\n1133.\n\nClaimants assert that each of Rosneft, on the one hand, and the Western Banks, on the other, fulfilled their respective roles under the Confidential Sale Agreement meticulously. Thus, on 6 March 2006, having completed the other steps contemplated under the Confidential Sale Agreement, the Western Banks filed a petition with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare Yukos bankrupt.1430 On 14 March 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally substituted Rosneft in the place of the Western Banks for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings.1431\n\nBanks' Petition to Declare Yukos Bankrupt Filed with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 6 March 2006, Exh.

C-307.\n\n1134.\n\nRespondent explains that the Confidential Sale Agreement was concluded between Rosneft and the Western Banks because of the \"convergence of their commercial interests\":\n\nThe SocGen syndicate simultaneously also sought payment of the same debt from Rosneft pursuant to the 2004 loan guarantee that Yukos had foisted on YNG, which Rosneft then owned. Although Rosneft disputed the validity of the guarantee, Rosneft required forbearance from the same banks on covenant breaches arising from the YNG acquisition, and Rosneft needed the bank's cooperation for its planned IPO. The convergence of the syndicate's and Rosneft's commercial interests resulted in their agreeing that Rosneft would pay the syndicate in full, but only after the syndicate had pursued all legal avenues to obtain payment from Yukos, the primary obligor.

C-795.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 300.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Observations**\n---------------------------------\n\n1141.\n\nHaving considered the extensive record and the maze of documents as well as the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal concludes that while it is undisputed that the Western Banks formally initiated the bankruptcy proceedings, and that Yukos is partly to blame for giving the Banks the incentive to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft, the role of Rosneft and of Respondent in creating the conditions for Yukos' bankruptcy cannot be ignored.\n\n1142.\n\nTurning firstly to the fault that Yukos bears in this matter, the Tribunal largely accepts Respondent's arguments that Yukos could have paid the A Loan in full prior to the end of 2005, whether by subordinating the B Loan to the A Loan, allowing the export contracts to continue to operate as security for the Western Banks, or indeed using assets that were placed into the Stichtings. It can therefore be said that Yukos is not without fault in connection with the initiation of the bankruptcy, since it contributed to creating conditions that gave the Western Banks every incentive to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft, and it was pursuant to that Confidential Sale Agreement that the Banks initiated bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos in exchange for payment from Rosneft under the A Loan. As Mr. Theede testified, banks being banks, the solution presented by the Confidential Sale Agreement was \"an easy, low-risk way out of this for them.\"1447\n\nTranscript, Day 10 at 113 (cross-examination of Mr. Theede).\n\n1143.\n\nHowever, to focus only on these narrow reasons for non-payment of the A Loan, and on the commercial considerations that drove the Western Banks to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement, is to miss the bigger picture. The Tribunal observes that Yukos was current in its payments to the Western Banks until December 2004, when YNG was auctioned to Rosneft. Had YNG not been seized, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Yukos would not have had problems repaying the A Loan. By the same token, given the circumstances under which YNG was seized (discussed in Chapter VIII.F of this Award), it stands to reason that Yukos felt justified in forcing Respondent, through Rosneft, to pay the Western Banks under the YNG guarantee, rather than paying the debt itself.\n\n1144.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore cannot accept Respondent's argument that because Yukos, even after the seizure of YNG, *could have* paid the Western Banks under the A Loan but did not do so, there is no link to be made between Rosneft (and, indeed, Respondent) and the bankruptcy. The big picture established by the record, including in respect of the tax assessments and the auction of YNG, suggests otherwise.\n\n1145.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion is also supported by two particular facts more closely related to the enforcement of the A Loan in Russia.\n\n1146.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal notes that the Western Banks entered into the Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft very soon after the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District reversed an earlier decision that had authorized the enforcement of the English Judgment, and that the same Court ultimately allowed the Western Banks to proceed with its enforcement after it had entered into the Confidential Sale Agreement. This suggests to the Tribunal, at best, a very happy coincidence as between the decision of the Court and the interests served by the terms presented to the Western Banks in the Confidential Sale Agreement. It is also consistent with Claimants' argument that the decisions of the Court and the conduct of Rosneft were being coordinated as part of a deliberate strategy to drive Yukos into bankruptcy.\n\n1147.\n\nSecondly, if Rosneft itself (or the State, as its owner) were not interested in orchestrating the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos, why was the requirement to initiate bankruptcy included in the Confidential Sale Agreement? In other words, while the Tribunal can accept both that the Western Banks had a commercial interest in getting paid by Rosneft (especially after the 5 December 2005 decision of the Federal Arbitrazh Court that reversed the enforcement of the English Judgment) and that Rosneft had a commercial interest in having the Western Banks' claim against Yukos assigned to it in exchange for such payment, the Tribunal does not see any evident commercial rationale for the inclusion in the Confidential Sale Agreement of the requirement that the Banks initiate bankruptcy in order to be paid.\n\n1148.\n\nIt thus appears to the Tribunal that the Western Banks, since Yukos was not reimbursing the loan, were actively \"encouraged\" to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement in order to accomplish their objective of being paid. While, as the Tribunal said earlier, Yukos must shoulder some of the blame for not paying the Western Banks and thereby increasing its exposure to the risk that it could be petitioned into bankrupcy, it appears undeniable to the Tribunal that initiating bankruptcy was not a goal of the Western Banks, but rather the objective of Rosneft, in the interests of its owner, the Russian Federation. The Tribunal concludes that in the end the bankruptcy was initiated by the Russian Federation. The separate and parallel bankruptcy petition filed by Rosneft-controlled YNG on 24 March 2006 reinforces this conclusion.\n\n1149.\n\nThe Tribunal, in light of the evidence reviewed above, finds the following passage from Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief compelling and adopts it as its own:\n\nThe only rational explanation for the highly unusual manner in which the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos were initiated was to act as a cover for the Russian Federation's involvement, allowing the Russian government to keep its word\u2014in the context of ongoing legal proceedings, including these arbitrations\u2014that it was not interested in the bankruptcy of Yukos (and thus maintaining the appearance that it was commercial parties\u2014not the State\u2014that sought Yukos' bankruptcy), while achieving its desired end.1448\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 123.\n\n**(b) Were the Bankruptcy Proceedings Conducted Properly and Fairly?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1150.\n\nClaimants paint the bankruptcy as \"the final act of the destruction\" of Yukos.1449 Claimants argue that Respondent (or entities whose conduct is attributable to Respondent)1450 not only initiated the bankruptcy, but also (i) ensured that it monopolized the bankruptcy process by discriminatory rejection and allowance of bankruptcy claims;1451 (ii) ensured the rejection of Yukos' proposed Rehabilitation Plan;1452 and (iii) confiscated the residual assets of Yukos through sham auctions and Yukos' eventual liquidation.1453\n\nMemorial \u00b6 411.\n\nFor the Tribunal's discussion of attribution, see Chapter X.A of this Award.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 431-51.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 452-67.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 468-94.\n\n1151.\n\nClaimants claim that Respondent monopolized the bankruptcy and, directly or indirectly, obtained 97.67 percent of all bankruptcy claims, obtained approximately 93.87 percent of the votes in the creditors' meeting, claimed USD 6 billion in profit tax on the auction proceedings, acquired over 95 percent of Yukos' remaining assets in the bankruptcy, and received as creditor approximately 99.71 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds.1454\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 126-33.\n\n**(i) The Courts' Treatment of Bankruptcy Claims**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1152.\n\nClaimants argue that the Russian courts never had the interests of Yukos or its rehabilitation in mind when conducting the bankruptcy proceedings. Firstly, the Russian courts ensured that the Russian State would become Yukos' main creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings by postponing the date of the first meeting of Yukos' creditors to give the State \"more time to prove new tax claims\" against Yukos.1455 These tax claims comprised Yukos' outstanding alleged tax liabilities for the years 2000 to 2003. As noted above, at the hearing of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on 14 June 2006, the bankruptcy judge ruled in favour of the Federal Taxation Service, setting \"a new speed reading record\" after taking just 15 minutes to consider 127,000 pages of information submitted by Russian tax officials.1456 As a result of that judgment, the Federal Taxation Service became Yukos' single largest creditor with registered claims amounting to approximately USD 13.06 billion.1457\n\n*Yukos creditors' meeting delayed by Moscow court*, Reuters, 8 June 2006, Exh. C-808.\n\n*Judge sets speed-reading record...,* Reuters, 16 June 2006, Exh. C-809.\n\nResolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, 11 August 2006, Exh. C-336; Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 2 October 2006, Exh. C-201; Register of Yukos Creditors' Claims, 30 October 2007, Exh. C-353; Summary Chart of Creditors, Exh. C-594.\n\n1153.\n\nSecondly, Claimants contend that the Russian courts ensured that State-controlled Rosneft\u2014of which the Russian State has been the majority shareholder since the company's privatization in the nineties\u2014would become Yukos' second largest creditor in the bankruptcy. On 17 July 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court admitted into the bankruptcy proceedings four claims by YNG, which by that that time had already become a subsidiary of Rosneft:\n\nThe claims were based on the sale of oil produced by Yuganskneftegaz and sold to Yukos' trading companies in 2004: the Court decided that Yukos, and not the trading companies\u2014notwithstanding that those companies were Yuganskneftegaz's counterparties under the relevant oil sale contracts\u2014was liable to pay for the oil sold.1458\n\nMemorial \u00b6 435.\n\n1154.\n\nThirdly, in Claimants' view, the Russian courts ensured that creditor claims belonging to Yukos-related entities or to Yukos' shareholders would not be recognized in the bankruptcy proceedings. For example, in its Memorial on the Merits, Claimants explain the Russian courts' treatment of Moravel Investment Limited, a GML affiliate:\n\nThis was the case, for example, for the claim filed by Moravel Investment Limited (\"Moravel\"), a GML affiliate, on the basis of an LCIA award of September 16, 2005, rendered by an arbitral tribunal comprised of Peter Leaver QC, Jonathan Hirst QC and J. William Rowley QC, Chairman. The award ordered Yukos to pay to Moravel US$ 655,725,238.60 in principal plus corresponding interest, which was outstanding under the B Loan Agreement concluded between Yukos and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in September 2003 for the purposes of Yukos' merger with Sibneft. This loan was identical, in all material aspects, to the A Loan which had been assigned to Rosneft by the Western Banks headed by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and on the basis of which Rosneft had been admitted into the bankruptcy proceedings. However, unlike Rosneft's claim, for which the Russian courts had recognized the English Judgment rendered in favor of the Western banks (later assigned to Rosneft), the courts refused the enforcement of the awards in favor of Moravel.1459\n\nMemorial \u00b6 441 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n1155.\n\nRussian courts accorded similar treatment to the remaining Yukos affiliates with outstanding claims against Yukos, such as Yukos Capital SARL, Glendale Group Limited, OOO Yu-Mordovia, OOO Yukos Vostok Trade, ZAO Yukos-M, OOO Siberian Internet Company, OOO Trading House Yukos-M, ZAO Krasnoyarskgeofizika, ZAO Lipetsknefteprodukt, and OOO Alta-Trade. As Claimants contend, \"the common ground for denying the claims of these companies was the alleged lack of evidence of the existence of the claims.\"1460\n\nMemorial \u00b6 448.\n\n**(ii) The Rejection of Yukos' Rehabilitation Plan**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1156.\n\nOn 1 June 2006, Yukos' general shareholders' meeting approved Yukos' Financial Rehabilitation Plan and appointed Mr. Osborne as the shareholders' representative in the bankruptcy proceedings.1461 Claimants point out that according to Yukos' Rehabilitation Plan, Yukos was in a position to pay off its alleged liabilities fully within two years.1462 Mr. Rebgun, the appointed administrator, was required to circulate Yukos' Rehabilitation Plan to all Yukos' registered creditors. According to Claimants, Mr. Rebgun did not do so, although Respondent alleges that Mr. Rebgun made the Rehabilitation Plan available for the creditors' review before the creditors' meeting.\n\nMinutes of Extraordinary General Meeting of Yukos' Shareholders held on 1 June 2006, Exh. C-311.\n\nClaimants' Skeleton \u00b6 55.\n\n1157.\n\nMr. Rebgun's own proposal to the creditors was to sell all Yukos' assets to satisfy the creditors' claims and then liquidate the company. At the creditors' meeting of 25 July 2006, at which the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft held 93.87 percent of votes, Yukos' Rehabilitation Plan was rejected, and the creditors decided to liquidate Yukos, \"which had the added bonus of creating an additional claim for the tax authorities of 24% profit tax on the auction proceedings, a claim on which it would collect US$ 6 billion.\"1463\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 127.\n\n1158.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants further contend that:\n\nDuring the hearing, the Respondent made a limited number of unfounded attacks on Yukos' Financial Rehabilitation Plan. For example, the Respondent alleged that Yukos' Financial Rehabilitation Plan was \"highly speculative\" as the \"cash pool\" was to be funded from \"uncertain revenues\" including US$ 18 billion from \"litigation claims.\" However, as even the most cursory review of the Plan reveals, \"litigation claims\" were not ascribed a value in determining the aggregate value of Yukos' assets available to pay claims and were merely intended to supplement the \"cash pool\", if and when anything was received.1464\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 128.\n\n1159.\n\nYukos' creditors gathered for their first meeting on 20 July 2006. Yukos' management proposed a Rehabilitation Plan1465 and Mr. Rebgun proposed its Analysis of Yukos' Financial Situation.1466 After the meeting was adjourned and resumed on 25 July 2006, the Federal Taxation Service, representing together with Rosneft 93.87 percent of the votes, voted against the Rehabilitation Plan and in favor of the liquidation of Yukos.1467\n\nRehabilitation Plan, Exh.

The rough outline management submitted was, however, legally defective and did not provide any basis for creditors to prefer rehabilitation to liquidation. It was not properly presented to or approved by Yukos shareholders, did not meet the legal requirements that the company's tax claims be satisfied within six months, and did not ensure full, let alone timely, payment of Yukos' creditors' claims.1472\n\nRespondent's Skeleton \u00b6 62 *; see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 123.\n\n1163.\n\nRespondent argues that the Rehabilitation Plan was \"a blatant and untenable attempt on the part of the Oligarchs to secure their own interests over those of the creditors\" and that \"the creditors' decision to reject the plan was reasonable and taken in accordance with Russian law, which vests full discretion with the creditors, consistently with international practice.\"1473\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 611.\n\n1164.\n\nRespondent underlines that in Russia, \"the vote for the liquidation or rehabilitation of the debtor is within the full discretion of the creditors.\"1474\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 632. This is consistent with international practice, *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1501.\n\n1165.\n\nOn the question of the late claims, Respondent does not contest that the Federal Taxation Service claimed USD 8.82 billion in profit taxes out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy and eventually received USD 6.02 billion; it submits however, that \"[t]hese are standard \u2018 *late* ' claims that arise in connection with any sale generating profits, including in the context of rehabilitation proceedings\"1475 and that there is therefore nothing improper about them.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1182.\n\n**(iii) The Declaration of Yukos' Bankruptcy**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1166.\n\nOn 1 August 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court stated that it had \"established that the debtor showed the signs of bankruptcy as defined in Article 3 of the Federal Law \u2018On Insolvency (Bankruptcy)'\" and that Yukos had \"not fulfilled its monetary obligations towards its creditors for three months from the time when these obligations should have been fulfilled,\" without making any reference to the difference between Yukos' liabilities and its assets.1476\n\nDecision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 1 August 2006, Exh. C-324.\n\n1167.\n\nThe Claimants assert that on 1 August 2006, when Yukos was declared bankrupt, \"Yukos' assets exceeded its alleged liabilities, and... the Company was clearly solvent.\"1477 The Claimants further suggest that \"there was nothing inevitable about the bankruptcy of Yukos\" and that \"Yukos could have avoided bankruptcy if allowed to pay off its fabricated tax debts.\"1478 To support this claim, Claimants refer to the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos' management, which proposed \"to leave intact Yukos' \u2018core assets' as a viable ongoing company, while addressing and paying in full all valid creditors' claims.\"1479\n\nMemorial \u00b6 822.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 825.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6128; *see also* Rehabilitation Plan, Exh.

R-3892.\n\n1175.\n\nClaimants assert that \"[a]s creditor, the Russian Federation received, either directly or through Rosneft, approximately 99.71% of the bankruptcy proceeds.\"1497 This occurred through \"Rosneft [having] won 11 out of the 17 bankruptcy auctions, including acquiring Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and Tomskeneft (Lot No. 10).\"1498\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 132.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 131.\n\n1176.\n\nIn their Skeleton Argument, Claimants summarize the eleven auctions that completed the bankruptcy proceedings as follows:\n\nYukos' remaining assets were transferred to the Russian State at well below their fair market value through a series of 17 auctions held between March 2006 and August 2007. Rosneft thereby directly or indirectly acquired Yukos' key remaining assets, including Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and Tomskneft (Lot No. 10), which were sold at a gross discount of approximately 37% and 33%, respectively, of their fair market value. For its part, Gazprom acquired through Eni/Enel the 20% minus 1 share stake in Sibneft that the Russian Federation had persistently refused to let Yukos sell to pay off alleged tax debts. As with the sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no genuine competition in the bankruptcy auctions and, in many instances, including those for Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft, the only participants were Rosneft and a previously unknown entity whose sole role was to satisfy the formal requirement that there be a minimum of 2 bidders.\n\nFinally, when, by the end of July 2007, it became clear that despite the low auction prices, the bankruptcy might still generate some surplus, further claims were admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the Russian State, through the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft. This ensured the completeness of Yukos' destruction and the transfer of its value and assets to the Russian State. Thus, the Russian Federation received, either directly or through State-owned Rosneft or Gazprom, approximately 99.71% of the bankruptcy proceeds and over 95% of Yukos' remaining assets, including all of Yukos' main production assets.\n\nOn November 12, 2007, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally endorsed all the activities of Yukos' receiver Mr. Rebgun, closed the Company's receivership and ordered that Yukos be struck off the register of legal entities. The latter happened on November 21, 2007.1499\n\nClaimants' Skeleton \u00b6\u00b6 58-60 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n1177.\n\nRespondent contends that Yukos' bankruptcy auctions were held in full compliance with Russian law, and that Mr. Rebgun had secured appraisals for the fair value of the assets:\n\nOnce Yukos' liquidation was properly approved, the company's assets were sold at auction in accordance with Russian law and international practice. Yukos' receiver obtained appraisals for the fair value of the assets, and used those appraisals to set minimum bids in the auctions, all of which were exceeded, some by very large margins. The auctions were open to domestic and foreign bidders, adequately noticed and advertised, and competitive. To the extent that any bidders may have been discouraged from participating, this was again the result of Claimants and Yukos having threatened potential bidders with legal action. While the aggregate results exceeded Yukos' own (and other) contemporaneous fair market value estimates, more than US$ 9 billion in creditor claims nonetheless remained unsatisfied.1500\n\nRespondent's Skeleton \u00b6 63; *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 133-34.\n\n**(v) Tribunal's Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n1178.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Respondent's insistence that all aspects of the bankruptcy were conducted in accordance with Russian bankruptcy law. However, the Tribunal's inquiry is not limited to a mere review of the formalities of the bankruptcy. It must address and review all the substantial features of the proceedings.\n\n1179.\n\nThus, the Tribunal views as improper and unfair that, for example:\n\n\u2022 All claims filed by Rosneft and the Federal Taxation Service, valued in the billions, were peremptorily accepted by the Court, while the many claims filed by Yukos' affiliated companies were rejected by the Court in a very summary way; and\n\n\u2022 Yukos was saddled with a claim of some USD 6 billion that related only to the profit tax to be collected by the Federal Taxation Service as a result of the liquidation of Yukos' assets in the bankruptcy.1501\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal is also troubled by the fact that Rosneft's acquisition of YNG (discussed in Chapter VIII.F of this Award) generated a claim of almost USD 10 billion against Yukos in the bankruptcy, including a claim based on the attribution to Yukos of debts owed to YNG by Yukos' trading companies. Since the Tribunal has already found that Rosneft's acquisition of YNG was, to say the least, questionable, in its view, this claim is equally questionable.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this claim or liability was considered in determining whether Yukos should be liquidated or rehabilitated, and indeed declared bankrupt, and the Federal Taxation Service itself\u2014which stood to benefit from that claim\u2014had a majority vote at the creditors' meeting.\n\n1180.\n\nIn light of the above conclusions, the Tribunal cannot accept that it was in any sense proper or fair for the creditors' committee to reject the Rehabilitation Plan, for the court to declare Yukos bankrupt, or for Yukos to have been deprived of all of its remaining assets through a hasty and questionable liquidation process. On the contrary, it is evident to the Tribunal that the totality of the bankruptcy proceedings reviewed in this chapter were not part of a process for the collection of taxes but rather, as submitted by Claimants, indeed the \"final act of the destruction of the Company by the Russian Federation and the expropriation of its assets for the sole benefit of the Russian State and State-owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom.\"\n\n1181.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its conclusions are consistent with those of the *RosInvestCo* tribunal and the *Quasar* tribunal.\n\n1182.\n\nWith respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, the *RosInvestCo* tribunal concluded as follows:\n\nThough the Tribunal did not find the bankruptcy auctions to be conducted contrary to Russian law, this does not change the general impression from the evidence on file for the Tribunal, since the application for bankruptcy by the SocGen Group was also conducted by association with the State-controlled company, Rosneft, and that they fitted into the obvious general pattern and obvious intention of the totality of the scheme to deprive Yukos of its assets.1502\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 620, Exh. C-1049.\n\n1183.\n\nThe *Quasar* tribunal concluded:\n\n141. The Tribunal has carefully considered each of the Respondent's defences, but is ultimately unpersuaded by them. The issue here is not one of the legality of the bankruptcy proceedings, nor their conformity with Russian bankruptcy regulations. Rather, it is whether the steps that were taken can properly and fairly be characterised as part of an ordinary process of collecting taxes. In the Tribunal's view, they cannot fairly be so characterised, particularly when viewed against the broader chronology of which they form part (as summarised later in this section). This conclusion is not overcome by the Respondent's various technical analyses of the consortium agreement.\n\n\u2026\n\n157. But the Tribunal also notes that, as a result of these auctions, \"at the end of the day\"... the Russian Federation has ended up with 93% of Yukos Oil Company.\"...\n\n158. As summarised below, the overall chronology of which the liquidation auctions form part, casts them and their outcome in a particular light. After careful consideration of the entire record, the Tribunal concludes that, as with the preceding events, the liquidation auctions were part of the same overall scheme of confiscation. In this regard, the Tribunal's findings are consistent with those of the *RosInvest* Tribunal.... The ECHR's finding to the contrary\u2014 *i.e.*, that Yukos failed to prove that the Russian Federation \"had misused those [enforcement] proceedings with a view to destroying the company and taking control of its assets\"\u2014must be understood as based on a heightened requirement of \"incontrovertible and direct proof,\" given the \"wide margin of appreciation\" a State enjoys under Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights....1503\n\n*Quasar*, Exh. 3383.\n\n**H. THE WITHDRAWAL OF PWC'S AUDIT OPINIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1184.\n\nAs noted earlier in this Award,1504 Yukos' auditor, PwC, withdrew its audit reports for Yukos in June 2007. This withdrawal was often mentioned, mostly by Respondent's counsel, during these proceedings. Although neither Party called as a witness anyone from PwC, the Tribunal has formed the view that it is essential for it to review PwC's role in the present Awards.\n\n*See* paragraph 104 above.\n\n1185.\n\nPwC was Yukos' auditor from 1997 to 2004. It also played an advisory role to Yukos, consulting on the company's domestic and international structures. On 15 June 2007, PwC formally withdrew all its prior audit reports for Yukos for the period from 31 December 1995 until 31 December 2004, stating that \"new information\" had led it to conclude that such reports could no longer be relied upon as trustworthy.1505\n\nPwC's Withdrawal Letter, Exh. C-611.\n\n1186.\n\nClaimants say that the Russian Government exerted pressure on PwC to withdraw the audits in order to bolster the legitimacy of the destruction of Yukos. The harassment of PwC, say Claimants, took the form of searches, seizures, interrogations, criminal charges, two tax lawsuits, and the potential loss of clients and its license to do business in Russia. Rather than risk its business and employees for the sake of a client that was \"no longer a going concern,\" PwC chose the \"only viable option,\" namely to cooperate with the Russian authorities by finding pretexts to withdraw its Yukos audits.1506\n\nTranscript, Day 2 at 50 (Claimants' opening), quoting U.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW2159, 10 May 2007, WikiLeaks Website, Exh. C-1358.\n\n1187.\n\nIn contrast, Respondent says that PwC and Yukos had had a troubled relationship for a long time, noting that PwC refused to audit the company after 2004. During interrogations of PwC auditor Douglas Miller in May and June 2007, PwC received credible \"new\" information showing that Yukos' senior management had repeatedly lied to its auditors, confirming PwC's prior suspicions on four particular issues, and causing PwC to lose confidence in the content of its audit reports. At the time, Yukos was in bankruptcy and former executives and company records were no longer accessible. PwC thus could not conduct satisfactory inquiries to determine how the new information affected the audited financial statements. In the circumstances, the \"only viable option\" for PwC was to withdraw the audits, a move endorsed and approved by Respondent's audit expert, Mr. Ellison.1507\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 205; Respondent's Skeleton \u00b6\u00b6 45-50; Respondent's Closing Slides, pp. 188-89; Ellison Report.\n\n1188.\n\nNo witnesses from PwC were presented by the Parties.1508 PwC is not on trial before this Tribunal. The Tribunal draws no conclusions in this Award on PwC's professional conduct. Nevertheless, the events surrounding PwC's withdrawal of the Yukos audits help to inform the Tribunal's view as to whether Yukos was the object of a series of politically-motivated attacks, or is now simply \"blaming the Russian Federation for the consequences of its own misconduct.\"1509\n\nFor the names of specific individuals from PwC who potentially could have testified, see paragraph 251 above.\n\n*See* Respondent's Skeleton \u00b6 22.\n\n**2. Chronology**\n-----------------\n\n1189.\n\nAbsent direct testimony from PwC, the Tribunal must draw its conclusions from the testimony of Claimants' witnesses; correspondence amongst Yukos, PwC, external advisors and the Russian authorities; and the testimony of PwC personnel before other fora. There are also contemporaneous U.S. State Department cables, which emerged via \"Wikileaks\" and reveal the \"candid\"1510 and \"unguarded\"1511 views of PwC's senior management.\n\nReply \u00b6 507.\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 41 (Respondent's opening).\n\n**(a) PwC Serves as Both Auditor and Consultant to Yukos**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n1190.\n\nFrom 1997, Yukos was one of PwC's major clients in Russia. At the Hearing, Claimants' witnesses described a \"perfectly normal\", \"cordial and close\" business relationship in which PwC was a \"permanent partner of Yukos and its subsidiaries for a long time.\"1512 PwC conducted Yukos' external audits and assisted with training Yukos' in-house accountants. PwC played an \"integral role\"1513 in developing Yukos' financial reporting system, and, according to Mr. Theede, \"PwC's consulting arm was actually the architect of [the trading company] structures.\"1514\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 50 (cross-examination of Mr. Theede); Kosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 15; Transcript, Day 6 at 28 (cross-examination of Mr. Rieger).\n\nMisamore WS \u00b6 25.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 50. *See also* the reference to PwC's consulting contract in Letter from Michael Kubena to Bruce Misamore, 15 January 2004, Exh. C-609; Rieger WS \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.\n\n1191.\n\nMr. Kosciusko-Morizet testified that \"from 1997 to 2004, PwC was given access to the entire documentation of the whole of the Yukos group without restriction and had a very detailed and global view of the financial situation and the procedures of Yukos and its subsidiaries.\"1515 It was a consistent theme among Claimants' witnesses that PwC enjoyed full access to Yukos' accounts, employees and information, \"including related-party transactions, shareholders, costs [and] taxation.\"1516 PwC also maintained a permanent staff presence within Yukos and performed site visits to Yukos entities.1517\n\nKosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 17.\n\n*See e.g.*, Transcript, Day 6 at 28 (cross-examination of Mr. Rieger).\n\nRieger WS \u00b6 16.\n\n1192.\n\nClaimants' witnesses pointed out that PwC never voiced complaints about access to the company or any of its staff. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet affirmed that PwC was \"perfectly able to check for themselves any documentation, ask for any documentation anywhere in the group at any level.\"1518 Mr. Misamore observed that if PwC \"did not have sufficient information, they should have asked for more.\"1519 It is interesting to note that in 1998 PwC initially refused to sign the Yukos financials, as it was unable to resolve which trading companies should be consolidated as \"controlled by Yukos and used for tax optimization.\" However, the next year, PwC did sign, as by then it had apparently been shown information sufficient to enable it to understand the control relationships.1520\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 29. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet added that PwC \"had every possibility to check whatever they wanted to check. And if they agreed on the consolidated perimeter, that was enough for us.... The U.S. GAAP consolidating statements were done according to the rules.... The accounts were approved by an eminent firm.\" Transcript, Day 4 at 52.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 249.\n\nRussian Federation Prosecutor General's Office, Record of Interrogation of Douglas Miller, 4 May 2007, Exh. R-137.\n\n1193.\n\nSimilarly, as detailed in the next section, PwC occasionally requested additional information about certain aspects of Yukos' activities, and was provided each time with sufficient answers to enable it to certify the financial statements according to U.S. GAAP standards.\n\n**(b) PwC Responds to the Massive Tax Reassessments against Yukos**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1194.\n\nWhen Mr. Lebedev was arrested in 2003 on tax-related charges, Yukos turned to PwC. Mr. Michael Kubena, a PwC partner, assured the specially-formed *ad hoc* Yukos Board committee chaired by Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet that Yukos had always complied with Russian law, including in the operation of its tax optimization structure, and that PwC did not believe that there was any possibility that the Russian authorities would attack Yukos on these issues.1521\n\nKosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 24.\n\n1195.\n\nIn December 2003, after Yukos received the 2000 Audit Report, Yukos again asked PwC for its comments. In a letter dated 15 January 2004, Mr. Kubena advised that, under the relevant Russian tax legislation, Yukos was not required to discharge the tax obligations of other taxpayers, regardless of whether they were affiliated parties.1522\n\nLetter from Michael Kubena to Bruce Misamore, 15 January 2004, Exh. C-609. An earlier draft of this letter also concluded that Yukos should not be liable for the trading shells' taxes, but did not exclude the possibility that there would be tax consequences for Yukos if the authorities and courts re-qualified its transactions and the nature of its business. Exh. C-1064, CP12026-27.\n\n1196.\n\nPwC's advice to Yukos was to set up a Board committee with independent legal counsel to carry out an investigation.1523 Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet thus resurrected the special *ad hoc* Board committee and Yukos engaged the law firm Akin Gump to examine the tax reassessments. PwC explained in a letter to Yukos of 29 January 2004 that an independent investigation of the pending charges and allegations against key Yukos personnel would enable PwC to obtain an understanding of possible illegal acts for purposes of its own auditing standards.1524 Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet said that \"to understand this letter, you have to remember the events... if you know that the problem was political, as everybody did.... The answer is you get cold feet and you start hedging, and this letter in technical language is about hedging.\"1525 PwC's persistence about the investigation led Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet to suggest at the time that PwC was \"trying to evade its responsibilities.\"1526 At the Hearing, he explained what he meant by this comment:\n\nYou're an auditor, you're in Russia, you know it's political; you get cold feet. What do you do? You don't want to be involved in the matter, so you find reasons to technically withdraw from the issue. What happened here is that we made every effort to satisfy the PwC requirements. The effort continued. Akin Gump was hired. A couple of memos, interviews and so on. And in the midst of April... assets of Yukos... were frozen. So that was that. At that point, any realistic hope of having PwC approving the 2003 GAAP accounts disappeared, for it was practically impossible. Even though we had satisfied all their requirements, they would not have approved the accounts because they knew\u2014they thought, \"It's a political struggle. What about our office?\" And they were right, because two years later they got into a problem that we all know about.... They know it's political; they don't want to be in the middle of the battle, they don't want to be touched. So they will keep raising arguments, technical arguments, in order not to be dragged into the fight.1527\n\nLetter from Donn Kingsley to Simon Kukes, 29 January 2004, Exh.

C-1064, CP11807.\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 165-66.\n\n1197.\n\nIn April 2004, PwC decided they would no longer audit Yukos. Mr. Doug Miller, a PwC Moscow partner, explained several years later, in an interrogation before the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, that the results of the Yukos/Akin Gump investigation \"were not final for us, they did not help us, i.e. we did not obtain the confirmation or comfort that would satisfy us as auditors. This was one of the factors which led to our refusal to audit the company in the future.\"1528\n\nRussian Federation General Prosecutor's Office, Record of Interrogation of Douglas Miller of PwC Russia, 4 May 2007, Exh. R-137 at 17.\n\n1198.\n\nThe timing of PwC's April 2004 decision to cease auditing Yukos coincides with the period when, according to Mr. Rieger, harassment of PwC at the hands of the Russian authorities commenced. PwC employees involved in Yukos' Russian accounts were interrogated.1529 In the spring of 2005, Mr. Miller told Mr. Rieger that he could not even meet with Yukos employees or management anymore, which Mr. Rieger understood to be a \"direct result of the permanent pressure put by the Russian authorities on PwC.\"1530\n\nRieger WS \u00b6 18.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**(c) PwC Faces Mounting Pressure from the Russian Federation around the Same Time as Mr. Khodorkovsky's Second Trial Starts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1199.\n\nPressure on PwC from the Russian authorities was sustained. In March 2006, a court case was brought against PwC for tax violations relating to expatriate salaries. There was speculation that the lawsuit was indirectly connected with investigations against Yukos.1531\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW466, \"Update on PWC's Russian tax issues,\" 2 February 2007, WikiLeaks Website, Exh. C-1352.\n\n1200.\n\nIn December 2006, a second court case was filed against PwC by the Tax Inspectorate. The Tax Inspectorate accused PwC of colluding with Yukos on tax evasion. PwC categorically rejected the claims that the Yukos audit reports were defective in any professional, legal or regulatory way.1532 While PwC acknowledged that it had raised certain matters with Yukos, it insisted that these matters did not materially affect the company's financial statements or alter PwC's opinion in respect of the financial statements.1533\n\n\"Official Position of PricewaterhouseCoopers,\" PwC Press Release, 25 December 2006, Exh.

Documents were seized and PwC was eventually fined.1534 A press report observed:\n\n[w]hat is clear is that the firm's association with Yukos and the fact that the oil company was paralysed and eventually bankrupted after being slapped with more than US$30 billion in back-tax claims despite financial reports approved by PwC has made the auditor a clear target for Russian tax authorities.1535\n\n*Russia, With Yukos Still in Sights, Raids PwC*, Wall Street Journal, 10 March 2007, Exh.

[and] strongly denie[d] any wrongdoing in either the 2002 tax case or in relation to its audits,\" and stated that it continued \"to work to resolve both matters.\"1536 Mr. Kubena told the U.S. Embassy that the treatment of PwC employees during the March 2007 raids was \"shocking\" and a \"disgrace.\"1537 Nevertheless, he was reported as saying that he wished to limit the public profile of the case and urged restraint in discussing it until the facts were clear. He said that, in the meantime, PwC \"better not... raise the public profile of the case in ways that could come back to hurt the prospects for a reasonable solution.\"1538\n\n\"PricewaterhouseCoopers' Official Statement,\" PwC Press Release, 12 March 2007, Exh.

Having met with PwC representatives, the U.S. Ambassador sought reassurance from Finance Minister Kudrin, who advised the Ambassador that there was no basis for the license to be revoked.1542 The press still speculated, however, that PwC might risk losing the license.1543 In fact, the license was renewed in April 2007 but PwC continued to fear that it would be revoked long after.1544 Press reports in April also noted that PwC had started losing clients, including State-owned companies Transneft and Sakhalin II.1545\n\n*PwC Puts On a Brave Face After Losing Case*, Moscow Times, 22 March 2007, Exh.

According to the declaration of a PwC in-house counsel in a separate forum, PwC was at that time already considering and drafting a possible withdrawal of the audits.1546\n\nIn the Matter of an Application of Michael Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev for an Order Seeking Discovery Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782, Declaration of Laurie Endsley, 31 January 2011 \u00b6 9, Exh.

The prosecutors wanted to interrogate Mr. Miller while reprimanding PwC for failing to cooperate with earlier requests.1548 On 19 April 2007, PwC urgently recalled Mr. Miller from his new post in London. They informed him that PwC was now cooperating with investigators. Mr. Miller was instructed to attend the Prosecutor General's Office, where he was interrogated on six occasions in May and June.1549 During these sessions he was presented with \"new\" evidence obtained in connection with the Khodorkovsky prosecution.1550 Other PwC personnel were also interrogated in the first half of 2007. During his last interrogation session, on 4 June 2007, Mr. Miller told the prosecutor that, in his opinion, the audit opinions issued in respect of Yukos' financial statements \"starting from at least 1999 should be withdrawn.\"1551\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW3343, \"Russia: PricewaterhouseCoopers Withdraws Audits of Yukos,\" 9 July 2007, Exh.

C-611.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1208.\n\nSenior PwC manager Pete Gerendasi reportedly explained to the U.S. Embassy that the \"new\" information had been carefully reviewed and deemed credible; that PwC's U.S. headquarters had been closely consulted; and that PwC had concluded after a thorough review that, \"since Yukos was no longer a going concern, the only viable option was to withdraw its audits.\"1556 The Embassy observed that Mr. Gerendasi was uncomfortable discussing the sources of the \"new\" information but that he was \"unequivocal\" that the withdrawal was \"a difficult call.\"1557 As described in the Wikileaks cable, at the time, PwC was still facing: (a) a review by the Finance Ministry of its auditing practices; (b) an appeal regarding the expatriate tax case; and (c) an appeal regarding the Yukos collusion case.1558 While Mr. Gerendasi noted that PwC's legal counsel \"was uncertain what effect PwC's decision to withdraw its Yukos audits would have on the outcome\" of the Yukos collusion case, he stated that \"the withdrawal would not have an adverse effect on the Finance Ministry's review of PwC's auditing practices.\"1559\n\nU.S. State Department Cable, 07MOSCOW3343, \"Russia: PricewaterhouseCoopers Withdraws Audits of Yukos,\" 9 July 2007, Wikileaks Website \u00b6 3, Exh.

The audit firm has also risked losing its license....

C-865.\n\n1210.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that just one day after the public announcement, the criminal charges against Mr. Kubena and other PwC personnel were dropped.1562 In dropping the charges, the prosecutor noted that \"the unjustified nature of the [audit opinions]... was the result of misrepresentation by [Yukos'] major shareholders and the persons acting on their instructions.\"1563\n\nLetter from Russian Federation Prosecutor General's Office to PwC, 26 June 2007, enclosing Resolution on Denial to Initiate Prosecution against ZAO PriceWaterhouseCoopers Audit, 25 June 2007, Exh.

PwC was \"pleased... the general prosecutor ha[d] decided not to take any action against PwC Russia, its partners or employees.\"1564\n\n*Moscow clears PwC over Yukos audits*, Financial Times, 19 July 2007, Exh. C-874.\n\n1212.\n\nPwC has always denied that there was a tit-for-tat deal whereby the Russian authorities would drop their cases against PwC in return for PwC withdrawing its audits. PwC told the *Financial Times* that \"the audit firm's apparent reversal of fortune had nothing to do with its withdrawal of the audits... and nothing to do with any attempt to reduce the legal pressure.\"1565 A few years later, in a 2009 deposition conducted in the U.S. by Mr. Khodorkovsky's criminal lawyers, Mr. Miller categorically denied any connection between PwC's decision to withdraw its audits and the legal pressure against PwC:\n\nQ. Mr. Miller, how much did the\u2014did the criminal investigation into PwC in 2007 impact PwC's decision to withdraw the audits?\n\n\u2026\n\nTHE WITNESS: I believe that the decision to withdraw was based firmly [on] the information that was shown to us... during the investigation.\n\nQ. And is it the same answer as to the tax claims filed against PwC?\n\nA. Yes.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. And did you receive any assurances from the investigators, including Mr. Karimov, that if PwC withdrew the audits, that the criminal investigation against PwC would be terminated?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Have you received any other assurances from the investigators as to treatment of PwC if you were\u2014if PwC were to withdraw the audit letters?\n\nA. No.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. How about any of the investigators from the Russian authorities, did anybody ask you to develop reasons to withdraw the Yukos audits?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are you aware of anyone from the... [Prosecutor General's Office] asking PwC to develop reasons to withdraw the audits?\n\nA. No, I'm not aware of that.1566\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nMiller Deposition, pp. 256-7, 264, Exh. R-4309.\n\n1213.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal notes that an October 2007 Wikileaks cable reveals that Messrs. Kubena and Gerendasi of PwC conveyed to the U.S. Embassy \"that the Yukos and expatriate salary tax cases against the auditor were politically motivated.\"1567 Mr. Kubena speculated that the case against PwC for colluding with Yukos might have been \"an effort by the [Government of Russia] to prove ex post facto that its actions against Yukos had a legitimate basis.\"1568 Mr. Gerendasi drew a direct connection between the expatriate tax case against PwC and the prosecution against Yukos' former management, saying that \"tax and law enforcement authorities may be trying to cast PwC as reckless in an attempt to underscore that the [Government of Russia] rightfully prosecuted Yukos senior management.\"1569 Following this meeting, the Ambassador commented that \"PwC is under serious duress in Russia.\"1570\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW5083, \"Update on PWC's Yukos, Russian tax cases,\" 19 October 2007 \u00b6 1, Exh. C-1359.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid* \u00b6 5.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 6.\n\n1214.\n\nThe following month, PwC told the Embassy it was worried that the criminal charges laid in the context of the expatriate tax case had \"devolved into a pressure tactic against the firm.\"1571 As for the Yukos tax case, which was on appeal, Mr. Gerendasi noted that \"[a]lthough the potential financial penalties in this case were only on the order of USD 500,000... the real threat remained to the firm's auditing license.\"1572 The Ambassador noted that \"Russia matters to PwC,\" and that \"[d]espite the rather stark picture Gerendasi painted, he said that PwC remained bullish on Russia and intended to maintain its operations in-country.... He added that in the interest of facilitating a resolution to the firm's short-term difficulties, PwC's international leadership would try to meet with senior [Russian governmental] officials in the near future.\"1573\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW5403, \"PWC's travails in Russia worsen,\" 15 November 2007 \u00b6 4, Exh.

The record discloses that they consulted with the prosecutors prior to their testimony, as demonstrated by an e-mail dated 28 March 2009 from the Prosecutor General's Office, in which the prosecutors answered questions posed by Mr. Miller as follows:\n\n*2. For every witness, exactly on what issues and/or arguments should they dwell in their witness testimony?*\n\n- The testimony of each witness from among your company's employees should be unified, that is testify to the same thing, in the same sense and featuring the same style (offensive and aggressive with regard to the Defense)...\n\n*3. Can we obtain a list of approximate expected questions by the Prosecutor for each witness?*\n\n*-* Carefully analyze your testimony (records of interrogations) and recall our recent conversation: you will understand the general meaning of such questions. You and I should phrase specific questions ourselves once you have personally got to the bottom of the situation.1574\n\nE-mail from Sergei Mikhailov to Doug Miller, 28 March 2009, Exh. C-1244.\n\n1216.\n\nIn December 2009, the U.S. Embassy commented on the role that PwC played in the Khodorkovsky trial and related Yukos lawsuits. It observed as follows:\n\n... if the audits were properly withdrawn, this will be a \"black mark\" for the [Yukos/Khodorkovsky] defense; if not, it could help the defense, but would greatly tarnish PWC's international reputation.... [The Khodorkovsky trial is] applying a superficial rule-of-law gloss to a cynical system where political enemies are eliminated with impunity.... There is a widespread understanding that Khodorkovskiy violated the tacit rules of the game: if you keep out of politics, you can line your pockets as much as you desire. Most Russians believe the Khodorkovskiy trial is politically motivated...1575\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 09MOSCOW3144, \"Rule of Law Lipstick on a Political Pig: Khodorkovskiy case plods along,\" 30 December 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8, Exh. C-1361.\n\n1217.\n\nEventually the two court cases against PwC were resolved in PwC's favor and PwC's fines were refunded.1576 Meanwhile, Mr. Miller's evidence, and that of other cooperative PwC witnesses, was accepted and relied upon by the trial judge who found Mr. Khodorkovsky guilty at the conclusion of his second criminal trial.1577\n\n*Tax Authorities Performed Their Duty to Yukos' Auditor*, Kommersant, 19 June 2009, Exh.

Parties' Arguments and Tribunal's Observations**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n1218.\n\nThe main question the Tribunal will address is whether PwC's withdrawal of its Yukos audits was a decision brought about by pressure from the Russian Federation, as Claimants argue, or whether PwC decided to withdraw the audit opinions out of the genuine concern that they were tainted by newly-discovered misrepresentations, as Respondent argues. There is a third possibility as well, namely, that PwC's withdrawal of its audits was a tactical response to pressure of the Russian authorities but that nevertheless PwC did have some valid grounds to believe that Yukos had made important misrepresentations to it.\n\n**(a) Did PwC Withdraw its Audits because it was under Pressure from the Russian Government?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1219.\n\nClaimants' witnesses were unequivocal. In their view, PwC gave in to pressure from the Russian authorities when it withdrew the audits. Mr. Rieger had noticed that after the attacks on Yukos began in 2003, \"PwC grew much more distant from Yukos.... I understood this to be the direct result of the permanent pressure put by the Russian authorities on PwC.\"1578 Mr. Misamore stated at the Hearing his belief that \"PwC withdrew its audit reports as a result of tremendous pressure from the Russian Government....\"1579 Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet agreed. He testified:\n\nWell, knowing Russia, knowing that this whole Yukos affair is basically political, with a financial dimension for some people of course, there is a complete logic here in the harassment that PwC was submitted to from December 2006; the raid on their offices, the usual methods of armed masked men with machine guns, in March; their denial again of any wrongdoing in April; and finally this letter, I would not say written but signed by Doug Miller; and then I believe that all the criminal prosecutions disappeared in a matter of days.... I saw this letter. I considered that this letter was extorted from them by force. I know and they know what happened to the Yukos personnel, Vasily Aleksanyan,... Svetlana Bakhmina and others; there is a long list. And they had to face a decision between, of course, protecting their business and protecting their people, especially their Russian personnel, from dire consequences and/or insisting on no wrongdoing; that is, keeping the ethical line.... But PwC, as everybody else, was familiar with the kind of treatment you could expect if you resist in that context, and they made a decision\u2014I don't blame them for that decision\u2014protecting their staff. It's just unethical but realistic. And now they have a thriving business in Moscow.1580\n\nRieger WS \u00b6 18.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 182.\n\nTranscript, Day 4 at 203-04. For Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet's testimony at the second Khodorkovsky trial, *see also* Verdict of the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow, 27 December 2010, pp. 468ff, Exh. C-1057.\n\n1220.\n\nRespondent did not deny that the raids, seizures and lawsuits occurred, but explained they were part of regular law enforcement activities. Respondent pointed out, for example, that many companies (including Ernst & Young) faced lawsuits about expatriation tax issues. It argued that auditor collusion lawsuits are standard in other countries.1581\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1283.\n\n1221.\n\nThe record before the Tribunal is abundantly clear. PwC's treatment improved significantly once it started to cooperate with the authorities and then withdrew its audits. Almost overnight, charges were dropped against PwC personnel. PwC's own legal problems started to be resolved. At the same time, some cases took longer to resolve, and concerns by PwC over loss of its license were real. It is clear that cooperation from PwC, once given, was expected to be enduring. This is easily understood. Mr. Khodorkovsky's second trial was still ongoing.\n\n1222.\n\nRespondent relies heavily on Mr. Miller's deposition to contradict Claimants' account of the events.1582 That deposition was taken under oath in the U.S., at the request of Mr. Khodorkovsky's own lawyers, and, according to Respondent, it is \"hard to imagine a clearer or more credible denial of Claimants' \u2018harassment' theory.\"1583\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 1273-74.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 1274-75.\n\n1223.\n\nAlthough Mr. Miller was not offered as a witness, the Tribunal does not accept his denial in another forum of any link between PwC's decision to withdraw the audits and the pressure against PwC mounted by the Russian authorities. Mr. Miller was then subjected to six sessions of interrogation. When he was recalled from London his superiors instructed him to cooperate with the Russian authorities. The March 2009 e-mail exchange with the prosecutor's office, suggests that he was prepared to cooperate when he testified in Mr. Khodorkovsky's second trial. Moreover, the candid views expressed by PwC officials in the U.S. Embassy's cables published by Wikileaks confirm that PwC was under pressure. The cables demonstrate that PwC was concerned not to aggravate its difficulties with the Government (\"better not raise the public profile of the case in ways that could come back to hurt the prospects for a reasonable solution\");1584 that PwC was anxious not to lose its license or its business in Russia;1585 that it considered the Yukos cases to be politically motivated and saw some connections between the withdrawal of the audit opinions and PwC's treatment by the Russia Government;1586 and that it felt that criminal charges in the expatriate tax case were being used as a \"pressure tactic.\"1587 The Embassy considered PwC to be under duress and concluded that \"the political and legal concerns that are driving the heightened scrutiny of PWC's accounting practices appear to have taken on a life of their own.\"1588\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW1028, \"GOR Agencies visit PwC Moscow Office March 9,\" 12 March 2007, Wikileaks Website, Exh.

Mr. Theede also testified that up until the Russian Federation's attack on PwC began, \"there was never any indication of any concerns or problems or anything to me.\" Transcript, Day 11 at 50. *See also* Misamore WS \u00b6 29; Rieger WS \u00b6 18; Kosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 17.\n\n1225.\n\nRespondent on the other hand points to \"a long and troubled relationship\" between Yukos and PwC, recalling that PwC had refused to continue to audit the company's U.S. GAAP statements after 2003.1590 Respondent asserts that in 2007 PwC withdrew its opinions in good faith, upon learning \"new information\" via Mr. Miller's interrogations in May and June 2007.1591 Respondent emphasizes \"that the Tribunal is not a trier of fact as to the reliability of the information learned by PwC. In order to rebut Claimants' unsupported harassment theory, it is sufficient that PwC had a good-faith belief in the credibility of that information....\"1592 According to Respondent, it is for Claimants to prove that Yukos never lied to PwC and that PwC's four reasons for withdrawal of the audits were a mere pretext. Although the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that it is not a trier of facts as to the soundness of this \"new information,\" it finds it appropriate to examine those four reasons.\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 205; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 61.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 61.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**i. Did Yukos' Management Lie to PwC about the BBS Companies Being \"Related\"?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1226.\n\nThe first category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC's Withdrawal Letter was the following:\n\nWhilst we were auditing the Company, its management many times declared to us that the Company and companies to which substantial volumes of crude oil and oil products were exported, namely Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South Petroleum Limited (hereinafter together referred to as \"BBS\"), were not affiliated parties. In the course of the Investigation, we were provided with information showing that BBS had been controlled by the shareholders of Group Menatep Limited (hereinafter \"Group Menatep\") and had been used to their advantage. At the material time, Group Menatep held a controlling block of shares in the Company.1593\n\nPwC's Withdrawal Letter, Exh. C-611.\n\n1227.\n\nIt appears as if Yukos' management had repeatedly assured PwC that Yukos was not \"related\" to the BBS Companies (in the sense of sharing the same beneficial owners within the meaning of GAAP standards).1594 PwC had looked at the issue itself and expressed doubts, but concluded that even if they were related, the transactions with the BBS Companies were done under fair market conditions, and were so immaterial that they could have no impact on the financial statements and thus did not need to be disclosed.1595 Then, in 2007, while being interrogated, Mr. Miller found out \"new information,\" in the form of the record of an interrogation of a Mr. Anilionis, who described how the BBS Companies were set up in a structure that would enable Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to \"keep [them] under control but on the surface the structure should not belong to \u2018Yukos.'\"1596 A trade office was set up in Geneva, prices were coordinated with Mr. Lebedev, and Yukos' employees were responsible for oil trading activities. The discovery of this \"lie\", even though relating to an immaterial matter from a financial reporting standpoint, is said to have shattered PwC's confidence in the statements of Yukos' management and thus caused PwC to withdraw its audit opinions.1597 Claimants say it is simply not credible for PwC to have invoked the BBS Companies issue as an excuse to withdraw its audit opinions.1598 They also question the reliability of the source of \"new information,\" the interrogation of Mr. Anilionis.1599\n\nMr. Misamore confirmed on cross-examination that he still believed that they were unrelated.

He explained that PwC had conducted a study in 2002 and that it had not been able to \"reach a conclusion as to whether or not [information about Yukos' relationship with the BBS Companies] should be disclosed.\"1602 Further, he noted that PwC signed Yukos' audited financial statements without that information. Upon being shown an internal PwC document, \"Matters for Partner Attention\", for year 2000, wherein PwC stated that \"[t]he absence of disclosure, while not desirable, does not constitute a material omission,\"1603 Mr. Misamore said that this document too supports his view that disclosure was not so desirable as to warrant PwC insisting on its inclusion in Yukos' F-1 document.1604\n\n*Ibid*. at 64.\n\nPwC Memorandum \"Matters for Partner Attention\u2014Summary of Significant Issues,\" 31 December 2000, p. 6, Exh. C-1232.\n\nTranscript, Day 9 at 178.\n\n1230.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the claims that the BBS Companies, apparently the, or certainly, a, principal exporter of the oil produced by Yukos, were not controlled by or related to Yukos. PwC's contention that it was misled in this regard may have been true.\n\n**ii. Did Yukos Management Lie to PwC about Yukos' Control over the Trading Companies?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1231.\n\nThe second category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC's Withdrawal Letter was the following:\n\nNow we have information demonstrating that the management of certain Russian legal entities affiliated with the Company did not control the activities of these entities, rather these legal entities were fully controlled directly by the Company's management. Since the management of these affiliated entities were not in control of these entities' activities, the court found that these activities were fictitious. Consecutively, the courts found that the profit earned by these legal entities affiliated with the Company was a profit of the Company, and therefore the Company should have accrued and paid taxes on this profit. Nevertheless, in the course of the audits, the Company's management told us that key issues of the activities of these affiliated legal entities were under supervision and control of their own management.1605\n\nPwC's Withdrawal Letter, Exh. C-611.\n\n1232.\n\nThis is an issue that was traversed at length in Chapters VIII.A and B of the present Award.\n\n1233.\n\nClaimants argued that PwC was fully aware of the structures of the trading companies, and that in the context of the preparation of Yukos' U.S. GAAP financial statements, PwC had given specific and detailed advice to Yukos on how to demonstrate control over affiliated companies so that they could be included within the consolidation umbrella.1606 Respondent accuses Claimants of conflating concepts of accounting (control relationships amongst various Yukos entities for consolidation purposes under the U.S. GAAP), which PwC *did* understand, with questions of tax (how much *actual* control Yukos exerted at an operational level over the trading shells from Moscow while maintaining the fiction of management in the low-tax region to avoid tax under Russian tax law), which PwC certainly did *not* appreciate, because it never audited the trading companies.1607 Respondent does not actually refer to any \"new\" information PwC learned which would have caused them concern about this in June 2007; it simply points to a series of negatives (PwC did *not* design the trading company scheme, PwC did *not* audit the trading companies).\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 469-70, referring to PwC Memorandum \"Audit Summary Points and Matters For Partner Attention\u201431 December 1999 and 1998,\" Exh.

C-1233.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 64.\n\n1234.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent referred to the August 2007 interrogation of Mr. Kubena's predecessor as PwC tax advisor in Russia, Mr. Klubnichkin, to show PwC never audited the trading companies.1608 While PwC was fully aware of Yukos' use of the tax optimization scheme, Mr. Klubnichkin said, it was *not* aware of any abusive elements. Mr. Klubnichkin said that as Yukos' auditor, PwC had \"never been aware of the fictitious nature of these \u2018operational' companies.... The deceit lies in the fact that a corporation creates false appearance of normal activity, of a serious business, with respect to a fictitious business.... We could only learn about such nature of these companies in case of a full audit of these companies themselves, which would include our visits to their operational premises.\"1609 The Tribunal notes that Mr. Klubnichkin's interrogation took place in August 2007, *after* the PwC withdrawal.\n\nRespondent's Closing Slides, pp. 205, citing Interrogation of K.M. Klubnichkin, 1 August 2007, Exh. RHB-S-72 (in English)/C-1065, RP 9988-9997 (in Russian).\n\nInterrogation of K.M. Klubnichkin, 1 August 2007, Exh. RHB-S-72 (in English)/C-1065, RP 9988-9997 (in Russian).\n\n1235.\n\nRespondent submits that PwC did not know about the Lesnoy assessments. Respondent thus disputes that PwC was ever aware that the trading companies were sham entities directly controlled by Yukos from Moscow, and disputes that Yukos' tax scheme was adopted on PwC's advice or recommendation.1610\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.\n\n1236.\n\nClaimants' response is two-fold. Firstly, they refer to oral and documentary evidence in the record confirming PwC's participation in the Yukos tax scheme in the regions.1611 They point to a contemporaneous internal memo from PwC Cyprus to PwC Moscow, which discloses that PwC was familiar with the details of the group structure and the relationships of the trading companies.1612 In addition, Claimants underline the closeness of Yukos' relationship with PwC as shown by PwC's attendance at an \"international symposium\" held by Yukos in early 2002, at which tax issues, group structure, international accounting standards and related party disclosure requirements were discussed.1613\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 135-42, citing Transcript, Day 6 at 27 (cross-examination of Mr. Rieger); Transcript, Day 4 at 27 (cross-examination of Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet). Mr. Misamore recalled that it was PwC's recommendation to use indirect control for purposes of consolidation. Transcript, Day 9 at 34. Mr. Theede recalled that PwC had been the \"architect\" of the domestic trading companies' structure. Transcript, Day 11 at 50. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet specified that Yukos, as in the case of other Russian companies, had \"made use of means of tax optimization that were provided for by Russian law\" and that \"these means had been recommended and put in place by PwC's experts.\" Morizet WS \u00b6 24. *See also* Letter from Enrique Munoz to Michel Soublin, 13 October 2000, Exh.

C-1064, CP4146.\n\n1237.\n\nFinally, Claimants point to a timing problem that in their view undermines the credibility of PwC's statement that it obtained \"new information\" only in May 2007. The Tribunal finds much force in Claimants' submission that PwC was on notice of the Russian Federation's alleged concerns about Yukos' tax optimization structure at least as early as January 2004, when it issued its opinion on the 2000 Audit Report. As Yukos' auditor since 1997, PwC obviously had a strong incentive in ensuring that its previous audit reports were accurate, and if there was anything new or worrying in what it had seen, it would have raised it at the time. PwC did not withdraw the audits in 2004, 2005, or 2006 when the issues were being aired through the Russian courts and in the public domain. Rather it waited three and a half years, and then suddenly decided that there was \"new information\" on the basis of which the audits should be withdrawn.\n\n**iii. Did Yukos' Management Lie to PwC about Transactions with Bank Menatep?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1238.\n\nThe third category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC's Withdrawal Letter was the following:\n\nIn the course of the Investigation, we were shown documents demonstrating that the Company had made significant payments to meet liabilities of the companies effectively owned and controlled by Group Menatep before AKB Menatep Bank. Complete information about the nature of these transactions and relations was not disclosed to us in the course of the audits.1614\n\nPwC's Withdrawal Letter, Exh. C-611.\n\n1239.\n\nThis \"new information\" concerned transactions going back to the late 1990s, when Yukos purchased what Respondent calls \"worthless claims\" against Bank Menatep, which was in bankruptcy at the time.1615 The principal shareholders of Bank Menatep were the same as the principal shareholders of Yukos. PwC was concerned that the purchase of claims against a bankrupt bank was undertaken to further the interests of the companies' common shareholders, using Yukos' funds and at the expense of Yukos' minority shareholders. By May 2000, Yukos had accumulated USD 500 million in claims against Bank Menatep, but had at most USD 220 million in guarantees.\n\nWhite & Case, Memorandum, 25 July 2001, Exh. R-3585.\n\n1240.\n\nDuring one of the 2007 interrogations, Mr. Miller was shown minutes of a May 2000 meeting, in which Yukos' managers stated that \"it would be not be desirable to disclose this information since those shares were bought out from the borrowers.\"1616 The minutes then state that \"[i]t is necessary to immediately demonstrate to the Company's auditors the intention to sell the excess of the purchased assets\u2014with a book profit\u2014to unrelated third parties....\" Although Mr. Miller could not in fact remember if he worked on this issue or if the information was disclosed to PwC, he was outraged what he described as the \"unacceptable manipulation of information\" revealed by the minutes and by Yukos' plan to lie to the auditors about its worthless claims against Bank Menatep.1617\n\nMinutes of Meeting, 31 May 2000, Exh. C-1231.\n\nReply \u00b6 481, citing to Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office, Record of Interrogation of Douglas Miller, 4 June 2007, Exh. R-871.\n\n1241.\n\nClaimants assert that PwC was always fully aware of the substance of the transactions concerning the assumption of Bank Menatep's debt, and that the transactions were accounted for in Yukos' financial statements and draft F-1 forms.1618\n\nYukos U.S. GAAP Consolidated Financial Statements, 31 December 1999, Exh.

Did Yukos' Management Lie to PwC about its Compensation Payments to Certain VPL Managers?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1242.\n\nThe fourth category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC's Withdrawal Letter was the following:\n\nThe Company failed to timely disclose to us information about certain payments made by the shareholders of Group Menatep in favor of certain individuals, who were leading executives of the Company at the time of its privatization. In the course of the Investigation, some information disclosed to us ran counter to the explanations given to us by the management and shareholders of the Company in the course of our audits with regard to the exact nature of those payments.1619\n\nPwC's Withdrawal Letter, Exh. C-611.\n\n1243.\n\nThis allegation concerned the extraordinarily generous compensation plan that had been put in place for certain persons who had been managers of Yukos at the time of its privatization. PwC suspected that the immense sums paid to those persons could not have been for services rendered to Yukos itself. Respondent alleges that Yukos had misrepresented to PwC the purpose of the compensation plan. PwC's long-held suspicion about the nature of the payments was only confirmed when the Prosecutor General showed Mr. Miller statements signed by the beneficiaries of the payments to the effect that they had been made to them \"not for services provided to Yukos but were... connected to Group Menatep's acquisition of Yukos.\"1620 Mr. Miller expressed \"indignation\" at the \"lie\" and alleged that Mr. Khodorkovsky had told him he would go to jail if forced to disclose the real reason for the payments.1621 This category of so-called \"lies\" was seen as important to PwC not in terms of material effect on the audited reports, but insofar as they undermined the credibility of Yukos' management's statements.1622\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 724, 728, citing to Minutes of Audit Committee of the Yukos Board of Directors, 26 February 2003, Exh.

R-4309.\n\n1244.\n\nClaimants affirm that Mr. Miller had always been familiar with the payment arrangements. How the payments are identified in the accounts is only an accounting issue (as opined by Clifford Chance and Cleary Gottlieb at the time).1623 When PwC signed off on the Yukos financial statements, they were aware of the issue. Even Mr. Miller acknowledged that the \"reliability of the financial statements is not affected.\"1624 Claimants were prepared to disclose the existence and purpose of the compensation fund to the public for the ADR listing.1625\n\nReply \u00b6 461, citing to E-mail from Doug Miller to Bruce Misamore, 14 August 2002, attaching PwC Memorandum \"Veteran Managers' Plan and Agreement: Determination of Accounting for Plan,\" Exh.

For example, the fact that PwC did not audit the trading shells would have been known to Mr. Miller before June 2007. PwC would have known about alleged \"sham\" or \"abusive\" elements of the Yukos tax optimization scheme at least as early as January 2004 when it was shown the 2000 Audit Report. It is not understandable that PwC would wait until June 2007 before determining that its audits were unreliable. Respondent itself notes that \"[a] question can be raised as to whether PwC waited too long to withdraw its audit opinions.\"1626\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 708.\n\n1246.\n\nIn addition, PwC said that its withdrawal letter was drafted on the basis of \"new\" information that Mr. Miller learned in the course of his interrogations in May 2007. However, it appears that a draft withdrawal letter was prepared as early as March of that year.1627\n\nIn the Matter of an Application of Michael Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev for an Order Seeking Discovery Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782, Declaration of Laurie Endsley, 31 January 2011 \u00b6 9, Exh. R-881.\n\n1247.\n\nPwC was clearly pressed by the Russian authorities to find grounds for withdrawing its audits of Yukos. Bearing in mind the complexity of the Yukos structure, the business environment at the time it was set up, and the grey areas of Russian tax law at the time, it is not surprising that PwC could identify elements of evidence with respect to some aspects of Yukos' business practice that it affirms gave rise to credibility issues. As far as the Tribunal can judge, Yukos may not have been candid in its representations to PwC about control of the BBS Companies and about the reasons for the immense payments Yukos undertook to make, and did make, to individuals who were involved in its privatization.\n\n1248.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal cannot accept that the four issues identified in PwC's Withdrawal Letter were in fact \"new\" for PwC. In addition, even if the information was new, it was not unequivocal, and could have been tested with Yukos when it was still operational. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that PwC did not give former Yukos senior officials an opportunity to comment on the new information before signing the withdrawal letter. At the Hearing, Mr. Misamore testified that he stood by the following statement he made in 2009 in relation to the PwC withdrawal:\n\nPWC never said anything to me or, as far as I know, anyone else at Yukos, to my knowledge, about a lack of information or the refusal to provide information, other than the instance concerning the ownership interests in [the] BBS [Companies]. If PWC had asked me to intervene\u2014and I did intervene with the BBS inquiry\u2014I would have gone to Group Menatep shareholders or their lawyers, and would have urged the release of the requested information.1628\n\nRecord of Interview of Bruce Misamore, 9 March 2009, p. 51, Exh. R-3347.\n\n1249.\n\nAccording to Respondent's accounting expert, Mr. Ellison, who was not cross-examined, the U.S. Statement of Auditing Standards No. 1 sets the following standard for the \"Subsequent Discovery of Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor's Report\":\n\nWhen the auditor becomes aware of information which relates to financial statements previously reported on by him, but which was not known to him at the date of his report, and which is of such a nature and from such a source that he would have investigated it had it come to his attention during the course of his audit, he should, as soon as practicable, undertake to determine whether the information is reliable and whether the facts existed at the date of his report. In this connection, the auditor should discuss the matter with his client at whatever management levels he deems appropriate, including the board of directors, and request cooperation in whatever investigation may be necessary.1629 [emphasis added]\n\nU.S. Statement of Auditing Standards No. 1, Section 561(4), attached as Exh. 4 to Ellison Report.\n\n1250.\n\nSimilar steps are expected to be taken under international and Russian auditing standards.1630 Mr. Ellison notes that PwC's Withdrawal Letter stated that \"due to the company undergoing bankruptcy and the former company executives no longer working for the company, PwC was unable to access the information required that could lead to revision of the financial statements and was also unable to discuss the matter with management, as recommended by [the audit standards].\" Mr. Ellison concludes that under those circumstances \"PwC had no option but to withdraw its audit reports.\"1631\n\nMr. Ellison refers to a similar obligation to \"discuss the matter with management\" under the International Auditing Standards ISA 560 and Russian Federal Auditing Rule No. 10. Ellison Report \u00b6\u00b6 3.5.5, 3.5.11, 3.6.1.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 3.4.28.\n\n1251.\n\nMr. Ellison observes that when a reputable international firm withdraws an audit opinion it is an \"unusual and serious\" event.1632 In light of the seriousness of the decision to withdraw the audit opinions, and the industry standard of consulting with the audited company before taking any action, it is noteworthy that PwC made no effort to reach out to Yukos' management or exmanagement to discuss the \"new\" information.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 2.3.1.\n\n1252.\n\nPwC's senior executives confided to the U.S. Embassy that the withdrawal decision was a \"difficult\" call.1633 At stake for PwC on the one hand was its reputation and loyalty to a \"dead\" client, and on the other hand its continued viability in the Russian market. As the cables reveal, Russia mattered to PwC.1634 PwC's senior executives met with the Russian Government to resolve PwC's problems. And, as noted earlier, after PwC made its decision, criminal charges were dropped, and PwC prevailed in two lawsuits, received a refund of its fines, maintained its license and retained important Russian clients such as Gazprom. As observed by Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, \"PwC undoubtedly opted in the end for the most pragmatic approach so as to maintain its office in Russia and protect its employees from being sued.\"1635\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW3343, \"Russia: PricewaterhouseCoopers Withdraws Audits of Yukos,\" 9 July 2007 \u00b6 7, Exh. C-1358.\n\nU.S. State Department Cable No. 07MOSCOW5403, \"PWC's travails in Russia worsen,\" 15 November 2007 \u00b6 8, Exh. C-1360.\n\nKosciusko-Morizet WS \u00b6 25.\n\n1253.\n\nAs the Tribunal stated at the outset of this chapter, PwC is not on trial before this Tribunal, which draws no conclusion in the present Award about PwC's professional conduct. However, the pressure mounted by the Russian authorities against Yukos' auditors, which led to PwC's eventual withdrawal of its audits and even to a PwC auditor testifying against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev at their second trial, informs the Tribunal's view that Yukos was the object of a series of politically-motivated attacks by the Russian authorities that eventually led to its destruction, as alleged by Claimants.\n\n**IX. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n1254.\n\nBefore turning to the central question of Respondent's liability under the ECT on the basis of the extensive factual record canvassed in the preceding Part VIII, the Tribunal addresses in this Part IX three preliminary objections made by Respondent, including two that were not finally resolved in the Tribunal's Interim Awards.\n\n1255.\n\nThe Tribunal considers, in this order, Respondent's preliminary objections related to: (a) the ECT's \"fork-in-the-road\" provision\u2014Article 26(3)(b)(i); (b) Claimants' allegedly \"unclean hands\"; and (c) the relevance of Article 21 of the ECT.\n\n**A. ARE ALL OR SOME OF THE CLAIMS BARRED BY THE \"FORK-IN-THE-ROAD\" PROVISION OF THE ECT?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1256.\n\nArticle 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT contains the ECT's \"fork-in-the-road\" provision. It must be read together with the preceding paragraphs of Article 26:\n\n*Article 26*\n\nSETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN AN INVESTOR AND A CONTRACTING PARTY\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b)(i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b);\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n[...]\n\n1257.\n\nBefore turning to the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal recalls its dismissal in the Interim Awards of Respondent's identical Article 26(3)(b)(i) objection to jurisdiction and/or admissibility:\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent's arguments are unconvincing. Indeed, in its written submissions, Respondent did appear to concede that, as a general matter, there is ample authority for the application of a \"triple identity\" test [identity of parties, cause of action and object of the dispute] in the context of a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision. To that extent, there is no question that the various Russian court proceedings and applications to the European Court of Human Rights cited by Respondent fail to trigger the \"fork-in-the-road provision\" of the ECT.1636\n\nInterim Awards \u00b6\u00b6 598-600 (YUL); 609-11 (VPL); 597-99 (Hulley).\n\n**2. Parties' Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n1258.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent renews its objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT. In its view, developments subsequent to the Interim Awards show that Claimants, as Yukos shareholders, are seeking before the ECtHR damages for the same alleged loss arising from Yukos' demise. Accordingly, Respondent submits that the ECT arbitrations expose it to double recovery.1637\n\nRespondent's Counter Memorial \u00b6 837.\n\n1259.\n\nRespondent relies on the Application for Just Satisfaction made by Yukos' former representative, Mr. Gardner, before the ECtHR, requesting damages \"and, for the first time... compensation for the \u2018ultimate stakeholders' in Yukos through a Stichting created under Dutch law.\"1638 Respondent argues that these circumstances deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction under Articles 26(3)(b)(i) and 26(2)(b), and Annex ID of the ECT.1639\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 369; Counter-Memorial \u00b6 827.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 828. Annex ID lists the Contracting Parties that have conditioned their consent to the submission of a dispute under the Treaty to international arbitration on the condition that the Investor has not previously submitted the dispute to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute. The Russian Federation is listed in Annex ID. (Interim Awards \u00b6\u00b6 588-89 (YUL); \u00b6\u00b6 599-600 (VPL); \u00b6\u00b6 587-88 (Hulley).\n\n1260.\n\nRespondent submits that the European Convention on Human Rights (\" **ECHR** \") and ECT claims share the same fundamental basis, and, accordingly, the ECT claims should be dismissed. As previously submitted in its First Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Respondent emphasizes that its consent to submit a dispute to international arbitration is expressly conditioned on Claimants not having already submitted the dispute to a \"previously agreed dispute resolution procedure,\" pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) read in conjunction with Article 26(2)(a) and Annex ID of the ECT.1640\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 829.\n\n1261.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal's dismissal of this objection was premised on the \"incorrect assumption\" that the parties in the proceedings before the ECtHR and the present proceedings are different.1641 Respondent further submits that the Tribunal erred in \"fail[ing] to mention the requirements of the \u2018triple identity test' and state which requirement was not fulfilled.\"1642 In satisfaction of the identity threshold, Respondent submits as follows:\n\n\u2022 the Application for Just Satisfaction before the ECtHR establishes that the \"\u2018ultimate stakeholders', including Claimants, are the only Yukos interests that are represented in the EC[t]HR proceedings\";1643\n\n\u2022 the monetary relief requested in both proceedings for Yukos' alleged expropriation is identical;1644 and\n\n\u2022 the ECHR and ECT claims both aim to obtain compensation for the purported expropriation of Yukos and \"have the same normative source,\" as Article 13(1) of the ECT and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 ECHR do not lay down independent standards by which Respondent's conduct is to be judged.1645\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 830.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 831.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 832.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 833.\n\n1262.\n\nClaimants maintain their rejection of this objection, emphasizing in their Reply that \"it is entirely inappropriate and an abuse of process for the Respondent now to seek to reopen this issue.\"1646\n\nReply \u00b6 967.\n\n1263.\n\nFirstly, Claimants emphasize that the merits phase of these arbitrations is not an instance of appeal and, further, that the principles of *res judicata* and *ne bis in idem* are absolute bars to Respondent renewing this objection.1647\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 969.\n\n1264.\n\nSecondly, Claimants submit that Respondent's contention that the parties in the ECtHR proceedings and these arbitrations are the same is incorrect. Mr. Gardner1648 does not act on behalf of Claimants, nor did Claimants make any submissions in those proceedings. Contrary to Respondent's characterization, Mr. Gardner was not seeking compensation \"on behalf of Claimants.\" Rather, Claimants say Mr. Gardner he was simply arguing that the destruction of the Company need not pose an obstacle to an award of just satisfaction, \"because the Dutch Foundation was able to receive such an award and dispose of it in accordance with its statutes.\"1649 Claimants also highlight that Mr. Gardner's submission is dated 4 May 2009, thus preceding the Interim Awards in these arbitrations by several months.\n\nYukos' counsel before the ECtHR.\n\nReply \u00b6 971.\n\n1265.\n\nThirdly, Claimants submit that Respondent advanced essentially the same argument previously before the ECtHR. Claimants submit that Respondent's position in that regard was rejected by the ECtHR because the parties in the ECT arbitrations were different, and thus the matters were not substantially the same.1650\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 972, citing ECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6\u00b6 524-26.\n\n1266.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that no issue of double recovery arises in these arbitrations. They repeat the disclaimer they provided to the Tribunal on 1 April 2010, that \"should any pecuniary damages be awarded to Yukos in the ECtHR proceedings, and should the Claimants receive any payments, such payments would be deducted from the amounts claimed in these arbitrations.\"1651\n\nReply \u00b6 963, citing Letter from the Claimants to the Arbitral Tribunal of 1 April 2010.\n\n1267.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to the 2012 decision in *Chevron v. Ecuador*,1652 which, according to Respondent, confirms \"a narrow interpretation of \u2018fork-in-the-road' provisions that focuses strictly on the legal bases of the claims would deprive such a clause of effective scope.\"1653\n\n*Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2009-23, Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 27 February 2012 (hereinafter \" *Chevron v. Ecuador* \").\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 370, citing *Chevron v. Ecuador* \u00b6 4.76.\n\n1268.\n\nRespondent also objects to Claimants' *res judicata* argument. Respondent submits that the ECtHR proceedings, which were \"formally instituted by Yukos, under Claimants' direction and control\" and involve \"the very same economic interests that are represented in these arbitrations, constitute a special circumstance that justifies a new examination of Respondent's Article 26(3)(b)(i) ECT objection.\"1654\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 374.\n\n1269.\n\nRespondent also alleges that Claimants admit there is privity of interest between the two proceedings. In support of this assertion, Respondent refers to:\n\n\u2022 the passage of the Reply (mentioned at paragraph 1266 above) where Claimants state that they will deduct any payments they receive in the ECtHR proceedings from the amounts claimed in these arbitrations; and\n\n\u2022 the Application for Just Satisfaction (mentioned at paragraph 1261 above), where Mr. Gardner characterized Claimants in these arbitrations as the \"ultimate stakeholders\" in Yukos.1655\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 369.\n\n1270.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimants' reliance on positions that the ECtHR has already finally rejected - namely that Respondent's taxation measures against Yukos were *mala fides*, briefed extensively in its Rejoinder,1656 \"creates a risk of conflicting determinations, one of the ills that Article 26(3)(b)(i) ECT is designed to avoid.\"1657\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 99-193.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 374.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n1271.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' submissions and reviewed the reasons for its dismissal in the Interim Awards of Respondent's identical objection to jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, the Tribunal sees no reason to reopen this issue and change its decision.\n\n1272.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent's objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT is dismissed.\n\n**B. \"UNCLEAN HANDS\" (DID CLAIMANTS ACT ILLEGALLY SO AS TO DEPRIVE THEM OFPROTECTION UNDER THE ECT?)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1273.\n\nAs its second preliminary objection, Respondent submits that Claimants have come to this Tribunal with \"unclean hands,\" with one or many of the following consequences: (a) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Claimants' claims; (b) Claimants' claims are inadmissible; and/or (c) Claimants should be deprived of the substantive protections of the ECT. The Tribunal addresses this argument in the present chapter.\n\n1274.\n\nShould the Tribunal reject the \"unclean hands\" argument as a preliminary objection, Respondent also submits that some instances of Claimants' unclean hands should be treated as contributory fault and/or a failure to mitigate on the part of Claimants, and that any damages awarded to Claimants should be discounted on the basis of their unclean hands. These arguments are addressed in Chapters X.E and XII.C.\n\n1275.\n\nRespondent initially made its \"unclean hands\" argument in the jurisdictional phase of these arbitrations. In Paragraph 3 of its Procedural Order No. 3 dated 31 October 2006, the Tribunal decided that it would be \"appropriate to defer consideration of the Parties' contentions concerning \u2018unclean hands' [and] Respondent's \u2018criminal enterprise' contention... to the merits phase, if any.\"\n\n1276.\n\nIn its Interim Awards, the Tribunal stated:\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware of Respondent's argument that Claimant in this arbitration has \"unclean hands\" and that Claimant's corporate personality should be disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise.\" The Tribunal recalls that it addressed these issues in its Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3 on 8 September and 31 October 2006. Specifically, the Tribunal then decided to defer consideration of Respondent's arguments concerning the \"unclean hands\" of Claimant or Claimant being an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise\" to any merits phase of this arbitration. Accordingly, by finding, as it does, that Claimant qualifies as an Investor owning and controlling an Investment for the purposes of Articles 1(7) and (6) of the ECT, the Tribunal does not dispose of the issues argued by Respondent concerning the \"unclean hands\" of Claimant and Claimant being an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise,\" which it will address during any merits phase of this arbitration.1658\n\nInterim Awards \u00b6 435 (Hulley); \u00b6 436; (YUL); \u00b6 492 (VPL).\n\n1277.\n\nAs anticipated in the Interim Awards, now with the benefit of a full presentation of the facts by the Parties on all aspects of the Yukos affair, the Tribunal addresses Respondent's \"unclean hands\" argument in this final Award.\n\n1278.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in their First Submission on Costs, Claimants argue that Respondent, after insisting on its \"unclean hands\" allegations and the assertion that Claimants are an instrumentality of a \"criminal enterprise\" in the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration and dedicating nearly two hundred pages of its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder to the first of these two arguments, ultimately abandoned these arguments at the Hearing, pursuing only the allegations related to alleged abuse by Claimants of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.1659 In its Reply Submission on Costs, Respondent confirmed that it had not abandoned its unclean hands defense. To the contrary, Respondent argued that Claimants had explicitly refused to join issue and submit rebuttal and Respondent had accordingly relied on its arguments as undisputed and accepted. According to Respondent, this alleviated the need to devote substantial hearing time to these points.1660\n\nExh. C-916.\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs \u00b6\u00b6 16-18\n\n1279.\n\nClaimants correctly observe that at the merits hearing (and in their Post-Hearing Brief) Respondent expanded only on the Cyprus-Russia DTA abuses part of its \"unclean hands\" argument, making only passing reference to other aspects of this argument.1661 However, in the Tribunal's view, this circumstance speaks only to Respondent's freedom to present its case as it chooses, and represents Respondent's strategic decision to focus on certain arguments instead of others in the limited time available to it at the Hearing and within the page limit for posthearing submissions imposed by the Tribunal. The fact that Respondent did not repeat in full all of the arguments made in previous pleadings at the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief does not mean that these arguments were abandoned.\n\n*See e.g.* Transcript, Day 19 at 169-74, 179; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 146, 148.\n\n1280.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal first summarizes the factual allegations constituting the foundation of Respondent's \"unclean hands\" argument and then the Parties' arguments regarding the impact of the alleged facts on the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the admissibility of claims and the availability of the substantive protections of the ECT to Claimants. In the last section of this chapter, the Tribunal sets out its decision with respect to \"unclean hands\" as a preliminary objection.\n\n**2. Claimants' Alleged \"Unclean Hands\"**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1281.\n\nRespondent lists 28 instances of alleged \"illegal and bad faith conduct\" by Claimants or \"attributable to\" Claimants involving a variety of actors and spanning over ten years, from the privatization of Yukos in the mid-1990s to its liquidation in November 2007. Claimants dispute that any of their conduct (or any conduct attributable to them) was illegal or in bad faith.\n\n1282.\n\nGiven the number and diversity of Respondent's allegations, the Tribunal presents them below in groups intended to facilitate its subsequent analysis. Where facts related to Respondent's \"unclean hands\" allegations fall outside the scope of the analysis of the factual background set out in Part VIII above, they are briefly summarized here.\n\n**(a) Conduct Related to the Acquisition of Yukos and the Subsequent Consolidation of Control over Yukos and its Subsidiaries**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1283.\n\nThe first eleven items of Respondent's list of \"illegal and bad faith conduct\" are dedicated to conduct related to the acquisition of Yukos by Bank Menatep; and the so-called \"Oligarchs\" and their subsequent consolidation of control and ownership over Yukos and its subsidiaries:\n\ni. Violating the legal requirements governing the loans-for-shares program that allowed Menatep to gain its controlling interest in Yukos.\n\nii. Using shell company proxies to feign competition in the loans-for-shares auction and a simultaneous investment tender for Yukos shares.\n\niii. Precluding actual competitors from bidding on Yukos shares in the loans-for-shares auction and investment tender, including through the abuse of Menatep's role as auction organizer to disqualify Russian competitors.\n\niv. Rigging a subsequent auction for the Yukos shares that were being held as collateral following the initial loans-for-shares auction, which deprived the Russian Government of substantial revenue.\n\nv. Conspiring with Yukos' pre-existing managers to facilitate the unlawful acquisition of Yukos by the Oligarchs, including by entering into an agreement whereby \"Yukos Universal\" committed to pay them compensation consisting of 15% of Menatep's beneficial interest in Yukos, ultimately worth billions of dollars, for \"services rendered to \u2018Yukos'\".\n\nvi. Colluding with others to predetermine the post-privatization ownership of Yukos.\n\nvii. Skimming profits from Yukos and its production subsidiaries for their own selfenrichment.\n\nviii. Abusing Russian corporate law and principles of corporate governance by squeezing out minority shareholders in Yukos' production subsidiaries through ruthless and self-enriching share dilutions, asset stripping, and transfer pricing.\n\nix. Siphoning off huge sums for the benefit of the Oligarchs from Yukos' proceeds from the sale of oil and oil products, while concealing related-party transactions from Yukos' own auditor.\n\nx. Further mistreatment of minority shareholders by manipulating shareholder meetings, pressuring the Russian Federal Securities Commission not to pursue its challenges against illegal misconduct, relying on fraudulently determined stock and asset values and deceiving those minority shareholders, the government, and domestic and foreign courts about the nature and control of offshore companies that were created to benefit Claimants and their cohorts.\n\nxi. Manipulating Yukos' stock value to devalue and reacquire the interests of creditors to which Yukos stock had been pledged.1662\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1435-36.\n\n1284.\n\nAs context to Respondent's allegations, it is useful to recall some of Yukos' early history. The Russian Federation created the company in 1993 as part of a large-scale reorganization of the Soviet oil production and processing industry into vertically integrated oil companies. Yukos remained largely state-run until 1995.1663\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 19.\n\n1285.\n\nRespondent recounts, based on a report by Professor Reinier Kraakman that, in March 1995, a consortium of Russian commercial banks, including Bank Menatep (the Chairman of which was Mr. Khodorkovsky), proposed to the Russian government that they would lend it money in exchange for the right to hold as collateral and manage shares of major state-owned companies such as Yukos.1664 A presidential decree of August 1995 provided for the auctioning of the right to hold and manage shares of individual companies.1665 Once the terms of the proposed management agreement expired, the government would have a choice between paying back the loan and reclaiming its shares, and allowing the lender to sell the shares, with the government keeping 70 percent of the difference between the sale price and the original amount of the loan.1666 This mechanism became known as the \"loans-for-shares program.\"\n\n*Ibid*.\u00b6 20.\n\nDecree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 889 On the Procedure for Putting the Federally Owned Shares in Pledge, 31 August 1995, Exh. R-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 21.\n\n1286.\n\nIn December 1995, the Russian Government retained Bank Menatep to organize the auction for the shares in Yukos.1667\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 23.\n\n1287.\n\nRespondent alleges that Bank Menatep \"completely rigged the auction\" by preventing potential competitors from participating, while using two front companies, Laguna and Regent, to formally comply with the requirements for bids.1668 Respondent recounts that Laguna won the right to hold as collateral and manage a 45 percent stake in Yukos for a USD 159 million loan to the Russian government and an additional investment obligation of USD 200 million. According to Respondent, Laguna acquired an additional 33 percent stake in Yukos by pledging just over USD 150 million in investments at a simultaneously held \"investment tender.\"1669 Bank Menatep acquired Laguna's rights to hold and manage Yukos shares immediately thereafter.1670 Respondent further alleges that Bank Menatep then used \"another rigged auction and another shell affiliate, named Monblan,\" to obtain full ownership of the stake in Yukos.1671 Respondent also suggests that Bank Menatep was \"an insider among insiders\" and used Yukos' own funds to pay for its takeover of Yukos.1672\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 28.\n\nKraakman Report \u00b6 20.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 29.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 33.\n\n1288.\n\nRespondent makes additional allegations regarding Bank Menatep's and the Oligarchs' treatment of foreign and Russian investors holding minority shares in Yukos' main production subsidiaries\u2014YNG, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft\u2014in the aftermath of the privatization.1673 Respondent alleges that from 1996 to 1999 Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs engaged in significant profit skimming and, in 1999 and 2000, abused Russian corporate law and principles of corporate governance to \"squeeze out the minority shareholders through massive share dilutions, transfer pricing, and asset stripping,\"1674 until \"the minority shareholders sold or swapped their shares on the Oligarchs' terms.\"1675\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 45.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 915, 946-49; *see* Kraakman Report \u00b6\u00b6 28-42.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 916, 951-61, 75; *see* Kraakman Report \u00b6\u00b6 44-62.\n\n1289.\n\nClaimants do not engage with the detail of Respondent's allegations. They contend that these allegations \"amount to little more than innuendo based upon a handful of sensationalized journalistic accounts.\"1676 In particular, Claimants point out that Respondent is \"unable to make out any failure by Bank Menatep to comply with the terms of the loans-for-shares program\"1677 and underline that it was the Russian government itself that had the authority to preclude foreign companies and individuals from bidding and to disallow bids.1678 Claimants add that Respondent's \"vague insinuations\" as to the source of funds used to privatize Yukos do not prove that anything unlawful took place.1679 Claimants suggest that Respondent's argument \"amounts to nothing more than an attempt to shift blame for the actions of the Russian Government itself onto Bank Menatep.\"1680\n\nReply \u00b6 1142.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1143.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 1144-45.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1146.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1147.\n\n1290.\n\nAs regards the manner of the consolidation of Bank Menatep's ownership over Yukos, Claimants reply that Respondent's allegations are vague and \"not only irrelevant, but also moot.\"1681 Claimants point out that Respondent relies on share issuances and transfers that were ultimately cancelled and on an alleged dispute with a minority shareholder that was eventually settled.1682\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 1149, 1151-53.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 1149-50.\n\n**(b) Conduct Related to the Cyprus-Russia DTA**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1291.\n\nNext, Respondent complains of Claimants' use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, listing the following \"bad faith and illegal conduct\":\n\nxii. Submitting fraudulent claims under, or otherwise abusing, the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty to evade hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes payable on dividends involving Yukos shares, thereby also violating Russian and Cypriot criminal laws.\n\nxiii. Entering into hundreds of sham transactions involving the sale and repurchase of Yukos shares between Claimants and their affiliates, the sole purpose of which was to fraudulently suggest that Claimants beneficially owned dividends declared on Yukos shares, and thereby to further Claimants' fraudulent claims for favorable tax treatment under the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty.\n\nxiv. Evading hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes on profits from transactions in and profits from sales of Yukos shares.\n\n[...]\n\nxvi. Diverting the proceeds of the Yukos tax evasion scheme into highly opaque Cypriot and British Virgin Islands entities and trusts to conceal the unlawful provenance of those proceeds, including through dividend distributions to undisclosed Cypriot parent companies of trading shells, thereby further abusing the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty.1683\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1435-36.\n\n1292.\n\nThe Russia-Cyprus DTA, as stated in its preamble, serves the \"avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital\" and the promotion of \"economic cooperation between the two countries.\" Article 10 of the DTA provides:\n\n1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.\n\n2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:\n\n5% of the gross amount of the dividends..\"\n\n1293.\n\nThe Parties agree that Claimants Hulley and VPL obtained monetary benefits running in excess of USD 230 million under this provision by claiming the reduced withholding tax rate of 5 percent instead of the standard 15 percent rate of the Russian Federation.\n\n1294.\n\nRespondent argues that, in so doing, Hulley and VPL fraudulently relied on the Russia-Cyprus DTA to evade Russian taxes, because they: (a) were not the \"beneficial owners\" of the dividend income but mere \"conduits\" for the Oligarchs, and (b) had a \"permanent establishment\" in Russia to which the dividend income was attributable.1684 According to Respondent, Claimants' reliance on the DTA was a \"complete perversion of the Treaty's purpose,\" and, as stated by Professor Rosenbloom, a \"blatant example of tax treaty abuse.\"1685 Respondent alleges that Claimants contrived a series of artificial sales and repurchases of Yukos shares by Hulley from YUL, and VPL parked shares in a UBS Moscow account at suspicious times, solely to benefit from the DTA. According to Respondent, Claimants offer no justification for this practice, aside from their expert, Mr. Baker, mischaracterizing it as a \"standard arrangement.\"1686\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 922-23; Rejoinder \u00b6 1448.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 165; Rosenbloom Report \u00b6 77.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1488-90; Baker Report, \u00b670.\n\n1295.\n\nRespondent submits that the beneficial ownership requirement \"should be construed in light of the object and purposes of the [DTA], including avoiding double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion and avoidance.\"1687 According to Respondent, Hulley and VPL never had the full right to use or enjoy Yukos' dividends. In support, Respondent refers to the following documents:\n\n\u2022 Hulley's and VPL's bank statements from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004, as well as GML's statement for 2004, which purportedly establish that the dividends paid to Hulley and VPL by Yukos only stayed in their accounts for one or two days prior to going to YUL;1688\n\n\u2022 Hulley's Articles of Association, which according to Respondent reserved to the \"Oligarchs\" any decision concerning the disposal of Hulley's assets;1689 and\n\n\u2022 the Deed of Appointment of Chiltern as a custodian trustee for VPL, which, according to Respondent, provides that all dividend income from VPL's Yukos shares \"shall be paid\" to YUL so long as Chiltern owns VPL.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1449, relying on the 2011 OECD Discussion Draft for the Model Tax Convention, Exh. R-1959.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1457-65, referring to Exhs. R-334 to R-4154.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1466-87, referring to Exh. R-236.\n\n1296.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimants have contradicted their own arguments in the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings by acknowledging an \"obligation to pass all future dividends\" to YUL; this, argues Respondent, falls within even Claimants' narrow interpretation of the beneficial ownership limitation.1690\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1478-79.\n\n1297.\n\nRespondent further asserts that Hulley and VPL each had a \"Russian permanent establishment.\"1691 Respondent interprets Claimants' admission that Hulley and VPL were holding companies to mean that any activity necessary to conduct the business of holding Yukos shares had to be carried out in Russia through a \"deemed permanent establishment\" (Article 5(5) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA) or a \"fixed place of business\" (Article 5(2) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA).1692 Respondent contends that Messrs. Lebedev and Kakorin, both Russian citizens and residents, carried out all the activities relating to Hulley's and VPL's Yukos shares from Russia.1693\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1491-501.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1491.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1500.\n\n1298.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants' alleged abuses violate both Russian and Cypriot criminal laws, as shown in the expert report of Mr. Polyviou.1694\n\nCounter-Memorial\u00b6 927.\n\n1299.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Claimants' expert, Mr. Baker, fails to differentiate the \"tolerated\" practice of \"treaty shopping\" from the \"universally condemned\" practice of \"round tripping,\" which Respondent alleges is what Claimants did.1695 Accordingly, Respondent submits that, \"at best,\" Hulley and VPL \"perverted\" the purposes of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, even if they satisfied its \"literal requirements.\"1696\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1508.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1509.\n\n1300.\n\nClaimants protest that Respondent's allegations are unsubstantiated in fact and in law.\n\n1301.\n\nFirstly, Claimants argue that the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in Article 10(2)(a) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA is a \"narrow one targeted at nominees, agents and other conduits under an obligation to pass on the amount received as a dividend to another party.\"1697 Hulley and VPL in the present case had the full right to use and enjoy the dividends they received from Yukos and were under no obligation to pass them on to another entity, as is evident from Clause 117 and Article 1 of their respective Articles of Association, which provide that the power to propose the declaration and payment of dividends lies solely with the directors of the respective companies.1698\n\nReply \u00b6 1157.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1158.\n\n1302.\n\nClaimants assert that shares \"transferred to a company shortly before the dividend dates and transferred back after the dividend has been paid are lawful and a common feature in stocklending, and also in the sale and repurchase of shares (\u2018repos').\"1699\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1161.\n\n1303.\n\nSecondly, Claimants assert that Hulley and VPL were holding companies, and that their business as such was not carried on in Russia.1700 None of the cumulative conditions in Article10(4) of the DTA were made out to show that Hulley or VPL had a permanent establishment in Russia, as demonstrated by Mr. Baker's report.1701\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1163.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1164-74.\n\n1304.\n\nThirdly, Claimants reject the fraudulent abuse analysis made by Respondent's expert Professor Rosenbloom, noting that there is no anti-abuse principle in the DTA.1702 Claimants emphasize that \u2018treaty shopping' to minimize tax is permissible.1703\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1176.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1175, citing *MIL (Investments) S.A. v. Canada* [2006] 5 CTC 2552 (Tax Court of Canada), affirmed by Federal Court of Appeal of Canada.\n\n1305.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that Hulley's and VPL's claims under the Cyprus-Russia DTA were consistent with the purpose of the DTA. Claimants recall that one purpose of double-taxation treaties is to promote the flow of investment, and argue that both countries have derived significant benefits from the DTA.1704\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1177.\n\n1306.\n\nIn any event, Claimants submit that the claiming of benefits under a double-taxation treaty is a technical matter, for which specific mechanisms of redress are available under the treaty itself and domestic law. Accordingly, this Tribunal is not the proper forum to hear and decide such disputes.1705\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1189.\n\n**(c) Conduct Related to the Tax Optimization Scheme**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1307.\n\nThree items on Respondent's list of Claimants' \"illegal and bad faith\" conduct relate to Claimants' use of the low-tax regions of the Russian Federation to mitigate tax burdens:\n\nxv. Engineering through management installed and controlled by Claimants the massive Yukos tax evasion scheme to avoid paying hundreds of billions of rubles in Russian taxes.\n\n[...]\n\nxvii. Engaging in abusive corporate restructurings to conceal Yukos' affiliation with its trading shells, thereby preventing Russian authorities from identifying and addressing Yukos' tax abuses.\n\nxviii. Concealing Yukos' continued control of its trading shells by resorting to call options or other artifices and by fabricating corporate and other transactional documents.1706\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1435-36.\n\n1308.\n\nA detailed discussion of these allegations is found in Chapter VIII.A of this Award.\n\n**(d) Actions Taken in Hindrance of the Enforcement of Russia's Tax Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1309.\n\nThe remaining ten items on Respondent's list of Claimants' \"bad faith and illegal conduct\" refer to actions allegedly taken to obstruct enforcement of Russia's tax claims against Yukos:\n\nxix. Repeatedly obstructing the conduct of the tax authorities' audits of Yukos by refusing to provide documents and information which would show the extent of Yukos' abuses, and by causing Yukos' producing subsidiaries and other related entities to be similarly obstructive.\n\nxx. Failing to pay Yukos' tax liabilities for tax year 2000 and following years, despite having received ample notice that Yukos would be required to pay these amounts and despite the fact that Yukos had abundant resources to do so.\n\nxxi. Dissipating assets to frustrate the Russian authorities' collection of the tax assessments, including by way of paying dividends of unprecedented amounts, making spontaneously accelerated loan \" *prepayments* \" to Oligarch-owned Moravel, and foisting upon YNG an upstream guarantee up to US$ 3 billion for the repayment of Yukos' alleged \" *debts* \" to Moravel.\n\nxxii. Offering to the Russian authorities assets which Yukos knew to be tainted to settle its tax liabilities.\n\nxxiii. Concealing the share registers of Yukos' subsidiaries to obstruct the bailiffs' enforcement of Yukos' tax obligations.\n\nxxiv. Sabotaging the YNG auction through litigation threats and a spurious bankruptcy filing in the United States that effectively prevented all but one bidder from placing a bid at the auction and artificially depressed the amount of the auction proceeds.\n\nxxv. Implementing asset-stripping measures by diverting Yukos' valuable assets to the *stichtings* managed by former Yukos officers and representatives of Claimants in anticipation of Yukos' bankruptcy.\n\nxxvi. Failing to repay Yukos' debt to the SocGen syndicate and frustrating the banks' attempts to collect against Yukos' Dutch assets.\n\nxxvii. In the process of all of the foregoing, lying to Yukos' auditors PwC about core aspects of their misconduct and, through PwC's certification of Yukos' financial statements based on this deception of Yukos' auditors, to Yukos' creditors and other members of the investing public who relied upon those financial statements and PwC's certification of them.\n\nxxviii. Yukos management's shielding of Yukos' very substantial foreign assets behind the veil of two Dutch *stichtings*, to place those assets beyond the reach of Russian tax authorities, violated Dutch law.1707\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1435-36.\n\n1310.\n\nIn sum, Respondent alleges that Yukos neither paid its tax debts in full immediately after these debts were assessed, nor made reasonable settlement offers; dissipated the assets it had on hand; lied to its auditors; obstructed the work of the bailiffs; and sabotaged the YNG auction. Each of these allegations is discussed by the Tribunal in Part VIII of this Award.\n\n**3. Parties' Positions Regarding the Impact of Claimants' Allegedly \"Unclean Hands\" on this Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1311.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether any of the instances of alleged illegal or bad faith conduct enumerated above could serve as a complete bar to Claimants' claims under the ECT (whether as a matter of jurisdiction, admissibility or otherwise) by virtue of the application of some rule or principle of law.\n\n1312.\n\nBetween them, the Parties have dedicated to this controversy several hundreds of pages of pleadings in the merits phase alone, citing in the process dozens of arbitral awards and decisions rendered by the Permanent Court of International Justice (the \" **PCIJ** \"), the International Court of Justice (\" **ICJ** \") and mixed-claims commissions. Below, the Tribunal does not attempt to do justice to the full breadth of the Parties' arguments, but focuses instead on their most salient points.\n\n**(a) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1313.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' \"unclean hands\" deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction, render Claimants' claims inadmissible and/or deprive Claimants of the substantive protections of the ECT. This submission is based on two main principles.\n\n1314.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that \"the ECT protects only *bona fide* and lawful investments and Respondent's consent to arbitrate only extends to such investments.\"1708 Respondent emphasizes that, as provided by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with its object and purpose. According to Respondent, the object and purpose of the ECT does not include the promotion and protection of illegal investments.1709 Rather, as stated in the Treaty's introductory note, \"[t]he fundamental aim of the [ECT] is to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues.\" Respondent argues that several arbitral awards, including *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic* (\" ***Phoenix*** \") *, SAUR International S.A. v. The Argentine Republic* and *Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria* (\" ***Plama*** \") support the proposition that, even in the absence of an express legality requirement clause in an investment treaty, illegal investments will not be protected.1710 With respect to *Plama*, in particular, Respondent notes that the tribunal dismissed the claimants' ECT claims in the merits phase on the grounds that: (a) the investment violated Bulgarian law and applicable principles of international law; (b) the claimant's conduct was not in good faith; and (c) to grant ECT protection would therefore have been contrary to the clean hands requirement.1711\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 147.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 898.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 1551-52, 1527, 1563, 1566, referring to *Plama Consortium Limited v.

Respondent highlights that tribunal's finding that the entire underlying transaction was illegal and, by that fact, \"it follows that the acquisition by each [c]laimant of the asset resulting from that transaction was also not in accordance with the law of Costa Rica.\"1722 Respondent submits that the finding of the *Anderson* tribunal applies in the present case, highlighting that:\n\nwhere an investment is simply transferred by the same ultimate owner from one investment vehicle to another, the concept of the unity of the investment requires that the process of the making and operation of the investment by the ultimate owner and the owner's investment vehicle be considered as a whole for purposes of determining the legality of the investment, even if the acquisition of the investment by the claimant, standing alone, is not illegal.1723\n\nResondent's Rejoinder \u00b6 1571, referring to *Anderson v. Costa Rica*, ICSID ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010, Exh.

Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\"1729\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 909.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 933.\n\n1322.\n\nRespondent also states that it is not estopped from invoking Claimants' unclean hands in this arbitration by any failure to take prompt action.1730 Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to satisfy the legal standard for estoppel.1731 This standard, argues Respondent, was confirmed by the ICJ in the *North Sea Continental Shelf Cases* :\n\n[I]t appears to the Court that only the existence of a situation of estoppel could suffice to lend substance to this contention, -- that is to say if the Federal Republic were now precluded from denying the applicability of the conventional regime, by reason of part conduct, declarations, etc., which not only clearly and consistently evinced acceptance of that regime, but also had caused Denmark or the Netherlands, in reliance on such conduct, detrimentally to change position or suffer some prejudice.

In that regard, Respondent argues that Claimants' reliance on Respondent's alleged failure to challenge illegalities earlier does not amount to an unequivocal representation. Respondent also submits that Claimants have failed to establish that they changed their conduct to their detriment in reliance on said representation. Particularly regarding the alleged abuses of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, Respondent contends it raised its objection to Hulley's and VPL's alleged violations in these arbitrations as early as October 2006, and thus, argues Respondent, \"Claimants' further suggestion that Respondent might be estopped because it did not also raise these abuses \u2018in an appropriate forum' is absurd.\"1733\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1593-95.\n\n1324.\n\nRespondent adds that informal or *contra legem* acceptance of an investment by the host State's authorities that is illegal under the host State's domestic law, or based on covert arrangements unknown to the host State, cannot provide a basis for estoppel. In support, Respondent relies on the *Fraport* award.1734\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1596, referring to *Fraport* \u00b6 347.\n\n1325.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants proportionality argument, stating that it is based on \"rules governing countermeasures by an injured State in inter-State relations.\"1735 In the words of Respondent: \"the legality requirement excludes illegal investments from the scope of ECT protection. As a result it is not that a host State is not justified in breaching obligations with respect to illegal investments, but instead that it has no treaty obligations in the first instance.\"1736\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1584-7.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1586.\n\n**(b) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1326.\n\nClaimants object that their \"unclean hands,\" even if proven by Respondent, could have no impact on their claims in these arbitrations because: (a) the ECT does not contain any principle of \"unclean hands\"; (b) no principle of \"unclean hands\" has been recognized as a general principle of law; and (c) the instances of \"unclean hands\" alleged by Respondent are \"collateral illegalities\" that do not fall within the parameters of any \"unclean hands\" doctrine.\n\n1327.\n\nClaimants assert that it is \"impossible to find any textual basis in the [ECT] for the Respondent's contention.\"1737 They add that the introductory note to the ECT--a note which Claimants contend is not an official document or interpretation of the ECT--confers an obligation to strengthen the rule of law on States parties, rather than on the investor.1738 Claimants highlight that Respondent chose not to quote the remainder of the note, which goes on to state that the ECT's aim of strengthening the rule of law on energy issues is to be accomplished \"by creating a level playing field of rules to be observed by all participating governments, thus minimising the risks associated with energy-related investments and trade.\"1739 In this regard, Claimants contend that denying a claimant access to a forum for resolving its claims altogether would violate, rather than support, the rule of law.1740\n\nReply \u00b6 1029.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1100.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1101.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1102.\n\n1328.\n\nClaimants seek to distinguish the *Phoenix* and *Hamester* ICSID awards relied upon by Respondent. Claimants highlight that the statement relied on by Respondent to infer that a jurisdictional requirement of compliance with host State laws is implicit, even when not stated, is *obiter dictum* on account of the BIT provisions being applied by those tribunals.1741 Similarly, Claimants submit that any reliance on the *Plama* award to insert a jurisdictional requirement of \"clean hands\" into the relevant treaty is incorrect. Claimants submit that in the *Plama* decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal considered and rejected an argument that the illegality of the investment could affect its capacity to hear the dispute.1742\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1098, referring to *Phoenix* \u00b6 101, Exh. R-1078; *Hamester* \u00b6 123-24, Exh. R-1079.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1099, referring to *Plama*, Exh. C-994.\n\n1329.\n\nFurther, Claimants emphasize that the bar for recognition of general principles of international law is set \"extremely high\".1743 Claimants assert that Respondent's \"unclean hands\" theory fails to meet this high threshold.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1039.\n\n1330.\n\nClaimants allege that neither the PCIJ nor the ICJ have ever endorsed \"unclean hands\" as a general principle of law.1744 They also argue that the inter-state cases relied on by Respondent are inapposite to this arbitration as they concern \"situations in which two sovereign States have assumed an identical or reciprocal obligation.\"1745 Claimants further argue that the awards of mixed claims commissions are of little guidance, as they deal mostly with diplomatic protection and are of \"ancient vintage.\" In support, Claimants cite the *Saba Fakes v. Turkey* ICSID award, in which the tribunal held that the \"rules of customary international law applicable in the context of diplomatic protection do not apply as such to investor-State arbitration.\"1746\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1040-55.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1040, 1055.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1056-67, referring to *Saba Fakes* \u00b6 69, Exh. C-1537.\n\n1331.\n\nClaimants note that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and Articles on Diplomatic Protection do not contain a principle of \"unclean hands.\"1747 They also argue that most scholars reject the existence of an \"unclean hands\" general principle altogether, while its proponents argue that it should be subject to certain well-defined limits.1748\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1068-71.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1072-77.

R-1053.\n\n1332.\n\nClaimants also submit that the investment tribunal awards relied on by Respondent in support of a general principle of \"unclean hands\" were decided on other grounds and that Respondent's analysis of these awards is incomplete and misleading.1749 According to Claimants, in each of the ICSID awards cited by Respondent-- *Plama*, *Phoenix*, *Hamester* and *Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (\" ***Inceysa*** \")--the tribunal's decision rested on a clause in the relevant BIT conditioning jurisdiction on compliance by the investor with the laws of the host State.1750\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1094.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1094-1105, referring to *Plama*, Exh.

R-1079.\n\n1333.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that even if Respondent can make the case for a general principle of \"unclean hands\" or a legality requirement under the ECT, Respondent's theory as applied to this case rests on allegations of collateral illegalities unrelated to either the making of Claimants' investments or their claims in these arbitrations.1751\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1134-38.\n\n1334.\n\nClaimants submit that even when interpreting treaty provisions expressly requiring compliance with host State laws as a condition of jurisdiction, investment tribunals have strictly construed such provisions.1752 Claimants submit that investment tribunals have only subjected the initial making of the investment to a legality test. They also assert that the limited temporal scope employed by investment tribunals renders alleged pre-investment conduct irrelevant,1753 and limits its substantive scope, *e.g.*, by extending only to host State laws \"governing the admission of foreign investments in its territory.\"1754 Claimants emphasize that misconduct unrelated to the making of an investment, or which concerns minor violations, has been disregarded by investment tribunals.1755\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1105.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1106-12.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1118-19.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1120.\n\n1335.\n\nClaimants also submit that Anglo-American jurisprudence confirms that alleged illegalities must have an \"immediate\" and \"necessary\" relation to a claimant's cause of action.1756\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1105, 1078, 1134.\n\n1336.\n\nIt follows, argue Claimants, that none of Respondent's allegations are covered by any principle of \"unclean hands\". The actions complained of by Respondent with respect to the acquisition of Yukos pre-date Claimants' investments, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over those actions.1757 The alleged abuses of the Cyprus-Russia DTA do not, according to Claimants, have the required \"immediate\" or \"necessary\" relation to Claimants' claims.1758 Claimants argue that to bar Hulley and VPL permanently from bringing claims under the ECT for having claiming benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA to which they were not entitled rests on an \"impossibly broad interpretation\" of the \"unclean hands\" concept.1759\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1135.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1137.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1337.\n\nClaimants also point out that only the allegations of DTA abuses concern the conduct of Claimants themselves, while the other 24 allegations concern the conduct of persons other than Claimants. Claimants contend that Respondent provides no basis on which the conduct of these third parties could render Claimants' hands \"unclean\".1760\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1136.\n\n1338.\n\nClaimants further assert that, even if any principle of \"unclean hands\" is potentially applicable in the situation at hand, Respondent is estopped from raising matters in these arbitrations of which it has long been aware, but has never challenged.1761 Claimants argue that acquiescence, or the silence or absence of protest in circumstances which generally call for a positive reaction signifying an objection, may \"in and of itself\" result in estoppel, where the other elements of estoppel are not made out.1762\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1181.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1183.\n\n1339.\n\nIn particular, Claimants reject Respondent's allegations with respect to the creation and original acquisition of Yukos in 1995. Claimants submit that it was Respondent that \"planned, organized, conducted and completed the privatization of the Russian Federation's property through the loans-for-shares program, including the privatization of Yukos.\"1763 Similarly, Claimants highlight that Respondent did not take legal action against Claimants for any of the alleged violations of the Cyprus-Russia DTA by Hulley and VPL. Claimants underline that Respondent must have had knowledge of many, if not all, of the alleged violations \"as early as October 2003, through the searches and seizures of documents at the Moscow premises of GML MS, or at least as early as October 6, 2006 when the Respondent first raised the matter in these arbitrations.\"1764\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1188.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1189.\n\n1340.\n\nClaimants also submit that, even if an \"unclean hands\" general principle existed, it would not confer upon States the right to violate investors' rights.1765 Drawing an analogy to countermeasures, Claimants refer to Articles 49 and 54 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and to the ILC Commentary on the provisions, which states that such measures \"are not intended as a form of punishment for wrongful conduct, but as an instrument for achieving compliance with the obligations of the responsible State.\"1766\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1191.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1194.\n\n1341.\n\nThe ILC Commentary further emphasizes that proportionality is a stand-alone requirement, such that even where a counter-measure is carried out for a permissible purpose, it must still be proportionate to the original breach.1767\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1195.\n\n1342.\n\nClaimants submit that the need to weigh the proportionality of Respondent's response to the illegalities it alleges against Claimants provides further reason for rejecting Respondent's \"unclean hands\" objection to jurisdiction/admissibility. In Claimants' own words: \"it is for the tribunal to assess such allegations... in its consideration of the merits of the investor's claims, bearing in mind that any response by the host State to any alleged illegality must comport with its international obligations.\"1768\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1197.\n\n**4. Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n1343.\n\nArticle 26(6) of the ECT provides that \"[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\"\n\n1344.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT, which is widely recognized as reflecting customary international law, provides in its first paragraph that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n1345.\n\nLooking first at the text of the ECT, the Tribunal observes that it does not contain any express reference to a principle of \"clean hands.\" Nor, unlike some other investment treaties, does the ECT contain an express requirement that investments be made in accordance with the laws of the host country.1769 These points are not disputed by the Parties.\n\n*See e.g.* the bilateral investment treaties applied in *Fraport*, Exh. R-1006 (Germany-Philippines BIT: \"[t]he term investment shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either Contracting State\"); *Inceysa*, Exh. R-1083 (Spain-El Salvador BIT: \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall protect in its territory investments made, in accordance with its legislation\"; \"[the BIT shall] apply to investments made... in accordance with the laws\"); *Phoenix*, Exh. RE-1078 (Israel-Czech Republic BIT: \"[t]he term \u2018investment' shall comprise any kinds of asset invested... in accordance with the respective laws and regulations.\"\n\n1346.\n\nIn the absence of any specific textual hook, the Tribunal must consider whether, given the need to interpret treaties in good faith and take account of their object and purpose, the ECT as a whole may be understood as conditioning the protection of investments on their legality, or on the good faith of the investor. The Tribunal addresses this question in subsection (a) below.\n\n1347.\n\nIn addition to any potential limitation on the protection of investments inherent in the ECT, a principle of \"clean hands\" could be relevant to this arbitration pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT if it were an \"applicable rule[...] or principle[...] of international law.\" The Parties dispute whether \"clean hands\" exists as a \"general principle of international law recognized by civilized nations\" in the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the ICJ. The Tribunal addresses this question in subsection (b) below.\n\n1348.\n\nFinally, in subsection (c) below, the Tribunal considers whether any of the 28 instances of \"bad faith and illegal conduct\" of which Respondent accuses Claimants fall within the scope of any \"unclean hands\" or similar principle applicable in the ECT context.\n\n**(a) Can a Clean Hands Principle or Legality Requirement be Read into the ECT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1349.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is support in the decisions of tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations for the notion that, even where the applicable investment treaty does not contain an express requirement of compliance with host State laws (as is the case with the ECT), an investment that is made in breach of the laws of the host State may either: (a) not qualify as an investment, thus depriving the tribunal of jurisdiction; or (b) be refused the benefit of the substantive protections of the investment treaty.\n\n1350.\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal, deciding a case under the ECT, thus stated that the \"substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments made contrary to law.\"1770 It acknowledged that the ECT \"does not contain a provision requiring the conformity of the Investment with a particular law,\" but stated that \"[t]his does not mean... that the protections provided for by the ECT cover all kinds of investments, including those contrary to domestic and international law.\"1771 The tribunal explained that, in that case, granting the claimant protection would have \"be[en] contrary to the principle *nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans* \" and \"the basic notion of international public policy\u2014that a contract obtained by wrongful means (fraudulent misrepresentation) should not be enforced by a tribunal.\"1772\n\n*Plama*, Exh. C-994 \u00b6 139.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 138.\n\n*Ibid. \u00b6* 143.\n\n1351.\n\nOther arbitral tribunals have stated in *obiter dicta* that the principle that an investment \"will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or international principles of good faith\" or \"of the host State's law\" is a \"general principle[... ] that exist[s] independently of specific language\" in an investment treaty.1773\n\n*Hamester* \u00b6\u00b6 123-24, Exh. R-1079. *See also Phoenix* \u00b6 101, Exh. R-1078 (\"it is the Tribunal's view that this condition - the conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws - is implicit even when not expressly stated in the relevant BIT\"); *SAUR* \u00b6 308, Exh. R-4186 (\"[the tribunal] is aware that the finality of the investment arbitration system is to protect only lawful and bona fide investments. Whether or not the BIT between France and Argentina mentions the requirement that the investor act in conformity with domestic legislation does not constitute a relevant factor. The condition of not committing a serious violation of the legal order is a tacit condition, inherent to any BIT as, in any event, it is incomprehensible that a State offer the benefit of protection through arbitration if the investor, in order to obtain such protection, has acted contrary to the law.\")\n\n1352.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this proposition. In imposing obligations on States to treat investors in a fair and transparent fashion, investment treaties seek to encourage legal and *bona fide* investments. An investor who has obtained an investment in the host State only by acting in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state, has brought itself within the scope of application of the ECT through wrongful acts. Such an investor should not be allowed to benefit from the Treaty.\n\n1353.\n\nFor reasons that will become apparent further in this chapter, the Tribunal does not need to decide here whether the legality requirement it reads into the ECT operates as a bar to jurisdiction or, as suggested in *Plama*, to deprive claimants of the substantive protections of the ECT.\n\n1354.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does need to address Respondent's contention that the right to invoke the ECT must be denied to an investor not only in the case of illegality in the *making* of the investment but also in its *performance*. The Tribunal finds Respondent's contention unpersuasive.\n\n1355.\n\nThere is no compelling reason to deny altogether the right to invoke the ECT to any investor who has breached the law of the host State in the course of its investment. If the investor acts illegally, the host state can request it to correct its behavior and impose upon it sanctions available under domestic law, as the Russian Federation indeed purports to have done by reassessing taxes and imposing fines. However, if the investor believes these sanctions to be unjustified (as Claimants do in the present case), it must have the possibility of challenging their validity in accordance with the applicable investment treaty. It would undermine the purpose and object of the ECT to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits.\n\n1356.\n\nRespondent has not been able to cite any apposite authority in support of its contention. The statements of investment tribunals it relies on were all made *obiter* and are too vague to allow any certain conclusions to be drawn as to their intended meaning *.* For example, the statement in *Fraport* that illegal acts in the course of an investment \"might be a defense to claimed substantive violations\" appears to suggest that, in some cases, the State's actions will have been justified as an appropriate response to the investor's violations of national law.1774 As is clear from the decision, the statement by the *Fraport* tribunal does not imply the unavailability of the substantive protections of the treaty, but rather concludes that the respondent State has not incurred any liability under the treaty.\n\n*Fraport*, Exh. R-1006 \u00b6\u00b6 395, 345. The Tribunal notes that the Chairman, Mr. Fortier, was the Chairman of the Fraport tribunal.\n\n**(b) Does the \"Clean Hands\" Doctrine Constitute a \"General Principle of Law Recognized by Civilized Nations\"?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1357.\n\nSince the Tribunal will not read into the ECT any legality requirement with respect to the conduct of the investment, it must consider Respondent's more general proposition that a claimant who comes before an international tribunal with \"unclean hands\" is barred from claiming on the basis of a \"general principle of law.\"\n\n1358.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that there exists a \"general principle of law recognized by civilized nations\" within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute that would bar an investor from making a claim before an arbitral tribunal under an investment treaty because it has so-called \"unclean hands.\"\n\n1359.\n\nGeneral principles of law require a certain level of recognition and consensus. However, on the basis of the cases cited by the Parties, the Tribunal has formed the view that there is a significant amount of controversy as to the existence of an \"unclean hands\" principle in international law.\n\n1360.\n\nRespondent has demonstrated that certain principles associated with the \"clean hands\" doctrine, such as *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* and *ex iniuria ius non oritur* have been endorsed by the PCIJ and the ICJ.1775 However, the Tribunal notes that Judge Simma in his separate opinion in the *Application of the Interim Accord of 13 December 1995* raises doubt as to the continuing existence of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* principle.1776\n\n*See The Diversion of Water from the Meuse (Netherlands v. Belgium)*, Judgment, 28 June 1937, Individual Opinion of Judge Hudson, PCIJ Series A/B No. 70, p. 73, 77, Exh. C-1502 (\"[i]t would seem to be an important principle of equity that where two parties have assumed an identical or reciprocal obligation, one party which is engaged in continuing non-performance of that obligation should not be permitted to take advantage of a similar non-performance of that obligation by the other party\"); *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros,* \u00b6 133 Exh.

Nor can it overlook that factual situation... when deciding on the legal requirements for the future conduct of the Parties. This does not mean that facts--in this case, facts which flow from wrongful conduct--determine the law. The principle *ex injuria jus non oritur* is sustained by the Court's finding that the legal relationship created by the 1977 Treaty is preserved and cannot in this case be treated as voided by unlawful conduct.\")\n\n*Application of the Interim Accord of 13 December 1995 (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia v.

C-1545.\n\n1361.\n\nWith regard to the \"unclean hands\" doctrine proper, Respondent has referred to the dissenting opinion of Judge Schwebel (a member of this Tribunal) in the *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* ICJ case, where he concluded that Nicaragua's claims against the United States should fail because Nicaragua had \"not come to Court with clean hands.\"1777 Respondent also referred to other dissenting ICJ and PCIJ opinions where the principle of \"unclean hands\" was invoked (albeit often without referring to it by name).1778\n\n*Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

R-1072 (\"The Congo did not come to the Court with clean hands\").\n\n1362.\n\nHowever, as Claimants point out, despite what appears to have been an extensive review of jurisprudence, Respondent has been unable to cite a single majority decision where an international court or arbitral tribunal has applied the principle of \"unclean hands\" in an interState or investor-State dispute and concluded that, as a principle of international law, it operated as a bar to a claim.\n\n1363.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that \"unclean hands\" does not exist as a general principle of international law which would bar a claim by an investor, such as Claimants in this case.\n\n**(c) Would any Instances of Claimants' Alleged \"Bad Faith and Illegal\" Conduct be Caught by a Legality Requirement Read into the ECT?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1364.\n\nTo summarize, the Tribunal accepts that a claimant may be barred from seeking relief under the ECT if its investment was made in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state.\n\n1365.\n\nIt follows that the alleged instances of \"unclean hands\" listed in Subsections IX.B.2(b), (c) and (d) above--specifically, the instances related to the alleged abuse of the Russia-Cyprus DTA, the tax optimization scheme and the obstruction of Russia's enforcement of tax claims against Yukos, all of which relate to actions that were taken after the making of Claimants' investment, cannot have any impact on the availability of ECT protection for Claimants.\n\n1366.\n\nThis leaves for the Tribunal's consideration Respondent's allegations of bad faith and illegal conduct in the acquisition of Yukos and the subsequent consolidation of control and ownership over Yukos and its subsidiaries, set out in Subsection IX.B.2(a) above.\n\n1367.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that these actions were taken before Claimants became shareholders of Yukos in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and, consequently, were not taken by Claimants themselves, but by other actors, such as Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs.1779 Claimants submit that these actions are thus irrelevant to these arbitrations, as the conduct complained of was not that of Claimants' themselves and, in any event, pre-dates Claimants' investment.1780\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 910-13, explaining the alleged illegal conduct of Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs in the acquisition of Yukos shares by the Oligarchs in 1995 and 1996.\n\n*See* Reply \u00b6\u00b6 1135-36.\n\n1368.\n\nRespondent replies that, on the contrary, the process of the acquisition of the Yukos shares by Claimants should not be seen in isolation but as an integral part of the \"making of the investment\" by Claimants. Respondent's argument was most convincingly put by Dr. Claudia Annacker during the Hearing. Dr. Annacker argued as follows:\n\nContrary to Claimants' position, the serious illegalities that infect the entire process of the acquisition of the Yukos shares by Claimants cannot simply be ignored because the transfer of the shares to the Claimants... viewed in isolation, is asserted to be legal. These illegalities cannot somehow be cured through multiple transfers within this network of the oligarchs' offshore companies from one shell company to another.\n\nIndeed, the making of an investment is often a process rather than an instantaneous act, and often comprises a number of diverse transactions. These transactions must be treated as an integrated whole. The transactions may have a separate legal existence, but they have a common economic aim...\n\nIndeed, it would be incompatible with economic reality and undermine the integrity of the legal process if serious irregularities - illegalities - infecting the process of the making of the investment would not affect the availability of investment treaty protection, whether or not a specific transaction, part of the process, if viewed in isolation, might be legal.\n\nNow, this conclusion applies a fortiori where a claimant is not unrelated to the persons or entities that committed these illegalities, but is an investment vehicle owned and controlled by the same persons who committed the illegalities... Otherwise, investment treaty protection could be achieved simply by shifting investments through layers of ownership and control to launder illegal investments...\n\nWhile Claimants' acquisition of their shares may be a separate legal transaction, there is a common economic aim pursued by the same oligarchs...1781\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 171-174 (Respondent's closing).\n\n1369.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that an examination of the legality of an investment should not be limited to verifying whether the last in a series of transactions leading up to the investment was in conformity with the law. The making of the investment will often consist of several consecutive acts and all of these must be legal and *bona fide*.\n\n1370.\n\nIn the present case, however, Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the alleged illegalities to which it refers are sufficiently connected with the final transaction by which the investment was made by Claimants. The transactions by which each Claimant acquired its investment were their purchases of Yukos shares. As established in the Interim Award, these purchases were legal and occurred starting in 1999.1782 On the other hand, the alleged illegalities connected to the acquisition of Yukos through the loans-for-shares program occurred in 1995 and 1996, at the time of Yukos' privatization. They involved Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs, an entity and persons separate from Claimants, one of which--Veteran--had not even come into existence.1783 With respect to Respondent's other allegations, regarding profit skimming and the oppression of minority shareholders, it is also clear to the Tribunal that they are not part of the transaction or transactions by which each Claimant acquired their interest in Yukos.\n\nInterim Awards \u00b6\u00b6 431 (YUL); 430 (Hulley); 474 (VPL).\n\nVPL was incorporated in 2001 (Interim Award \u00b6 44 (VPL).\n\n1371.\n\nRespondent relies on *Anderson* for the proposition that \"illegalities infecting an investment that pre-date a claimant's acquisition of the investment are not irrelevant or outside the tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis*.\"1784 However, the tribunal in that case examined and found to be illegal the very transaction through which the claimants obtained their investment, not any prior transactions made by other persons.1785\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1571, referring to Anderson, Exh. R-4204.\n\n*Ibid*\n\n1372.\n\nWhile it is true that the claimants in *Anderson* were not blamed for the illegality that tainted their investment, nevertheless it is the very transaction by which their respective investments were obtained that was considered illegal by the tribunal, and led it to decline jurisdiction.\n\n**(d) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1373.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Respondent's \"unclean hands\" argument fails as a preliminary objection. It does not operate to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction in this arbitration, render inadmissible any of the Claimants' claims or otherwise bar Claimants' from invoking the substantive protections of the ECT.\n\n1374.\n\nHowever, as will be seen in Chapter X.E and Part XII, some of the instances of Claimants' \"illegal and bad faith\" conduct complained of by Respondent in the context of this preliminary objection, could have an impact on the Tribunal's assessment of liability and damages.\n\n**C. RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE ECT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1375.\n\nAnother important threshold issue in this arbitration arises from Respondent's objection under Article 21 of the ECT. Respondent argues that, pursuant to this complex provision (containing a \"carve out\" *from* the ECT for \"Taxation Measures\" at Article 21(1) and a \"claw back\" *for* Article 13 of the ECT in relation to \"taxes\" at Article 21(5)), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims with respect to \"Taxation Measures\" other than those based on expropriatory \"taxes\".1786 Claimants argue that the objection is without merit since, *inter alia*, Article 21 does not apply to actions\u2014including expropriations\u2014carried out \"under the guise of taxation.\"1787\n\n*See e.g.*, Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 162-72.\n\n*See e.g.*, Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 203-30.\n\n1376.\n\nThe relevant provisions of Article 21 of the ECT for present purposes are paragraphs 1 (the \"carve-out\"), 5 (the \"claw-back\") and 7 (definitions), which in the English version1788 read as follows:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n\u2026\n\n(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where nondiscrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the non-discrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the expiry of the six-month period;\n\n(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.\n\n\u2026\n\n(7) For the purposes of this Article:\n\n(a) The term \"Taxation Measure\" includes:\n\n(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein;\n\nand\n\n(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.\n\n(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.\n\n(c) A \"Competent Tax Authority\" means the competent authority pursuant to a double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes or their authorized representatives.\n\n(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms \"tax provisions\" and \"taxes\" do not include customs duties.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of Claimants' highlighting of the differences in the wording of paragraphs 5 and 7 of Article 21 in some of the other official languages of the ECT. As will be seen from the Tribunal's findings in this chapter, the Tribunal does not need to address the relevance, if any, of these differences.\n\n1377.\n\nRespondent's objection under Article 21 of the ECT was originally addressed by the Parties during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. In its Interim Awards, the Tribunal observed that some of the arguments raised by the Parties under Article 21 went to the heart of the merits of the dispute, in that they related to the background to and motivation behind Respondent's tax assessments, enforcement measures and other conduct, and that the Tribunal would not rule on these issues in a vacuum.1789 As a consequence, the Tribunal decided \"to defer its definitive interpretation of Article 21, and its characterization of [Claimants'] claims for purposes of Article 21, to the next phase of the arbitration.\"1790\n\nInterim Awards \u00b6\u00b6 583-84 (Hulley), \u00b6\u00b6 584-85 (YUL), \u00b6\u00b6 595-96 (VPL).\n\nInterim Awards \u00b6 584 (Hulley), \u00b6 585 (YUL), \u00b6 596 (VPL).\n\n1378.\n\nAs a consequence, the Parties had a further opportunity to develop their positions under Article 21 of the ECT during the merits phase of the present proceedings. Claimants' and Respondent's arguments are now summarized in turn.\n\n**2. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n1379.\n\nClaimants argue that Article 21 of the ECT does not apply to the case at hand since Respondent's actions were \"actions under the guise of taxation\" rather than \" *bona fide* taxation actions\"1791 and merely a tool \"to achieve a purpose that had nothing to do with taxation: the elimination of a potential opponent and the appropriation of Yukos' assets.\"1792 According to Claimants, \"[i]t is no answer for a state to say that its courts have used the [word] \u2018taxation'... in describing judgments by which they effect the dispossession of foreign investors. If that were enough, investment protection through international law would likely become an illusion, as states would quickly learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse measures, perhaps expropriation first of all, as taxation.\"1793 Claimants refer in particular to the decisions of the *Quasar* and *RosInvestCo* tribunals to support their view that in a case such as this one a carve-out with regard to taxation measures cannot apply.1794\n\nTranscript, Day 2 at 4 (Claimants' opening); Transcript, Day 17 at 156 (Claimants' closing); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 204.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 170 (Claimants' closing); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 206.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 171 (Claimants' closing) (quoting *Quasar* \u00b6 179, Exh.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n1385.\n\nRespondent argues that most of the actions complained of by Claimants are outside the scope of the Tribunal's scrutiny due to the taxation carve-out provision in Article 21(1) of the ECT.\n\n1386.\n\nRespondent points out that taxation carve-outs have a number of functions, which include preserving States' sovereignty in fiscal matters, the coordination of obligations under investment treaties and double taxation treaties, and assuring that complex tax issues are addressed with the necessary expertise.1806 To achieve these functions, taxation carve-outs would typically be \"broad, covering all aspects of the tax regime.\"1807 Respondent refers to a number of instances where investment treaty tribunals gave effect to taxation carve-outs in international investment treaties, namely the decisions in *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, *EnCana v. Ecuador*, *El Paso International Company v. The Argentine Republic* (\" ***El Paso*** \"), *Burlington v. Ecuador* and *Nations Energy v.

Canada)* to support its view that \"measures\" has a broad ordinary meaning and that, contrary to Claimants' suggestion that \"Taxation Measures\" only refer to legislative \"provisions\", legislation and implementing measures cannot be dissociated.1811 According to Respondent, such a dissociation would be absurd, since \"[e]very time a contracting State enforces tax legislation that is carved out, but would be inconsistent with the treatment standards in Part III, the State would incur international responsibility for breach of Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty.\"1812\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 162 (Respondent's opening); Respondent's Opening Slides, pp. 461-62; Respondent's PostHearing Brief \u00b6 164.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 162.\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 163-64, 170 (Respondent's opening) (discussing *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

Respondent points out that the word \"includes\" used in Article 21(7) of the ECT stands in contrast to the word \"means\" used elsewhere, thus suggesting that the enumeration in that provision is not exhaustive.1813 Respondent also argues that, if the term \"Taxation Measure\" were limited to provisions relating to taxes, the use of the word \"includes\" would not make sense, since Article 21(7) of the ECT specifically refers to both \"any provision relating to taxes\" in \"the domestic law of the Contracting Party\" and \"any provision relating to taxes\" in an \"international agreement... by which the Contracting Party is bound.\"1814 Since \"all provisions relating to taxes are either contained in domestic law or in international treaties,\" Respondent claims that there would be nothing left to add.1815\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 171 (Respondent's rebuttal); Respondent's Opening Slides, p. 465; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 163.\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 176 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 178 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\n1389.\n\nRespondent rather suggests that \"[t]he term \u2018Taxation Measure' has a meaning in itself\" and that \"it provides a benchmark to determine which measures or categories of measures, in addition to those expressly listed, constitute \u2018Taxation Measures' for purposes of Article 21 of the ECT.\"1816 Respondent refers to the ECT's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* to support its view that the list in Article 21(7) of the ECT is \"illustrative\" and \"not a definition\".1817 In particular, Respondent points out that, during the negotiations of the ECT, the Canadian delegation, in response to a memorandum of the Legal Sub-Group noting that \"taxation measures\" were identified in an illustrative manner, remarked that this was intentional and that \"it would be counterproductive to come up with anything more precise.\"1818 It also suggests that, while the French delegation expressed a preference for an exhaustive definition and for the word \"includes\" to be replaced by \"means\", by not proceeding with the suggested replacement, the \"negotiating States chose to maintain an illustrative list.\"1819\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 171-72 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 167-68 (Respondent's opening) (discussing Memorandum from the Chairman of the Legal SubGroup to the Chairman of Working Group II, Document No. LEG-14, 5 March 1993, p. 2, Exh.

Canada)* judgment, that the question of legality can have no impact on the qualification of an act as a \"taxation measure\",1826 and it suggests that measures \"in apparent reliance\" on taxation legislation, even if abusive, must be covered by a taxation carve-out.1827 Respondent also refers to a number of decisions of investment treaty tribunals to support this view. In particular, Respondent quotes from the decision in *EnCana v. Ecuador*, according to which \"provided a matter is sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law or regulation (or to a procedure, requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent reliance on such a law or regulation), its legality is a matter for the courts of the host State.\"1828 Similarly, Respondent quotes from the decision in *Burlington v. Ecuador* as having taken the view that the claim that a State \"used its tax power in bad faith... challenges [that State's] tax power, and therefore raises \u2018matters of taxation'.\"1829\n\nRespondent's Opening Slides, p. 469 (quoting *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v.

This would be in line with the practice under tax treaties, which generally leaves the term of \"taxes\" undefined, adopting the meaning of the term under the domestic law of the State that imposed the tax.1841 Respondent refers in this regard for instance to Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital and the Cyprus-Russia DTA, pointing out that both instruments are referenced in the claw-back provision of Article 21(5) of the ECT.1842\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 179 (Respondent's opening).\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 180 (Respondent's opening).\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 180-81 (Respondent's opening); Transcript, Day 21 at 188 (Respondent's rebuttal); 2010 OECD Model Tax Convention, Article 3(2), Exh.

Tribunal's Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n1401.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Tribunal deferred its decision on Article 21 because the Parties' arguments in relation to this provision during the jurisdictional phase raised issues that went to the heart of the merits of the dispute and the Tribunal decided that it could not rule on these issues in a vacuum.\n\n1402.\n\nNow, at the conclusion of the merits phase of the present proceedings, the Tribunal has the necessary context within which to evaluate the Parties' arguments, analyze and interpret Article 21, and characterize Claimants' claims for purposes of Article 21.\n\n1403.\n\nBefore turning to Article 21 itself, the Tribunal considers it helpful to recall its principal findings on those core issues relating to the merits that are particularly relevant for Article 21.\n\n1404.\n\nIn Chapter VIII.B, the Tribunal concluded, on the totality of the evidence, that the tax authorities used the \"re-attribution\" formula not only so as to be able to collect the revenue-based taxes against Yukos, but also so as to establish a basis for imposing on Yukos the massive VAT liability and excessive fines that followed. In the Tribunal's view, while Yukos was vulnerable on some aspects of its tax optimization scheme, principally because of the sham-like nature of certain elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions, and could have faced some legitimate claims relating to revenue-based taxes had the Russian Federation limited itself to *bona fide* taxation measures, the State apparatus decided to take advantage of that vulnerability; it did so by launching a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena. The Tribunal has come to these conclusions based on its review of the entire record, as detailed in the other chapters of Part VIII, above.\n\n1405.\n\nThe Tribunal now has to decide, in these circumstances, if and how Article 21 applies, and whether it deprives the Tribunal of its jurisdiction, as argued by Respondent, to consider Claimants' claims under Article 10 of the ECT (in the event the carve-out applies), and perhaps even under Article 13 of the ECT (if the carve-out applies and the claw-back does not apply).\n\n1406.\n\nBoth Parties made extensive submissions on Article 21, both in writing and orally. Having considered the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to rule on Claimants' claims under Article 13 of the ECT for two independent reasons, each of which in and of itself suffices to justify the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Firstly, the Tribunal finds that, irrespective of its findings regarding the applicability of Article 21 of the ECT to the present case, it would have \"indirect\" jurisdiction over claims under Article 13 of the ECT because any measures excluded by the carve-out under Article 21(1) of the ECT would be brought back within the Tribunal's jurisdiction by the claw-back of Article 21(5) of the ECT and any referral to the Competent Taxation Authorities within the meaning of this latter provision would clearly have been futile.\n\n1407.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal finds that, in any event, the carve-out of Article 21(1) can apply only to *bona fide* taxation actions, *i.e.*, actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only under the guise of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent) cannot qualify for exemption from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1). As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that it does indeed have \"direct\" jurisdiction over claims under Article 13 (as well as Article 10) in the extraordinary circumstances of this case.\n\n1408.\n\nThe Tribunal will now develop each of these reasons.\n\n**(b) First Reason: Assuming the Carve-Out Applies, So Does the Claw-Back, and Any Referral to the Competent Tax Authorities Would Clearly have been Futile**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1409.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction under Article 13 of the ECT, even assuming that the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT applies. This determination is based on both the scope of the expropriation claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT relative to the scope of the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT, and the futility of any referral to the Competent Tax Authorities under Article 21(5) of the ECT. The Tribunal will expand upon each of these points in turn.\n\n**i. The Scope of the Claw-Back in Article 21(5)**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1410.\n\nRespondent argues that the term \"Taxation Measures\", used in the carve-out, should be given a broad meaning, including collection and enforcement measures, while the term \"taxes\", used in the claw-back, should be given a narrow meaning, which would exclude collection and enforcement measures. The Tribunal cannot accept Respondent's arguments for the following reasons.\n\n1411.\n\nFirstly, the Tribunal observes that the term \"Taxation Measures\", used in Article 21(1), is defined in Article 21(7)(a) to mean \"provisions\" of domestic tax law and tax treaties, while the term \"taxes\", used in Article 21(5), is not defined in the Treaty.\n\n1412.\n\nPursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n1413.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the ordinary meaning of \"tax\" used in Article 21(5) cannot be narrower than the meaning of \"Taxation Measure\" used in Article 21(1). Respondent's interpretation of \"Taxation Measures\" and \"taxes\" would, as Claimants submit, result in a wide carve-out and a narrow claw-back, \"reinstating protection from expropriation [under Article 13 of the ECT] only in relation to \u2018charges and payments', but not collection and enforcement measures or interests and fines.\"1854 The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that such an interpretation would lead to \" a gaping hole in the ECT where investors would stand completely unprotected from expropriatory taxation.\"1855 Such an interpretation would defeat the object and purpose of the claw-back and of the ECT itself.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 220.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 220 (emphasis in the original).\n\n1414.\n\nRespondent refers the Tribunal to a number of treaties that contain a taxation carve-out, but that either do not contain any claw-back provision or limit the claw-back to certain substantive protection standards, and argues that its proposed interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT corresponds to a \"middle ground of varying practices.\" The Tribunal, having reviewed those treaties, finds those provisions of no assistance to its interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT.\n\n1415.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal, having found that the interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT according to the general rule of interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT results in a meaning that is neither ambiguous nor obscure and does not lead to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, does not need to call in aid any other rule of interpretation. Finally, the Tribunal does not find much helpful guidance in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT. Respondent claims that the replacement of \"Taxation Measures\" with \"taxes\" in a draft of Article 21(5) of the ECT circulated in June 1993 could not have been incidental. However, if this replacement had been motivated by the intention of the negotiators to limit the scope of the claw-back provision in Article 21(5) of the ECT compared to the scope of the carve-out in Article 21(1) of ECT, the Tribunal would expect such a motivation to have found some additional expression in the record.\n\n1416.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore holds that any measures falling under the taxation carve-out of Article 21(1) of the ECT are also covered by the scope of the expropriation claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT.\n\n**ii. The Referral to Competent Tax Authorities**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1417.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls Article 21(5)(b), which sets out the following referral mechanism:\n\n(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\n(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;\n\n(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where non discrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the nondiscrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;\n\n(iii) Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after the expiry of the six-month period;\n\n(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii), lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.\n\n1418.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"[t]he referral mechanism... precludes any ruling by the Tribunal whether a tax constitutes an expropriation... without having made referral to the tax authorities.\"1856 Specifically, Respondent argues that Article 21(5)(b)(i) requires the Tribunal to make a referral to \"the Russian Ministry of Finance, the Cypriot Ministry of Finance, and the UK Inland Revenue.\"1857\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 192 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 191 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\n1419.\n\nClaimants, on the other hand, take the view that a referral is not warranted, for two reasons. Firstly, Claimants argue that the requirement is triggered only if there is an allegation that \"a tax constitutes an expropriation,\" whereas in the present case, according to Claimants, their investments were not expropriated by \"a tax\", but \"by a combination of many types of actions of which taxation\u2014as labeled by the Russian Federation\u2014was only one.\"1858 Secondly, Claimants argue that any referral made to the Russian Ministry of Finance, or the tax authorities of the United Kingdom and Cyprus for that matter, would be an exercise in futility.1859 According to Claimants, the Russian Ministry of Finance would effectively be asked to \"be a judge in its own cause,\" and asking the tax authorities to review the entire file\u2014written submissions, relevant correspondence, expert reports, witness statements, hearing transcripts and over 8,000 exhibits\u2014and to comment on it, would amount to a \"useless exercise\".1860\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 229.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 229.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 229.\n\n1420.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Claimants' first argument, since it ignores the logic by which the Tribunal would have come to this point in its reasoning. If the Tribunal were considering Respondent's measures under the claw-back of Article 21(5), it would be because the Tribunal would have found previously that there was no meaningful distinction between the scope of \"Taxation Measures\" and \"taxes\" for purposes of Article 21, or indeed because it would have found that even if measures \"under the guise\" of taxation were covered by the carve-out, then they must also be covered by the claw-back. The referral mechanism therefore cannot be avoided on the basis of a narrow interpretation of the term \"tax\" in Article 21(5)(b)(i).\n\n1421.\n\nClaimants' futility argument, however, is persuasive. In this particular case, the Tribunal is convinced that a referral to the tax authorities of the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and/or Cyprus would be (and, at any earlier stage of the proceedings, would have been) an exercise in futility.\n\n1422.\n\nThe record before the Tribunal is enormous. The arguments and allegations of the Parties relating to various taxes and the reasons for which they should or should not be considered expropriatory have filled briefs adding up to thousands of pages, have relied on some 8,800 exhibits and were presented to the Tribunal in oral hearings scheduled over a six-week period. It is inconceivable that the gist of this case, for either side, could have been reduced to a meaningful submission of a size and scope that might have been digested by the relevant tax authorities in a way that would have given them an opportunity to provide timely and pertinent guidance to the Tribunal.\n\n1423.\n\nThus, while the Tribunal acknowledges that the referral mechanism in the claw-back provision of Article 21(5) was designed to assist tribunals \"to distinguish normal and abusive taxes,\" as noted by Professor Park in his \"Tax Arbitration and Investor Protection\" article cited by Respondent,1861 this is simply not a case in which the Tribunal could have been assisted by referring the matter to the tax authorities. As the Tribunal has noted at various stages in the present Award, its conclusions ultimately rest on a consideration of the totality of the evidence presented to it. The tax authorities, on the other hand, would necessarily need to focus on discrete taxes or discrete issues related to taxes.\n\nRespondent's Closing Sides, p. 849; William Park, Tax Arbitration and Investor Protection, in INVESTMENT PROTECTION AND THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY (Graham Coop & Clarisse Ribeiro eds., 2008), p. 115, p. 131, Exh. R-3410.\n\n1424.\n\nThe requirement for an investor to make a referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i), first sentence (and, *a fortiori*, the requirement for the Tribunal to make a referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i), second sentence) cannot, in the Tribunal's view, apply in cases where such a referral would obviously be futile. Like any provision in an international treaty, Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT must be interpreted in good faith. A good faith interpretation of the provision leads to the conclusion that a referral cannot be required if following the referral procedure would clearly be futile under the circumstances of a specific case.\n\n1425.\n\nIt has long been recognized, with regard to the exhaustion of local remedies requirement in the context of the principles on diplomatic protection,1862 that following a prescribed procedure may be dispensed with under circumstances where doing so clearly would not produce the result that the procedure seeks to achieve. The relevant principle is set out in Article 15(a) of the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, providing that \"[l]ocal remedies do not need to be exhausted where... there are no reasonably available local remedies to provide effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress.\"1863 Tribunals adjudicating claims of investors under international investment treaties have made similar findings with regard to the obligation of investors to observe so-called cooling-off periods1864 or the requirement to submit a dispute to litigation in the host State's domestic courts for a certain period of time.1865\n\n*See e.g.*, *Certain Norwegian Loans (France v. Norway)*, Judgment, 6 July 1957, ICJ Reports 1957, p. 9, Separate Opinion of Judge Lauterpacht, p. 34, at p. 39; *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (Second Phase)*, Judgment, 5 February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, p. 3, Separate Opinion of Judge Tanaka, p. 114, at pp. 144-45.\n\nDraft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, adopted by the International Law Commission at its 58th session, 2006, Article 15(a).\n\n*See e.g.*, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation & Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/111, Decision on Jurisdiction, 9 September 2008 \u00b6 94.\n\n*See e.g.*, *BG Group Plc. v. The Republic of Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Award, 24 December 2007 \u00b6 147, Exh. R-3576; *Ambiente Ufficio S.P.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 8 February 2013 \u00b6 607.\n\n1426.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that a referral must be regarded as clearly futile if there is no possibility that the relevant authorities would in fact be able to come to some timely and meaningful conclusion about the dispute or make any timely determinations that could potentially serve to assist the Tribunal's decision-making. The Tribunal finds, for the reasons stated above, that no such possibility exists or existed in this case.\n\n1427.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that neither Party disputes that, in the event of a referral, any determinations of the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whatever discrete issues they might have been able to focus on relating to whether any tax was an expropriation would not have been binding on the Tribunal. The wording of Article 21(5)(b)(iii) of the ECT is very clear: bodies such as the present Tribunal *may* take into account any conclusion arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities regarding which the tax is an expropriation.1866\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 229; Transcript, Day 21 at 194 (Respondent's rebuttal).\n\n1428.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal holds that a referral of the dispute to the \"Competent Tax Authorities\" within the meaning of Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT would clearly have been futile at the outset of this arbitration and was therefore not required. It remains futile today.\n\n**iii. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n1429.\n\nAs a consequence, assuming (for the sake of argument) that some of Respondent's measures fell within the scope of the carve-out in Article 21(1), the Tribunal would nevertheless be in a position to proceed to determine whether the relevant measures constituted a violation of Article 13 of the ECT under the claw-back. It could do so even though it has not referred the issue of whether any tax is an expropriation to any of the Competent Tax Authorities because to do so would clearly be an exercise in futility.\n\n**(c) Second Reason: The Carve-Out Does Not Apply**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1430.\n\nSecondly, and independently from the above reasoning, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to rule on Claimants' claims under Article 13 of the ECT due to the fact that the Article 21 carve-out does not apply to the Russian Federation's measures because they are not, as the Tribunal has concluded above, on the whole, a *bona fide* exercise of the Russian Federation's tax powers.\n\n1431.\n\nThis accords with Claimants' view that Article 21 of the ECT can apply only to *bona fide* taxation actions, *i.e.*, actions that are motivated for the purpose of raising general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only \"under the guise\" of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent), argue Claimants, cannot qualify for exemption from the protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1).\n\n1432.\n\nThe Tribunal essentially accepts the latter interpretation of Article 21.\n\n1433.\n\nTo find otherwise would mean that the mere labelling of a measure as \"taxation\" would be sufficient to bring such measure within the ambit of Article 21(1) of the ECT, and produce a loophole in the protective scope of the ECT. Since the claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT relates only to expropriations under Article 13 of the ECT, a State could, simply by labelling a measure as \"taxation\", effectively avoid the control of that measure under the ECT's other protection standards. It would seem difficult to reconcile such an interpretation with the purpose of Part III of the ECT.\n\n1434.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent that, by finding that Article 21(1) of the ECT applies only to *bona fide* taxation, the Tribunal would be conflating the requirements for the application of the taxation carve-out (representing an exception to the protection standards under the ECT) and the requirements for the application of the protection standards themselves. For example, Article 13 of the ECT could be violated through a *bona fide* taxation measure that was aimed at the raising of State revenue, but whose effect was expropriatory. By contrast, the characterization of an incriminated action by a respondent State as a Taxation Measure for purposes of Article 21(1) of the ECT would be independent of the effects of that action, but rather depend on the motivation underlying it.\n\n1435.\n\nThe Tribunal also sees no reason to assume that it would be better for the question of the motivation underlying a particular measure to first be addressed through the \"Competent Tax Authorities\" (pursuant to the referral mechanism under Article 21(5) of the ECT), as the particular expertise of these authorities does not extend to the question of whether an act that on its face appears to be a taxation measure is in reality implemented for improper reasons. To the contrary, where the tax authorities of a State have participated in measures against an investor whose true purpose is unrelated to taxation, submitting these issues to the preliminary examination of the same authorities would add little value for an arbitral tribunal.\n\n1436.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, by making this finding, it is in good company, and that the two eminent arbitral tribunals which have previously considered, on an admittedly more limited record, essential elements of the dispute now before it, have adopted the same view.\n\n1437.\n\nThus, the *RosInvestCo* tribunal concluded that:\n\n[I]t is generally accepted that the mere fact that measures by a host state are taken in the form of application and enforcement of its tax law, does not prevent a tribunal from examining whether this conduct of the host state must be considered, under the applicable BIT or other international treaties on investment protection, as an abuse of tax law to in fact enact an expropriation.1867\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 628, Exh. C-1049.\n\n1438.\n\nSimilarly, the *Quasar* tribunal opined that:\n\nIt is no answer for a state to say that its courts have used the word \"taxation\"... in describing judgments by which they effect the dispossession of foreign investors. If that were enough, investment protection through international law would likely become an illusion, as states would quickly learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse measures, perhaps expropriation first of all, as taxation. When agreeing to the jurisdiction of international tribunals, states perforce accept that those jurisdictions will exercise their judgment, and not be stumped by the use of labels.1868\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 179, Exh. R-3383.\n\n1439.\n\nBy contrast, neither the *EnCana v. Ecuador* decision1869 nor the *Burlington v. Ecuador* award1870 to which Respondent refers in support of its view that any measure \"adopted in apparent [reliance on] tax legislation\" should fall under the taxation carve-out,1871 in fact appears to endorse such a position.\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 174 (Respondent's opening); Transcript, Day 21 at 179, 183 (Respondent's rebuttal) (discussing *EnCana v. Ecuador*, LCIA UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 February 2006 \u00b6 142, Exh. C-976).\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 174 (Respondent's opening); Transcript, Day 21 at 182-83 (Respondent's rebuttal) (discussing *Burlington Resources v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 \u00b6 207, Exh. R-992).\n\nTranscript, Day 3 at 174 (Respondent's opening).\n\n1440.\n\nThus, while the tribunal in *EnCana* stated that, for a measure to fall under the taxation carve-out in the treaty before it, it would have to be \"sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law or regulation (or to a procedure, requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent reliance on such a law or regulation),\"1872 the emphasis in this formulation appears to have been on the \"sufficiently clea[r]\" connection to an existing legal provision or practice, rather than the \"apparent reliance\" of the authorities on the existence of a legal basis for their actions. This is supported by another statement of the *EnCana* tribunal in the same paragraph, according to which \"an arbitrary demand unsupported by any provision of the law of the host State would not qualify\" for an exemption under the taxation carve-out.1873\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, LCIA UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 February 2006 \u00b6 142(1), Exh. C-976.\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, LCIA UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 February 2006 \u00b6 142(1), Exh. C-976.\n\n1441.\n\nThe context of the statement also makes it clear that the tribunal was only addressing minimum requirements for the application of the taxation carve-out before it, rather than expressing any views about situations in which the carve-out provision would not apply. Thus the tribunal emphasized that, for a measure to come under the treaty's carve-out, it would have to be \"sufficiently clearly connected to\" or supported by some taxation law, regulation or actual practice (the latter of which would in turn have to be based on a taxation law or regulation). It did, however, neither say nor imply that any measure which the authorities based on a taxation law or regulation would by definition be regarded as a taxation measure and therefore justify the application of the carve-out.\n\n1442.\n\nIt makes sense to regard a tax demand that is effectively motivated not by the aim of raising public revenue but by a purpose extraneous to taxation as an \"arbitrary demand\" that, in the words of the *EnCana* tribunal, cannot qualify for an exemption under a taxation carve-out.1874 Such an interpretation is also supported by the statement of Claimants' expert Professor Crawford, who was the presiding arbitrator in the *EnCana* arbitration and according to whom the decision was not meant to imply \"that anything labelled as a taxation measure is excluded\" by a taxation carve-out.1875\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, LCIA UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 February 2006 \u00b6 142(1), Exh. C-976.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 161 (Claimants' closing); Further Opinion on Jurisdictional Issues by James Crawford, 3 May 2007 \u00b6 5, Exh. C-613.\n\n1443.\n\nNeither does the *Burlington* decision referred to by Respondent support the view that a taxation carve-out would have to apply to any measure adopted by tax authorities in apparent reliance on tax legislation. In *Burlington*, the tribunal notes that \"bad faith\" of the respondent mentioned by the claimant rested on its allegation that Ecuador had forced the claimant to give up certain contractual rights by the use of its taxation legislation.1876 There was no suggestion in that case that Ecuador had taken any measures against the investor for motives that were entirely unrelated to the raising of public revenue. As a consequence, the tribunal in *Burlington*, when it said that the claimant's suggestion \"that Respondent used its tax power in bad faith in order to force Claimant to surrender its rights\" under the contracts raised \"matters of taxation\",1877 was referring to the specific situation in that case that cannot in any way be compared to the one at issue in the present proceedings.\n\n*Burlington Resources v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 \u00b6 175, Exh. R-992.\n\n*Burlington Resources v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 \u00b6 207, Exh. R-992.\n\n1444.\n\nIt follows that Article 21(1) of the ECT, which applies only to *bona fide* taxation measures, does not find any application in this arbitration. The tax assessments levied against Yukos by the Russian Federation, which the Tribunal has found were designed mainly to impose massive liabilities based on VAT and related fines, and were essentially aimed at paralyzing Yukos rather than collecting taxes, are not exempt from scrutiny under the ECT, as they are not captured by the carve-out of Article 21(1).\n\n1445.\n\nSimilarly, and *a fortiori*, subsequent steps in the enforcement of the tax assessments are not captured by the carve-out, because the Tribunal has found that they too were exigently pursued by means that indicate that Yukos was not just being chased to pay taxes, but was being driven into bankruptcy.\n\n**(d) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n1446.\n\nBased on the analysis set out in this chapter of the Award and for the two independent reasons set out above, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider whether the Russian Federation is liable to Claimants under Article 13 of the ECT for the measures which it has adopted and which have resulted in the evisceration of their investments and the destruction of Yukos.\n\n1447.\n\nWhile the Tribunal's finding that the carve-out in Article 21(1) does not apply would in principle allow the Tribunal to consider the measures under both Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT, in the circumstances, as will be seen, it will not be necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the expropriatory measures of Respondent are also in breach of Article 10 of the ECT.\n\n**X. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n1448.\n\nHaving dismissed Respondent's preliminary objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the admissibility of Claimants' claims and the applicability of the ECT in the present case, the Tribunal now turns to the question of the Russian Federation's liability under the Treaty. In Part VIII, the Tribunal canvassed the evidentiary record put before it by the Parties. In this Part X, the Tribunal draws the legal consequences of its factual conclusions, beginning by addressing questions of attribution.\n\n1449.\n\nAs has already been mentioned, the Tribunal's eventual conclusions regarding the alleged breaches by Respondent of Article 13 (Expropriation) of the ECT will make it unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the application of Article 10 (Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments). Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will set out the Parties' arguments with regard to Article 10. The Tribunal will then set out the Parties' arguments in respect of Article 13. Finally, the Tribunal will set out its decision regarding Respondent's liability and Claimants' contributory fault.\n\n**A. ATTRIBUTION**\n------------------\n\n1450.\n\nThe Parties are divided on the question of whether some of the actions of which Claimants complain are attributable to the Russian Federation. Below, the Tribunal sets out the Parties' submissions and its own views on this question.\n\n**1. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n1451.\n\nClaimants summarize their position with regard to the attribution of acts said to constitute breaches of the ECT to Respondent in their Memorial as follows:\n\n[T]he Russian Federation has acted through almost all of its organs, be it Executive or Judiciary, at all levels, including the highest, in seeking the destruction of Yukos. These include the President of the Russian Federation, the Presidential Administration, the Tax Ministry (later to become the Federal Taxation Service, a federal body of executive authority within the Ministry of Finance), the Ministry of Justice (under whose authority federal bodies of executive authority such the Federal Bailiff Service or the Federal Penitentiary Service are acting), the Prosecutor General's Office (a federal body entrusted with the task of execution of the laws in the name of the Russian Federation), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (responsible for the police forces), the Federal Security Service (also a federal body of executive authority, acting under the authority of the President). When not acting through these Executive organs or through the Russian courts, the Russian Federation was acting through State-owned entities, first and foremost State-owned company Rosneft...1878\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nMemorial \u00b6 551.\n\n1452.\n\nClaimants put forward a similar view at the Hearing:\n\n[W]e complain of acts of the executive organs. That's the President ; the Prime Minister ; ministries, including Tax, Justice and Interior Ministries; and their constituent bodies, the Federal Bailiffs Service and the Federal Penitentiary Service under Justice.\n\nWe complain of the actions of executive bodies or agencies: that would be the Prosecutor General's Office, the Federal Property Fund and the Federal Security Services. We also complain of the actions of the courts.... These are actions of the Russian Federation State organs, and they are, by definition, actions of the State.1879\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 252.\n\n1453.\n\nIn particular, with regard to the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos, Claimants assert that:\n\nThe Russian Federation initiated the bankruptcy proceedings through Rosneft, whilst the Russian courts ensured that the Russian State directly and through Rosneft would be the main creditor in the proceedings, systematically rejecting the claims of creditors related to Yukos or Yukos' shareholders. Thus placed in the driving seat in these bankruptcy proceedings, the Russian State, acting through the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft, rejected the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos' management and paved the way for itself, through bankruptcy receiver (Mr. Rebgun) and the Russian Federal Property Fund to distribute the rest of Yukos' assets by auctioning them at bargain prices.

However, Respondent insists that this is not enough to satisfy the standard of attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, and that Claimants must prove a link between any relevant actions of Rosneft or YNG and specific instructions given by the Russian State.1894 As explained by Respondent at the Hearing:\n\n[W]hat Claimants must establish to attribute the conduct of Rosneft under Article 8 to Respondent\u2014but which they clearly have not proven\u2014is that in acquiring YNG from Baikalfinance, entering into the agreement with SocGen and voting for Yukos' liquidation at the creditors\u2019 meeting, Rosneft was acting pursuant to specific instructions of a Russian State organ.1895\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 387.\n\nTranscript, Day 21 at 196. *See also* Transcript, Day 19 at 116.\n\n1460.\n\nSimilarly, with respect to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, Respondent asserts that \"what Claimants must establish, but what they clearly have not proven, is that in filing the bankruptcy petitions...

Tribunal's Decision on Attribution**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1465.\n\nThe Parties' differences in respect of attribution are centered on whether there can be attributed to Respondent actions of Rosneft in the acquisition of YNG, and in precipitating and participating in the bankruptcy proceedings. Their differences also include whether the course of the bankruptcy proceedings and the actions in respect of them by the bankruptcy administrator, Mr. Rebgun, are, in whole or in part, attributable to the Russian Federation.\n\n1466.\n\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility are in point. They and their commentary are conveniently republished in a book edited by Professor James Crawford, then the Commission's special rapporteur on the topic.1901 Chapter II, \"Attribution of Conduct to a State,\" in its introductory commentary, observes that, \"the general rule is that the only conduct attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e., as agents of the State.\"1902 Article 8, \"Conduct directed or controlled by a State *,* \" provides that \"[t]he conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction and control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"1903 The commentary to Article 8 observes that:\n\nQuestions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterprises which are State-owned and controlled.... The fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity... is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity.... Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, *prima facie* their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority... [and] the instructions, direction or control [of the State] must relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act.1904\n\nArticles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries (Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001), Articles 1-11 and 28-39, Exh. C-1042.\n\n*Ibid.p.* 54.\n\n*Ibid.* p. 47.\n\n*Ibid.* p. 48.\n\n1467.\n\nThe Parties agree that the actions of organs of the Russian State, whether executive, judicial or administrative, are attributable to Russia. As noted, disagreement is essentially confined to the actions of Rosneft (and Rosneft-controlled YNG) and the actions of the bankruptcy administrator.\n\n1468.\n\nThe Russian State owned all, or, subsequently, over 70 percent of the shares of Rosneft. Rosneft's officers were and are appointed by the State and many of the members of Rosneft's Board of Directors concurrently occupied and occupy senior executive positions in Government, some close to President Putin.1905 All this however does not suffice to attribute to the Russian State the actions of which Claimants especially complain: (a) Rosneft's collaboration with Baikal in the sale of YNG at auction and its immediate repurchase by Rosneft; (b) Rosneft's agreement with the SocGen bank creditors syndicate of Yukos to pay the debt of Yukos to those banks, the banks at the same time undertaking to petition Russian courts for the bankruptcy of Yukos; and (c) Rosneft's successful bids at the bankruptcy auction for much of what was left of Yukos.\n\nFor example, Mr. Igor Sechin, the Chairman of Rosneft's Board of Directors from 2004 to 2012, was also from 2004 to 2008 Deputy Head of the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation and aide to the President, and, from 2008 to 2012, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. In 2011, he became President of Rosneft. Mr. Sergei Naryshkin, now the Chairman of the State Duma, was member of the Rosneft Board of Directors from 2004 to 2009, while also holding the post, from 2004 to 2011, of Head of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation (*see* Rosneft Annual Reports 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, Exh. C-379; Rosneft Annual Report 2010, Exh. C-1265; *see also* Rosneft Annual Report 2012 (available on Rosneft's web-site).\n\n1469.\n\nThat is because it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove that Rosneft in so acting, did so at the instructions or direction, or under the control of the Russian State\u2014but for one remarkable fortuity that bears on the auction of the shares of YNG and their acquisition by Rosneft.\n\n1470.\n\nPresident Putin conducted a press conference with Russian and foreign media on 23 December 2004.1906 He was asked by V. Terekhov (Interfax), \"in the wake of serious events that occurred tonight, when Nefteyugansk passed into the ownership of a state company. Will you comment... ?\" President Putin replied:\n\nNow regarding the acquisition by Rosneft of the well-known asset of the company\u2014I do not remember its exact name\u2014is it Baikal Investment Company? Essentially, Rosneft, a 100% state owned company, has bought the well-known asset Yuganskneftgaz. That is the story. In my view, everything was done according to the best market rules... a state owned company or, rather, companies with 100% state capital, just as any other market players, have the right to do so and, as it emerged, exercised it. Now what would I like to say in this context? You all know only too well how the privatization drive was carried out in this country in the early 90s and how, using all sorts of stratagems, some of them in breach even of the then current legislation, many market players received state property worth many billions. Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests. I consider this to be quite logical.\n\nPresident of Russia Official Web Portal, Press Conference with Russian and Foreign Media, 23 December 2004, Exh. C-422.\n\n1471.\n\nTowards the end of this lengthy press conference, K. Eggert (BBC), noting that there had been a lot of criticism in Western press and official circles of the sale of YNG, asked for the reaction of President Putin to \"this criticism and does it concern you at all?\" President Putin responded by sharply criticizing the Texas bankruptcy proceedings brought by Yukos and the responsive court ruling as \"unacceptable from an international legal point of view... a breach of international politeness\" and a manifestation of U.S. \"imperium\". He concluded: \"As for the deal that took place, I think that it was carried out in strict conformity with the Russian legislation and in accordance with the norms of international law and the international commitments that Russia has taken on as part of the agreements that we have signed with our partners on the international stage. So I do not see any real problems here.\"\n\n1472.\n\nIn this latter comment about agreements that Russia had signed, President Putin may have had the ECT in mind. What at any rate is critical is his statement at the opening of the press conference that, with regard to Rosneft's purchase of the YNG shares from Baikal, \"the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests.\" He did not say that Rosneft was looking after its own interests, but that the purchase signified that the Russian State was looking after \"its own interests\". In the view of the Tribunal, that statement constitutes President Putin's public acceptance and assertion that Rosneft's purchase of the YNG shares from Baikal was an action in the State's interest, the inference being that the State, then 100 percent shareholder of Rosneft, the most senior officers of which were members of President Putin's entourage, directed that purchase in the interest of the State. It follows that that act, as well as the auction of YNG shares that underlay it, is attributable to the Russian State.\n\n1473.\n\nClaimants have invoked as well Rosneft's press release of 27 June 2005, in which Rosneft declared that, given that it is wholly owned by the State, \"Rosneft acts on its behalf.\"1907 They also noted a statement made by Rosneft in the context of its IPO in July 2006, acknowledging that \"the Russian Government... controls Rosneft....\"1908\n\n*Rosneft Shareholders' AGM Held*, Rosneft Press Release, 27 June 2005, Rosneft Website, Exh. C-1419.\n\nRosneft IPO Prospectus, 14 July 2006, Exh. C-380.\n\n1474.\n\nIt does not necessarily follow from the foregoing that the actions of Rosneft in contracting with the SocGen bank creditors of Yukos, and in bidding at the bankruptcy auction of Yukos itself, are attributable to Russia. Yet it may well be that in taking those actions, Rosneft did so at the *sub rosa* direction of the Russian State, at the direction of senior officers of President Putin's entourage who concurrently ran Rosneft. In the view of the Tribunal, it may reasonably be concluded that Rosneft was so directed. Or, if not, that it was not because it did not need to be; Rosneft was such a creature of President Putin's entourage that it reflexively implemented his policies. But proving that admittedly is elusive, in the absence of an inculpatory admission on behalf of the Russian State such as that of President Putin in respect of the acquisition of YNG.\n\n1475.\n\nAre the actions of the bankruptcy administrator, Mr. Rebgun, attributable to the Russian Federation?\n\n1476.\n\nRespondent observed in its Rejoinder that \"[i]n most European legal systems a liquidator or bankruptcy receiver is not a State organ\" and that bankruptcy managers and receivers do not \"generally exercise elements of governmental authority or act under the instructions, direction or control of the State\".1909 Respondent cited pertinent awards of investment treaty tribunals, including *Plama*1910 and *Oostergeel v. Slovak Republic*1911 as well as the decision of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in *Kotov v. Russia*1912 in support of this conclusion. Those decisions are indeed supportive.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 389-390.\n\n*Plama* \u00b6\u00b6 252-53.\n\n*Jan* *Oostergetel* \u00b6\u00b6 151-58.\n\n*Kotov v. Russia* \u00b6\u00b6 99-107.\n\n1477.\n\nClaimants did not address these arguments at the Hearing, where they appeared to limit their complaints in the context of the bankruptcy proceedings to \"the actions of the Russian courts, who appointed the interim receiver and confirmed all his actions, as well as the actions of the admitted creditors, namely the Tax Ministry and Rosneft.\"1913\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 252.\n\n1478.\n\nRespondent has maintained that the actions of the Tax Ministry\u2014incontestably an organ of the Russian State\u2014in asserting and realizing its predominant claims to the assets of Yukos in the bankruptcy proceedings, nevertheless are not in breach of the ECT because the Tax Ministry there acted as a mere commercial creditor and did not exercise governmental authority. \"The votes of the Russian tax authorities are attributable to Respondent, but are not an exercise of *puissance publique.* The tax authorities voted at the Creditors' Meeting, and, more generally, participated in Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings in their capacity as a Yukos creditor alongside other creditors, enjoyed no special prerogatives or privileges, and were subject to the same rules as private creditors, the 2002 Bankruptcy Law.\"1914 Moreover, Respondent contends that the Moscow Arbitrazh Court's \"acceptance of the bankruptcy petitions and ratification of the creditors' decision to liquidate Yukos does not change this conclusion... [It] enforced legislation governing private-law relations, specifically, bankruptcy legislation, which imposes limitations inherent in private property. Loss resulting from a court's enforcement of legal limitations inherent in private property is not compensable under Article 13 or 10(1) ECT, irrespective of whether the court proceedings were instituted by a State organ.\"1915\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 177.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 178.\n\n1479.\n\nThe foregoing line of argument runs up however against the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 4 provides that \"[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State....\" The commentary to this article specifies that \"[i]t is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as \u2018commercial' or as \u2018 *acta iure gestionis* ' *.* \"1916\n\nILC Aricles on State Responsibility, Articles 1-11 and 28-39, p. 40, Exh. C-1042.\n\n1480.\n\nIn respect of attribution, the Tribunal concludes that the Russian Federation is responsible for its organs, executive, judicial and administrative, in the actions that they took against and in relation to Yukos and its stockholders; that, for the reasons stated above, the Russian Federation, speaking through its President, accepted responsibility for Rosneft's acquisition of YNG and for the auction that underlay it; and that, in respect of other actions of Rosneft that bear on the destruction of Yukos, while proof of specific State direction is lacking, it may reasonably be held that the highest officers of Rosneft who at the same time served as officials of the Russian Federation in close association with President Putin acted in implementation of the policy of the Russian Federation. The actions of Mr. Rebgun as bankruptcy administrator are not attributable to Respondent.1917\n\nIt is of interest to note that, in an interview with the Vedomosti paper in October 2006, Mr. Rebgun is alleged to have acknowledged his ties to the Russian security establishment known as the \"siloviki.\" *Yukos liquidator says process will be legal*, AFP World News, 10 August 2006, Exh. C-822.\n\n**B. ARTICLE 10 OF THE ECT**\n----------------------------\n\n**1.

Kazakhstan* and to a recent commentary by Judge Schwebel, a member of this Tribunal, where he wrote that:\n\n[w]hat in another case may or may not be fair and equitable treatment by a State of foreign investment may involve procedural matters, or matters of substance, or both, far removed from the confines and criteria of a denial of justice.1934\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 607-16.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 608, referring to Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, \"Is *Neer* Far from Fair and Equitable?\" (2011) 27 Arb. Int'l 555 p. 559, Exh. C-1647.\n\n1489.\n\nIt follows, submit Claimants, that while investment tribunals have considered the fair and equitable treatment standard to include the manner in which an investor and its investment are treated by the host State's courts \"mainly through the prism of denial of justice... this is by no means exhaustive of the standard.\"1935 In sum, Claimants' position is that, while denial of justice forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the latter standard is not limited to the former.1936\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 611.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 615\n\n1490.\n\nClaimants also submit that freedom from arbitrariness and discrimination forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.1937 In support of their submission, Claimants refer to the award in *Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic* (\" ***Saluka*** \")\u2014quoted verbatim by the *Biwater Gauff v. United Republic of Tanzania* (\" ***Biwater*** \") and *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* tribunals\u2014which established the proposition that the standard of reasonableness has no different meaning in this context than in that of the fair and equitable treatment standard with which it is associated.1938\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 645, citing *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005 (hereinafter \" *CMS v. Argentina* \").\n\nMemorial \u00b6 645, citing *Saluka*, \u00b6 460, Exh.

C-992.\n\n1491.\n\nClaimants submit that the *Plama v. Bulgaria* award confirms that \"unreasonable\" conduct is synonymous with \"arbitrary\" conduct.1939 Claimants also contend that many tribunals, such as those in *Lemire v. Ukraine* and *Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic* (\" ***Siemens*** \"), have ruled that various State actions, not \"based on reason\", and comparable to those alleged against Respondent were \"arbitrary\".1940\n\nMemorial \u00b6 646, *Plama*, Exh. C-994.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 651-52.\n\n1492.\n\nClaimants further submit that the principle of proportionality is an element of the fair and equitable treatment standard, as confirmed in *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile* (\" ***MTD v. Chile*** \")and *Vivendi v. Argentina*.1941\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 679.\n\n1493.\n\nMany arbitral tribunals, say Claimants, have also held that a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.1942 They refer to the concepts of consistency, transparency and treatment that does not frustrate the legitimate expectations of the investor as being essential to ensure such an environment1943 Claimants cite the *PSEG Global v. Turkey* award, where the tribunal stated that \"the \u2018roller-coaster' effect of the continuing legislative changes\" seriously breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation.1944\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 697.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 698.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 703.\n\n1494.\n\nClaimants also contend that Article 10(1) of the ECT includes a stand-alone prohibition against discrimination that is breached if the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investor's investment is impaired. The test for identifying discriminatory measures, submit Claimants, is described in *Plama* as entailing \"like persons being treated in a different manner in similar circumstances without reasonable or justifiable grounds.\"1945\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 737.\n\n1495.\n\nFurther, Claimants argue that the non-discrimination standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT is not limited to measures taken because of the foreign nationality of the investor. Claimants emphasize that nothing in the wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT suggests such a limit to the standard. This is particularly obvious when Article 10(1) is contrasted with Article 10(7) of the ECT, which contains the most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment standards. It follows, argue Claimants, that \"when the ECT's drafters intended to restrict a nondiscrimination provision to nationality-based discrimination, they expressly did so.\"1946 Claimants contend that the former U.S. BIT negotiator, Mr. Vandevelde supported this interpretation:\n\nNothing in the language [of the ECT] suggests that it is limited to discrimination based on nationality.... Although the most common competitive disadvantages imposed on foreign investments may be nationality-based, a competitive disadvantage imposed on some other basis may be just as detrimental to the investment.1947\n\nReply \u00b6 641.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 642, referring to Kenneth Vandevelde, *Bilateral Investment Treaties, History, Policy and Interpretation* (OUP 2010) pp. 213-14, Exh. C-1018.\n\n1496.\n\nClaimants also rely on the awards in *Plama*, *Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan*1948 and *National Grid*1949 for the proposition that arbitral tribunals interpreting the ECT and other investment protection treaties with identical or similar provisions have concluded that the non-discrimination standard is not restricted to a protection against nationality-based discrimination.1950\n\n*Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v. Republic of Tajikistan* (SCC Case No. V064/2008), Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability of 2 September 2009 \u00b6 248, Exh. C-1531.\n\n*National Grid P.L.C. v.

C-996.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 644-46.\n\n1497.\n\nClaimants contend that the authorities relied upon by Respondent for the contrary proposition either contradict Respondent's position or are inapposite.1951 Claimants characterize Respondent's \"selective quoting\" from the *LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v. The Argentine Republic* award as \"unfortunate.\" They say that, in fact, in the paragraph immediately following the one cited by Respondent, the Tribunal said the exact opposite. They point out that the tribunal found that \"while there was no intent to discriminate against the investments on account of the investors' nationality, there was differential treatment of similar companies.\"1952 Claimants also highlight that Respondent's reliance on declarations from the U.S. and Canada is of no assistance, as they are non-signatories to the ECT.1953\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 647-51.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 650, referring to Counter-Memorial p. 748, n.2479; *LG&E Energy Corp et al. v.

C-981 (hereinafter *\"LG&E* \").\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 652-53.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1498.\n\nRespondent submits that, in determining whether the host State's conduct is fair and equitable, an investor's legitimate and reasonable expectations are the \"dominant\" element. Respondent also submits that the assessment of the reasonableness and legitimacy of an investor's expectations of fair and equitable treatment must be based on the state of the law of the host State, its political and historical conditions, and any particular conditions of treatment the State offered the investor at the time it made its investment.1954 In support of these propositions, Respondent cites *Saluka* and *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*.1955\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1549-50.\n\n*Ibid*. citing *Saluka* \u00b6\u00b6 301-302; *Duke Energy Eletroquil Partners S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008 \u00b6 340, Exh. C-993.\n\n1499.\n\nRespondent also refers to the award in *M.C.I. v. Ecuador* to support the proposition that the obligation to provide an investor with stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions cannot be construed as an obligation to refrain from enforcing existing law.1956 Respondent relies on Professor Dolzer's view that \"[t]he pre-investment legal order forms the framework for the positive reach of the expectation which will be protected and also the scope of considerations upon which the host state is entitled to rely when it defends [itself].\"1957\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1551.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1552.\n\n1500.\n\nRespondent refers to the awards in *Lauder v. Czech Republic* and *Genin v. Estonia* in support of its contention that conduct cannot be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard if authorities are only taking the actions necessary to enforce the their laws.1958 Respondent also relies on the *Genin v. Estonia* award for the proposition that where a State's actions are the justified exercise of its power to enforce its laws, the procedural irregularities complained of by investors must be very severe to amount to a violation of the relevant investment treaty.1959\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1553, referring to *Lauder v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001 \u00b6\u00b6 296-97, Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1566-67, referring to *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Ltd., Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v.

R-1095.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1567.\n\n1501.\n\nMoreover, Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT\u2014specifically with respect to establishing a denial of justice, or conduct that is otherwise manifestly unfair or unreasonable\u2014corresponds to an international law minimum standard of treatment of foreign investment.1960 This minimum standard, submits Respondent, incorporates the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for alien property, as well as treaty obligations of the host State, but excludes decisions by international organizations, such as the ECtHR.1961\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1559.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1561.\n\n1502.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants' burden for showing a violation of the minimum standard is \"demanding\".1962 Thus, some tribunals have equated the fair and equitable treatment standard with the *Neer* standard, which for allegations of due process violations by a host State's courts would require a showing of outrage, bad faith, willful neglect of duty, or \"insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\".1963\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1562, referring to *AES Summit Generation Ltd. and AES-Tisza Eromu Kft v. Hungary*, ICSID ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010 \u00b6 9.3.40, Exh.

Ukraine*, Respondent argues that the assessment of the conduct of national courts must include the availability of remedies in the host State's legal system and whether or not such remedies were exercised; and if they were exercised, whether they were exercised fully and wisely.1965 In addition, in order to prove their claim for denial of justice, Claimants must show a \"clear and malicious misapplication of the law\" based on the content of judicial opinions themselves.1966\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1571.\n\n*Ibid.* citing *Limited Liability Company AMTO v.

Regardless of the standard of review under Article 10(1), Claimants must establish that the Russian Federation's actions interfered with Claimants' legitimate and reasonable expectations based on a full disclosure of the facts relevant to Claimants' investments and based on operation of the investments in accordance with Russian law\n\na)... Claimants must establish... specific, legal commitments by Respondent based on a full disclosure of the facts relevant to their investments\n\nb) Claimants also must establish that the Russian Federation's actions interfered with their expectations that are based on an operation of their investments in accordance with Russian law\n\n2. Claimants must establish a systemic judicial failure, or, at a minimum, that the conduct they attack is otherwise manifestly unfair or unreasonable\n\na) Claimants must establish that the Russian court decisions they attack constitute a denial of justice or are otherwise manifestly unfair or unreasonable\n\nb) Specifically with respect to the taxation measures Claimants challenge, Claimants must establish a systemic judicial failure or, at a minimum, that the measures are manifestly unfair or unreasonable, and contrary to internationally recognized tax policies and practices\n\nc) Specifically with respect to Yukos' bankruptcy proceedings, Claimants must demonstrate a systemic failure of the Russian judicial system, or, at a minimum, that the bankruptcy proceedings were manifestly unfair or unreasonable\n\n3. To establish \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" that impaired the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of their investments, Claimants must prove a systemic judicial failure, or, at a minimum, that the taxation measures complained of are contrary to international tax practices or treated similar cases differently on the basis of nationality, without reasonable justification.1969\n\nRejoinder, Table of Contents, pp. v-vi.\n\n1506.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that in order to substantiate their claim, Claimants must prove a direct causal link between the loss of their shares and measures in breach of Article 10(1) ECT.1970\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 173.\n\n**3. Did Respondent Accord Claimants' Investments the Standard of Treatment Required by Article 10(1) of the ECT?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1507.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent violated its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to accord Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment and by impairing Claimants' investments by discriminatory measures.\n\n1508.\n\nIn terms of fair and equitable treatment, Claimants contend that Respondent's actions, both individually and collectively, constitute breaches of the most basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process, as well as a denial of justice.1971 Claimants emphasize that their case is not limited to one of \"systematic denial of justice\", as Respondent maintains.1972\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 568, 618.\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 134 (Claimants' closing); *Ibid.* at 145.\n\n1509.\n\nClaimants also emphasize that, in considering whether Respondent violated the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Tribunal should not view each fact in isolation, but rather look at the totality of Respondent's actions.1973 Thus, Claimants state that, while some of Respondent's actions could and do, in and of themselves, constitute breaches of Articles 10(1), their position is that \"the totality of the Russian Federation's actions and their cumulative effect\" constitute a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.1974\n\nTranscript, Day 1 at 155-57 (Claimants' opening), referring to *RosInvestCo* \u00b6 621, Exh.

The Tribunal sees no reason why a breach of a FET obligation cannot be a series of cumulative acts and omissions. One of these may not on its own be enough, but taken together, they can constitute a breach of FET obligations.\"); *see also* Claimants' PostHearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 182-84.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182.\n\n1510.\n\nClaimants offer a list of specific actions taken by Respondent, or attributable to it, which, they say, demonstrate that Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n1511.\n\nFirstly, Claimants contend that Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard by the conduct of \"over 150 raids... in brutal conditions from July 4, 2003 to November 18, 2004, and the innumerable searches and seizures conducted by armed and masked officers at Yukos' headquarters, the premises of affiliates or entities related to Yukos, or the offices of lawyers acting in Yukos-related cases, leaving neither a copy nor a simple list of the documents and items seized, in breach of even the most basic requirements of Russian law.\"1975 Claimants allege that these searches and seizures were part of the Russian Federation's campaign to destroy Yukos and had a major disruptive effect on the operations of Yukos, reducing the company's chances of survival in the face of the Russian Federation's attacks (and, in particular, \"the accelerated pace in which tax debts were fabricated\").1976 As for the \"campaign of harassment\" on PwC, and subsequent raid, Claimants allege that it precipitated PwC's withdrawal of its certification of Yukos' audits.1977\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 161, referring to Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 152-66; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 74-94; Rieger WS \u00b6 28; Misamore WS \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Schmidt WS \u00b6 16; *see also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 569-79.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 159, 161-62, 165.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 578.\n\n1512.\n\nSecondly, Claimants contend that Respondent did not provide proper notice of administrative actions to be taken by the State.1978 In that regard, Claimants submit that the Tax Ministry, the Russian courts and the bailiffs repeatedly failed to afford Yukos reasonable timeframes in which to pay or challenge the alleged tax reassessments: just two days to voluntarily pay after issuance of the 2000 Decision, and a single day to pay after issuance of each of the 2002 and 2003 Decisions. In addition, Claimants allege that Respondent did not wait for these short time limits to expire before filing a petition for collection with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, which Claimants allege were swiftly \"rubber-stamped\" in favor of Respondent.1979\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 567, 586.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 582-90.\n\n1513.\n\nThirdly, Claimants submit that Respondent did not afford them the opportunity to be heard by an impartial tribunal. Claimants contend that Respondent instead ensured that government-friendly judges sanctioned the tax reassessments and that the three judges who failed to rule against Yukos were removed, and their rulings later overturned. Yukos' requests for interim relief to suspend the effect of the tax reassessment decisions pending appeal on the merits were also systematically rejected. Claimants further submit that hearings on these matters were set, and appeals ruled upon, almost immediately, and that Yukos was not given real access to case materials.1980\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 581-86.\n\n1514.\n\nFourthly, Claimants assert that the sale of YNG was a sham auction, orchestrated by Respondent under the pretext of satisfying Yukos' alleged tax liability for the 2000 Decision; an alleged liability that Claimants submit was fully paid prior to the auction date.1981 With only State-owned Gazprom and Baikal in attendance,1982 Claimants contend that Baikal acquired YNG for a \"bargain\" price. Claimant also notes that Baikal was purchased by State-owned Rosneft shortly following the auction, and that President Putin himself admitted Baikal was used as a front company to shield the future owner - Rosneft - from legal claims.1983\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 594.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 595.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 599.\n\n1515.\n\nFifthly, Claimants assert that the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos at the behest of Rosneft, the biased conduct of those proceedings by Russian courts, and the sale of Yukos' remaining assets also violated due process requirements.1984\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 601-17.\n\n1516.\n\nClaimants submit that the following actions taken by Respondent in breach of due process amount to a denial of justice:\n\n\u2022 the administration of justice by Russian courts with respect to all Yukos related matters did not meet generally accepted international law standards of due process, impartiality and legitimacy;1985\n\n\u2022 Russian courts were unduly hasty in their decision-making, refusing to provide Yukos with sufficient time or adequate opportunity to review the evidence on which the tax reassessment payment demands were based which eventually lead to its bankruptcy;1986 and\n\n\u2022 the systematic removal of judges who ruled in Yukos' favor and dismissal of Yukos' challenges against judges who had previously ruled against it in tax proceedings.1987\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 643.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 626.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 629.\n\n1517.\n\nIn their discussion of denial of justice, Claimants invited the Tribunal to note the fact that Yukos lost nearly all of its cases in 2000 against the tax authorities and the statistic put forward by Mr. Konnov that the taxpayer in Russia wins in 75 percent of the cases.1988\n\nTranscript, Day 17 at 135 (Claimants' closing).\n\n1518.\n\nMoreover, Claimants argue that even if it purported to discuss denial of justice claims, Respondent has actually failed to defend its conduct, limiting itself to misstating the standard applicable to a claim of denial of justice.1989 According to Claimants, Respondent has \"concentrated its energies on urging the Arbitral Tribunal to impose a higher burden on Claimants, for the facts of the Russian Federation's conduct are devastating.\"1990 Claimants assert that Respondent's attempts to elevate the applicable threshold fail because Respondent's conduct was indefensible under any plausible interpretation of the standards contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.1991\n\nReply \u00b6 612.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 631.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1519.\n\nClaimants also contend that Respondent's actions were arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate, and abusive,1992 in their reference to the following actions of Respondent:\n\n\u2022 Respondent's unrelenting campaign of coercion, harassment, and intimidation against Yukos and related persons and entities;1993\n\n\u2022 the imposition of arbitrarily and disproportionately large payment demands by Respondent under the guise of tax reassessments, enforced within short time periods and accompanied by arbitrary freezing of assets orders;1994 and\n\n\u2022 Respondent's unreasonable and arbitrary rejection of Yukos' proposals to settle or resolve the alleged tax claims.1995\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 644-95. Claimants submit that while Article 10(1) of the ECT only expressly prohibits \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\", jurisprudence confirms that \"unreasonable\" measures have the same meaning as \"arbitrary\" conduct, and similarly violate the fair and equitable treatment standard (*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 665-67, citing *EDF (Services) Limited v. The Republic of Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009 \u00b6 303, Exh. C-1001; *Plama* \u00b6 184; *Saluka* \u00b6 460; *CMS v.

According to Claimants, in providing no other defense, Respondent has conceded that its conduct breached Article 10(1). Claimants view Respondent's defense as resting\n\nsquarely on the theory that Article 21(1)... operates as a license to ECT signatories to freely violate their treaty obligations under Article 10(1)... so long as they create the appearance that their actions have some connection, however remote and indirect, to taxation.2000\n\n*Ibid. \u00b6* 577.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1524.\n\nRespondent's main position is that Claimants have failed to establish any violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n1525.\n\nIn particular, Respondent submits that (a) Claimants have failed to establish that conduct, which is attributable to Respondent and an exercise of its sovereign power, proximately caused the loss of Claimants' investment;2001 (b) Claimants have failed to establish that the measures they challenge interfered with Claimants' legitimate expectations;2002 and (c) the measures relating to the imposition and enforcement of taxes were well within the range of a State's generally accepted regulatory powers.2003\n\nPost-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 174-80.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 184-90; Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1545, 1555-58.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 191-99.

ARTICLE 13 OF THE ECT**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1528.\n\nArticle 13(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:\n\n*Article 13* EXPROPRIATION\n\n(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:\n\n(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;\n\n(b) not discriminatory;\n\n(c) carried out under due process of law; and\n\n(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\nSuch compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\").\n\nSuch fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n1529.\n\nThe Parties analyze Article 13 in two steps, first by addressing what constitutes expropriation or \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation,\" and then by discussing what constitutes a legal expropriation, *i.e.*, an expropriation conducted in accordance with the four conditions set out in Article 13(1): that the expropriation be (a) in the public interest; (b) not discriminatory; (c) carried out under due process of law; and (d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. The Tribunal will summarize first the Parties' principal arguments regarding the legal standards of Article 13 and will then review the facts of the present case in the light of these standards.\n\n**2. Applicable Legal Standards under Article 13 of the ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1530.\n\nClaimants note that Article 13(1) of the ECT deals with nationalization and expropriation, as well as other equivalent measures. Claimants submit that such equivalent measures include \"covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner... of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"2007\n\nMemorial \u00b6 855, quoting *Metalclad Corp. v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000 \u00b6 103, Exh. C-954.\n\n1531.\n\nClaimants submit that the standard for expropriation is objective and that while the showing of intent to expropriate may evidence a measure to be expropriatory, it is not a requirement of expropriation.2008\n\nMemorial *.* \u00b6 856, referring to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

C-968; *see also* Transcript, Day 1 at 154.\n\n1532.\n\nClaimants emphasize that, in considering whether Respondent expropriated Claimants' investment within the meaning of Article 13(1), the Tribunal should look at the totality of Respondent's actions and not at each fact in isolation.2009 The question is not, Claimants submit, whether each of Respondent's individual actions was lawful under Russian law, or was no different than the practice in other jurisdictions, but whether the totality of Respondent's conduct was lawful under international law.2010\n\nTranscript, Day 1 at 153-56 (Claimants\u2019 opening), referring to *RosInvestCo* \u00b6 621, Exh.

According to Claimants, a State alleging that it has legitimately exercised its powers of taxation is not impervious to scrutiny under international law;2018 \"taxation, like the exercise of any other sovereign power, can be expropriatory.\"2019\n\nReply \u00b6 754.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 756, 761.\n\n1536.\n\nWith regard to non-discrimination, Claimants assert that it is defined as the singling out of a person or group of people without a reasonable basis. Thus, Claimants submit, a finding of \"unjustified differential treatment, whether in law or in fact,\" has been regarded as discriminatory.2020 Claimants quote a commentary that the \"expropriation of an investment because of animosity between the host-state officials and the investor or in retaliation for lawful, but politically unpopular, conduct of the investment would violate the nondiscrimination condition.\"2021 Claimants add that, as in the case of Article 10(1) of the ECT, discrimination under Article 13(1) refers not only to nationality-based discrimination, but to other types of unjustified discriminatory treatment as well.2022\n\nMemorial \u00b6 878, citing *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

The host State has the power to accept and define the rights acquired by an investor at the time of the making of the investment. And a foreign investor acquires rights in an investment, subject to the existing regulatory framework. So absent a specific commitment from the host State to the investor, an expropriation may occur only where the State measure does not reflect a pre-existing lawful limitation inherent in private property.2037\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 123-24 (Respondent's closing), referring to *LG&E* \u00b6\u00b6 189-90.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 124-25 (Respondent's closing), citing 2004 and 2012 U.S. Model BITs, Annex B \u00b6 1, Exhs.

Nor can legitimate expectations be premised on illegal conduct.2039 Respondent also submits that legitimate expectations include an expectation of \"the evolution of the regulatory regime, including through interpretation or application of the law, even if without precedent, and changes through legislative amendment.\"2040\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 984; Transcript, Day 19 at 129-30 (Respondent's closing); *see also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 184.\n\nTranscript, Day 19, 126-27 (Respondent\u2019s closing), referring to *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

R-1143.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 185.\n\n1545.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submits that a distinction must be made between expropriatory measures that breach a host State\u2019s obligations under the ECT and the legitimate exercise of a State\u2019s regulatory power, including for the imposition and enforcement of taxes.2041 Factors which distinguish one from the other include the compatibility of the measures with international and comparative standards, as well as their compatibility with national law and review by domestic courts.2042 Applying the latter criterion, Respondent submits that States cannot usually incur international responsibility through the actions of their tax authorities so long as domestic courts are available to resolve disputes between the tax authorities and taxpayers.2043\n\nTranscript, Day 19, 133-34 (Respondent\u2019s closing); Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 191.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 136, 142 (Respondent\u2019s closing); Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 192-93.\n\nTranscript, Day 19 at 136, 141-42 (Respondent\u2019s closing).\n\n1546.\n\nThus, in the present case, to establish a violation of Article 13(1) of the ECT, Claimants must demonstrate that the decisions of the Russian courts that upheld the challenged taxation measures, as well as the decisions issued in the context of Yukos\u2019 bankruptcy, are themselves \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.\"2044 Accordingly, Respondent says, Claimants must demonstrate that these decisions were the result of a systemic failure of the Russian judicial system or, at a minimum, are manifestly improper, abusive, extraordinarily excessive or arbitrary, in manifest violation of Russian law, and in violation of international and comparative standards, so as to place them outside Russia\u2019s wide margin of discretion in taxation matters.2045 Respondent emphasizes that this Tribunal cannot sit as an appellate court reviewing the decisions of the Russian courts.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1107; Rejoinder \u00b6 425.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 425-69.\n\n1547.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimants must establish a violation of the requirements in Article 13(1) of the ECT.2046 Regarding the non-discrimination requirement, Respondent submits that Article 13(1) calls for proof that similar cases were, without reasonable justification, treated differently on the basis of nationality. Accordingly, Claimants must allege differential treatment based on foreign ownership.2047\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 471 -86.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 765.\n\n**3.

For a detailed discussion, see paragraphs 679-97, 745-50, and 934-45 above.\n\n1556.\n\nAs for the criminal proceedings against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and certain Yukos officials, as well as the searches, seizures and arrests carried out in support of those proceedings, Respondent submits that these events did not cause Yukos' liquidation. According to Respondent, the evidence establishes that these measures did not impair Yukos' operations.2063\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 182.\n\n1557.\n\nRespondent further contends that Claimants have failed to establish that the measures they challenge interfered with Claimants' legitimate expectations.2064\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 978-1095.\n\n1558.\n\nWith regard to the tax assessments, Respondent argues that Claimants had no \"legitimate expectation that the tax authorities would not apply the substance-over-form, proportionality, and bad-faith taxpayer doctrines to attribute the income nominally earned by Yukos' sham trading shells to Yukos,\" because Respondent had never made any specific representation, based upon full disclosure, that Respondent would allow Yukos to operate its tax schemes with impunity.2065 Nor had Claimants ever sought or obtained a formal tax ruling on the legality of Yukos\u2019 tax scheme.2066 In fact, prior to the 2000 Tax Audit Report, according to Respondent, Yukos sought, but was unable to obtain, a legal opinion supporting the legality of its tax scheme.2067\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 187-88; *see also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1030-65; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 748-756.

According to Respondent, the attribution for tax purposes of revenues nominally earned by sham entities to a company that sought to evade taxes was a proper application of legal doctrines that were well-settled in Russia, and are employed by many other States.2068 Yukos itself, argues Respondent, was well aware that its tax schemes, if discovered or disclosed, would result in substantial tax liabilities.2069\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 188 (*see* discussion in Chapters VIII.A and VIII.B).\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1003-29; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 584-645; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 189.\n\n1560.\n\nRespondent also argues that the Russian legislation on which the enforcement measures (including the asset freezes, fines, default interest, enforcement fees and the forced sales of Yukos\u2019 assets) were based was already extant in the 1990s. These enforcement measures were thus foreseeable consequences of Yukos\u2019 failure to pay.2070\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 189.\n\n1561.\n\nRespondent then submits that the measures taken for the imposition and enforcement of taxes were well within the range of a State\u2019s generally accepted regulatory powers.2071 This is shown by the fact that these measures were in conformity with Russian law and were upheld by national courts, and were in accordance with international and comparable standards and practices of other countries.2072\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 191.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 192-93; *see also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1106, 1120-1232.\n\n1562.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants have failed to show that the Russian courts contributed to any \"measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation\" through any of the decisions they issued in the context of the enforcement of the tax demands,2073 the Yukos-Sibneft demerger,2074 the criminal proceedings against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev,2075 or the Yukos bankruptcy proceedings.2076\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1337-1434.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1435-51.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1452-6.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1457-1543.\n\n1563.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that the ECtHR unanimously determined that the challenged tax assessments were a legitimate exercise of Respondent's regulatory powers.2077 According to Respondent, given that the vast majority of the ECT Contracting States (including the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and Cyprus) are also ECHR Contracting States and that the ECHR enshrines the common *ordre public* of the European States in terms of democracy and the rule of law, the \"ECtHR's interpretation and application of the ECHR to the measures at issue, through a final and binding judgment, must be taken into account under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT in assessing whether they are within the bounds of generally recognized regulatory powers.\"2078\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 194-95, referring to ECtHR Yukos Judgment \u00b6 606, Exh. R-3328 (\"... each of the Tax Assessments 2000-2003 pursued a legitimate aim of securing the payment of taxes and constituted a proportionate measure in pursuance of this aim.\").\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 195; *see also* Transcript, Day 19 at 143-49.\n\n**4. If Respondent's Actions Constitute Expropriation, Has Respondent Met the Criteria for a Lawful Expropriation under Article 13(1) of the ECT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n1564.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent did not meet any of the four requirements under Article 13(1) of the ECT for a lawful expropriation (*i.e.*, public interest, non-discrimination, due process and adequate compensation).2079\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 865-90.\n\n1565.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the expropriation of Claimants' investment was not in the public interest. In fact, \"the facts of the case unmistakably show that the actions of the Russian Federation had nothing to do with the legitimate exercise of sovereign power, whether taxation, law enforcement or otherwise, but were rather a blatant confiscation of strategic assets and the elimination of a potential political opponent.\"2080 Claimants invoke the finding of the *RosInvestCo* tribunal that the Russian Federation\u2019s actions were \"linked to the strategic objective to return assets to the control of the Russian State and to an effort to suppress a political opponent.\"2081 According to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s justification that it only sought to enforce its laws is without any basis.2082\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 167; *see also* Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1010-12; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 511-13.\n\nReply \u00b6 726.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 745-838.\n\n1566.\n\nClaimants also submit that the expropriation of their investments was discriminatory and was not carried out under due process of law.2083 Nor was the expropriation accompanied by compensation, let alone \"prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\"2084\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 881, 885-87.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 889.\n\n1567.\n\nClaimants conclude that the Russian Federation\u2019s actions are in breach of Article 13(1) and constitute an internationally wrongful act for which Respondent is responsible.2085\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 890.\n\n**(b) Respondent's Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n1568.\n\nEven if Claimants could establish expropriation, which Respondent contends they cannot, Respondent maintains that the requirements in Article 13(1) of the ECT have not been breached.\n\n1569.\n\nRespondent submits that no lack of public interest has been established.2086 Respondent states that its actions were legitimate, as \"the purposes justifying imposition and enforcement of taxes, including severe penalties, fines and other sanctions in case of non-compliance of taxpayers with their obligations to pay taxes, are firmly recognized in international law.\"2087 Respondent asserts that Claimants have not addressed the ECtHR\u2019s rejection of Yukos\u2019 \"political motivation\" charge.2088\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1318-36.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1324.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 764.\n\n1570.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimants have failed to establish discrimination under Article 13(1)(b) of the ECT because Claimants do not allege any discrimination based on foreign ownership or residence, which Respondent contends is the intended scope of the term \"discriminatory\" in this provision.2089 Respondent submits that selective tax enforcement is not discriminatory within the meaning of Article 13(1)(b) of the ECT.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1238-51.\n\n1571.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Yukos \"was a visible and logical candidate for tax assessments, penalties, and enforcement actions\" as its abuses of the low-tax region policy were particularly egregious and the amounts of taxes it evaded unprecedented.2090 Other Russian oil companies, argues Respondent, cannot be compared. Some companies, such as Rosneft, Tatneft and Surgutneftegaz did not resort to tax minimization schemes involving the use of low-tax regions.2091 While some other companies, such as Lukoil, did use such schemes, they abandoned them much earlier than Yukos.2092 Other companies, which continued to rely on the low-tax regions program, for example Sibneft, satisfied the \"proportionality of investments\" requirement of the Russian anti-avoidance rules.2093 Finally, tax arrears, default interest and fines were in fact assessed against some companies, including TNK-BP, Sibneft and Lukoil.2094\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1255, 1268.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1260.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 1261, 1269.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1262.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1264.\n\n1572.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimants have failed to establish due process violations cognizable under Article 13(1)(c) of the ECT. For this assertion, Respondent relies on its own articulation of the requisite legal standard, namely that \"administrative authorities cannot be faulted for conduct upheld by their own courts unless the court system is disavowed at the international level,\" which Respondent argues is not the case here.2095\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1280.\n\n1573.\n\nRespondent contends that in the present case most of the due process violations raised by Claimants have been reviewed by Russian courts and dismissed on the merits, while the due process arguments raised by Claimants for the first time in this arbitration are \"specious.\"2096\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 1290.\n\n1574.\n\nRespondent specifically submits that the pace of the court proceedings that led to decisions upholding the Tax Ministry\u2019s tax demands against Yukos was in conformity with Russian procedural law and practice. Respondent notes that, pursuant to Article 215(1) of the Arbitrazh Procedure Code, first instance judgments in tax disputes must be rendered no later than two months after institution of the court proceedings.2097 Respondent denies that Yukos was not provided with sufficient time to review documents during the collection proceedings pertaining to the 2000 Decision conducted by Judge Grechishkin.2098 Respondent also argues that the removal of Judge Cheburashkina and the recusal of Judge Mikhailova were proper, as there was cause to doubt the impartiality of these two judges.2099 Finally, Respondent argues that Yukos\u2019 challenges to Judges Korotenko and Dzuba (who were charged with reviewing Yukos\u2019 challenges to the 2001 Decision and 2002 Decision, respectively) on the ground that they had previously been involved in other proceedings for the collection of taxes against Yukos, were soundly rejected, as Yukos was not able to point to any rule of Russian law that would prevent a judge from hearing similar or related cases.2100\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 1291-92, referring to *Arbitrazh Procedure Code*, Art. 215, Exh.

TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON BREACH OF THE ECT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1575.\n\nAs set out in Section X.C.2 above, the Parties are in sharp disagreement about the place and content of the legitimate expectations that Yukos had or could have had in devising and implementing its tax avoidance arrangements. Claimants maintain, as Mr. Dubov testified, that the most senior officials of the Russian Federation were informed of and approved Yukos\u2019 plans in respect of low-tax jurisdictions. Claimants point to the legislation of those jurisdictions which, while requiring a specified level of local investment by a trading company, for the most part did not refer to or require the presence of trading company personnel in the low-tax jurisdiction or specify that the activities of the trading company take place in that jurisdiction. Respondent stresses that virtually all the significant work of the trading companies was done not in the low-tax jurisdictions by a small number of low-level and uninformed functionaries but in and by Yukos\u2019 Moscow offices, facts that led two panels of the ECtHR to conclude that the trading companies were a \"sham\". Respondent emphasizes that Yukos never secured and apparently was unable to secure a legal opinion upholding the lawfulness of its tax planning arrangements and operations.\n\n1576.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that federal legislation and the legislation of the low-tax jurisdictions did not provide, or at any rate, uniformly provide, that the trading companies actually conduct their trading operations in the territory of the low-tax jurisdictions. Such a provision in any event would have been increasingly deprived of its force in view of the advent of electronic communications. Nevertheless there are indications in the record that Yukos itself had doubts, or at least apprehensions, about the legality of aspects of its *modus operandi.* Internal Yukos communications noted above at paragraph 491 so suggest, as may the unwillingness of Mr. Khodorkovsky to sign papers required for SEC registration. Yukos was able to advance no convincing explanation for the \"Lesnoy shuffle\", which may well have been carried out to frustrate investigation of perceived tax improprieties. While both PwC (Yukos' tax consultants) and Mr. Pepeliaev (Yukos' tax lawyer) opined in early January 2004, after the initial tax assessment was issued, that the tax assessment against Yukos itself was not well-founded,2101 the absence of a prior legal opinion supporting the propriety of Yukos' arrangements in the low-tax jurisdictions is striking and may be suggestive. So also is the inability of Yukos to explain immense payments to former Yukos employees and its inability to sustain the claim that certain of its primary trading companies (the BBS companies) were not controlled by it. There is also the issue of the questionable use by Claimants of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, which the Tribunal addresses in Chapter X.E on contributory fault.\n\n*See* Letter from Michael Kubena to Bruce Misamore, 15 January 2004, Exh. C-609; Sergey Pepeliaev, Summary of the Tax Inspection of OAO NK Yukos, 5 January 2004, Exh. C-1128; Sergey Pepeliaev et al., Opinion Regarding Compliance with Legislation of Inspection Report No. 08-1/1 of 29 December 2003 issued by the Tax Ministry of Russia, 15 January 2004, Exh. C-1129 (all referring to the 2000 Audit Report, Exh. C-103). *See also* paragraphs 705, 706 and 1195 above.\n\n1577.\n\nThe Tribunal has not overlooked or discounted the foregoing and other weaknesses in the contentions of Claimants. But are they sufficient to support what the Tribunal understands to be a central contention of Respondent, namely, that Claimants should have expected that the Russian Federation would react as it did to what it claims were violations of Russian tax law and practice as its courts had interpreted that law and practice to be?\n\n1578.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the expectations of Claimants may have been, and certainly should have been, that Yukos' tax avoidance operations risked adverse reaction from Russian authorities. It is common ground between the Parties that Yukos and its competitors viewed positions taken by the tax authorities on issues of tax liability to be exigent, erratic and unpredictable. The Tribunal however is unable to accept that the expectations of Yukos should have included the extremity of the actions which in the event were imposed upon it. Not only did Mikhail Khodorkovsky not appear to expect to be arrested even after the arrest of Platon Lebedev, he and his colleagues surely could not have been expected to anticipate the rationale and immensity of the tax assessments and fines. They could not have been expected to anticipate that their legal counsel would labor under the disabilities imposed upon them. They could not have been expected to anticipate the sale of YNG for so low a price under such questionable circumstances. They could not have been expected to anticipate that more than thirteen billion dollars in unpaid taxes and fines would be imposed on Yukos for unpaid VAT on oil exports when that oil had in fact been exported. They could not have been expected to anticipate that they risked the evisceration of their investments and the destruction of Yukos.\n\n1579.\n\nThe Tribunal has earlier concluded that \"the primary objective of the Russian Federation was not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its valuable assets.\"2102 For the reasons that emerge in Part VIII, if the true objective were no more than tax collection, Yukos, its officers and employees, and its properties and facilities, would not have been treated, and mistreated, as in fact they were. Among the many incidents in this train of mistreatment that are within the remit of this Tribunal, two stand out: finding Yukos liable for the payment of more than 13 billion dollars in VAT in respect of oil that had been exported by the trading companies and should have been free of VAT and free of fines in respect of VAT; and the auction of YNG at a price that was far less than its value. But for these actions, for which the Russian Federation for reasons set out above and in preceding chapters was responsible, Yukos would have been able to pay the tax claims of the Russian Federation justified or not; it would not have been bankrupted and liquidated (unless the Russian Federation were intent on its liquidation and found still additional grounds for achieving that end, as the second criminal trial of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev indeed suggests).\n\n*See* paragraph 756 above.\n\n1580.\n\nRespondent has not explicitly expropriated Yukos or the holdings of its shareholders, but the measures that Respondent has taken in respect of Yukos, set forth in detail in Part VIII, in the view of the Tribunal have had an effect \"equivalent to nationalization or expropriation\". The four conditions specified in Article 13 (1) of the ECT do not qualify that conclusion.\n\n1581.\n\nAs to condition (a), whether the destruction of Russia's leading oil company and largest taxpayer was in the public interest is profoundly questionable. It was in the interest of the largest State-owned oil company, Rosneft, which took over the principal assets of Yukos virtually cost-free, but that is not the same as saying that it was in the public interest of the economy, polity and population of the Russian Federation.\n\n1582.\n\nAs to condition (b), the treatment of Yukos and the appropriation of its assets by Rosneft (and to a much lesser extent, another State-owned corporation, Gazprom), when compared to the treatment of other Russian oil companies that also took advantage of investments in low-tax jurisdictions, may well have been discriminatory, a question that was inconclusively argued between the Parties and need not be and has not been decided by this Tribunal.\n\n1583.\n\nAs to condition (c), Yukos was subjected to processes of law, but the Tribunal does not accept that the effective expropriation of Yukos was \"carried out under due process of law\" for multiple reasons set out above, notably in Section VIII.C.3. The harsh treatment accorded to Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev remotely jailed and caged in court, the mistreatment of counsel of Yukos and the difficulties counsel encountered in reading the record and conferring with Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, the very pace of the legal proceedings, do not comport with the due process of law. Rather the Russian court proceedings, and most egregiously, the second trial and second sentencing of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev on the creative legal theory of their theft of Yukos' oil production, indicate that Russian courts bent to the will of Russian executive authorities to bankrupt Yukos, assign its assets to a State-controlled company, and incarcerate a man who gave signs of becoming a political competitor.\n\n1584.\n\nAs to condition (d), what in any event is incontestable is Respondent's failure to meet its prescription, because the effective expropriation of Yukos was not \"accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation\", or, in point of fact, any compensation whatsoever. In order for the Russian Federation to be found in breach of its treaty obligations under Article 13 of the ECT, the foregoing violations of the conditions of Article 13 more than suffice.\n\n1585.\n\nIt follows that Respondent stands in breach of its treaty obligations under Article 13 of the ECT. Accordingly Respondent's liability under international law for breach of treaty is established. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion based on its consideration of the totality of the extensive evidence before it. Having found Respondent liable under international law for breach of Article 13 of the ECT, the Tribunal does not need to consider whether Respondent's actions are also in breach of Article 10 of the Treaty.\n\n1586.\n\nThe establishment of liability under international law is at the heart of its doctrine and jurisprudence. The Statute of the PCIJ, in Article 36(2), referred to \"(c) the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; (d) the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation\". The identical provision is found in Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ.\n\n1587.\n\nThe PCIJ held in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case that:\n\nIt is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is no necessity for this to be stated in the convention itself.2103\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), Jurisdiction, Judgment, 26 July 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p. 21, Exh. C-1501.\n\n1588.\n\nIn a subsequent phase of the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, the Court specified the content of the obligation of reparation in the following oft-quoted terms:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act\u2014a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals\u2014is that reparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for the loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it\u2014such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.2104\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland), Merits, Judgment, 13 September 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47, Exh. C-925.\n\n1589.\n\nThe ILC Articles on State Responsibility provide, in Article 31, an article entitled \"Reparation\", that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" In support of this conclusion the Articles quote the foregoing holdings in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case.2105\n\nArticles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries (Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001), Articles 1-11 and 28-39, p. 91, Exh. C-1042.\n\n1590.\n\nArticle 36 of the Articles, entitled \"Compensation\", provides that:\n\n1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby....\n\nThe commentary to the Articles states that:\n\nthe function of compensation is to address the actual losses incurred as a result of the internationally wrongful act. Compensation corresponds to the financially assessable damage suffered... it is not concerned to punish... nor does compensation have an expressive or exemplary character.\"2106\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 99.\n\n1591.\n\nArticle 13 of the ECT specifies, in the event of expropriation, that \"compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation... the Valuation Date.\"\n\n1592.\n\nArticle 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, entitled \"Contribution to the injury,\" provides that \"[i]n the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured... entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\" The ILC's commentary to the Articles refers to notions of \"contributory negligence\" and \"comparative fault\".2107\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 109-10.\n\n1593.\n\nThe Tribunal will assess damages in the light of the foregoing accepted principles of international law.\n\n**E. CONTRIBUTORY FAULT**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1594.\n\nThe Tribunal now has to determine whether the damages caused to Claimants by the wrongful acts of Respondent should be reduced because, as Respondent argues, \"Claimants may not recover from the Russian Federation the fruits of their own wrongdoing.\"2108\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, Vol. 10, Slide 4.\n\n1595.\n\nIn support of its submission, Respondent invokes mainly the legal principle of contributory fault. In its Closing Statement, Respondent argued that Claimants failed to establish that their loss was caused by the Russian Federation's actions in violation of its obligations under the ECT, notably by failing to account for the effects of Claimants' own actions and of Yukos' actions.2109 It argued2110 that Claimants ignored Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which provides:2111\n\nArticle 39. Contribution to the injury\n\nIn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Vol. 12, Slide 4.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, Vol. 12, Slide 5.\n\nArticles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries (Text adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session, in 2001), Articles 1-11 and 28-39, p. 109 Exh. C-1042.\n\n1596.\n\nExtracts of the ILC's Commentary to Article 39 are pertinent, including the following:2112\n\nArticle 39 deals with the situation where damage has been caused by an internationally wrongful act of a State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance with Articles 1 and 28, but where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach, has materially contributed to the damage by some willful or negligent act or omission.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n1597.\n\nThe Tribunal also refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which states:\n\nArticle 31. Reparation\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\n1598.\n\nThe following extract from the ILC's Commentary to Article 31 is also noted:2113\n\nIt is true that cases can occur where an identifiable element of injury can properly be allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone. But unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 93.\n\n1599.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore decide, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before it, whether there is a sufficient causal link between any willful or negligent act or omission of the Claimants (or of Yukos, which they controlled) and the loss Claimants ultimately suffered at the hands of the Russian Federation through the destruction of Yukos.\n\n1600.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is not any contribution by the injured party to the damage which it has suffered which will trigger a finding of contributory fault. The contribution must be material and significant. In this regard, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion in apportioning fault.\n\n**2. Contributory Fault as Applied in Other Cases**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1601.\n\nBefore it proceeds with its analysis of the potential contributory fault of Claimants (and Yukos) in the present case which may have contributed to the injury caused to them by the internationally wrongful act of the Russian Federation, the Tribunal has reviewed decisions of investor-state tribunals which have addressed the principle of contributory fault.\n\n1602.\n\nThis review leads the Tribunal to three conclusions which will inform its analysis.\n\n1603.\n\nFirstly, the legal concept of contributory fault must not be confused with the investor's duty to mitigate its losses. There are cases where the claimant's damages were reduced because the tribunal found that it failed to take some reasonable steps to minimize its losses. In such cases, \"the injured party must be held responsible for its own contribution to the loss.\"2114\n\n*EDF International S.A. and Ors v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID, ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012 \u00b6 1301. *See also* *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID, ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, Exh. C-962 and *AIG Capital Partners, Inc and Anor v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID, ARB/01/6, Award, 7 October 2003, Exh. R-1110.\n\n1604.\n\nSecondly, there are cases where the contributory fault of the investor, while it may have increased the loss which it sustained, was unrelated to the wrongdoing of the State.2115 The fault of the investor in those cases contributed to the losses which flowed from the wrongful act of the State.\n\n*MTD. v. Chile*, Exh. C-969 and *Iurii Bogdanov, Agurdino-Invest Ltd. and Agurdino-Chimia JSC v. Republic of Moldova*, SCC Rules, Award, 22 September 2005, Exh. R-1179.\n\n1605.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal identified certain decisions where the tribunals found that the victim contributed to the State's wrongful conduct.2116 The contributory fault of the investor in those cases provoked the wrongful conduct of the State.\n\n*Antoine Goetz & Consorts et S.A. Affinage des Metaux v. Republique du Burundi*, ICSID, ARB/01/2, Award, 21 June 2012 and *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID, ARB/06/111, Award, 5 October 2012 (a case also chaired by Mr. Fortier).\n\n1606.\n\nWhile there is no doctrine of precedent *stricto sensu* in international arbitration, the Tribunal has found these decisions of assistance in its analysis.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1607.\n\nIn Chapter IX.A above, the Tribunal reviewed some 28 instances of alleged \"illegal and bad faith conduct\" by Claimants or \"attributable to the Claimants\", which Respondent argues have contributed to Yukos' demise or should, in any event, prevent Claimants from recovering damages from the Russian Federation. For the reasons set out in that chapter, the Tribunal has already concluded that most of these \"actions or omissions\" cannot be considered as having materially contributed to Yukos' demise.\n\n1608.\n\nThere are, however, four remaining instances of alleged willful or negligent conduct by Claimants and/or Yukos which, the Tribunal agrees, must be considered as potentially constituting fault that may have contributed to the destruction of Yukos, for which the Tribunal has found Respondent responsible. These four instances are:\n\ni) Yukos' conduct in some of the low-tax regions;\n\nii) Yukos' use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA;\n\niii) Yukos' conduct in connection with the YNG auction, notably the procuring of a Temporary Restraining Order by a Texas court and the published threat of a \"lifetime of litigation\"; and\n\niv) Yukos' conduct in connection with its bankruptcy, notably the non-payment of the A Loan.\n\n1609.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review these four instances and seek to determine whether any one of them qualifies as contributory fault as that legal principle has been interpreted in the decisions which it has reviewed earlier.\n\n**(a) Conduct of Yukos in Some of the Low-Tax Regions**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1610.\n\nAt the outset of its review, the Tribunal needs to recall that the central, indeed the only, focus of its remit with respect to the tax optimization schemes in the ZATOs and other low tax regions of Russia was the series of arrangements implemented by one Russian oil company, Yukos. These arrangements have been documented by hundreds of exhibits which the Tribunal has considered and analyzed in Chapters VIII.A and VIII.B of the present Award.\n\n1611.\n\nWhile there is ample evidence in the record that nearly all Russian oil companies also availed themselves of such tax optimization arrangements which were permitted by law,2117 there is no evidence that the operations of those other oil companies, in any respect, breached the legislation and abused the low tax regimes as the Tribunal has found Yukos did through the sham-like nature of some elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions notably in the ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny.\n\nTranscript of Testimony of Mikhail Kasyanov before the Khamovnichesky Court of Moscow of May 24, 2010, p. 3, Exh. C-440; Statement of Prime Minister Mikhail Mikhailovich Kasyanov of 8 July 2009 in *Khodorkovsky v. Russia 1*, \u00b6 40, Exh. C-446; TNK-BP's use of low tax regions was disclosed in *TNK International Limited Interim Consolidated Financial Statements*, as of 30 June 2003, p. 8, Exh. C-391; and *TNK-BP Limited Consolidated Financial Statements*, as of 31 December 2003, Exh. C-392; Lukoil's use of low tax regions was noted in *Board of the Audit Chamber of the* *Russian Federation, Audit Chamber Report on Yukos, Lukoil and Sibneft for 2003 and January-March 2004,* Exh. R-266, *OAO Lukoil, Securities filing, Offering Circular*, 26 November 2002, Exh. R-322, and *OAO Lukoil, Annual Report for 2001*, Exh. R-321.\n\n1612.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls its further findings, in Chapters VIII.A and VIII.B above, that this abuse by Yukos in some of the low-tax regions occurred prior to the confrontation between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky in February 2003. At the February 2003 meeting, President Putin said to Mr. Khodorkovsky that, henceforth, he would no longer receive any protection from the Kremlin. Specifically, President Putin said to Mr. Khodorkovsky: \"We have already discussed it with you recently, that your company, for example, has had problems with the payment of taxes.\"2118\n\nVideo recording and transcript of the meeting of the members of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs with President V. Putin held in the Ekaterininsky Hall, Kremlin, on 19 February 2003, Exh. C-1396.\n\n1613.\n\nThis specific reference by President Putin to Yukos' tax issues at the February 2003 meeting is significant.\n\n1614.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has concluded, on the basis of the totality of the evidence, that Respondent's tax assessments and tax collection efforts against Yukos were not aimed primarily at the collection of taxes, but rather at bankrupting Yukos and facilitating the transfer of its assets to the State, it cannot ignore that Yukos' tax avoidance arrangements in some of the low-tax regions made it possible for Respondent to invoke and rely on that conduct as a justification of its actions against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos.\n\n1615.\n\nAccordingly, even though the Tribunal has found that President Putin and his administration used Yukos' tax problems as a pretextual justification for setting in motion a plan to bankrupt Yukos, as opposed to just collecting the taxes that might have been legitimately assessed against the trading companies on the basis of the \"bad faith taxpayer\" doctrine, the Tribunal concludes that there is a sufficient causal link between Yukos' abuse of the system in some of the low-tax regions and its demise which triggers a finding of contributory fault on the part of Yukos.\n\n**(b) Conduct of Yukos under the Cyprus-Russia DTA**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1616.\n\nAs detailed in the Expert Reports of Thomas Z. Lys, Yukos' \"tax optimization\" plan included use of the trading companies in the low-tax regions to receive proceeds from the sale of Yukos' oil and oil products, and the transfer of those proceeds to other Yukos-controlled trading and holding companies in the Russian Federation and in off-shore jurisdictions such as Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.2119\n\nSecond Lys Report,, pp. 39 ff.\n\n1617.\n\nRespondent, relying on the expert reports of Professor H. David Rosenbloom,2120 Professor Dr. Stef van Weeghel and Mr. Polyvios G. Polyviou, has argued that Yukos' use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA was abusive. Claimants, relying on the Expert Report of Mr. Philip Baker QC, counter Respondent's argument and assert that the use by Yukos of the DTA was not abusive. It is noteworthy that the Parties did not call as witnesses one another's respective experts on that issue.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 150-61.\n\n1618.\n\nClaimants note that, to this day, the Russian authorities \"have done absolutely nothing\" in respect of the alleged improper invocation of DTA benefits by Claimants, including under the specific mechanisms of review that exist under the treaty itself and/or under the domestic laws of the contracting parties.2121 They also submit that the first time Respondent raised any issue regarding the tax arrangements subject to the Cyprus-Russia DTA was on 6 October 2006 in the present arbitration and that Respondent \"concocted [this issue] specifically for the purposes of these arbitrations.\"2122\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 192-202.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 198-200, referring to Respondent's Comments on Issues Raised by Procedural Order No. 2 of 8 September 2006.\n\n1619.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Claimants' argument that it is incongruous for the Russian Federation to complain in these proceedings about Yukos' use of the treaty while never having invoked the mechanisms available to it to trigger the review of such use by, for example, invoking the information-sharing provisions of the treaty.2123\n\nTranscript, Day 20 at 146.\n\n1620.\n\nAt the same time, it seems clear to the Tribunal, on the facts, that Yukos' operations under the DTA were wholly conducted by Mr. Lebedev from Yukos' established offices in Moscow, that his \"place of management\" where he habitually concluded contracts relating to operations under the Treaty was in Moscow, which of itself demonstrates that Yukos' avoidance of hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes through the Cyprus-Russia DTA, was questionable. Hulley appears to the Tribunal to have falsely declared on Cypriot withholding tax forms that \"income\"\u2014dividends from Yukos\u2014\"was not connected with activities carried on in the Russian Federation\" despite Mr. Lebedev's activities in Moscow.2124\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 164, referring to Hulley Enterprises Limited, Claims for an Exemption of Passive Incomes Sourced in Russia before the Payment is Made (Form 1013DT) for 2000, 2001, Exh. R-193; Veteran Petroleum Limited, Claims for an Exemption of Passive Incomes Sourced in Russia before the Payment is Made (Form 1013DT) for 2001, 2002, Exh. R-194; Hulley Enterprises Limited, Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, 7 April 2004, Exh. R-190; Veteran Petroleum Limited, Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended Dec. 31, 2003, 15 December 2006 Exh. R-192.\n\n1621.\n\nIn any event, even if there was an abuse by Yukos of that treaty, as in the Tribunal's *prima facie* view there was, such conduct would be subsumed into and enlarge the abuse by some of Yukos' trading companies in some of the low tax regions, which the Tribunal has already found amounted to contributory fault on the part of Yukos.\n\n**(c) Conduct of Yukos in Connection with YNG Auction**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1622.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that the abusive use of some of the low-tax regions by Yukos including its questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA occurred prior to the February 2003 encounter between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky and thus prior to the plan formed by the Russian Federation not simply to collect taxes from Yukos but to bankrupt the company and transfer its assets to the State.\n\n1623.\n\nThe YNG auction took place in December 2004 well after Respondent had put in motion its plan to expropriate Yukos. It was preceded by Yukos' resort to bankruptcy proceedings in Texas, the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order by the Texas court, and Yukos' public threats, most strikingly a full page advertisement in the *Financial Times,* warning prospective purchasers of YNG against participating in the auction.\n\n1624.\n\nRespondent submits that these actions discouraged prospective purchasers of YNG from taking part in the auction and depreciated the price realized at the auction.\n\n1625.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that, but for these actions of Yukos, it is reasonable to surmise that the auction of YNG on 19 December 2004, the unlawful measure of Respondent that dealt as \"fatal blow\" to the survival prospects of Yukos, could have resulted in a higher bid price than the auction actually did. However, in the view of the Tribunal, Yukos' ultimate fate would have been no different if it had not threatened a lifetime of litigation or obtained a Temporary Restraining Order from a Texas Court. Its demise may have been postponed, or the path to its demise altered in some minor way, but it would not have been avoided.\n\n1626.\n\nThe Tribunal observes with interest that the *RosinvestCo* tribunal found that \"Yukos did in some respects contribute to its own demise\" and that it referred in that context to the Houston bankruptcy proceedings.2125\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6 634, Exh. C-1049.\n\n1627.\n\nIn addition, before concluding its analysis of this facet of Claimants' conduct, the Tribunal needs to contrast these actions of Yukos with a series of actions of Respondent before the YNG auction which must have depreciated the auction price very significantly and thus served the Russian Federation objective of acquiring the Yukos assets at a bargain price.\n\n1628.\n\nThose actions of Respondent include:\n\n\u2022 The threat by Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources to withdraw YNG's operating licenses;2126\n\n\u2022 The massive tax liabilities imposed on YNG in October and December 2004;2127\n\n\u2022 The statement by the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice that the USD 10.4 billion valuation of YNG was \"due to the high risk to a potential buyer\";2128\n\n\u2022 The decision by Respondent to fix the date of the auction exactly one month after the auction was announced, being the minimum length of the notice required under Russian law;2129\n\n\u2022 The alleged pressure of Respondent on would be bidders from India and China not to participate in the auction.2130\n\n*Russian Government May Revoke YUKOS Unit's Licenses*, FWN Select, 10 September 2004, Exh. C-701.\n\n*Repeat Field Tax Audit Report No. 30-03-14/2*, 29 October 2004 *,* Exh. C-251; *see* Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, 25 April 2006, p. 2, Exh. C-255; Memorial \u00b6 271.\n\n*In the Yukos Saga, Yet Another Gloomy Chapter*,Wall Street Journal, 14 October 2004, Exh. C-713.\n\nIn its report of 6 October 2004, Dresdner wrote that \"[ a] quick auction will most likely prevent the achievement of a full price since purchasers will only be able to conduct a limited audit of the financial and economic performance and accordingly will discount their valuation of the target asset.\" [emphasis added]. Dresdner Valuation Rpeort, Section 11.2, Exh. C-274.\n\n*Russia's Latest Auction Farce Eerily Familiar*, The Moscow Times, 21 December 2004, p. 1, Exh. C-739.\n\n1629.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the actions of Yukos which may have depreciated the auction price, do not constitute contributory fault as they did not contribute in a material way to its demise.\n\n**(d) Conduct of Yukos in Connection with its Bankruptcy (Non-Payment of the A Loan)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1630.\n\nWith respect to the non payment by Yukos of the A Loan and Respondent's submission that such non-payment rendered Yukos responsible for its own bankruptcy, the Tribunal accepts Respondent's contention that Yukos was in a position to pay off the balance of the A Loan and that its willful failure to do so contributed to the circumstances of its bankruptcy by leading SocGen to petition for it. At the same time, the loan provisions contemplated that YNG oil production and sale would fuel payment of the loan, and it was understandable that, once YNG was taken over by Rosneft, Claimants should have felt that responsibility for repayment of the A Loan was not theirs or theirs alone.\n\n1631.\n\nMoreover, in the view of the Tribunal, even if Yukos had paid off the A Loan, it represented only a fraction of the claims against Yukos which could have been used to petition the company into bankruptcy. In view of the larger circumstances, it is difficult to conclude that, even if the A Loan had been paid, another ground for pushing Yukos into bankruptcy would not have been found.\n\n1632.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that, while Yukos may have been at fault in refusing to pay off the A Loan, its behavior does not rise to the level of contributory fault.\n\n**4. Tribunal's Decision on Contributory Fault**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1633.\n\nParaphrasing the words of Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and its commentary, the Tribunal must now determine whether Claimants' and Yukos' tax avoidance arrangements in some of the low-tax regions, including their questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA summarized above, contributed to their injury in a material and significant way, or were these minor contributory factors which, based on subsequent events such as the decision of the Russian authorities to destroy Yukos, cannot be considered, legally, as a link in the causative chain. As the Tribunal noted earlier in this chapter, an award of damages may be reduced if the victim of the wrongful act of the respondent State also committed a fault which contributed to the prejudice it suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its discretion, considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility.2131\n\n*See* ruling in *MTD v. Chile* \u00b6\u00b6 242-43 that \"the Claimants should bear part of the damages suffered.\" In that case, that \"part\" was quantified as 50 percent of the damages. *See also* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID, ARB/06/111, Award, 5 October 2012 \u00b6\u00b6 659-687. In that case, that \"part\" was quantified as 25 percent of the damages.\n\n1634.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Claimants should pay a price for Yukos' abuse of the low-tax regions by some of its trading entities, including its questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, which contributed in a material way to the prejudice which they subsequently suffered at the hands of the Russian Federation.\n\n1635.\n\nIn considering the extent of the contribution of Claimants' faults to their injury, the Tribunal notes that the subsequent conduct of the Russian Federation, as the Tribunal has found, was disproportionate and tantamount to expropriation of Claimants' investment in Yukos. Claimants' damages were caused by the series of events starting with the arrest of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and the tax assessments, and culminating in the YNG auction, which led to the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos. The Tribunal must now determine to what extent and in what proportion Claimants' and Yukos' conduct prior to 2003, including their questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, contributed so as to lessen the responsibility of Respondent.\n\n1636.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the ICSID Annulment Committee in the *MTD v. Chile* case that \"the role of the two parties contributing to the loss [is] [... ] only with difficulty commensurable and the Tribunal [has] a corresponding margin of estimation.\"2132 However, the Tribunal, as other tribunals have done, must reach a decision and it has done so on the basis of all the evidence which it has reviewed.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. v. The Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007 \u00b6 101. *See also* *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID, ARB/06/111, Award, 5 October 2012 \u00b6\u00b6 659-87.\n\n1637.\n\nHaving considered and weighed all the arguments which the Parties have presented to it in respect of this issue the Tribunal, in the exercise of its wide discretion, finds that, as a result of the material and significant mis-conduct by Claimants and by Yukos (which they controlled), Claimants have contributed to the extent of 25 percent to the prejudice which they suffered as a result of Respondent's destruction of Yukos. The resulting apportionment of responsibility as between Claimants and Respondent, namely 25 percent and 75 percent, is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n**XI. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n1638.\n\nAs will be seen in Part XII of the Award dealing with quantification of Claimants' damages for Respondent's breach of the ECT, one of the elements factored into the Tribunal's calculation of damages will be interest.2133 Accordingly, the Tribunal, in the present Part XI will determine the applicable rate of such interest, whether it should be simple or compound and, if compound, the period of compounding.\n\nIn particular see paragraphs 1822-23 below on pre-award interest on the dividend streams that Claimants would have obtained in the absence of Respondent's breach.\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n1639.\n\nClaimants request the Tribunal to award them pre- and post-award interest.2134 In their Submission on Costs, Claimants also request interest on any costs awarded to them.2135\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 969-70; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 859, 1199; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 302.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 64.\n\n1640.\n\nAccording to Claimants, \"payment of interest can be required to ensure full reparation.\"2136 Claimants quote the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina*, which stated that the purpose of the payment of interest is \"to compensate the damage resulting from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum he was supposed to receive.\"2137 Claimants submit that the Tribunal has \"full discretion to determine the most appropriate rate of interest to achieve full reparation\"2138 and quote the award in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (\" ***Santa Elena*** \"):\n\n[T]he determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially considerations of fairness which must form part of the law to be applied by this Tribunal.2139\n\nMemorial \u00b6 959, citing to ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 38, Exh.

C-952.\n\n1641.\n\nClaimants further contend that the Tribunal may award compound interest2140 and that compound interest has become \"the norm in investment arbitration as regards full reparation.\"2141 Putting emphasis on the awards in *Santa Elena* and *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (\" ***Wena*** \"), Claimants explain that compound interest should be awarded in order for the amount of compensation to reflect the additional sum that the claimant would have earned if the money had been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.2142\n\nMemorial \u00b6 963, citing to *Metalclad v.

C-952.\n\n1642.\n\nClaimants' valuation expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, analyzed three possible rates of interest: the LIBOR plus two or four percent; the yield on Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD; and the U.S. Prime rate of interest plus two percent.2143\n\nMemorial \u00b6 966; First Kaczmarek Report \u00b6\u00b6 375-81; Reply \u00b6 859 n.1491; Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n1643.\n\nAccording to Claimants:\n\nNavigant observed that the Russian Federation's breaches \"have effectively turned Claimants into unwilling lenders to Russia.\" The yield on Russian sovereign bonds issued in U.S. dollars corresponds to the rate that the Russian Federation offers to its willing lenders. Therefore, in order to be fully compensated for the Russian Federation's breaches, the Claimants should be awarded interest at a commercial rate higher than this latter rate. LIBOR +4% would represent such an appropriate commercial rate, which is the rate used by Navigant in its expert report.2144\n\n[emphasis in the original]\n\nMemorial \u00b6 967.\n\n1644.\n\nClaimants have requested that interest of LIBOR plus 4 percent, compounded annually, be applied pre- and post- award, including on costs.2145\n\nMemorial \u00b6 970; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 859, 1199; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 309; Claimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 64.\n\n1645.\n\nAt the Hearing, Claimants presented the following table to summarize their submission on interest rates:2146\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Interest Rate** | **Description** | **Justification** |\n| Russian Cost of Debt | Cost of raising money for the Russian Government | The actions have effectively turned the Claimants into unwilling lenders to Russia. |\n| U.S. Prime Rate | Rate that US banks charge their most creditworthy customers | The U.S prime rate is not widely available in the market.

C-1787.\n\n1646.\n\nClaimants noted that the Russian cost of debt is \"a natural candidate\" for interest rate.2147 In response to a question by the Chairman whether Claimants \"still rely on LIBOR\", counsel for Claimants noted that he had \"avoided making any comment on the reliability of LIBOR.\"2148\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*. at 260 (Claimants' closing).\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n1647.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' request for pre- and post-award interest is \"manifestly unfounded and disproportionate, and should be rejected.\"2149 Respondent refers to the Commentary on Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for the proposition that there is \"no automatic entitlement to the payment of interest.\"2150\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1743.\n\n*Ibid*., quoting Commentary on ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Article 38 \u00b6 7, Exh. R-4235.\n\n1648.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that compound interest is not awarded automatically by tribunals.2151 Respondent observes that the *RosInvestCo* tribunal used LIBOR alone, calculated annually, without any compounding.2152\n\n*Ibid*. Respondent explains that, as noted by the tribunal in *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008 \u00b6 473, Exh. C-993, \"the award of compound interest is not a principle of international law.\" As explained by BORZU SABAHI, COMPENSATION AND RESTITUTION IN INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION (2011), p. 152, Exh. R-4234, \"compound interest, in international investment law, may be awarded if the aggrieved party can prove that it \u2018could have received compound interest... by placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle...'.\" In *RosInvestCo* \u00b6\u00b6 688-90, Exh. C-1049, the tribunal notes that the practice of awarding compound interest is \"by no means unanimous\" and that awarding interest at \"a normal commercial rate\" does not imply that the tribunal \"is bound to award compound interest.\" Rejoinder \u00b6 1743 n.2952.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1746; *RosInvestCo* \u00b6\u00b6 684-90, Exh. C-1049.\n\n1649.\n\nRespondent criticizes Claimants and their expert for failing to provide a justification for their preferred rate of LIBOR plus four percent.2153 According to Respondent, awarding Claimants interest at LIBOR plus four percent compounded annually would \"unduly punish\" Respondent while granting Claimants a \"windfall.\"2154\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1746.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1747, quoting John Yukio Gotanda, *Awarding Interest in International Arbitration*, 90 Am. J. of Int'l Law 40 (1996) pp. 59-60, Exh. R-4236.\n\n**C. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Energy Charter Treaty**\n----------------------------\n\n1650.\n\nArticle 26(8) of the ECT provides that \"awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute\" [emphasis added]. In the case of a lawful expropriation, Article 13(1) of the ECT directs that compensation \" shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment\" [emphasis added].2155\n\nSee Subsection XII.C.1(b) below for discussion on the applicability of the Article 13 standard in lawful and unlawful expropriations.\n\n1651.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that arbitral tribunals hearing disputes under the ECT have awarded pre- and post-award interest at various rates.2156\n\n*See e.g. Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB (Sweden) v. Latvia*, SCC, Award, 16 December 2003, p. 40 (preaward and post-award interest at six percent, corresponding to the prevailing interest rate in Latvia), Exh. C-967; *Kardassopoulos* \u00b6\u00b6 658-68, 677-78 (pre-award and post-award interest at LIBOR plus four percent compounded semi-annually), Exh. C-1533.\n\n**2. ILC Articles on State Responsibility**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1652.\n\nArticle 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reads as follows:\n\n1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.\n\n2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.2157\n\nExh. C-1042.\n\n1653.\n\nThe Commentary on Article 38 provides that \"[t]he awarding of interest depends on the circumstances of each case; in particular, on whether an award of interest is necessary in order to ensure full reparation.\"2158\n\n\u00b6 7, Exh. C-1042.\n\n**3.** ***RosInvestCo*** **and** ***Quasar***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1654.\n\nThe *RosInvestCo* tribunal awarded pre- and post-award interest using LIBOR alone, calculated annually, without any compounding,2159 while the *Quasar* tribunal awarded pre- and post-award interest at a rate of 6,434 percent (corresponding to the relevant average yield of medium-term Russian sovereign bonds dealt in USD) compounded annually.2160\n\n*RosInvestCo* \u00b6\u00b6 684-92, Exh. C-1049.\n\n*Quasar* \u00b6 226, Exh. R-3383.\n\n**4. Treatises**\n----------------\n\n1655.\n\nTwo books on the issue of damages in international investment cases have recently been published. The Tribunal has found the chapters of these books dealing with interest very informative.2161\n\nSERGEY RIPINSKY & KEVIN WILLIAMS, DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (2008), pp. 363-91 (other extracts of which constitute Exh. C-1610) (hereinafter \"Ripinsky and Williams\"); IRMGARD MARBOE, CALCULATION OF COMPENSATION AND DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (2009), pp. 317-92 (other extracts of which constitute Exh. C-1607) (hereinafter \"Marboe\").\n\n1656.\n\nThe following paragraphs summarize these authors' respective analyses and conclusions on various aspects of the issue of interest in international investment cases.\n\n**(a) General Issues**\n----------------------\n\n1657.\n\nDr. Irmgard Marboe explains that, on the one hand, interest should compensate the temporary withholding of money: interest should address the claimant's financial disadvantage of not being able to dispose of money, which materializes either in loss of profit from alternative investments or in costs for a loan.2162 On the other hand, the awarding of interest should prevent the debtor's unjust enrichment since the debtor gains a financial profit through the withholding of the money.2163 Additionally, post-award interest, writes Dr. Marboe, serves the purpose of creating an effective incentive for the respondent to comply with an arbitral award without delay.2164\n\nMarboe \u00b6 6.05.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 6.06; *see also* *Santa Elena* \u00b6 101, Exh. C-952 (\"[the claimant] is entitled to the full present value of the compensation that it should have received at the time of the taking. Conversely, the taking state is not entitled unjustly to enrich itself by reason of the fact that the payment of compensation has been long delayed.\").\n\nMarboe \u00b6 6.38, citing to John Yukio Gotanda, SUPPLEMENTAL DAMAGES IN PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW, 1997, p. 58.\n\n1658.\n\nDr. Sergey Ripinsky and Mr. Kevin Williams stress the well-established mantra that tribunals enjoy a wide margin of discretion in awarding interest.2165\n\nRipinsky and Williams, pp. 365-66.\n\n**(b) Rate**\n------------\n\n1659.\n\nDr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams write that choosing the rate is \"perhaps the issue where one sees the greatest variety in approaches of arbitration tribunals.\"2166 They consider four different approaches.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 366. Dr. Marboe calls it \"one of the most difficult decisions.\" Marboe \u00b6 6.40.\n\n1660.\n\nThe first is the \"investment alternatives\" approach, adopted by the majority opinion in the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal case *Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran* (\" ***Sylvania*** \") and explained in the following terms:\n\n[T]he Tribunal will derive a rate of interest based approximately on the amount that the successful claimant would have been in a position to have earned if it had been paid in time and thus had the funds available to invest in a form of commercial investment in common use in its own country.2167\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 368, quoting *Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran,* Award, 27 June 1985, 8 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports, 298, 320 (footnote omitted) (hereinafter \" *Sylvania* \").\n\n1661.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, this approach was followed in subsequent awards of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal as well as by the *Santa Elena* tribunal.2168\n\n*Ibid*., p. 368; *see* Marboe \u00b6\u00b6 6,107-6.120.\n\n1662.\n\nThe second approach is the \"borrowing rate\" approach, which is based on borrowing rates from banks in the claimant's country.2169 Investment tribunals have often used the LIBOR, an interbank borrowing rate of interest. Some tribunals have also added a certain percentage to the LIBOR rate to arrive at the approximate rate that international investors would have had to pay if they had been obliged to borrow the money. According to Ripinsky and Williams, tribunals have \"normally\" added two percent to LIBOR.2170\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 369.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 370.\n\n1663.\n\nDr. Marboe notes that Judge Holtzmann had argued in favor of a borrowing rate approach in his separately recorded view on interest in the *Sylvania* decision, because it \"is reasonable to assume that most businesses habitually borrow while fewer regularly invest in certificates of deposit.\"2171 Dr. Marboe writes that the borrowing rate approach can lead to different results, such as the selection of the prime rate, the borrowing rate of the investor, the cost of capital of the investor, the borrowing rate of the State (the \"coerced loan theory\") or the average borrowing rate.2172\n\nMarboe \u00b6 6.82, quoting *Sylvania*, p.321 n.13.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 6.85-6,106.\n\n1664.\n\nIn respect of the prime rate, Dr. Marboe writes:\n\nThe \"prime\" or \"base\" rate plays an important role in negotiations about company loan conditions in Anglo-American countries. As such, it seems to be an appropriate basis for the assessment of the damages incurred by a delayed payment. However, it must be taken into account that not all enterprises can borrow money from the banks at the prime rate. Therefore, an increase by a few percentage points might be necessary as has been the practice in the cases mentioned above. The question then arises, of course, how many percentage points are appropriate. It appears, therefore, that the prime rate does not really offer a viable means of ensuring adequate and consistent decisions on interest.2173\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 6.93.\n\n1665.\n\nIn respect of the \"coerced loan theory\", she opines:\n\nAccording to this approach, the amount of interest has nothing to do with the claimant's actual loss, but rather depends on the respondent's risk characteristics.\n\nThis approach measures the financial effect of the delay from the perspective of the respondent. It has to be borne in mind, however, that pre-award interest in international investment cases should fulfil the function of compensation or damages. Therefore, the perspective of the claimant is decisive.\n\nThe perspective of the respondent, however, is important when it comes to the prevention of enrichment as an additional function of the interest claim. While this is only of secondary importance concerning pre-award interest, it becomes relevant with regard to post-award interest. This means that the \"coerced loan theory\" would better fit with the determination of post-award interest.2174\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 6,101-6.103 (footnote omitted).\n\n1666.\n\nThe third approach to interest is to rely on the interest rate applicable under the host State's domestic law provisions concerned. Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams observe that investment tribunals have done so,2175 while Dr. Marboe asserts that, in international investment disputes, \"national legal interest rates are not applicable and not adequate.\"2176\n\nRipinsky and Williams, pp. 370-72.\n\nMarboe \u00b6\u00b6 6.70.\n\n1667.\n\nFinally, in a number of disputes, write Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, tribunals have adopted a specific rate ranging from 5 to 10 percent, calling it \"reasonable\", \"fair\" or \"appropriate\".2177 Dr. Marboe writes that \"fair\" rates have ranged from 5 to 17.5 percent.2178\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 372.\n\nMarboe \u00b6 6,149; *see also* \u00b6\u00b6 6,150-6.161.\n\n1668.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, overall, Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams favor the \"investment alternatives\" approach, with the caveat that, in situations where the debtor's actions force the claimant to borrow funds, it would be appropriate to award interest at the claimant's actual borrowing rate,2179 whereas Dr. Marboe appears to prefer the use of inter-bank interest rates.2180\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 373.\n\n*See* Marboe \u00b6 6,147.\n\n**(c)** ***Dies a quo***\n------------------------\n\n1669.\n\nThe authors of both treatises affirm that, in cases of expropriation, \"interest has invariably been calculated from the date of the taking.\"2181\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 375; *see ibid*. \u00b6 6,163.\n\n**(d) Simple or Compound**\n--------------------------\n\n1670.\n\nWith respect to the important issue of whether interest awarded should be simple or compound, Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams opine that \"there is a trend away from only awarding simple interest to generally awarding compound interest,\"2182 while Dr. Marboe states that \"compound interest as opposed to simple interest appears to be predominantly accepted as appropriate in recent international investment arbitration\" because it is \"regarded as better reflecting actual economic realities both for the purpose of remedying the loss actually incurred by the injured party and for the prevention of unjustified enrichment of the respondent State.\"2183 Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams refer to the *Santa Elena* award, issued in 2000, as \"a turning point in jurisprudence.\"2184\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 379.\n\nMarboe \u00b6 6,236; but see Marboe's list of exceptions \u00b6\u00b6 6,237-6.261.\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 385.\n\n1671.\n\nDr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams observe that the period of compounding has ranged from one year to one month and that annual compounding has been \"predominant.\"2185\n\n*Ibid*., p. 387.\n\n**(e) Post-Award Interest**\n---------------------------\n\n1672.\n\nAfter an extensive review of arbitral decisions, Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams conclude that in the majority of cases, tribunals have not considered post-award interest separately from pre-award interest and have simply granted interest until the date of full payment of the award. This \"automatically turns pre-award interest into post-award.\"2186\n\n*Ibid*.; *see also* Marboe \u00b6\u00b6 6,243-6.261.\n\n1673.\n\nThey note that when post-award interest has been granted separately, tribunals have been more severe towards the respondent, compared to the pre-award interest granted.2187\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 389.\n\n1674.\n\nAccording to Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, \"[t]hese changes can be explained by the desire of some tribunals to ensure prompt compliance with the award by adding a punitive element to interest and thereby turning the post-award interest from a purely compensatory instrument into a sanction.\"2188\n\n*Ibid*., p. 389; *see* Marboe \u00b6 6,245.\n\n1675.\n\nDr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams also note that some tribunals have provided for a grace period following the date of the award, during which interest does not accrue.2189\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 390; *see also* Marboe \u00b6\u00b6 6,262-6.268.\n\n**D. TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n--------------------------\n\n1676.\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered the Parties' submissions, the treatises of the learned authors quoted extensively above, the many decisions of tribunals which have traversed the issue of interest and, of course, the totality of the evidence in the case at hand that it considers pertinent to its determination of this facet of the present arbitrations, will now proceed with its analysis and exercise its judgment.\n\n1677.\n\nAs we saw earlier, the ECT, the relevant legal instrument, envisages an award of interest in an arbitral award. In addition, the Treaty decrees mandatory payment of interest \"at a commercial rate established on a market basis\" in the case of a lawful arbitration. In the view of the Tribunal, there can be no doubt that, *a fortiori*, in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as in the present case, Claimants are entitled to interest from Respondent in order to ensure full reparation for the injury they suffered as a result of those of Respondent's measures that the Tribunal has found to be internationally wrongful.\n\n1678.\n\nNeither the Treaty nor the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provide specific rules regarding how interest should be determined. In addition, as the Tribunal has found, the practice of past tribunals is varied and inconsistent and does not provide clear guidance. Thus, as is well established, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of interest applicable and whether it should be simple or compound.\n\n1679.\n\nOf the three rates proposed by Claimants, the LIBOR plus two or four percent, the yield on Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD and the U.S. Prime rate plus two percent, the Tribunal has rejected outright the first two for the following brief reasons. LIBOR, as Claimants' counsel implicitly recognized during the Hearing, has been discredited, while the yield on Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD would lead, in the Tribunal's opinion, to excessive compensation for Claimants.\n\n1680.\n\nAs for the U.S. Prime rate plus two percent, the Tribunal initially saw merit in this rate which is a version of the borrowing rate approach reviewed earlier. The Tribunal notes that this method was put forward by Judge Holtzmann in his separately recorded view on interest in the *Sylvania* Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal case.2190\n\n*Sylvania*, p. 321 n.13.\n\n1681.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded however that this method should also be rejected. It is not an appropriate basis for the assessment of the damages in this case. There is no evidence that Claimants had to borrow money because they were not compensated at the time of the expropriation.\n\n1682.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal finds apposite the following statement of the *Siemens v. Argentina* tribunal:\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the rate of interest to be taken into account is not the rate associated with corporate borrowing but the interest rate the amount of compensation would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation.2191\n\n*Siemens* \u00b6 396, Exh. C-983.\n\n1683.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that a rate of interest based on return of investment during the relevant period was adopted by the *Santa Elena* tribunal:\n\n[W]here an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.2192\n\n*Santa Elena* \u00b6 104, Exh. C-952. The Chairman of the Tribunal was also the Chairman of the ICSID tribunal in *Santa Elena*.\n\n1684.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that many investor-state tribunals have adopted this \"investment alternatives approach,\"2193 using rates of U.S. debt instruments even when the claimant was not a U.S. investor.2194\n\nRipinsky and Williams, pp. 368-69; Marboe \u00b6\u00b6 6,107-6.119; *Sylvania*, pp. 320-21; *Santa Elena* \u00b6 104, Exh. C-952; *Siemens* \u00b6 396, Exh. C-983.\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 369 & n.42; *see e.g.*, *Alpha Projektholding GmbH (Austria) v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award, 8 November 2010 \u00b6 514 & n.666; *EDF International S.A.,* *SAUR International S.A. Leon* *Participationes Argentinas S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012 \u00b6 1325ff, Exh. R-4186; *Gemplus,* Exh. C-1536.\n\n1685.\n\nThe Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, has concluded that it would be appropriate to award to Claimants interest on a rate based on ten-year U.S. Treasury bond rates.\n\n1686.\n\nAs will be seen in Part XII on damages, the Tribunal has ruled that Claimants' shares in Yukos should be valued as of the date of the Award. Accordingly, there will be no pre-award interest granted to Claimants in respect of the damages representing the value of their shares.2195\n\nPre-award interest on the value of the Claimants' shares has, however, been applied in the context of calculating the amount of damages that would have to be awarded on the basis of a valuation date corresponding to the date of the expropriation of Claimants' investment. *See* paragraph 1847 below.\n\n1687.\n\nHowever, in order that they may be made whole, the Tribunal will grant pre-award interest to Claimants for the damages which represent the value of the dividend streams for which, as will be seen,2196 the Tribunal has decided Claimants should be compensated. In order to compute the pre-award interest awarded to Claimants at the rate based on ten-year U.S. Treasury bond rates, the Tribunal will use the average yield of ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds over the period from 1 January 2005 to 30 May 2014 as the applicable rate of interest, which the Tribunal has determined to be 3,389 percent.2197\n\n*See* Subsection XII.C.4.\n\n*See* Table T9 appended to this Award.\n\n1688.\n\nAs will also be seen in Part XII on damages, the Tribunal has decided to award Claimants postaward interest on the damages of USD 50,020,867.798 for which the Tribunal has found Respondent liable.\n\n1689.\n\nAs to whether the interest awarded should be simple or compound, while the Tribunal recognizes that the awarding of compound interest under international law now represents a form of \"jurisprudence constante\" in investor-state expropriation cases,2198 the Tribunal has concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be just and reasonable to award Claimants simple pre-award interest and post-award interest compounded annually if Respondent fails to pay in full to Claimants the damages for which it has been held liable before the expiry of the grace period hereinafter granted.\n\n*Oko Pankki Oyj (formerly called OKO Osuuspankkien Keskuspankki OYJ)*, *VTB Bank (Deutschland) AG (formerly called Ost-West Handelsbank AG) and Sampo Bank PLC v. The Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6), Award, 19 November 2007 \u00b6 349, Exh. C-1530.\n\n1690.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants claim interest on the costs that may be awarded to them by the Tribunal at the same rate as the interest awarded to them on the damages.2199 In the event that Respondent fails to pay in full to Claimants the costs awarded to them in Part XIII of the present Award before the expiry of the grace period, post-award interest will accrue on any outstanding amount, compounded annually.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 64.\n\n1691.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, in view of the significant amount of damages which Respondent owes Claimants as a result of this Final Award, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to grant to Respondent a grace period of 180 days following the date of the Award before interest will accrue if not paid in full to Claimants by then.\n\n1692.\n\nIn order to compute any post-award interest awarded to Claimants on their damages and their costs, the Tribunal orders that the interest rate be determined as the yield on ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds as of 15 January 2015 and then the dates of compounding yearly thereafter.\n\n**XII. THE QUANTIFICATION OF CLAIMANTS' DAMAGES**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1693.\n\nThe Tribunal will now determine the damages caused to Claimants by Respondent's breach of Article 13 of the ECT. The Parties' positions in this regard can be summarized as follows.\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n1694.\n\nClaimants assert that they are entitled to full reparation for Respondent's breach of its obligations under the ECT \"through financial compensation measured at the date of expropriation or at the date of the award, whichever is the greatest\"2200 and seek damages in \"an amount to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal,\" but estimated at \"no less than US$ 114,174 billion.\"2201 Claimants maintain that, while Article 13(1) of the ECT provides a specific rule of compensation, this rule applies only to legal expropriations (*i.e.*, expropriations satisfying the conditions contained in Article 13(1)), and that, where one or more of the conditions of Article 13(1) have not been met, the rules of customary international law apply to the issue of reparation.2202 According to Claimants, in order to achieve full reparation in the event of an unlawful expropriation, an investor must be able to choose between a valuation of the damages it has suffered as at the date of the breach and a valuation as at the date of the award.2203\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 232.\n\nReply \u00b6 1199. *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 302.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 897-99; Transcript, Day 17 at 219-18.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 917.\n\n**1. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n1695.\n\nClaimants submit that there are two potentially relevant dates with regard to the assessment of damages, namely the moment when a treaty breach occurs and the moment when an award is rendered. Claimants take the view that \"an investor should be compensated in the highest amount between the valuation of the damages it has suffered as at the date of the breach and that at the date of the award.\"2204 The reason for this alternative valuation, according to Claimants, is that \"to the extent the assets expropriated have increased in value during the arbitration process, this increase must accrue for the benefit of the Claimants, not to the Russian Federation.\"2205 Claimants refer to a number of legal authorities to support the conclusion that, in cases of unlawful expropriations, investors are entitled to choose between a valuation as at the date of the breach and a valuation as at the date of the award.2206\n\n*Ibid*. *See also* \u00b6 913; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 232-33.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 913.\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 915-17; Reply \u00b6 845. Claimants refer in particular to *ADC*, \u00b6\u00b6 496-97, Exh. C-980; *Siemens* \u00b6 352, Exh. C-983; *Kardassopoulos* \u00b6 514, Exh. C-1533; *Amoco International Finance Corporation v.

C-939 (hereinafter \" *Amco* \").\n\n1696.\n\nClaimants assert that the date of the expropriation of their investment in this case was 21 November 2007, the date on which Yukos was struck off the Russian register of legal entities. The justification for choosing this date, according to Claimants, is that \"[i]n cases involving expropriations through a series of coordinated interferences by the State, the date of expropriation corresponds to the date on which the governmental interference ripened into an irreversible deprivation of the investor's property,\"2207 and that striking Yukos from the register of legal entities constituted \"a point of no return.\"2208\n\nMemorial \u00b6 912, n.1314. *See also* Reply \u00b6 940.\n\nReply \u00b6 943.\n\n**2. Causation**\n----------------\n\n1697.\n\nWith regard to causation, Claimants assert that they do not need to establish a link between individual actions of Respondent and the damages suffered, but that it suffices for them to show that the sum of Respondent's actions caused those damages. Claimants argue that:\n\n[T]he Russian Federation sought and achieved the dismantlement and destruction of Yukos, and the Claimants' investments therein, through a series of cumulative actions.... The breach, and the Respondent's responsibility, arises from the Russian Federation's actions taken as a whole and not from each and every one of these actions. It is the cumulative effect of these acts that is criticized by the Claimants.2209\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 904.\n\n1698.\n\nClaimants also argue that:\n\n[A] causal link needs only be established between the actions of the Russian Federation taken as a whole and the Claimants' damages, namely the destruction of their investments. This causal link is obvious....2210\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 911.\n\n1699.\n\nAccording to Claimants, there is ample authority to support their position that the Tribunal need only consider \"the totality of the Russian Federation's actions and their result: the inexcusable treatment of the Claimants' investments and, ultimately, their outright expropriation.\"2211\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 191, citing to *e.g.*, *Walter Bau* \u00b6 12.43, Exh.

Calculations Performed by Claimants and Mr. Kaczmarek**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1700.\n\nClaimants have submitted two expert reports on damages authored by Mr. Brent Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting, dated 15 September 2010 and 15 March 2012, together with their Memorial and their Reply, respectively. The calculations contained in these reports and referred to in Claimants' pleadings can be summarized as follows.\n\n**(a) The \"Scenarios\" Presented by Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1701.\n\nClaimants perform calculations based on three different \"scenarios.\" Within each of these scenarios, Claimants also differentiate between a number of sub-scenarios.\n\n1702.\n\nThe first scenario developed by Claimants is based on two fundamental assumptions, namely (a) that the tax assessments against Yukos constituted a breach of the ECT, and (b) that this breach caused the merger between Yukos and Sibneft to be cancelled. In addition, Claimants call in aid an optional assumption in the context of this scenario, namely (c) that Yukos would have had a 70 percent chance of obtaining a listing on the NYSE, which would have further increased its value.2212 Claimants' first scenario can thus be subdivided into two sub-scenarios: sub-scenario 1a, which is based only on assumptions (a) and (b); and sub-scenario 1b, which is based on all three assumptions (a), (b), and (c).\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 20.\n\n1703.\n\nClaimants' second scenario is based on assumption (a) described above, namely that the tax assessments against Yukos constituted a breach of the ECT, whilst excluding assumption (b) (thus not seeking damages for the demerger between Yukos and Sibneft). Here again two sub-scenarios can be distinguished: sub-scenario 2a is based solely on assumption (a), whereas sub-scenario 2b is based on both assumptions (a) and (c).\n\n1704.\n\nClaimants' third scenario assumes that the tax assessments against Yukos did not constitute a breach of the ECT, but that the subsequent enforcement of the tax claims did. Accordingly, Claimants calculate the \"damages arising out of the 2004 and 2007 auctions, regardless of the merits of the alleged tax claims imposed on Yukos.\"2213 Within this third scenario, Claimants distinguish five sub-scenarios (subsequently referred to as 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e),2214 all of which assume that Yukos should have been allowed to settle its alleged tax debts one way or another (thus avoiding the liquidation of the company), but propose different modalities as to how this could have been done.2215\n\nMemorial \u00b6 977.\n\nSub-scenarios 3b and 3d were first presented in Reply \u00b6 873.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 979.\n\n1705.\n\nSub-scenario 3a assumes that Yukos would have been allowed a grace period of five years and would then have \"been able to pay off the entire amount of its alleged tax liabilities out of its operating cash-flows only by 2009.\"2216\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 983 *. See also* Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 33.\n\n1706.\n\nSub-scenario 3b assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of three years and would then have been able to pay off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of its free cash flows and the sale of non-core assets during that period.2217\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 36.\n\n1707.\n\nSub-scenario 3c assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of one year and would then have been able to pay off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of its free cash flows, the sale of non-core assets and debt financing during that period.2218\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 34.\n\n1708.\n\nSub-scenario 3d also assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of only one year, but then assumes (in contradistinction to sub-scenario 3c) that Yukos would have paid off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of free cash flows, the sale of certain core assets and (limited) debt financing.2219\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 38.\n\n1709.\n\nFinally, sub-scenario 3e assumes that, while Yukos would have had to sell YNG to settle its alleged tax obligations, the auction \"would have been conducted in a manner ensuring a fair, rather than grossly undervalued, price,\" generating proceeds of USD 19,703 billion,2220 with the result that Yukos would have paid off its alleged tax liabilities with these proceeds as well as its cash flows in 2004 and 2005, while remaining a going concern.2221\n\nMemorial \u00b6\u00b6 989-90.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 993 *. See also* Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 30.\n\n1710.\n\nIn accordance with Claimants' submissions regarding the relevant valuation dates, Claimants base their damages calculations in the first place on a valuation date of 21 November 2007. Accordingly, Claimants provide calculations for all three scenarios based on this date. In addition, Claimants also carry out a number of calculations based on the date of 1 January 2012, as a proxy for the date of the award, \"for comparison purposes.\"2222 Claimants provide calculations based on this date for scenarios 1 and 2, but not for scenario 3.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 155; Reply \u00b6 946.\n\n**(b) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on Scenarios 1 and 2**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1711.\n\nClaimants' calculations for scenarios 1 and 2 as of November 2007 are in principle based on the following methodology: the total of the damages claimed corresponds to the sum of Claimants' share in a hypothetical Yukos entity as of the valuation date plus the hypothetical cash flows that Claimants would have received in the form of dividends based on Claimants' shareholding in Yukos from 2004 to November 2007. In addition, in scenarios 1b and 2b, Claimants also include the value they attribute to the \"lost chance\" of listing Yukos' shares on the NYSE.2223 The total amount thus obtained is then \"brought forward\" to a date close to the date of Mr. Kaczmarek's report by adding pre-award interest.2224 Each one of these steps is set out in more detail below.\n\nThe total loss T under Claimants' scenario 1b based on a valuation date of November 2007 can thus be described as T = Value of Shares in November 2007 (V) + Dividends received from 2004 to 2007 (D) + Value of \"lost chance\" to list shares on NYSE (LC).

Value of Shares**\n----------------------\n\n1712.\n\nWith regard to the valuation date of 21 November 2007, Claimants calculate the value of their shares in Yukos as follows:\n\n*(a) Valuation of Yukos*\n------------------------\n\n1713.\n\nAs a first step, Claimants calculate the value of the relevant Yukos entity, as defined by the assets that Claimants assume Yukos would have owned in November 2007 in the absence of Respondent's alleged breaches.2225 The assets taken into account depend on the scenario. For the purposes of scenario 1, both Yukos' and Sibneft's original assets are taken into account,2226 whereas for scenario 2 the calculations are based only on Yukos' assets.2227 Claimants use three different methods for valuating Yukos, namely the DCF method, the comparable companies method and the comparable transactions method.2228\n\nMemorial \u00b6 931.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 972.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 927, 972.\n\n1714.\n\nWith regard to the DCF method, Claimants describe their approach as an attempt to reconstruct the \"pro-forma financial statements\" that the relevant Yukos entity would have presented in November 2007, based on the financial and operational data published by Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, which held the majority of Yukos' assets at that point in time.2229 Where no such data is available, Claimants rely on \"historical financial statements and operating information published by Yukos and Sibneft... as well as a benchmark of indicators from Yukos' and Sibneft's industry peers in Russia.\"2230 Based on this data, Claimants estimate cash flows between 2007 and 2015 as well as a \"terminal value\" of the entity in 2015.2231 Claimants then bring the above estimates to their November 2007 value by applying a discount rate based on Yukos' cost of capital.2232 This operation leads them to Yukos' enterprise value as of November 2007.2233\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 931. For scenario 2, Mr. Kaczmarek uses the Dicounted Cash Flow (hereinafter \"DCF\") model developed for scenario 1 with a number of adjustments. First Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 417.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 931.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 932.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 933-34 *. See also* First Kaczmarek Report \u00b6\u00b6 84, 87.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 935.\n\n1715.\n\nClaimants also use a comparable companies approach, based on data available for a pool of Russian (Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, TNK-BP and Surgutneftegaz) and international (BP, Chevron, Conoco-Philips, Exxon-Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total SA) oil companies.2234 This approach identifies companies with characteristics similar to Yukos (notably in terms of production, reserves, profitability, revenue growth and financing structure), establishes the ratios between the enterprise value of these companies and relevant operating or financial metrics (EBITDA, reserves and production), and then applies these ratios to the relevant metrics of Yukos in order to estimate the latter's enterprise value.2235 The net income, EBITDA, reserves and production of Yukos are derived from the \"pro-forma financial statements\" established in the context of the DCF method.2236\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 938.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 429.\n\n1716.\n\nFinally, Claimants use a comparable transactions approach based on public purchase transactions of comparable companies.2237 In this regard, Claimants apply a \"sum of the parts valuation,\" in which they select transactions that are meant to match the upstream and downstream business of Yukos separately.2238 Here again, the operating and financial metrics of Yukos as determined in the context of the DCF method are used to calculate the value of the company.2239\n\nMemorial \u00b6 940.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 941.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1717.\n\nClaimants then calculate a synthesized enterprise value of Yukos based on the results of the three approaches, weighing the DCF approach at 50 percent, the comparable companies approach at 40 percent and the comparable transactions approach at 10 percent.2240 By then subtracting Yukos' assumed debt, they arrive at Yukos' synthesized equity value.2241\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 944-45. Claimants note that they assign a low weight to the results of their comparable transactions approach, due to the \"absence of a transaction involving a company similar to YukosSibneft in the years preceding the date of valuation.\" *Ibid*. \u00b6 945.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 945.\n\n*(b) Calculation of the Value of Claimants' Shareholding*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1718.\n\nIn a final step, for each of the scenarios considered, Claimants calculate the value of Claimants' shareholding in Yukos by multiplying the company's equity value by Claimants' share in the company\u201453 percent (corresponding to the dilution of Claimants' shareholding associated with the creation of YukosSibneft) for scenario 1 and 70.5 percent (corresponding to Claimants' original shareholding in Yukos) for scenario 2.2242\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 949, 972.\n\n**ii. Additional Indicators Relied on by Claimants to Confirm the Value of Yukos Shares**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1719.\n\nWith regard to scenario 1, Mr. Kaczmarek avers that he confirmed his valuation with a number of additional indicators. Claimants calculate Yukos' enterprise value based on the market capitalization of Rosneft in November 2007, with a number of adjustments made in order to take into account the differences between Rosneft's assets and Yukos' (fictitious) assets as of that date. The result of this calculation is an enterprise value that is about USD 4.5 billion lower than the enterprise value calculated on the basis of the above-described methodology.2243\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 263. *See also* Memorial \u00b6 946.\n\n1720.\n\nMr. Kaczmarek also confirms his valuation of Yukos' enterprise value as of November 2007 based on the increase of three benchmarks (Urals blend prices, the RTS Oil and Gas index and Lukoil's market capitalization) between October 2003 and November 2007.2244 These calculations lead to an enterprise value of Yukos that is approximately halfway between USD 14.4 billion lower (RTS Oil and Gas) and USD 46.5 billion higher (Lukoil market capitalization) than the enterprise value of Yukos calculated on the basis of Claimants' basic methodology.2245\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 260. *See also* Exh. C-1783.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 261. *See also* Exh. C-1783.\n\n1721.\n\nFinally, Claimants calculate Yukos' enterprise value on the basis of a share swap involving YNG shares that would have taken place between Rosneft and Yukos in October 2006, which Claimants say implies a valuation of YNG's equity at USD 46.2 billion at that point in time.2246 On that basis, Claimants calculate an enterprise value of Yukos as of 21 November 2007 that is approximately USD 12.8 billion lower than the value calculated on the basis of their basic methodology.2247\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 262. *See also* Exh. C-1773.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 262. *See also* Exh. C-1784.\n\n**iii. Hypothetical Cash Flows from Dividends**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1722.\n\nThe second component of Claimants' damages calculation is the cash flows from dividends that Claimants argue would have been paid to them in the first and second scenarios but for Respondent's treaty breaches. Claimants assume that, without the alleged breaches of the ECT by Respondent, Yukos would have paid dividends to its shareholders between 30 September 2003 and 21 November 2007.2248 Accordingly, Claimants say that they would have received a pro rata share of these dividends, calculated on the basis of their shareholding in the company.2249\n\nMemorial \u00b6 952.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 953.\n\n**iv. Loss of Chance**\n----------------------\n\n1723.\n\nThe third component of Claimants' damages calculation is based on Claimants' valuation of what they refer to as the loss of a chance to obtain a listing of Yukos on the NYSE. Claimants submit that, without the breaches of Respondent, Yukos would likely have been listed on the NYSE, and that this listing would have decreased the company's costs of capital and thus increased Yukos' share value.2250 Claimants quantify the value of the loss of this chance by multiplying the assumed increase in share value with the probability of a successful listing, which they assume to be 70 percent.2251 This loss for Claimants is the amount thus obtained, multiplied by Claimants' shareholding in Yukos.2252\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 954-56.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 958.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 956, 958.\n\n**v. Pre-Award Interest**\n-------------------------\n\n1724.\n\nIn a final step for purposes of their calculations with regard to scenarios 1 and 2, Claimants bring forward the total amount thus obtained to a date close to the date of their last submissions,2253 and add pre-award interest of LIBOR plus four percent on a compound basis.2254\n\nThe date used for purposes of Mr. Kaczmarek's second report is 15 March 2012. Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 15.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 969. For Claimants' arguments on interest see Section XI.A.1 above.\n\n**(c) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on Scenario 3**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1725.\n\nClaimants' calculations for scenarios 3a to 3d are based on their calculations for the second scenario, but are adjusted to take into account the settlement of Yukos' tax liabilities through Yukos' cash flow, the sale of certain assets and/or debt financing.2255 These scenarios do not assume any payment of dividends to Yukos' shareholders or the loss of a chance of obtaining a listing of Yukos on the NYSE.2256 Rather, Claimants determine Yukos' equity value as of November 2007 and derive the value of their ownership interest in Yukos from that figure. They then bring forward the amount thus obtained to a date close to the date of their last submissions again by adding compound pre-award interest at a rate of LIBOR plus four percent.2257\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6\u00b6 555, 567.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6\u00b6 556, 568.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n1726.\n\nClaimants' calculations for scenario 3e (which assumes the sale of YNG at a price higher than that achieved in the 2004 auction) are somewhat more complex. In this scenario, Claimants estimate the enterprise value of YNG as of November 2007, and then subtract this amount from their estimate of the enterprise value of Yukos as of the same date. This leaves Claimants with a figure for the enterprise value of Yukos' assets without YNG.2258 Claimants then subtract the assumed debt of this smaller Yukos entity and thus arrive at the equity value of Yukos (without YNG) in November 2007.2259 Claimants calculate their losses as a pro rata share (based on their 70.5 percent shareholding in Yukos) of the sum of this equity value, their estimate of free cash flows that a diminished Yukos (without YNG) would have achieved between January 2005 and November 2007, and pre-award interest brought forward to a date close to the date of their last submissions.2260\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 545.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 546.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 547.\n\n**(d) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on 2012 Valuation Date**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1727.\n\nThe position of Claimants is that, because of the unlawful taking by Respondent of Yukos, they are entitled to select the evaluation of the damages either at the date of Respondent's breach or at the date of the award, whichever is the highest.2261 Thus, Claimants, in their Reply, also quantify their damages in scenarios 1 and 2 based on a valuation date of 1 January 2012. Claimants state they chose this date for practical purposes since it is close to the date of submission of Mr. Kaczmarek's second expert report and that, if need be, calculations \"can subsequently be updated at a date closer to the award.\"2262\n\nMemorial \u00b6 917.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 233 n.499.\n\n1728.\n\nWhile Mr. Kaczmarek does not set out the methodology used in this regard in any great detail,2263 it can be inferred from some of the appendices to his second report.2264 In these appendices, Mr. Kaczmarek estimates Yukos' cash flows for the years 2004 to 2011 as well as the terminal value of Yukos as of 1 January 2012 for scenarios 1 and 2 and then applies pre-award interest of LIBOR plus four percent to bring these figures to the present (*i.e.*, 15 March 2012)2265 value and thus obtain Yukos' total damages.2266 For scenarios 1b and 2b, Claimants also add the incremental value of the chance of obtaining a listing on the NYSE.2267 Claimants then calculate their damages as a percentage of Yukos' damages, based on their shareholding in the relevant entity.2268\n\n*See* Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 155.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendices AG to AK.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendices AG.1 and AK.1.

Failure of Claimants to Mitigate**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1730.\n\nIn response to Respondent's contention that Claimants should promptly have paid the original taxes assessed against Yukos (as well as those Yukos should have anticipated would be imposed for succeeding years on the same grounds) to avoid massive damages, Claimants aver that there is no \"duty to appease\" and that \"a victim of extortion is not to blame if the threats against it are carried out after it refuses to pay.\"2282\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 275.\n\n1731.\n\nClaimants also argue that Yukos had no reason to concede the validity of the Russian authorities' position with regard to the initial tax assessments \"in circumstances where its objections to the December 29, 2003 Audit Report were still under consideration\" and where it had received advice from its lawyers that the Audit Report was \"totally inconsistent with the Russian tax law.\"2283 In any event, Claimants say that Yukos did not have enough cash to settle an alleged tax debt of USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004.2284\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 281, quoting Sergey Pepeliaev, Summary of the tax inspection of OAO NK Yukos, 5 January 2004, pp. 1, 3, Exh. C-1128.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 292.\n\n1732.\n\nIn addition, Claimants assert that, to apply Respondent's argument, \"the Tribunal would need to ignore the most salient facts\u2014the Respondent's breaches\u2014and assume... that the very same Russian authorities who committed those breaches would have acted differently if only Yukos had taken the actions specified by the Respondent.\"2285 In particular, with regard to Respondent's argument that Yukos could have significantly reduced its tax burden by filing corrected VAT returns during the first quarter of 2004, Claimants contend that the actual conduct of the Russian authorities demonstrates that any amended returns that Yukos might have submitted would, in any event, have been either ignored or rejected.2286\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 276.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 287.\n\n**5. Windfall and Double-Recovery**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1733.\n\nFinally, Claimants also reject Respondent's arguments that any award of damages should avoid presenting Claimants with a windfall and take into account the risk of double-recovery. According to Claimants, these arguments of Respondent merely seek to \"repackage its so-called \u2018unclean hands' theory in the context of damages\" and Respondent, they say, \"has failed to articulate any basis on which alleged collateral illegalities could... be relevant to an assessment of damages.\"2287 In any event, conclude Claimants, any benefits they may have received through their investments prior to Respondent's breaches of the ECT are irrelevant for the calculation of the damages in the present arbitration and, furthermore, any assets located outside Russia have been excluded from Mr. Kaczmarek's valuations.2288\n\nReply \u00b6\u00b6 883-85.\n\nReply \u00b6 963.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n1734.\n\nRespondent argues that, even if it were held to be liable for a breach of the ECT, Claimants should not be awarded any damages in this case.2289 Respondent has submitted two expert reports on damages by Professor James Dow, one dated 1 April 2011 and the other 15 August 2012, with their Counter-Memorial and their Rejoinder, respectively. These reports and Respondent's arguments with regard to Claimants' damages calculations can be summarized as follows.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 262-63.\n\n**1. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n1735.\n\nRespondent disagrees with both valuation dates proposed by Claimants.\n\n1736.\n\nWith regard to Claimants' valuation as of the date of expropriation, Respondent invokes the principle that \"the valuation date should be when the purported substantial deprivation of the investor's investment has occurred.\"2290 Respondent objects, however, to Claimants' assessment that in this case a substantial deprivation of their investment occurred on 21 November 2007, a date which Respondent considers \"arbitrary.\"2291 Respondent argues that \"the hallmark of an appropriate valuation date is the loss of effective control over the investor's investment\"2292 and concludes that \"Claimants have repeatedly averred that they lost control of their investment and that it lost all value long before November 21, 2007.\"2293\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1666.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1618.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1666.\n\nIbid. \u00b6 1666 *. See also* Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 238.\n\n1737.\n\nAs a result, Respondent disputes that the date of 21 November 2007 chosen by Claimants has any relevance. As Professor Dow explained at the Hearing:\n\nI am very clear in stating that the 2007 date has no economic relevance, in my view. And I say that because at the end of 2004 Yukos shares had lost essentially all of their value. Yukos was a penny stock. It wasn't expected to recover, the market did not expect it to recover; that was reflected in the share price.... So from an economic point of view, the date of delisting in 2007 is a bureaucratic event, not an event at which value was lost.2294\n\nTranscript, Day 12 at 14 *. See also* at 49.\n\n1738.\n\nWhile Respondent does not propose any specific alternative date when Claimants lost control of their investments, Professor Dow suggested at the Hearing that such a date would, in any event, have to be before the end of 2004.2295\n\n*Ibid.* at 175.\n\n1739.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants' submission that the date of an award can be used as an alternative valuation date. In this regard, Respondent argues that the \"standard theoretical framework economists typically use to calculate damages is an \u2018 *ex ante* ' one\" where damages are assessed at the moment of the relevant breaches and then brought to present value with prejudgment interest.2296 By contrast, an \" *ex post* \" approach would, according to Respondent, use information based on hindsight, provide no principled basis for choosing a date and therefore be vulnerable to error.2297 In addition, Respondent claims that, \"with each passing day after the alleged takings date, it becomes increasingly speculative to value the asset taken as of some later date.\"2298\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1617.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1618.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 239.\n\n1740.\n\nIn his first report, Professor Dow writes that there is a \"general preference among economists for the *ex ante* approach when evaluating damages in commercial matters\" and refers, in this connection, to an article published in the 1990 Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance.2299 Relying on this article, Respondent submits that \"an expropriation relieves the owner not only of the value of the asset on the date of expropriation, but also of the risk associated with owning it\" and that, as a consequence, \"[t]he only way to recognize both aspects is to assess the value of the asset on the date of expropriation, when neither its owner nor the State knows whether the asset will increase or decrease in value.\"2300\n\nFirst Dow Report \u00b6 13, citing to Franklin M. Fisher and R. Craig Romaine, *Janis Joplin's Yearbook and the Theory of Damages*, Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance (1990), p. 153, Exh. R-1980.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 239.\n\n**2. Causation**\n----------------\n\n1741.\n\nRespondent also disagrees with Claimants with respect to causation. In particular, Respondent emphasizes the need to establish \"a sufficient causal link\" between breach and damage, where the latter is the \"proximate result\" of the former.2301 Respondent advocates the following methodology:\n\n[I]f the damages are caused by a series of harmful actions... each violation can be treated as a new action and the corresponding incremental change can be estimated at the time of the action,... [t]he incremental damage figures for each violation can then be added together to obtain a total damage figure.2302\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1606, quoting U.S. and Germany Mixed Claims Commission, Administrative Decision No. II, 1 November 1923, 23, p. 29, Exh. R-1188.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1617.\n\n1742.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants' approach to damages fails \"to connect any of the alleged treaty violations to a specific amount of damages\" and provides \"no mechanism for determining the incremental damages allegedly caused by any specific alleged violation.\"2303 As a consequence, Respondent alleges that Claimants' valuations \"do not accommodate the situation where the Tribunal finds that fewer than all of the scores of alleged \u2018bad acts' were violations.\"2304\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1619 *.

Specific Aspects of the Calculations Performed by Claimants Criticized by Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1743.\n\nPrincipally, Respondent criticizes Claimants' damages claims as being \"based on inherently incorrect or speculative assumptions.\"2305 According to Professor Dow, Mr. Kaczmarek's various calculations are \"riddled with errors\" and the obvious result of \"reverse engineering to a desired result.\"2306 Respondent and its expert raise numerous arguments in support of their criticism, the most important of which are summarized below.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1637.\n\nSecond Dow Report \u00b6 422.\n\n**(a) Credibility of Claimants' DCF Analysis**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1744.\n\nOne of Respondent's main criticisms with regard to Claimants' valuation is directed at Mr. Kaczmarek's DCF analysis. In particular, in his first expert report, Professor Dow identifies what Respondent claims are \"three obvious and significant errors\" regarding the valuation of YNG.2307 Respondent points out that, while Mr. Kaczmarek admitted to two of these errors in his second expert report, the valuation of YNG remained virtually unchanged.2308 As a consequence, Respondent claims that Mr. Kaczmarek's \"main task\" in his second report must have been to \"find a way to make up for gaping holes in his initial valuation that he concedes were the result of readily identifiable errors that he realized had to be corrected, after Professor Dow had identified them.\"2309 Respondent points out that, while the necessary corrections identified by Professor Dow caused Claimants' expert to make adjustments of over USD 10 billion to his valuation of YNG, Mr. Kaczmarek still ended up with virtually the same figure as in his first report as a consequence of a series of simultaneous \"discretionary\" upward adjustments.2310\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1630.\n\nSecond Dow Report \u00b6 8. *See also* Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6\u00b6 82-97.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1606.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1612.\n\n1745.\n\nRespondent also claims that Claimants' expert \"did the same thing in his other two DCF models, correcting mistakes that reduce his valuation of Yukos and YukosSibneft by USD 40 billion and USD 90 billion, respectively, and then adjusting other elements to bring his conclusions back up to where he started.\"2311 According to Respondent, \"Mr. Kaczmarek confirmed... that his DCF model is simply a device for justifying an *a priori* conclusion, conceding repeatedly that his focus was not on critically analyzing the inputs to his model, but rather on whether the output met pre-conceived notions that were never disclosed in his reports.\"2312 As a result, Respondent concludes that Claimants' results have been \"reverse engineered\"2313 and are \"made-up numbers around which models were built.\"2314\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1613. Respondent identifies a number of errors which it says were made by Mr. Kaczmarek in his first report before being corrected in his second report. In addition, Respondent identifies a number of errors which it says were made by Mr. Kaczmarek in his second report.

See also* Second Dow Report \u00b6 420.\n\nSecond Dow Report \u00b6 423.\n\n**(d) Claimants' Calculations of Hypothetical Cash Flows from Dividends**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1748.\n\nRespondent does not explicitly address Claimants' calculations of hypothetical dividends that would have been paid by Yukos to its shareholders if there had been no breach of the ECT as alleged by Claimants. However, when criticizing Mr. Kaczmarek's calculations with regard to scenario 3, Professor Dow does comment on the free cash flows of Yukos that, according to Claimants, would have been the basis for the payment of dividends. Thus, according to Professor Dow, the free cash flows identified by Mr. Kaczmarek in this context are \"inflated because they are based on his... grossly erroneous[] Yukos DCF model that overstates Yukos cash flows.\"2320 Professor Dow provides an alternative set of figures that he refers to as the \"corrected\" cash flows from Mr. Kaczmarek's model.2321\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 492.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 492 and Figure 81.\n\n**(e) Claimants' Calculations Based on the Loss of a Chance to Obtain a Listing on the New York Stock Exchange**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1749.\n\nProfessor Dow also criticizes Claimants' assumption that Yukos would have benefited from a listing on the NYSE as \"thrice wrong because it assumes an event that did not happen, that was entirely within Yukos' control, and overstates the economic benefit that would be expected were the event to have come to pass.\"2322 In addition, Professor Dow states that there is no basis for the assumption that, without Respondent's actions, Yukos would have had a 70 percent chance of being listed on the NYSE.2323\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 204.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 215.\n\n**(f) Claimants' Calculations Based on the Assumption of a Completed Yukos-Sibneft Merger**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1750.\n\nProfessor Dow criticizes Claimants' calculations based on a completed Yukos-Sibneft merger arguing that such a merger was never completed and that the valuation of a combined YukosSibneft entity is therefore utterly speculative.2324 In particular, Professor Dow claims that Mr. Kaczmarek's calculations largely ignore \"the effects of the merger on operational costs, any impact on costs as a result of changed regulatory requirements, and the combined entity's creditworthiness and cost of borrowing.\"2325\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 204.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 208.\n\n**(g) Claimants' Scenarios 3a to 3d**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1751.\n\nWith regard to Claimants' scenarios 3a to 3d, which assume payment of Yukos' tax liabilities over a period of one, three or five years, Respondent asserts that Russian law did not allow the Tax Ministry to enter into any such arrangements as postulated by Claimants2326 and that it was, in any event, not obligated to do so.2327 In addition, Respondent claims that, based on the knowledge available regarding the development of oil prices in 2004, Claimants' calculations in relation to expected cash flows are not realistic.2328 Respondent also disputes that Claimants would have been able to negotiate a loan of USD 16 billion, as assumed in Claimants' scenario 3c.2329\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1631.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1662 and n.2559.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1631 *.

Failure of Claimants to Mitigate**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1754.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants had \"repeated opportunities to mitigate the damage caused,\"2333 and that, in particular, by paying its taxes in early 2004, Yukos could have \"halved the total amount to be paid\"2334 rather than \"subject[ing] itself to... US$ 12 billion in additional 2000-2003 Avoidable Taxes and Fees.\"2335 If Yukos had paid its taxes and filed appropriate returns during the first quarter of 2004, Respondent says it \"would have survived as a going concern and still could have pursued a claim for a refund of any amounts the courts found it did not need to pay.\"2336 Accordingly, the \"loss of all value of Yukos\" would be \"the consequence of the contributory fault and the failure to mitigate of Yukos, under the control of Claimants.\"2337\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1602.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1729.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 1730 *.

Windfall and Double-Recovery**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1756.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that any calculation of damages should take into account any previous benefits obtained by Claimants from their investments in Russia, so as to prevent any \"double-recovery.\"2340 Respondent contends that granting Claimants the damages sought \"would be a massive windfall to Claimants, who have already received far more from their investment in Yukos than they would have received had they invested in a comparable Russian oil company during the same period.\"2341 Respondent also suggests that, had the market known of \"Yukos' lack of transparency, its disregard of minority interests, and its failures of corporate governance, not to mention its internal documents acknowledging the civil and criminal exposure it faced from its massive tax fraud, Yukos would not have experienced the share appreciation... on which Claimants' damages claim depends.\"2342 As a consequence, Respondent claims that \"the market metrics... are not fair indicators of value and cannot be relied upon by the Tribunal.\"2343\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1648.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 232 (footnote omitted).\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 261.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 261.\n\n1757.\n\nRespondent concludes that \"any damages award should provide for no more than a reasonable rate of return.\"2344 Since Claimants would \"have already gained that return through Yukos' dividends and share repurchases,... hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Russian taxes they evaded through abuse of the [Cyprus-Russia DTA], and all the assets that were stripped from Yukos,\" the \"proper measure of damages in this case\" would in any event be \"zero.\"2345\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 233 *.

TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1758.\n\nHaving reviewed and considered the Parties' submissions and their experts' reports, the Tribunal will now determine the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of Respondent's unlawful expropriation of Yukos' assets in breach of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n**1. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n1759.\n\nWith regard to the date of valuation, the Tribunal needs to address two issues, namely (a) the date of the expropriation of Claimants' investment by Respondent, and (b) whether Claimants are entitled to choose between a valuation based on that date of expropriation and a valuation based on the date of the award. Each of these questions is addressed in turn.\n\n**(a) The Date of the Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1760.\n\nAs noted earlier, Claimants have advanced the date of 21 November 2007, the day on which Yukos was struck off the Russian register of legal entities, as the date of the expropriation of their investment, and have performed their main damages analysis based on a valuation of their shares in Yukos as of that date.\n\n1761.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the date of 21 November 2007 cannot be the date of Yukos' expropriation. The Tribunal observes that both Parties are agreed that, in principle, in the event of an expropriation through a series of actions, the date of the expropriation is the date on which the incriminated actions first lead to a deprivation of the investor's property that crossed the threshold and became tantamount to an expropriation.2346 This is the date that is relevant for the determination of the Tribunal.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 912, n.1314; Reply \u00b6 940; Rejoinder \u00b6 1666; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 238.\n\n1762.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the threshold to the expropriation of Claimants' investment was crossed earlier than in November 2007. On the basis of the record, it is clear to the Tribunal that a substantial and irreversible deprivation of Claimants' assets occurred on 19 December 2004, the date of the YNG auction. YNG was Yukos' main production asset and its loss, with the conclusion of the auction on that date, marked a substantial and irreversible diminution of Claimants' investment.2347 This conclusion of the Tribunal is confirmed by statements made by Claimants in December 2004 to the effect that they had \"lost the power to govern the financial and operating policies of Yukos so as to obtain the benefits from its activities\" and that Yukos had become \"incapable of operating as a business.\"2348 The date of the expropriation of Claimants' investment is therefore determined by the Tribunal to be 19 December 2004.\n\n*See* Subsection VIII.F.3(c) above.\n\nYUL (and its subsidiaries), Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for The Year Ended 31 December 2004, Exh. R-4229 *. See also* Rejoinder \u00b6 1673.\n\n**(b) The Possibility for Claimants to Choose Between a Valuation as of the Date of Expropriation and a Valuation as of the Date of the Award**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1763.\n\nThe Tribunal also holds that, in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as in the present case, Claimants are entitled to select either the date of expropriation or the date of the award as the date of valuation.\n\n1764.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted earlier, Respondent, relying on the opinion of its expert on damages, maintains that Claimants may not make such a choice and that there is a preference amongst economists for what he refers to as an \" *ex ante* \" approach to the evaluation of damages.2349 In support of his opinion, Professor Dow relies on a single article published in an economics journal in 1990.2350\n\nFirst Dow Report \u00b6 13.\n\nFranklin M. Fisher and R. Craig Romaine, *Janis Joplin's Yearbook and the Theory of Damages*, Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance (1990), p. 153, Exh. R-1980.\n\n1765.\n\nNeither the text of Article 13 of the ECT nor its *travaux* provide a definitive answer to the question of whether damages should be assessed as of the date of expropriation or the date of the award. The text of Article 13, after specifying the four conditions that must be met to render an expropriation lawful, provides that for \"such\" an expropriation, that is, for a lawful expropriation, damages shall be calculated as of the date of the taking. *A contrario,* the text of Article 13 may be read to import that damages for an unlawful taking need not be calculated as of the date of taking. It follows that this Tribunal is not required by the terms of the ECT to assess damages as of the time of the expropriation. Moreover, conflating the measure of damages for a lawful taking with the measure of damages for an unlawful taking is, on its face, an unconvincing option.\n\n1766.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, and in exercise of the latitude that the terms of Article 13 of the ECT afford it in this regard, the question of whether an expropriated investor is entitled to choose between a valuation as of the expropriation date and the date of an award is one best answered by considering which party should bear the risk and enjoy the benefits of unanticipated events leading to a change in the value of the expropriated asset between the time of the expropriatory actions and the rendering of an award. The Tribunal finds that the principles on the reparation for injury as expressed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility are relevant in this regard. According to Article 35 of the ILC Articles, a State responsible for an illegal expropriation is in the first place obliged to make restitution by putting the injured party into the position that it would be in if the wrongful act had not taken place. This obligation of restitution applies as of the date when a decision is rendered. Only to the extent where it is not possible to make good the damage caused by restitution is the State under an obligation to compensate pursuant to Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.\n\n1767.\n\nThe consequences of the application of these principles (restitution as of the date of the decision, compensation for any damage not made good by restitution) for the calculation of damages in the event of illegal expropriation are twofold. First, investors must enjoy the benefits of unanticipated events that increase the value of an expropriated asset up to the date of the decision, because they have a right to compensation in lieu of their right to restitution of the expropriated asset *as of that date*. If the value of the asset increases, this also increases the value of the right to restitution and, accordingly, the right to compensation where restitution is not possible.\n\n1768.\n\nSecond, investors do not bear the risk of unanticipated events decreasing the value of an expropriated asset over that time period. While such events decrease the value of the right to restitution (and accordingly the right to compensation in lieu of restitution), they do not affect an investor's entitlement to compensation of the damage \"not made good by restitution\" within the meaning of Article 36(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. If the asset could be returned to the investor on the date where a decision is rendered, but its value had decreased since the expropriation, the investor would be entitled to the difference in value, the reason being that in the absence of the expropriation the investor could have sold the asset at an earlier date at its previous higher value. The same analysis must also apply where the asset cannot be returned, allowing the investor to claim compensation in the amount of the asset's higher value.\n\n1769.\n\nIt follows for the several reasons stated above that in the event of an illegal expropriation an investor is entitled to choose between a valuation as of the expropriation date and as of the date of the award. The Tribunal finds support for this conclusion in the fact that this approach has been adopted by tribunals in a number of recent decisions dealing with illegal expropriation.2351 One of these tribunals, in *Ioannis Kardassopoulous and Ron Fuchs v. The Republic of Georgia*, so interpreted the ECT.2352\n\n*See e.g.*, *ADC* \u00b6\u00b6 496-97, Exh. C-980; *Siemens* \u00b6 352, Exh. C-983; *Amoco*, pp. 300-301, Exh. C-939. *See also* Marboe \u00b6 3,287, Exh. C-1607.\n\n*Kardassopoulos* \u00b6 514, Exh. C-1533.\n\n**2. Causation**\n----------------\n\n1770.\n\nThe Parties disagree with regard to the requirements for showing the causation of damages.2353 The Tribunal finds it useful to address the Parties' views on this matter in two steps. First, the Tribunal will address the requirements for showing the causation of damages where several actions are invoked at the same time. Second, it will deal with the consequences of damage being caused by several actions, only some of which are breaches attributable to the respondent party.\n\nReply \u00b6 911 (Claimants assert that \"a causal link needs only be established between the actions of the Russian Federation taken as a whole and the Claimants' damages\" and that \"[t]his causal link is obvious.\"). *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 191. By contrast, *see* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1619 (Respondent takes the view that, by simply asserting a link between the totality of a number of \"bad acts\" and a damage, Claimants put themselves in a position where they have to show that \"all of the scores of alleged \u2018bad acts' were [treaty] violations.\"). *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1628\n\n**(a) Causation and Reliance on Multiple Actions**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1771.\n\nClaimants assert that \"a causal link needs only be established between the actions of the Russian Federation taken as a whole and Claimants' damages\" and that \"[t]his causal link is obvious.\"2354 Respondent takes the view that, by simply asserting a link between the totality of a number of \"bad acts\" and the damage, Claimants put themselves in a position where they have to show that \"all of the scores of alleged \u2018bad acts' were [treaty] violations.\"2355\n\nReply \u00b6 911. *See also* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 191.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6 1619. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1628.\n\n1772.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that Claimants do, in fact, establish that a specific series of actions of Respondent, consisting of the 2000-2004 tax assessments against Yukos and the subsequent enforcement measures (including the forced auction of YNG), constituted an illegal expropriation of Claimants' investment, and that this expropriation caused Claimants damage. In particular, the 2000-2004 tax assessments were actions that contributed to the expropriation of Claimants' investment, and without these assessments, the damage to Claimants would not have occurred. While other actions taken by Respondent may or may not have contributed to a violation of the ECT's standards, showing that they did is not required for establishing causation with regard to the damage suffered by Claimants. All of the heads of damage subsequently identified by the Tribunal are consequences of the 2000-2004 tax assessments that led to the expropriation of Claimants' investment, and this expropriation was clearly a breach of Article 13 ECT.\n\n**(b) Multiple Causes for the Same Damage**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1773.\n\nThe Parties also do not agree with regard to the consequences of damage being caused by several events, where only some of those events are breaches attributable to a respondent party. Respondent appears to suggest that concurrent causation of a particular line of damage by Claimants' own conduct, the conduct of third parties and conduct of Respondent that is not wrongful should exclude Respondent's responsibility for that damage,2356 and that Claimants bear the burden of showing that no such causation exists.2357 The Tribunal does not agree with that argument.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 234. *See also* Counter-Memorial \u00b6 1619; Rejoinder \u00b6 1719. Claimants do not specifically address this point.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 1719.\n\n1774.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal finds it instructive to look to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Article 31 of the ILC Articles provides that \"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused.\"2358 The official commentary to this provision notes that \"[o]ften two separate factors combine to cause damage,\" before pointing out that:\n\nAlthough, in such cases, the injury in question was effectively caused by a combination of factors, only one of which is to be ascribed to the responsible State, international practice and the decisions of international tribunals do not support the reduction or attenuation of reparation for concurrent causes, except in cases of contributory fault.... Such a result should follow *a fortiori* in cases where the concurrent cause is not the act of another State... but of private individuals.... [U]nless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct.2359\n\nExh. R-1031.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 (footnotes omitted), Exh. R-1031.\n\n1775.\n\nAs the commentary makes clear, the mere fact that damage was caused not only by a breach, but also by a concurrent action that is not a breach does not, as such, interrupt the relationship of causation that otherwise exists between the breach and the damage. Rather, it falls to the Respondent to establish that a particular consequence of its actions is severable in causal terms (due to the intervening actions of Claimants or a third party) or too remote to give rise to Respondent's duty to compensate. As the Tribunal considers that Respondent has not demonstrated this with regard to any of the heads of damage identified in the remainder of this Chapter, the Tribunal holds that causation exists between the damage and Respondent's expropriation of Claimants' investment.2360\n\nClaimants' contributory fault and the associated reduction of the damages suffered has already been addressed above in Chapter X.E.\n\n**3. Failure of Claimants to Mitigate**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1776.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants could have significantly mitigated their damages by taking a few simple steps in the first quarter of 2004, namely by paying the taxes then assessed against Yukos, filing amended VAT returns in Yukos' name, and filing amended tax returns for the years 2000-2002 and a tax return for 2003 recognizing all of Yukos' income without assigning it to its trading entities. The Tribunal has considered each of the actions Respondent suggests Claimants should have taken (set out in paragraphs 679-80, 745-48 and 934-35 above) and has concluded that the suggested actions would not ultimately have made a difference to the enforcement measures subsequently taken by the Russian Federation. As seen in Part VIII above, the measures taken by the Russian Federation demonstrate that its primary objective was to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets and that it was determined to do whatever was necessary to achieve this purpose. In light of this finding, the Tribunal cannot accept that by paying the taxes then assessed or re-filing VAT and tax returns in early 2004, Claimants could have deterred Respondent in the pursuit of its objective.\n\n**4. The Methodology Followed by the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1777.\n\nHaving made these determinations in respect of the valuation dates, causation and mitigation, the Tribunal now turns to the specific methodology of establishing the damages in this arbitration. As an initial matter, the Tribunal observes that, since it has decided that Claimants are entitled to the higher of the damages determined as of the date of expropriation and as of the date of the award, the Tribunal must establish the total amount of damages caused by Respondent's actions on each of the two valuation dates identified, namely the date of the YNG auction and the date of this Award. For purposes of the Tribunal's calculations, the date of the Award will be deemed to be 30 June 2014. Claimants will be entitled to the higher of these two figures, subject to the deduction of 25 percent for contributory fault.2361\n\n*See* Chapter X.E.\n\n1778.\n\nOn each of these valuation dates, Claimants are entitled to the following heads of damages: (1) the value of Claimants' shares in Yukos valued as of the valuation date; (2) the value of the dividends that the Tribunal determines would have been paid to Claimants by Yukos up to the valuation date but for the expropriation of Yukos; and (3) pre-award simple interest on these amounts.\n\n1779.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal considers that a potential listing of Yukos on the NYSE and the benefits that Claimants might have derived from such a listing are too uncertain to be taken into account for purposes of calculating Claimants' damages. This element of Claimants' damages case is therefore rejected.\n\n1780.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the assessment of Claimants' damages must be based on their shareholding in Yukos, without taking into account the potential effects of a completed merger between Yukos and Sibneft. The Tribunal has not been convinced, on the balance of probabilities, that in the absence of Respondent's expropriatory actions, the envisaged merger would have been completed;2362 indeed, the Tribunal considers that assuming a completed merger in the \"but for\" scenario is too speculative. As a consequence, the Tribunal rejects Claimants' first damages scenario, notably the valuation of Claimants' share in YukosSibneft.\n\n*See* Chapter VIII.D.\n\n1781.\n\nBefore turning to the calculation of the damages components for the two relevant valuation dates, the Tribunal explains in the following subsections the methodology it has decided to adopt for valuing Yukos on each of the given dates, and the basis on which it has determined the amount of dividends that would likely have been paid to Claimants, in the \"but for\" scenario, prior to each of the valuation dates.\n\n**(a) Valuation of Yukos**\n--------------------------\n\n1782.\n\nAs set out earlier in this chapter, for purposes of the damages calculation, the Tribunal has decided that the relevant valuation dates are the date of the YNG auction and the date of this Award. However, the starting point for the Tribunal's analysis must be the calculations done by Claimants as of their suggested valuation date of 21 November 2007. Claimants have put forward alternative valuations of Yukos as of that date calculated on the basis of various valuation methods. These methods and the valuations of Yukos derived from them (in USD billion) are summarized in the following table:2363\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| DCF method | 88,5932364 |\n| Comparable companies method | 92,9242365 |\n| Comparable transactions method | 87,6202366 |\n| Rosneft's market capitalization on 21 November 2007, adjusted | 83.072367 |\n| Yukos' market capitalization on 24 October 2003 adjusted pursuant to development of Urals Blend price index | 104,8352368 |\n| Yukos' market capitalization on 24 October 2003 adjusted pursuant to development of RTS Oil & Gas index | 74,1912369 |\n| Yukos' market capitalization on 24 Oct 2003 adjusted pursuant to development of Lukoil's market capitalization | 129,0282370 |\n| Implied value of YNG based on share swap between Rosneft and Yukos in October 2006 (adjusted pursuant to development of RTS Oil & Gas index) and proceeds from auctions of non-YNG assets in 2007 | 75,6572371 |\n\nFor any of these valuations, Claimants' respective damages (under this head of damage) would correspond to their pro rata stake in the outstanding shares of Yukos, which were 56.3 percent for Hulley, 2.6 percent for YUL and 11.6 percent for VPL (a total of 70.5 percent for Claimants taken together). All figures are in USD.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, p. 11, Table 3; \u00b6 69.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, p. 11, Table 3; p. 38, Table 24..\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, p. 11, Table 3; p. 39, Table 25.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 263; Exh.

However, Professor Dow has provided a \"corrected\" version of Claimants' comparable companies analysis, making adjustments for what he considered to be the principal errors contained therein.2372 Based on these adjustments, Respondent's expert arrives\u2014in orally advancing what \"could be\" a \"useful\" evaluation\u2014at a \"corrected\" enterprise value of Yukos, as of 21 November 2007, in the amount of USD 67,862 billion.2373 Assuming a 90/10 equity/debt capital structure of Yukos, this corresponds to an equity value of Yukos, as of 21 November 2007, of approximately USD 61,076 billion.2374\n\nSecond Dow Report \u00b6 417.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 444; p. 182, Figure 67; p. 195, Figure 73; Appendix 16.1 *. See also* Transcript, Day 12 at 47 (Professor Dow).\n\nA 90/10 equity/capital structure corresponds to the assumption made by Claimants for purposes of their calculations. *See* Exh. C-1784.\n\n1784.\n\nHaving considered the extensive expert evidence presented by Mr. Kaczmarek and Professor Dow, including the written evidence in the two expert reports that each submitted (with detailed accompanying annexes and appendices), and the testimony that was elicited from them during the Hearing, the Tribunal concludes, for the reasons set out below, that the \"corrected\" comparable companies figure is the best available estimate for what Yukos would have been worth on 21 November 2007 but for the expropriation.\n\n1785.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that neither of the other two primary valuation methods put forward by Claimants is sufficiently reliable to ground a determination of damages for this case. On balance, the Tribunal was persuaded by Professor Dow's analysis of Claimants' DCF model, and is compelled to agree that little weight should be given to it. The Tribunal observes that Claimants' expert admitted at the Hearing that his DCF analysis had been influenced by his own pre-determined notions as to what would be an appropriate result.2375 Similarly, the Tribunal can put little stock in Claimants' calculations based on the comparable transactions method, since both Parties agree that, in fact, there were no comparable transactions,2376 and thus no basis that would allow a useful comparison.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 190.\n\nMemorial \u00b6 945; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 242.\n\n1786.\n\nAs for the remaining valuation methods put forward by Claimants, and the valuations of Yukos generated by them, the Tribunal notes that Claimants use these secondary valuations primarily in support of their main valuation. Moreover, some of these figures were only introduced by Claimants at a very late stage of the proceedings (through demonstrative exhibits at the Hearing and in Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief2377) and could therefore not be properly addressed by Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that none of these secondary valuation methods can serve as a suitable independent basis for determining the value of Yukos.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6\u00b6 261-63; Exh. C-1785.\n\n1787.\n\nBy contrast to all of the other methods canvassed above, the Tribunal does have a measure of confidence in the comparable companies method as a means of determining Yukos' value. While Professor Dow stated at the Hearing that he had not performed an analysis sufficient to fully endorse the figure resulting from his corrections to Claimants' comparable companies approach, he agreed that it \"could be a useful valuation.\"2378 The Tribunal for its part finds that the comparable companies method is, in the circumstances, the most tenable approach to determine Yukos' value as of 21 November 2007, and therefore the starting point for the Tribunal's further analysis.\n\nTranscript, Day 12 at 47.\n\n1788.\n\nThe next step for the Tribunal consists in determining the value of Yukos as of the relevant valuation dates by adjusting Yukos' value as of November 2007 on the basis of the development of a relevant index. Having considered the various options in this regard, the Tribunal finds that the RTS Oil and Gas index is the most appropriate index for that purpose. The RTS Oil and Gas index is based on prices of trades executed in securities admitted to trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange2379 and presently includes preferred or common shares of nine Russian oil and gas companies, the most important of which are Gazprom, Lukoil, Novatek, Rosneft and Surgutneftegas.2380 The methodology for establishing the index as well as its current and historical values are transparent and publicly available on the webpage of the Moscow Stock Exchange.2381 Both Parties have referred to the RTS Oil & Gas index as a reliable indicator reflecting the changes in the value of Russian oil and gas companies2382 and have used it in their calculations to carry forward certain valuations from one date to another.2383\n\n\"Methodology of the Moscow Exchange Sector Indices calculation,\" March 2013 \u00b6 1.1, available at http://fs.moex.com/files/4032 (last accessed 4 July 2014).\n\nPreferred or common shares in each of these companies are weighted as 15 percent of the index's total. *See* \"Constituents of Sectoral Indices valid from December 17, 2013 to March 17, 2014,\" available at http://moex.com/s933 (last accessed 4 July 2014).\n\nhttp://fs.moex.com/files/4032 (last accessed 4 July 2014).\n\nTranscript, Day 12 at 67-68 (Professor Dow); Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 260.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 134, n.282 (carrying forward a valuation of certain Yukos assets from November 2007 to December 2005); Second Dow Report \u00b6 519 and Appendix 15.2 (carrying forward a valuation of Tomskneft and Samareneftegaz from November 2007 to May 2007); Appendix 28.3 (carrying forward a valuation of certain Yukos assets from November 2007 to December 2004).\n\n1789.\n\nIn order to determine the value of Yukos on each of the two valuation dates, the Tribunal will now adjust Yukos' value as of 21 November 2007 (USD 61,076 billion) by multiplying it by a factor that reflects the change in the RTS Oil and Gas index between 21 November 2007 and each of the two valuation dates. This adjustment factor is calculated and applied for each of the two valuation dates in subections 5(a) and 5(b) below.\n\n1790.\n\nHaving explained the Tribunal's methodology in respect of the first head of damage (the valuation of Yukos on each of the valuation dates), the Tribunal will now explain the basis on which it has determined the value of \"lost\" dividends, namely the dividends that would likely have been paid to Claimants, in the \"but for\" scenario, prior to each of the valuation dates.\n\n**(b) Valuation of Lost Dividends**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1791.\n\nA second element of the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of Respondent's expropriation of their investment is the loss of dividends that would otherwise have been paid to them as Yukos shareholders. For each valuation calculated as of the two valuation dates, the Tribunal must determine the value of the lost dividends up to each date, since the value of Yukos as of that date, while it captures the expectations of future profit, does not capture any of the past profit that the company would likely have generated.\n\n1792.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the two valuation dates are the date of the YNG auction (19 December 2004) and the date of this Award (deemed to be 30 June 2014 for valuation purposes). For the first valuation date, the Tribunal must therefore determine the value of the lost dividends up to 19 December 2004; for the second valuation date, the Tribunal must determine the value of the lost dividends up to 30 June 2014.\n\n1793.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal's analysis are the \"Yukos lost cash flows\" (*i.e.*, free cash flow to equity) that Claimants' expert calculated with respect to his valuation of Claimants' damages. In his first report, Mr. Kaczmarek values Yukos as of 21 November 2007 only, and therefore produces a model of \"lost cash flows\" that does not extend beyond that date.2384 The \"lost cash flows\" between 2004 and 21 November 2007 are presented as being based on actual historical information, as opposed to the cash flows included in Mr. Kaczmarek's DCF model for the period 21 November 2007 through the end of 2015, which are based on forecasts and projections built up from information available prior to the period.2385\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report, Appendix J.1.\n\n*Ibid*., Appendix J.2.\n\n1794.\n\nIn his second report, Mr. Kaczmarek updates his valuation of Yukos as of November 2007 (including his presentation of \"lost cash flows\" to that date),2386 but also presents, for the first time, a valuation of Yukos as of 1 January 2012 (as a proxy for the valuation of Yukos as of the date of the Award).2387 For purposes of the valuation as of 1 January 2012, Mr. Kaczmarek produces a model of \"lost cash flows\" that extends from 2004 through to the end of 2011.2388 The \"lost cash flows\" between 2004 and 2011 are presented as being based on actual historical information, as opposed to the cash flows included in Mr. Kaczmarek's DCF model for the period 2012 through the end of 2019, which are based on forecasts and projections built up from information available prior to the period.2389\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendix J.1-updated.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 155.\n\n*Ibid*., Appendix AJ.1.\n\n*Ibid*., Appendix AJ.2.\n\n1795.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that no free cash flow to equity figures are provided by Claimants' expert for the years 2012 to 2014. While Claimants offered to update their damages calculations at a date closer to the Award,2390 the Tribunal has been able to establish the relevant figures on the basis of Mr. Kaczmarek's methodology, using data provided elsewhere in Mr. Kaczmarek's reports. The Tribunal's calculations are set out in Tables T4 to T6, attached to the Award, and explained in greater detail in the following paragraphs.\n\nReply \u00b6 946; Second Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 155.\n\n1796.\n\nTo calculate Yukos' free cash flow to equity, Mr. Kaczmarek uses the following formula: Free cash flow to equity = Free cash flow to the firm - Tax-adjusted interest payments + Change in net debt + 20 percent of Sibneft dividends.2391 Mr. Kaczmarek provides figures regarding the free cash flow to the firm and the tax-adjusted interest payments for the relevant time period in Appendix AJ.2 to his second report.2392 In addition, in note (5) to Appendix AJ.1 to his second report, Mr. Kaczmarek defines Yukos' annual change in net debt as the annual change in Yukos' long-term debt plus its short-term debt less its cash.2393 Mr. Kaczmarek provides these figures in Appendix AJ.4 to his second report.2394 With regard to the Sibneft dividends, Mr. Kaczmarek provides figures for years 2004 through 2011 in Appendix AJ.1 to his second report.2395 For the years 2012 through 2014, the Tribunal has assumed that the Sibneft dividends would have been equal to those paid in 2010, the last year for which Mr. Kaczmarek has provided an annual figure (his figure for 2011 being based on annualized third quarter figures).\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.1.\n\nTables T4 and T5 attached to the Award.\n\nTable T5 attached to the Award.\n\nTable T6 attached to the Award.\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.1.\n\n1797.\n\nWith these additional numbers calculated by the Tribunal, on the basis of data and formulas set out in Mr. Kaczmarek's reports, the Tribunal is able to arrive at numbers for Yukos' \"lost cash flows\" (*i.e.*, free cash flows to equity) for the entire period extending from 2004 through 2014. The Tribunal then, in principle, has the input it needs in order to determine the lost dividends for each of the valuation dates: for the first valuation date (the date of the YNG auction), the Tribunal can therefore arrive at a value (based on Mr. Kaczmarek's model) for the lost dividends up to 19 December 2004; and for the second valuation date (the date of the Award), the Tribunal can also arrive at a value (based on Mr. Kaczmarek's model) of the lost dividends up to 30 June 2014. The Tribunal notes that the total amount of lost dividends, based on Mr. Kaczmarek's model, for the period from 2004 to 30 June 2014, is USD 67,213 billion.2396\n\nThe relevant calculations with regard to both dividends and interest are set out in Table T3 attached to this Award.\n\n1798.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, however, Claimants' calculation of Yukos' lost cash flows is merely a starting point for the Tribunal's determination of what it views as the correct estimate of the dividends that Claimants would have earned from Yukos in the \"but for\" scenario. As explained in the following paragraphs, several fundamental considerations lead the Tribunal to modify the calculations of Claimants' expert.\n\n1799.\n\nFirstly, although Yukos' lost cash flows determined by Mr. Kaczmarek are based in part on actual historical information (*i.e.*, largely information about the performance of Yukos' former assets disclosed by Rosneft in its financial reports),2397 the Tribunal is unable to dissociate them from Claimants' DCF model, which was convincingly criticized by Respondent's expert and its counsel.\n\n*See e.g.*, Second Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.8, nn.6-8 (which indicate that actual tariff rates and tax expenses, as reported by Rosneft, are used for the 2004-2011 period). *See also* Second Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.9, n.2 (which indicates that \"[f]or the period 2004-2011, the crude sales percentages are based on actual crude sales as reported by Rosneft and Lukoil\").\n\n1800.\n\nIn his second report, Professor Dow identifies and explains a \"series of errors\" embedded in Claimants' DCF valuation of Yukos.2398 His \"corrections\" of those errors result in a very substantial reduction (51 percent) in the valuation of Yukos generated by the DCF model. Although not all of those \"corrections\" apply to the cash flows discussed above, which are based in part on actual historical information (and thus are not plagued by some of the errors associated with forecasts and projections), some of the \"corrections\"\u2014notably those related to the interpretation of the historical information\u2014in the view of the Tribunal, do impact the cash flows.\n\nSecond Dow Report \u00b6\u00b6 237-317.\n\n1801.\n\nFor example, the Tribunal accepts Professor Dow's opinion that Claimants have underestimated Yukos' transportation costs (by implicitly assuming that, in the \"but for\" scenario, \"Yukos would have been able to capture the efficiencies of Rosneft's proprietary pipeline network\").2399 The Tribunal also accepts Professor Dow's opinion that Claimants' model overlooks certain operating expenses of Yukos, thus evidencing a \"basic flaw\" in Claimants' DCF model, namely that there is \"no systematic attempt\" to ensure that all of Yukos' costs have been accounted for.2400\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 256.\n\n*Ibid*. \u00b6 277.\n\n1802.\n\nAlthough, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to accept all of Professor Dow's \"corrections\" for purposes of the valuation of the dividends, the Tribunal notes that the spreadsheets submitted by Respondent's expert with his Second Report allow the Tribunal to calculate \"corrected\" free cash flow to equity figures for the relevant years.2401 While Respondent's expert has not explicitly endorsed this \"corrected\" version as representing his views with regard to Yukos' free cash flow to equity, it is evident to the Tribunal that it represents a figure that is more in line with his views. According to this \"corrected\" methodology, Yukos' dividends in 2004 would have been USD 3,218 billion (instead of USD 3,645 billion), and the sum of Yukos' dividends over the period from 2004 through the first half of 2014 would have been USD 49,293 billion (instead of USD 67,213).2402\n\nSecond Dow Report, Appendix 1 (in Excel format). The results obtained by switching the values in the \"Corrected?\" column on the first sheet of Appendix 1 (Appendix 1.1) from 0 to 1 (meaning that the corrections are applied) in sheets 2 and 3 (Appendix J.1 and Appendix J.2) are reproduced in Annex A1 to this Award.\n\nThe relevant calculations with regard to both dividends and interest are set out in Table T3 attached to this Award.\n\n1803.\n\nThe Tribunal has formed the view that Professor Dow's corrections, however, do not take into account all the risks that Yukos would have had to contend with in carrying on business during the period 2004 through to the present if the company had not been expropriated. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that \"an expropriation relieves the owner not only of the value of the asset on the date of expropriation, but also of the risk associated with owning it.\"2403 Accordingly, in any model of the cash flows that would have been generated by Yukos had it not been expropriated (*i.e.*, the cash flows in a \"but for\" scenario), it is necessary to take into account the risks to those cash flows that were eliminated by the expropriation. Those risks must be factored back into the cash flow model in the \"but for\" scenario.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 239.\n\n1804.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Mr. Kaczmarek's cash flow model does not factor in those risks in his calculations. To the contrary, Mr. Kaczmarek models Yukos' financial performance after the date of expropriation based, in large measure, on the results achieved by Yukos' assets *in the hands of Rosneft*.2404 As Respondent rightly submits, \"Mr. Kaczmarek effectively valued Yukos as if it were a State-owned strategic enterprise, which it never was.\"2405\n\nSecond Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ and related Appendices.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 242.\n\n1805.\n\nThe first significant risk that, in the Tribunal's view, is not adequately accounted for in the cash flow models of either expert is the real risk of substantially higher taxes. Since taxes other than income taxes (also referred to as \"non-income taxes\") consistently account for well over 50 percent of Yukos' net income from year to year,2406 Yukos' cash flows could be significantly affected by any increases in the tariffs and rates relating to the non-income taxes.2407 In Mr. Kaczmarek's model, the taxes that are established annually by legislation (such as the export customs duty and domestic excise tax for refined products) are based on actual historical data (if available) and, for the forecast period, are based on the prior year's tax rate plus an adjustment to account for annual inflation.2408 In other words, there is no accounting for the possibility\u2014even likelihood\u2014that had Yukos remained in private hands, the State would have increased taxes, perhaps even substantially, in order to capture a greater share of the rent earned from the exploitation of Russia's natural resources. Yet, the record shows that this is precisely what the Russian Federation did in 2002 and 2003, when Yukos was still in private hands. In paragraph 188 of his first report, for example, Mr. Kaczmarek explains that large tax increases in 2002 and 2003 caused surging profits at Yukos to level off during that period.2409\n\n*See* line items for \"taxes other than income tax\" and \"net income\" in Second Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.3.\n\n*See* breakdown of Yukos' non-income taxes (including crude oil unified mineral extraction tax, export customs duties, and various excise taxes) and associated tariffs and rates. Second Kaczmarek Report, Appendix AJ.8.\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 259.\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 188.\n\n1806.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that Yukos, in its 2002 Annual Report, disclosed the following concerns about taxation:\n\nWe are subject to numerous taxes that have had a significant effect on our results of operations. Russian tax legislation is and has been subject to varying interpretations and frequent changes.2410\n\n\u2026\n\nIn the context of the significant regulatory changes related to Russia's transition from a centrally planned to a market economy over the past 10 years and the general instability of the new market institutions introduced in connection with this transition, taxes, tax rates and implementation of taxation in Russia have experienced numerous changes. Although there are signs of improved political stability in Russia, further changes to the tax system may be introduced which may adversely affect the financial performance of our Company. In addition, uncertainty related to Russian tax laws exposes us to enforcement measures and the risk of significant fines and could result in a greater than expected tax burden.2411\n\nYukos Annual Report, 2002, p. 81, Exh. C-26.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 84.\n\n1807.\n\nThe 2002 Annual Report also alerted the Yukos shareholders to risks related to the Company's dividend policy:\n\nReserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the statutory accounting reports of YUKOS Oil Company, which are prepared in accordance with Regulations on Accounting and Reporting of the Russian Federation and which differ from U.S. GAAP. Russian legislation identifies the basis of distribution as net income. For 2002, the current year statutory net income for YUKOS Oil Company as reported in the annual statutory accounting reports was RR 40,701 million. However, current legislation and other statutory laws and regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation and, consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ from the amount disclosed.2412\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 58.\n\n1808.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most significantly, there are the risks associated with the complex and opaque structure set up by Claimants, or by others on their behalf, in order to transfer money earned by Yukos out of the Russian Federation through a vast offshore structure. This structure is well documented in the reports of Professor Lys. An organizational chart attached as an appendix to a letter from PwC Cyprus to PwC Moscow dated 10 April 2003 shows the complexity of the structure as of that date, and the fact that Yukos' control over it was established by means of call options.2413 With this structure, Yukos was able to consolidate the profits of the trading companies and offshore holding companies (entities within its \"consolidation perimeter\") into its results while remaining \"free to segregate these profits from minority shareholder claims whenever it served the majority shareholders' or management's interests.\"2414\n\nExh. R-3165, p. 5. The Tribunal has included a copy of the chart in Annex A2 to this Award. *See also* Second Lys Report, Appendix F.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 258.\n\n1809.\n\nAs Respondent rightly points out, Yukos' claim of corporate governance reforms, Western standards of transparency and protection of minority interests, which Mr. Kaczmarek highlighted in his first report2415 (and which was a recurring theme heard from Claimants in this case), \"was a fa\u00e7ade.\"2416 Notably, even the company's President, Mr. Theede, testified that they had no knowledge that Yukos was using offshore structures that it did not own.2417\n\nFirst Kaczmarek Report \u00b6 156.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief \u00b6 260.\n\nTranscript, Day 11 at 59. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, the Chairman of the Board's Audit Committee, acknowledged that he had no opinion, and had made no enquries, as to whether Yukos owned the low tax region entities (*see* Transcript, Day 4 at 60-61).\n\n1810.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that even after the tax assessments at issue in the present arbitration were issued, Claimants and their owners were able to divert money earned by Yukos out of Yukos, and into the two Stichtings,2418 and therefore away from the tax authorities. The Tribunal cannot exclude the possibility that, but for the expropriation, the very same mechanism would have been resorted to by Claimants under different circumstances to divert some of the money earned by Yukos.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 528-39. The Tribunal recalls that Claimants do not dispute that money was transferred into the Stichtings. *See* above at \u00b6\u00b6 1054-60, 1124.\n\n1811.\n\nIn light of all the circumstances, and taking into account: (a) the figures based on Mr. Kaczmarek's calculations; (b) the figures based on Professor Dow's \"corrections\"; and (c) the additional risks described above, which the Tribunal finds must be factored into its damages analysis, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, concludes that it is appropriate to determine and fix the dividend payments that it assumes Yukos would have paid to its shareholders in the \"but for\" scenario in the amounts set out in the far right column of the following table (in USD billion):\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Year** | **Kaczmarek** | **Dow** | **Tribunal** |\n| 2004 | 3,645 | 3,218 | 2.5 |\n| 2005 | 4,796 | 4,489 | 3.5 |\n| 2006 | 4,677 | 4,396 | 3.5 |\n| 2007 | 8,484 | 7,670 | 6 |\n| 2008 | 7,819 | 6,749 | 6 |\n| 2009 | 7,642 | 5,463 | 5 |\n| 2010 | 4,254 | 4,842 | 3.5 |\n| 2011 | 6,285 | 4,283 | 4 |\n| 2012 | 8,395 | 3,724 | 5 |\n| 2013 | 7,628 | 3,148 | 4 |\n| 2014 (first half) | 3,586 | 1,310 | 2 |\n| Total | 67,213 | 49,293 | 45 |\n\n1812.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Yukos' dividends in 2004 would have been USD 2.5 billion, and the sum of Yukos' dividends over the period from 2004 through the first half of 2014 would have been USD 45 billion.2419\n\nThe relevant calculations with regard to both dividends and interest are set out in Table T3 attached to this Award.\n\n**5. Application of the Methodology Followed by the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1813.\n\nThe Tribunal, applying the methodology outlined above to the two valuation dates of 19 December 2004 and 30 June 2014, can now proceed to the valuation of the expropriated company as of those two dates.2420\n\n*See* Table T1 annexed to this Award.\n\n**(a) Calculations Based on 19 December 2004 Valuation Date**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1814.\n\nThe damages suffered by Claimants based on a valuation date of 19 December 2004 are determined as follows.\n\n**i. Valuation of Shares in Yukos**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1815.\n\nAs explained earlier, the Tribunal will determine the equity value of Yukos as of 19 December 2004 by adjusting what it considers, based on the Parties' submissions, to be the best available estimate of this value as of 21 November 2007, *i.e.*, an amount of USD 61,076 billion, with a factor that reflects the development of the RTS Oil and Gas index between 19 December 2004 and 21 November 2007. The value of the RTS Oil and Gas index on 19 December 2004 was 92.85, whereas on 21 November 2007 it had a value of 267.8. The adjustment factor to be applied to determine Yukos' value as of the earlier date is therefore x=92.85/267.8=0.3467. By applying this factor to the amount of USD 61,076 billion, the Tribunal arrives at an equity value of Yukos as of 19 December 2004 in the amount of USD 21,176 billion.2421\n\n*See* Table T2 annexed to this Award.\n\n1816.\n\nThe value of Claimants' 70.5 percent share in Yukos, calculated as a pro rata share of this amount, corresponds to USD (70.5/100)\\*21,176=14.929 billion.\n\n**ii. Dividends**\n-----------------\n\n1817.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal's methodology outlined above, the dividends that would have been paid to Yukos' shareholders throughout 2004 will be assumed to be USD 2.5 billion. Since the valuation date is 19 December 2004, there are 12 days missing for the full year which must be taken into consideration. Accordingly, this amount must be multiplied by a factor x=(365-12)/365, corresponding to approximately 97 percent. This gives a total amount of free cash flow to equity based on a valuation date of 19 December 2004 of USD 2,418 billion. Claimants' share of this amount corresponds to dividends of USD (70.5/100)\\*2,418=1.705 billion.\n\n**iii. Interest**\n-----------------\n\n1818.\n\nBy applying an annual interest rate of 3,389 percent,2422 the total amount of interest payable on the equity value of Yukos and the dividends that would have been paid to its shareholders from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2014 is 7,596 billion.2423 The total amount of interest payable to Claimants on this basis is 70.5 percent of this figure, *i.e.*, USD 5,355 billion.\n\n*See* Part XI. The Tribunal has assumed that dividends would have been paid in each case at the end of the relevant year and that interest would have started accruing at the determined pre-award interest rate from 1 January of the year thereafter.\n\nTo avoid unnecessarily complicating the calculations, this figure does not take into account interest for the period from 19 to 31 December 2004. Adding this interest would not affect the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\n**iv. Total Damages Suffered by Claimants**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1819.\n\nThe damages suffered by Claimants due to the breach by Respondent of Article 13 of the ECT based on a 19 December 2004 valuation date is the sum of the Claimants' share of these components calculated above, *i.e.*, 70.5 percent of (21,176 + 2,418 + 7,596), which amounts to USD 21,988 billion.2424\n\n*See* Table T1 annexed to this Award. Claimants' shareholdings in Yukos, as percentages of Yukos Issued Shares, were 48.72 percent, 2.25 percent and 10 percent for Hulley, YUL and VPL, respectively. Interim Awards \u00b6 419 (Hulley); \u00b6 419 (YUL); \u00b6 419 (VPL). In absolute numbers, out of a total number of 2,236,964.578 Issued Shares, Hulley held 1,090,043.968 shares, YUL held 50,340,995 shares and VPL held 223,699,175 shares, while 302,000,000 shares were Treasury Shares. First Kaczmarek Report, Appendix C.5.b. This translates into a total number of 1,934,964.578 Outstanding Shares, of which 56.33405 percent, 2.60165 percent and 11.56089 percent were held by Hulley, YUL and VPL, respectively. The exact combined share of Claimants in Yukos Outstanding Shares was 70.49659 percent.\n\n**(b) Calculations Based on 2014 Valuation Date**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1820.\n\nThe damages suffered by Claimants based on a valuation date of 30 June 2014 are determined as follows.\n\n**i. Valuation of Claimants' Share in Yukos**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1821.\n\nAs for the calculations based on the date of the expropriation, the Tribunal will determine the equity value of Yukos as of 30 June 2014 by adjusting what it considers, based on the Parties' submissions, the best available estimate of this value as of 21 November 2007, *i.e.*, the amount of USD 61,076 billion, with a factor that reflects the development of the RTS Oil and Gas index between 21 November 2007 and 30 June 2014. For practical purposes, and in order to eliminate the effects of random fluctuations of the index on the amount to be awarded, the Tribunal has chosen to use the average of the values of the index over the period from 6 January 2014 to 24 June 2014 as the basis for its calculations. This average value of the RTS Oil and Gas index is 186.90.2425 The adjustment factor to be applied to determine Yukos' value as of the later date is therefore x=186.90/267.8=69.79 percent. By applying this factor to the amount of USD 61,076 billion the Tribunal arrives at an equity value of Yukos as of 30 June 2014 in the amount of USD 42,625 billion.2426\n\n*See* Table T8 annexed to this Award.\n\n*See* Table T2 annexed to this Award.\n\n1822.\n\nThe value of Claimants' 70.5 percent share in Yukos, calculated as a pro rata share of this amount, corresponds to USD (70.5/100)\\*42,625=30.049 billion.\n\n**ii. Dividends and Interest on Dividends**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1823.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal's methodology outlined earlier, the dividends that would have been paid to Yukos' shareholders from the beginning of 2004 to 30 June 2014 will be assumed to correspond to USD 45 billion. Together with interest, the total amount for this period is USD 51,981 billion.2427\n\n*See* Table T3 annexed to this Award.\n\n1824.\n\nClaimants' share of this amount corresponds to USD (70.5/100)\\*51,981=36.645 billion.\n\n**iii. Total Damages Suffered by Claimants**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1825.\n\nThe damages suffered by Claimants due to the breach by Respondent of Article 13 of the ECT, based on a valuation date of 30 June 2014, is the sum of the Claimants' share of the two components calculated above, *i.e.*, 70.5 percent of (42,625 + 51,981), which amounts to USD 66,694 billion.2428\n\n*See* Table T1 annexed to this Award.\n\n**(c) Comparison of the Results Based on the Two Different Valuation Dates**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1826.\n\nThe total amount of Claimants' damages based on a valuation date of 19 December 2004 is USD 21,988 billion, whereas the total amount of their damages based on a valuation date of 30 June 2014 is USD 66,694 billion. Since the Tribunal has concluded earlier that Claimants are entitled to the higher of these two amounts, the total amount of damages to be awarded before taking into account any deductions necessary as a consequence of Claimants' contributory fault is USD 66,694 billion.\n\n**6. Deductions Due to Claimants' Contributory Fault**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1827.\n\nAs determined earlier,2429 the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants contributed to the extent of 25 percent to the prejudice they suffered at the hands of the Russian Federation. As a consequence, the amount of damages to be paid by Respondent to Claimants will be reduced by 25 percent to USD 50,020,867.798 and the Tribunal so finds.2430\n\n*See* Section X.E.4.\n\nClaimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows: EUR 39,971,834.360 (Hulley), EUR 1,846,000.687 (YUL) and EUR 8,203,032.751 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92 above, post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.\n\n**7. Windfall and Double Recovery**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1828.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to make any further deductions beyond those set out above. In particular, any advantages that Claimants may have obtained through their investments prior to Respondent's expropriatory actions can not have any impact on the damages they have suffered. The Tribunal sees no risk of \"double-recovery\" in this regard.\n\n1829.\n\nFinally, the rate of return that Claimants may realize on their original investment in Yukos as a result of the damages that the Tribunal has awarded to them for the expropriation of their shares is irrelevant. It is the value of the expropriated investment on the date of the Award rather than the amount originally invested by Claimants that is the basis for the calculation of the damages awarded.\n\n**XIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1830.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants and Respondent have each requested that the opposing party be ordered to pay the full costs of the arbitration.2431\n\nReply \u00b6 1199(5); Rejoinder \u00b6 1748(v).\n\n1831.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party.2432\n\nAs opposed to the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a dispute between Contracting Parties, which is addressed in Article 27(3)(j) as follows: \"The expenses of the tribunal, including the remuneration of its members, shall be borne in equal shares by the Contracting Parties parties to the dispute. The tribunal may, however, at its discretion direct that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Contracting Parties parties to the dispute.\"\n\n1832.\n\nHowever, Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules do provide the Tribunal with guidelines with respect to the allocation of costs in arbitration.\n\n1833.\n\nArticle 38 defines the \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n1834.\n\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules set out the guidelines which will inform the Tribunal in its determination of the apportionment of costs. They read as follows:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n1835.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the Tribunal requested the Parties to file their claims for costs with appropriate schedules by 17 April 2014 and to submit comments on the opposing Party's claims by 6 May 2014. The Tribunal wrote:\n\nThe Parties are requested to present their claims with schedules showing a breakdown of costs for legal representation and assistance, including lawyers' fees, experts' fees and other costs associated with presenting their case. The breakdown of lawyers' fees should indicate the number of attorneys (together with charge out rates) and the amount of time involved in the discrete phases of these proceedings (Phase 1 being the period up to the Interim Awards; Phase 2 being the period after the Interim Awards). It is expected that the breakdowns should be in sufficient detail for the Tribunal to appreciate the work in respect of which the costs were incurred.\n\n1836.\n\nAs requested, the Parties filed their cost claims on 17 April 2014 and submitted comments on the opposing side's cost claims on 6 May 2014.\n\n**B. CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants are Entitled to Recover All Costs Incurred in Connection with these Arbitrations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1837.\n\nClaimants note that Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules \"establishes two approaches with respect to costs.\"2433 Firstly, Article 40(1) establishes a \"clear presumption\" that the losing party pays all costs referred to in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f)\u2014\"loser pays\" or \"costs follow the event.\"2434 Secondly, Article 40(2) requires that, when allocating costs for legal representation referred to in Article 38(e), tribunals take into account \"the circumstances of the case.\"2435\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 4.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 5.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 6.\n\n1838.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent should bear all costs set out in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f), namely the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA (including those of the PCA's Secretary-General).\n\n1839.\n\nClaimants aver that Respondent was the unsuccessful party in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase. Claimants assert that they \"prevailed on every single issue that was finally decided in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of these arbitrations.\"2436 They consider that Respondent should bear the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA related to that phase.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 10.\n\n1840.\n\nClaimants submit that they should prevail at the merits stage as well and that Respondent should bear the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA related to that phase.2437\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 11.\n\n1841.\n\nAccording to Claimants, no circumstances in this case require the Tribunal to depart from the starting point of \"costs follow the event\"; to the contrary, they argue, the circumstances in this case \"only further necessitate\" an order of costs in favour of Claimants.2438\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 12.\n\n1842.\n\nClaimants submit that, taking into account the circumstances of the case\u2014and in particular the Parties' success in the arbitrations, their conduct during the proceedings, and the actual measures of Respondent which gave rise to the dispute\u2014Respondent should bear all of Claimants' costs of legal representation and assistance.\n\n1843.\n\nClaimants contend that where the investor prevails in an investor-State arbitration, an order that the State pay the investor's costs of legal representation is based on the principle of reparation, which mandates that the investor be fully compensated for its losses, including those incurred as a result of having to litigate.2439\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6\u00b6 17-19 (quoting *Gemplus* \u00b6\u00b6 17-21-17-22, Exh.

C-945.\n\n1844.\n\nAccording to Claimants:\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent's approach to these proceedings has been to raise (and re-raise) as many objections, arguments and issues as possible, no matter how irrelevant or implausible they may be, in the hopes of delaying the proceedings and somehow burying or obfuscating the straightforward facts of the case.2440\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 22.\n\n1845.\n\nClaimants opine that Respondent's \"obstructionist conduct\" in this case should lead the Tribunal to order it to pay all costs of legal representation.2441\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6\u00b6 22, 52-53. Claimants list what they term Respondent's \"constant attempts to extend deadlines and otherwise prolong or disrupt the proceedings\" (\u00b6\u00b6 23-31), \"deliberate attempts to withhold evidence\" (\u00b6\u00b6 32-39), \"manifest disregard for the Arbitral Tribunal's orders\" (\u00b6\u00b6 40-41), \"renewed and abandoned jurisdiction and admissibility objections\" (\u00b6\u00b6 42-48), and \"overly burdensome, disorganized and fundamentally misleading presentation of its case\" (\u00b6\u00b6 49-51).\n\n1846.\n\nClaimants submit that \"in no other case has the need to take into account the underlying conduct of the host State been more relevant than in these arbitrations.\"2442 Claimants argue that Respondent's conduct \"has been decried by every single court or tribunal, organization, and independent observer outside Russia\" and \"must be sanctioned in full.\"2443\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs \u00b6 54 (referring to *Deutsche Bank AG v.

Claimants' Comments on Respondent's Submission on Costs**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1851.\n\nClaimants summarize their comments on Respondent's Submission on Costs as follows:\n\nRespondent has elected not to provide a \"breakdown of costs\", as directed by the Arbitral Tribunal. Its so-called \"Schedule of Costs\" cannot in any way facilitate the Tribunal's task in reaching its decision on costs, including in assessing the reasonableness of either of the Parties' claimed amounts. Moreover, the Respondent's argument that each Party should bear its own costs is based on a flawed presentation of investment treaty case law and a blatantly self-serving description of the Respondent's conduct throughout these arbitrations. At the same time, the Respondent's position speaks volumes as to its true conviction (or lack thereof) in its defenses to the Claimants' claims. Had the Respondent truly believed that the Claimants, Yukos and/or related persons and entities had engaged in large-scale criminal conduct\u2014ranging from embezzlement and money laundering to tax fraud and even murder\u2014it would have insisted that its full costs be shouldered by the Claimants, instead of proposing, as it has done now, that it bear its own costs in defending the Claimants' claims.2448\n\nClaimants' Comments on Respondent's Submission on Costs dated 6 May 2014, p. 1.\n\n1852.\n\nClaimants assert that comparing the comprehensive presentation of their costs for legal representation with Respondent's \"opaque\" Schedule of Costs would be \"akin to comparing apples and oranges.\"2449 Even then, Claimants maintain that their costs would still be reasonable. In particular, Claimants note that \"in ordering respondent States to bear investors' costs, investment treaty tribunals have found that it is not unusual for claimants' costs to be higher than those of respondents, given that, *inter alia*, the burden of proof generally falls on claimants.\"2450\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 3.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 3 (referring to *ADC* \u00b6 535, Exh. C-980; *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, \u00b6 624, Exh. C-998.\n\n**C. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Equal Apportionment is an Appropriate Exercise of the Tribunal's Discretion onCosts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1853.\n\nRespondent notes that, while Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the costs referred to in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f) should \"in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party,\" it gives the Tribunal the discretion to \"apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\" Respondent asserts that Article 40(2) grants the Tribunal \"complete discretion\" in its apportionment of the Parties' costs of legal representation.2451\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs \u00b6 3.\n\n1854.\n\nRespondent argues that the following factors should inform the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion:\n\n(a) whether the dispute involved novel and complex questions of law and a long and complex procedure such that it would be unfair to penalize a non-prevailing party for maintaining its positions with an adverse costs award;\n\n(b) the constructive and professional conduct of the parties and their positive impact on the tribunal's settlement of the dispute, which militates in favor of equal apportionment of costs;\n\n(c) any bad faith, unreasonable or unnecessarily burdensome conduct of a party for which the other party should be compensated;\n\n(d) whether the non-prevailing party succeeds in some respects during the arbitration with legal, factual or procedural arguments, making it inappropriate to award the ultimately successful party its costs; and\n\n(e) the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism and the traditional position under public international law and in investor-state arbitration that parties \"bear their own costs of legal representation and assistance.\"2452\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 4 (footnotes omitted).\n\n1855.\n\nRespondent submits that, in light of the above-mentioned factors, the \"appropriate approach here is for each side to bear its own costs.\"2453 Further:\n\nIf, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal decides that equal apportionment of costs in these cases is not appropriate, and that the costs incurred by the prevailing party should be borne by the unsuccessful party, Respondent would then request that Claimants should bear Respondent's costs based upon the relative success of the parties in these arbitrations on issues of jurisdiction, the merits and Claimants' demand for damages. It is clear from the Procedural Orders issued throughout the proceedings and from the Interim Awards on Jurisdiction and Admissibility that neither side has been fully successful.2454\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6 9.\n\n**2.

TRIBUNAL'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Fixing and Allocation of Costs of the Arbitration Pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1859.\n\nThe Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 8,440,000 to cover the costs of the arbitration; EUR 4,240,000 by Claimants and EUR 4,200,000 by Respondent.2463 In determining the amount of its members' fees, the Tribunal has taken account of Article 39(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which \"[t]he fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.\"\n\nOver the course of the proceedings, the Parties contributed in equal shares to the deposits. In July 2014, the Tribunal requested a final supplementary deposit of EUR 40,000 and invited either Party to cover the full amount in advance of issuance of the Final Awards, which Claimants accepted to do.\n\n1860.\n\nThe fees of Mr. Daniel Price, the arbitrator initially appointed by Claimants, amount to EUR 103,537.50. Mr. Price's expenses amount to EUR 3,678.99. The fees of Dr. Charles Poncet, the arbitrator appointed by Claimants following the resignation of Mr. Price, amount to EUR 1,513,880. Dr. Poncet's expenses amount to EUR 85,549.64.\n\n1861.\n\nThe fees of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, the arbitrator appointed by Respondent, amount to EUR 2,011,092.66. His expenses amount to EUR 51,927.29.\n\n1862.\n\nThe fees of The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, PC CC OQ QC, the Chairman, amount to EUR 1,732,937.50. The Chairman's expenses amount to EUR 51,782.24.\n\n1863.\n\nThe fees of Mr. Martin J. Valasek, the Assistant to the Tribunal, amount to EUR 970,562.50. Mr. Valasek's expenses amount to EUR 51,718.96.\n\n1864.\n\nPursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the PCA Secretary-General served as the Appointing Authority, and the International Bureau of the PCA was designated to act as Registry in these arbitrations. The PCA's fees for its services amount to EUR 866,552.60.\n\n1865.\n\nOther tribunal costs, including court reporters, interpreters, hearing rooms, meeting facilities, travel and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to EUR 996,780.12.\n\n1866.\n\nAccordingly, the costs of the arbitration, including all items set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, amount to EUR 8,440,000 for the jurisdiction and merit phases.\n\n1867.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls again the terms of Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules:\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n1868.\n\nThe costs are therefore to be awarded to the successful party and against the unsuccessful party, unless the circumstances of the case justify a different approach.\n\n1869.\n\nIn the present proceedings, it is clear that Claimants have prevailed and been successful in both the jurisdiction and merits phases. The Tribunal can see no reason why Respondent, the unsuccessful party, should not bear the costs of the arbitration, EUR 8,440,000, and it so orders Respondent to bear such costs and to reimburse the contributions that Claimants deposited in the amount of EUR 4,240,000.2464\n\nClaimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows: EUR 3,388,197 (Hulley), EUR 156,476 (YUL) and EUR 695,327 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92 above, post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.\n\n1870.\n\nThere is no unexpended balance on deposit.\n\n**2. Fixing and Allocation of Costs for Legal Representation and Assistance of the Parties Pursuant to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1871.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls again the terms of Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules:\n\nWith respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n1872.\n\nParagraph (e) of Article 38 provides that the term \"costs\" includes:\n\nThe costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable.\n\n1873.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Claimants' costs for their legal representation and the assistance of their experts amount to USD 79,628,055.56 plus an additional GBP 1,066,462.10, which, Claimants submit, are \"reasonable\" taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n1874.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, provides the Tribunal with a schedule indicating the \"types of costs\" incurred by Respondent in its defence. It presents a \"total\" figure of USD 27,000,000 which does not adequately assist the Tribunal in assessing the reasonableness of the Parties' respective costs.\n\n**3. Conclusion on the Award of Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1875.\n\nIt is well established that an UNCITRAL tribunal such as the present one has the unfettered discretion to fix and to decide in what proportion the costs for legal representation and assistance of the parties shall be borne by the Parties.\n\n1876.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has formed the view that Claimants, the successful Party, should be awarded a significant portion of their costs of legal representation and assistance. The Tribunal now has to determine the portion which it considers reasonable. In determining this reasonable portion, the Tribunal takes into account a number of relevant factors. The Tribunal will now proceed to review some of the factors which it considers particularly relevant in the instant case.\n\n1877.\n\nClaimants, in their prayer for relief, asked the Tribunal to order Respondent to pay to Claimants damages of more than USD 100 billion.\n\n1878.\n\nThe stakes were high and, if Claimants were thorough and vigorous in pressing their claims, Respondent was no less thorough and vigorous in presenting its defences.\n\n1879.\n\nThe thousands of pages of written pleadings and exhibits submitted by the Parties, the myriad requests for production of documents, the Tribunal's lengthy procedural orders, the ten days of hearings in The Hague in the fall of 2008 on Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, the 21 days of Hearings on the Merits in The Hague in the fall of 2013, all demonstrate the importance which both sides attached to this arbitration.\n\n1880.\n\nThe Parties litigated vigorously. Each Party was represented by eminent counsel. The quality of the written and oral pleadings was outstanding. Counsel of both Parties are commended for their high professionalism.\n\n1881.\n\nIn the circumstances, it is unsurprising that the cost submissions of the Parties, as to their amounts, should reflect the very considerable work which each Party was required to expend in order to, on the one hand, press its claims and, on the other hand, defend itself.\n\n1882.\n\nIt also is not surprising that Claimants' costs in this case should be higher than those of Respondent since they bore the burden of proof for their claims under the ECT and produced many fact witnesses in the Hearing on the Merits whereas Respondent produced no fact witness.\n\n1883.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that some of the fees of Claimants' experts are \"plainly excessive\".\n\n1884.\n\nAnother factor which the Tribunal considers relevant in fixing the costs of Claimants which should be borne by Respondent is the fact that, at the end of the day, Claimants' experts were of limited assistance to the Tribunal in its determination of Claimants' damages.\n\n1885.\n\nEven if Claimants were successful in asserting the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Respondent, in prevailing on the liability of Respondent and being awarded an immense sum in damages, at the end of the day, as was seen in Part XII, the damages awarded to Claimants were reduced significantly by the Tribunal from the claims advanced by them.\n\n1886.\n\nFinally, a factor which the Tribunal has considered particularly relevant in fixing the portion of their costs which Claimants should be awarded is the egregious nature of many measures of Respondent which the Tribunal has found were in breach of the ECT.\n\n1887.\n\nHaving scrutinized the costs for legal representation and assistance of Claimants and taking into consideration all the factors traversed above, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, considers that reimbursement by Respondent to Claimants of USD 60,000,000 as part of their costs would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances and it so orders.2465 The Tribunal notes that USD 60,000,000 is approximately 75 percent of Claimants' grand total of costs for the jurisdiction and merits phases, namely USD 79,628,055.56 and GBP 1,066,462.10.\n\nClaimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows: EUR 47,946,190 (Hulley), EUR 2,214,277 (YUL) and EUR 9,839,533 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92 above, post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.\n\n**XIV. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n1888.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously:\n\n(a) DISMISSES the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility, based on Article 21 of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n(b) DISMISSES the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility, pertaining to Respondent's contentions concerning \"unclean hands\" and \"illegal and bad faith conduct\";\n\n(c) DISMISSES the renewed objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n(d) HOLDS that the present dispute is admissible and within the Tribunal's jurisdiction;\n\n(e) DECLARES that Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\n(f) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant Yukos Universal Limited damages in the amount of USD 1,846,000.687;\n\n(g) ORDERS Respondent to pay the amount of EUR 156,476 to Claimant Yukos Universal Limited as reimbursement for the costs of the arbitration;\n\n(h) ORDERS Respondent to pay the amount of USD 2,214,277 to Claimant Yukos Universal Limited for a portion of the costs of its legal representation and assistance in the arbitration proceedings; and\n\n(i) ORDERS Respondent to pay to Claimant Yukos Universal Limited, if within 180 days of the issuance of this Award Respondent fails to pay in full the amounts set forth in paragraphs (f), (g) and (h), above post-award interest on any outstanding amount starting from 15 January 2015, compounded annually. Post-award interest shall be determined as the yield on 10-year U.S. treasury bonds as of 15 January 2015 and then the dates of compounding yearly thereafter."}, {"Title": "Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2014-07-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights\n----------------------------------------------\n\nPROCEDURE\n---------\n\n1.\n\nThe case originated in an application (no. 14902/04) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (\"the Convention\") by OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos (\"the applicant company\"), on 23 April 2004.\n\n2.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on 20 September 2011 (\"the principal judgment\"), the Court held that in the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings the applicant company did not have sufficient time for preparation of the case at first instance and on appeal, in breach of Article 6 of the Convention (\u00a7\u00a7 534-551 of the principal judgment), that the assessment of the penalties relating to 2000 and the doubling of the penalties for 2001 were unlawful and in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (\u00a7\u00a7 563-575), and that in the enforcement proceedings against the applicant company the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim of these proceedings and the measures employed, in breach of the same Convention provision (\u00a7\u00a7 645-658). The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant company's complaints.\n\n3.\n\nUnder Article 41 of the Convention the applicant company sought just satisfaction of 37,981,000,000 euros (EUR) in respect of pecuniary damage and submitted that the judgment of 20 September 2011 constituted sufficient just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage. The applicant company further requested payment of 4,333,105 pounds sterling (GBP) and 762,148 dollars (USD) in respect of fees, costs and expenses.\n\n4.\n\nSince the question of the application of Article 41 of the Convention was not ready for decision, the Court reserved it and invited the Government and the applicant company to submit, within three months, their written observations on that issue and, in particular, to notify the Court of any agreement they might reach (ibid., \u00a7 671 of the principal judgment, and point 10 of the operative provisions).\n\n5.\n\nThe applicant company and the Government each filed written observations on 13 June 2012. Both parties submitted further written observations and then replied to each other's observations on 31 July 2012, 1 March and 15 May 2013.\n\n6.\n\nThe composition of the Chamber was determined according to the provisions of Article 23 \u00a7 3 of the Convention and Rule 26 \u00a7 4 of the Rules of Court. Pursuant to these provisions, Christos Rozakis, Nina Vaji\u0107, Sverre Erik Jebens and Giorgio Malinverni continued to sit in the case following the expiry of their terms of office.\n\nTHE LAW\n-------\n\n7.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention provides:\n\n\"If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.\"\n\n**A. Pecuniary damage**\n-----------------------\n\n*1. The parties' submissions*\n-----------------------------\n\n**(a) The applicant company's arguments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe applicant company took the view that the violations found by the Court in the principal judgment had resulted in considerable pecuniary losses. More specifically, the company would have survived had it not been for the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the enforcement proceedings, that is, had it not been required to sell its main production subsidiary OAO Yuganskneftegaz, and had it been given ninety days to repay each debt and been permitted to sell less valuable assets.\n\n9.\n\nWith reference to an expert report, the applicant company considered that the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the domestic authorities' failure in the enforcement proceedings to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim of these proceedings and the measures employed had led to the direct loss of EUR 37,981,000,000, representing the expert's assessment of the applicant company's value on 19 December 2004. The applicant company did not advance any claim for interest payments in connection with this sum.\n\n10.\n\nThe applicant company submitted that the causal link between the violations found and its loss of the stated value had been established. However, it conceded that the assumptions and conclusions in the expert report which valued its loss at the above-stated amount had differed to a certain extent from the Court's conclusions in its principal judgment.\n\n11.\n\nWith regard to the issue of the appropriate method of distributing the award, the applicant company asserted that, given that it had been liquidated in 2007 and in view of the Court's flexible practice in respect of the payment of awards under Article 41 of the Convention, the amount should be paid to the Yukos International Foundation. This entity was created in the Netherlands by the applicant company with a view to distributing \"after [the] payment of the creditors ... any funds received and to be received by it through a scheme to shareholders of Yukos Oil Company, in accordance with the applicable law and the principles of reasonableness and fairness\".\n\n**(b) The Government's arguments**\n----------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Government asked the Court to reject the applicant company's claim in full. They argued that no injured party remained in this case and that there was no need to award compensation, since, among other things, no financial loss arose from any violations found by the Court. In this latter respect, they took the view that the sale of OAO Yuganskneftegaz would have been necessary even if the State had used a more flexible approach to enforcement, as suggested by the Court in the principal judgment. The outcome of the enforcement proceedings would not have been different even had the enforcement fee been reduced and had the authorities carried out a full and reasoned assessment of the consequences of enforcement.\n\n13.\n\nIn respect of the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 with regard to the enforcement proceedings, the Government was of the view that at the relevant time the applicant company had simply been unable to pay its debts. The company's position was to deny the existence of any tax liabilities and to refuse payment. In such circumstances, even a reasoned review of all enforcement options would not have led to the applicant company being granted more time. The Government commented in detail on the relevant factors highlighted by the Court in the principal judgment and attached an expert report by the head counsel of the Russian bailiffs' service addressing these questions. The Government concluded that the outcome of the enforcement proceedings would have remained essentially the same.\n\n14.\n\nThe Government specifically disagreed with the working assumptions used by the expert report submitted by the applicant company. In their view, the report had mistakenly assumed increased oil production, in spite of the need to sell assets and to cut spending on investment; the report made no reduction to reflect the hasty circumstances of the sale of the applicant company's assets, and it also allowed the company excessively long time-limits for payment, unrelated to anything in domestic law or practice. The Government submitted their own expert report suggesting that the applicant company was worthless at the relevant time on account of the fraudulent nature of its tax management and the related legal risks. More generally, with reference to the case of *McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom* (27 September 1995, Series A no. 324), the Government suggested that, given the fraudulent nature, scale and seriousness of the domestic case against the applicant company, any pecuniary award would be inappropriate in the circumstances.\n\n15.\n\nAs regards the question of the possible recipient of a payment under Article 41 of the Convention, the Government pointed out that the applicant company no longer existed and that the entity referred to by the applicant company could not be a proper recipient, in that the Court had no jurisdiction to delegate to a third party the power to grant just satisfaction. They also pointed out that the beneficiaries of the Yukos International Foundation were anonymous, that there was a risk of double compensation because some of the applicant company's shareholders were pursuing legal proceedings in other venues, and that there was no guarantee that the interests of all shareholders would be reflected in the distribution of awards by this entity, rather than the interests of merely some of them, who were likely to be the \"least deserving\".\n\n16.\n\nIn this latter respect, the Government took the view that the possible payment of any award under Article 41 of the Convention, either directly or indirectly, to certain shareholders and managers who at the relevant time had instigated tax fraud by the applicant company and benefited from dividends paid out of tax fraud would not be just, fair and equitable. In the Government's view, the risk of possible abuse in the distribution of funds was real. They referred to an example of how one of the surviving entities created by the applicant company, which was registered in the Netherlands and similar in nature to the Yukos International Foundation, had paid out money to an affiliate of the former majority shareholder rather than distributing it to all of the shareholders.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the damage allegedly resulting from the Court's invalidation of the penalties, the Government suggested that this should not be compensated, since at the time of the applicant company's liquidation there remained a huge unpaid debt, including unpaid taxes. Even if the impugned penalties were to have been returned to the applicant company at the relevant time, the sums would then have had to be paid back to the State in order to cover the applicant company's debts of around USD 8 billion.\n\n*2. The Court's assessment*\n---------------------------\n\n**(a) Violation of Article 6 of the Convention**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAt the outset the Court would point out that in its principal judgment it found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the haste with which the domestic courts had conducted the 2000 Tax Assessment proceedings against the applicant company, both at first instance and on appeal. The Court cannot speculate as to what the outcome of these proceedings might have been had the violation of the Convention not occurred (see, for example, *Jalloh v. Germany* [GC], no. 54810/00, \u00a7 128, ECHR 2006-IX, and *Martinie v. France* [GC], no. 58675/00, \u00a7 59, ECHR 2006-VI).\n\n19.\n\nIt finds that there is insufficient proof of a causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage allegedly sustained by the applicant company. There is therefore no ground for an award in this respect.\n\n**(b) Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the retroactive imposition of the penalties for the years 2000 and 2001**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Court observes that in the principal judgment it concluded that the penalties in the 2000 Tax Assessment and certain of the penalties in the 2001 Tax Assessment were unlawful and in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The amounts in question, RUB 19,185,272,697 (approximately 543,623,045 euros) in respect of the year 2000, and RUB 19,556,570,413 (approximately 569,898,525 euros) in respect of the year 2001, were effectively paid by the applicant company during the enforcement proceedings and thus represented a clear pecuniary loss, which, in the Court's view, should be compensated under Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n21.\n\nDespite the Government's objections, the Court sees no good reasons to depart from the principle of *restitutio in integrum*, firmly established in its case-law, in assessing the amount of pecuniary compensation in the present case. In its principal judgment it found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 concerning the imposition of the penalties for the year 2000 and in part for the year 2001. The Court ruled that the penalties were unlawful as such, and did not represent an irregularity of a merely procedural nature (see, by contrast, *Former King of Greece and Others v. Greece* [GC] (just satisfaction), no. 25701/94, \u00a7\u00a7 78-79, 28 November 2002; and *Beyeler v. Italy* (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 33202/96, \u00a7 20, 28 May 2002).\n\n22.\n\nThe Court considers that the figure of RUB 38,741,843,110, representing the amount of penalties for the year 2000 and one half of the penalties for the year 2001 (see paragraph 20 above), was effectively paid by the applicant company on 12 November 2007 at the latest (see paragraph 303 of the principal judgment). This sum equalled EUR 1,078,246,919 at the conversion rate on that date.\n\n23.\n\nIn addition, the Court also recalls that the applicant company was compelled to pay the 7% enforcement fee in respect of the mentioned unlawful penalties. The Court decides that since it has declared the original penalties unlawful, the payment of the 7% enforcement fee in respect of these penalties was unlawful as well.\n\n24.\n\nThe Court notes in this connection that the applicant company was required to pay the enforcement fee of RUB 1,342,969,088.79 (approximately EUR 37,353,983) in respect of the penalties for the year 2000 and the enforcement fee of RUB 1,368,959,928.91 (approximately EUR 36,636,218) in respect of one half of the penalties for the year 2001, both sums having been effectively paid by the applicant company on 12 November 2007 at the latest (see paragraph 303 of the principal judgment).\n\n25.\n\nThese sums represented clear pecuniary losses sustained by the applicant company, in breach of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. They should thus be compensated under Article 41 of the Convention. The amount of RUB 2,711,929,017.7, consisting of RUB 1,342,969,088.79 for the year 2000 and RUB 1,368,959,928.91 for the year 2001, equalled EUR 75,477,284 at the conversion rate on that date.\n\n26.\n\nTaking into account the inflation rate of 12.62% for the euro between that date and the present time, the Court assesses the amount of pecuniary damage to the applicant company resulting from the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the retroactive imposition of the penalties (see paragraph 22 above) and the payment of the enforcement fee on these unlawful penalties (see paragraph 25 above) for the years 2000 and 2001 at EUR 1,299,324,198.\n\n**(c) Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the enforcement proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Court refers to its finding in the principal judgment that the domestic authorities failed to strike a fair balance between the legitimate aim of the enforcement proceedings in respect of the applicant company and the measures employed, by being inflexible regarding the pace of the proceedings, obliging the company to pay excessive fees and failing to give explicit account of all of the relevant factors. The above considerations led the Court to conclude that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the enforcement proceedings in respect of the applicant company.\n\n28.\n\nIn this respect, the Court notes that the working assumptions used by the applicant company in its assessment of the prospects of the applicant company's survival and its value in the aftermath of the events remain at least in part speculative (see, for example, *Credit and Industrial Bank v. the Czech Republic*, no. 29010/95, \u00a7 88, ECHR 2003-XI (extracts)). In its principal judgment the Court did not conclude, as alleged by the applicant company, that the applicant company would have survived the enforcement proceedings had it not been for the aforementioned shortcomings in these proceedings. Therefore, the Court cannot accept the applicant company's claim in full (see, for example, *Goddi v. Italy*, 9 April 1984, \u00a7 35, Series A no. 76; *Tre Trakt\u00f6rer AB v. Sweden*, 7 July 1989, \u00a7 66, Series A no. 159; *Beaumartin v. France*, 24 November 1994, \u00a7 44, Series A no. 296-B; *Kingsley v. the United Kingdom* [GC], no. 35605/97, \u00a7 43, ECHR 2002-IV; *Ezeh and Connors v. the United Kingdom* [GC], nos. 39665/98 and 40086/98, \u00a7\u00a7 141 and 143, ECHR 2003-X and *Martinie v. France* [GC], cited above, \u00a7 59).\n\n29.\n\nEven if it cannot be said that the above-cited defects alone caused the applicant company's liquidation, they nevertheless seriously contributed to it, directly resulting in pecuniary damage satisfying the causality criteria of Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n30.\n\nIn this respect, the Court recalls that in paragraph 655 of the principal judgment it has clearly stated that the above-mentioned defects very seriously contributed to the applicant company's demise, having identified:\n\n\"... [a] factor which seriously affected the company's situation in the enforcement proceedings. The applicant company was subjected to a 7% enforcement fee in connection with the entire amount of its tax-related liability, which constituted an additional hefty sum of over RUB 43 billion (EUR 1.16 billion), the payment of which could not be suspended or rescheduled (see paragraphs 484-486). This was a flat-rate fee which the authorities apparently refused to reduce, and these sums had to be paid even before the company could begin repaying the main body of the debt (see paragraph 484). The fee was by its nature unrelated to the actual amount of the enforcement expenses borne by the bailiffs. Whilst the Court may accept that there is nothing wrong as a matter of principle with requiring a debtor to pay for the expenses relating to the enforcement of a debt or to threaten a debtor with a sanction to incite his or her voluntary compliance with enforcement writs, in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs. Because of its rigid application, instead of inciting voluntary compliance, it contributed very seriously to the applicant company's demise.\"\n\n31.\n\nThe 7% enforcement fee (levied on unpaid taxes, interests and penalties) in respect of the applicant company amounted to:\n\n- RUB 6,848,291,175 (approximately EUR 190,481,640) for the year 2000;\n\n- RUB 12,652,063,176 (approximately EUR 345,770,570) for the year 2001;\n\n- RUB 13,477,590,451 (approximately EUR 360,688,386) for the year 2002;\n\n- RUB 11,926,766,600 (approximately EUR 355,784,986) for the year 2003.\n\nThe enforcement fee for the tax liability for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 totalled RUB 44,904,711,402.82 (approximately EUR 1,252,725,582). As indicated above, this lead the Court to conclude that in the circumstances of the case the resulting sum was \"completely out of proportion to the amount of the enforcement expenses which could have possibly been expected to be borne or had actually been borne by the bailiffs\" (see paragraph 655 in the principal judgment).\n\n32.\n\nMaking a reasonable assessment of the enforcement fee and having regard to the parties' submissions in this respect, the Court accepts the Government's indication of an appropriate rate of 4%, which they made in their submissions of 30 March 2013. The Court accordingly decides that in order to satisfy the requirements of proportionality the enforcement fee should have been reduced to 4%.\n\n33.\n\nIn order to calculate the amount of the applicant company's pecuniary loss in this connection, the Court deducts the amount of RUB 2,711,929,017.7 (EUR 75,477,284) representing the 7% enforcement fee paid by the applicant company on the unlawful portion of the penalties for the years 2000 and 2001 (see paragraph 25 above), from the entire amount of the enforcement fee of RUB 44,904,711,402.82 (approximately EUR 1,252,725,582) mentioned in paragraph 31 to arrive at the figure of RUB 42,192,782,385.12 (approximately EUR 1,177,070,056).\n\n34.\n\nIt then follows that the applicant company sustained a clear pecuniary loss of RUB 18,082,621,022, representing the difference between RUB 42,192,782,385.12 (see paragraph 33 above) and the amount of that fee calculated at a 4% rate (RUB 24,110,161,362). The Court observes that the enforcement fee was effectively paid by the applicant company on 12 November 2007 at the latest (see paragraph 303 of the principal judgment). The stated amount equalled EUR 503,268,013 at the conversion rate on that date.\n\n35.\n\nTaking into account the inflation rate of 12.62% for the euro between that date and the present time, the Court assesses the amount of pecuniary damage to the applicant company resulting from the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the manner in which the authorities conducted the enforcement proceedings at EUR 566,780,436.\n\n**(d) The method of distribution of the award**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Court has concluded that the applicant company sustained pecuniary damage as a result of the violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the retroactive imposition of the penalties for the years 2000 and 2001 and the payment of the 7% enforcement fee on these penalties (see subpart (b) in paragraphs 20-26 above) and the disproportionate character of the enforcement proceedings (see subpart (c) in paragraphs 27-35 above). It has rejected the remainder of the applicant company's claim under this head as unsubstantiated. The overall amount of pecuniary damage, including compensation for inflationary losses, sustained by the applicant company in the present case thus amounts to EUR 1,866,104,634 (see paragraphs 26 and 35 above).\n\n37.\n\nWith regard to the appropriate method of distribution of this award, the Court does not accept the applicant company's suggestion that payment be made to the Yukos International Foundation, as the case file contains no evidence confirming who exactly in such a circumstance would benefit from the award in this case.\n\n38.\n\nRegard being had to the fact that the applicant company ceased to exist (compare to *Stankov and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden v. Bulgaria*, nos. 29221/95 and 29225/95, \u00a7 121, ECHR 2001-IX; and *Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria*, no. 49429/99, \u00a7 80, ECHR 2005-XII (extracts)), the Court decides that the aforementioned amount should be paid by the respondent Government to the applicant company's shareholders and their legal successors and heirs, as the case may be, in proportion to their nominal participation in the company's stock (see, *mutatis mutandis*, *Holy Synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Metropolitan Inokentiy) and Others v. Bulgaria* (just satisfaction), nos. 412/03 and 35677/04, \u00a7 39, 16 September 2010; *Sophia Andreou v. Turkey* (just satisfaction), no. 18360/91, \u00a7\u00a7 33-38, 22 June 2010; and *Lordos and Others v. Turkey* (just satisfaction), no. 15973/90, \u00a7\u00a7 61-70, 10 January 2012). In order to facilitate the Government's task, the Court refers to the list of the applicant company's shareholders, as they stood at the time of the company's liquidation, which is held by ZAO VTB Registrator, the company which had held and ran the register of the applicant company.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, given the nature of the violation found, the Court does not consider relevant the Government's references to the allegedly fraudulent conduct of the applicant company's management and some of its shareholders. The applicant company has already been held liable for the actions described in the various tax and enforcement proceedings and the Court sees no reasons to reduce the amount of award to take account of conduct for which the applicant company has already been punished.\n\n40.\n\nWith regard to the Government's reference to the applicant company's allegedly unmet liabilities, amounting to over USD 8 billion at the time of its liquidation, the Court takes the view that this argument is similar to the applicant company's evaluation of the consequences of the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in respect of the enforcement proceedings (see paragraph 28 above) and remains speculative (see, *mutatis mutandis*, *S.A. Dangeville v. France*, no. 36677/97, \u00a7 70, ECHR 2002-III).\n\n41.\n\nIn this respect, the Court would note that it is clear from the course of the enforcement and liquidation proceedings that the domestic authorities chose not to seek repayment of the entirety of the applicant company's debt by, for instance, granting the applicant company more time. Rather, they decided to precipitate the proceedings by auctioning the applicant company's main production unit and liquidating it, notwithstanding the risk of being subsequently unable to recover some of the company's liabilities. The existence and scale of the allegedly unmet liabilities referred to by the Government resulted at least in part from the method used by the domestic authorities to recover the applicant company's tax liability.\n\n42.\n\nMoreover, the fact remains that any liabilities that the applicant company may have had in respect of its creditors were either met or extinguished within the framework of the enforcement and liquidation proceedings in November 2007, and there is nothing in the case file or the parties' submissions to suggest that under domestic law the applicant company or its shareholders remain liable for any payments in favour of any of its creditors resulting from the above-mentioned enforcement or liquidation proceedings. In view of the above, the Court rejects the Government's argument as unfounded.\n\n43.\n\nIn so far as the respondent Government referred to various parallel proceedings allegedly brought by some of the applicant company's shareholders in other international *fora*, the Court notes that there have been two final arbitral awards in cases brought against the Russian Federation by a group of the applicant company's minority shareholders under bilateral investment treaties. These awards were made on 12 September 2010 and 20 July 2012 respectively by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. There is also a pending set of arbitration proceedings brought by the applicant company's majority shareholders (see paragraphs 519-526 of the principal judgment), in which no final award has been adopted so far.\n\n44.\n\nAs regards the former two cases, the Court would note that the case file contains no information regarding the enforcement of these awards. In such circumstances, the Court does not find it necessary to take this information into account in the context of the present judgment and at this stage of the proceedings. The Government's reference to the pending case is thus irrelevant.\n\n**B. Non-pecuniary damage**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe applicant company submitted that the principal judgment was in itself sufficient just satisfaction in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\n46.\n\nThe respondent Government did not object.\n\n47.\n\nThe Court considers that, in the circumstances of the present case, the findings of a violation of Article 6 of the Convention and violations of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 constitute sufficient just satisfaction for the applicant company in respect of non-pecuniary damage.\n\n**C. Costs and expenses**\n-------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe applicant company requested payment of GBP 4,333,105 in respect of the legal fees charged by its counsel Mr Piers Gardner for the work on the case prior to the principal judgment, USD 174,000 in respect of the costs of an expert report and USD 588,148 in respect of various fees incurred as a result of the preparation of submissions on Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n49.\n\nThe Government asked the Court to take into account the fact that the initial application had been unsuccessful on most of the points of principle and that this should be reflected in any award under this head.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the Court's case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as a violation of the Convention has been established and it has been shown that these costs and expenses have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in the Court's possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award a lump sum of EUR 300,000 covering costs under all heads, to be paid to the Yukos International Foundation directly, as requested by the applicant company.\n\n**D. Default interest**\n-----------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT\n----------------------------\n\n1. *Holds* unanimously that the finding of a violation constitutes in itself sufficient just satisfaction for the non-pecuniary damage sustained by the applicant company;\n\n2. *Holds*, by five votes to two,\n\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant company's shareholders as they stood at the time of the company's liquidation and, as the case may be, their legal successors and heirs EUR 1,866,104,634 (one billion, eight hundred sixty six million, hundred and four thousand, six hundred thirty four euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of pecuniary damage, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement;\n\n(b) that the respondent State must produce, in co-operation with the Committee of Ministers, within six months from the date on which this judgment becomes final, a comprehensive plan, including a binding time frame, for distribution of this award of just satisfaction;\n\n3. *Holds*, by six votes to one,\n\n(a) that the respondent State is to pay within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 \u00a7 2 of the Convention, EUR 300,000 (three hundred thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of costs and expenses, which sum is to be paid to the Yukos International Foundation, at the request of the applicant company;\n\n(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;\n\n4. *Dismisses*, unanimously, the remainder of the applicant company's claim for just satisfaction.\n\nDone in English, and notified in writing on 31 July 2014, pursuant to Rule 77 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.\n\nS\u00f8ren Nielsen Christos Rozakis Registrar President\n\nIn accordance with Article 45 \u00a7 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 \u00a7 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:\n\n(a) concurring opinion of Judge Jebens;\n\n(b) partly dissenting opinion of Judge Bushev, joined in part by Judge Hajiyev.\n\nCONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE JEBENS\n----------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nIn the principal judgment the Court concluded, by a majority of four to three, that there had been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the 2000-2001 tax assessments. It transpires from paragraph 574 of that judgment that the Court held that those assessments were not lawful, in that they had been based on a change in the domestic courts' interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-bar for imposing penalties. It also transpires from paragraphs 606 and 607 that this was the only reason for the Court's finding of a violation on this point.\n\n[2].\n\nIn my partly dissenting opinion I concluded that the tax assessments and the imposition of penalties for the years 2000-2001 had complied with the requirement of lawfulness. My reasons for arriving at that conclusion were that the tax assessments were based on a legal development in the higher courts' interpretation of domestic law which was reasonable and should be respected, having regard also to the States' wide margin of appreciation in this field.\n\n[3].\n\nIn the meantime, however, the principal judgment has become final on all points. It has become *res judicata*, which means that the conclusions are binding. Thus, the situation is different from what it would have been had the Court decided on the issue of just satisfaction in its principal judgment.\n\n[4].\n\nThe finality of the judgment is applicable not only to the parties to the case, but to the Court as well. It should apply not only to those judges who voted in favor of the Court's conclusions in that judgment, but also to the dissenting judges. To hold a different view would mean to go against a binding judgment, which could create confusion and undermine the Court's position vis-\u00e0-vis the parties and the outside world. Another important fact is that the applicants' claim for just satisfaction is based on the Court's conclusions in the principal judgment. Therefore, were a judge to decide on those claims on the basis of a dissenting opinion rather than of the Court's conclusion, he or she would not be properly addressing the applicant's claim, and the State's response to that claim.\n\n[5].\n\nFor these reasons I have based my voting with regard to the applicant company's claim for just satisfaction on the Court's conclusions on each point in the principal judgment.\n\nPARTLY DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE BUSHEV, JOINED IN PART BY JUDGE HAJIYEV\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[6].\n\nThe present opinion contains the joint dissenting opinion of Judge Hajiyev and Judge Bushev with regard to awarding pecuniary damage to the applicant company's shareholders (see parts 1-3 below), and that of Judge Bushev with regard to reimbursement of the costs and expenses incurred by the applicant company (see part 4 below).\n\n[7].\n\nWe support the majority's view that the Court cannot accept the applicant company's claim in full, since it is based, at least, in part on speculative assumptions (see paragraphs 19, 28 of the just satisfaction judgment). However, we disagree with the way in which the majority applied the principle of *restitutio in integrum,* which has resulted in the awarding of an extraordinary amount of compensation. With all due respect to our colleagues, and to our deep regret, we must dissent from the majority's conclusions in the relevant parts, for the following reasons.\n\n[8].\n\nAs a starting point, we should like to emphasise our full respect for the principle of *res judicata* and to acknowledge the binding nature of the principal judgment, although we both voted against the majority's finding of the violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (please refer to our dissenting opinion, attached to the principal judgment, for further details). In the meantime, the issue of just satisfaction was not addressed in the principal judgment, which presupposes an analysis of the circumstances of the case as set out in the principle judgment and the case file, in the light of the specific requirements (preconditions) set out in Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n[9].\n\nIn this respect, we would argue that in the circumstances of this case the applicant company's shareholders may not be considered as victims of the breach (1), that the test of direct and clear causality has not been met (2), and that, in any event, it goes against the requirement of equity to award the pecuniary damage under the approach and in the amount defined by the majority (see points 1.4, 2.3 and 3 below).\n\n[10].\n\nLet us now clarify our thinking.\n\n**1. Status of the Shareholders as a Victim**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n[11].\n\nWe believe that the majority has in essence departed from the Court's case-law regarding the criteria for assessing a company's shareholders as victims and injured parties (see points 1.1 - 1.3 below). In any event, in the circumstances of the case, awarding such an extraordinary level of compensation to the shareholders is incompatible with the requirement of equity (see point 1.4 below).\n\n[12].\n\nThe applicant company claimed that the damages should be paid to the Yukos International Foundation \u2013 a legal entity created by the applicant company (see paragraph 11 of the just satisfaction judgment). The majority rejected this method of distribution, \"as the case file contains no evidence confirming who exactly in such a circumstance would benefit from the award in this case\" (see paragraph 37 of the judgment), having concluded that payments were to be made by the Government \"to the applicant company's shareholders and their legal successors and heirs, as the case may be, in proportion to their nominal participation in the company's stock\".\n\n[13].\n\nAs an illustration of the majority's conclusion on this matter, the judgment (see paragraph 38) contains a reference to the Court's previous practice. The quantity of cases referred to might create the impression that such a conclusion is based on well-established case-law. This is not the case. In exceptional circumstances heirs and successors may indeed receive the compensation which would have been awarded by the Court to the respective right holder (victim) had the latter (the Yukos company in this case) retained legal personality on the date on which the award was granted.\n\n[14].\n\nThis result, under the judgments referred to, as well as under other case-law, requires that at least three related conditions are jointly met. *Firstly*, there must be circumstances which allow for an exception to the general rule of \"direct effect\" (1.1); *secondly*, the relevant right to compensation must exist (1.2); and, *thirdly*, the \"successors and heirs\" (the shareholders, by analogy) must confirm to the Court their intention to be protected under the Convention mechanism: at the least, they must somehow demonstrate to the Court such an intention (1.3). None of these criteria has been met in the case at hand.\n\n1.1. \"*Direct effect rule\": no exceptions applicable to Yukos shareholders.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[15].\n\nAs the Practical Guide on Admissibility Criteria makes clear:\n\n\"The act or omission in issue must *directly* affect the applicant\" (\u00a7 25). The victim must have suffered direct damage. It is further specified in \u00a7 30 that the Court may accept an individual application from a person considered an indirect victim where there is a *personal* and *specific* link between the direct victim and the applicant. However, shareholders in a company cannot claim to be victims of a violation of the company's rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 (see *Agrotexim and Others v. Greece*, 24 October 1995, \u00a7\u00a7 62 and 64, Series A no. 330-A), save in exceptional circumstances (see *Camberrow MM5 AD v. Bulgaria* (dec.), 1 April 2004)\".\n\n[16].\n\nBankruptcy is clearly an extraordinary situation in a company's life cycle. However, extending the notion of \"exceptional circumstances\" to each and every shareholder in a bankrupt company (as the majority has done) would diminish the concept of direct effect (damage). It is common knowledge in corporate law that, under all jurisdictions, a shareholder is not the only stakeholder in a given company (the creditors, the labour collective, management, society, the public authorities, etc., are also stakeholders). Shareholders are normally considered as having no additional privileges in relation to other stakeholders with regard to the distribution of a company's assets in the event of bankruptcy. This position, namely that of last in the line of stakeholders for a bankrupt company's assets, makes the link between such an applicant company and its shareholders even more remote and more indirect. An exception should possibly be made where a shareholder has decisive and ultimate power in the company's governance, using the company's personality as a corporate instrument (\"veil\") for its own business (see, *inter alia*, *G.J. v. Luxembourg*, no. 21156/93, \u00a7 24, 26 October 2000). It is difficult to believe that each of the more than fifty thousand Yukos shareholders who under the majority's approach deserved compensation *pro rata* had a *personal and specific link* with the applicant company, and had decisive and ultimate power in its governance.\n\n1.2. *The property right/interest to be protected under the Convention must exist and be real. Yukos shareholders' right to compensation did not exist.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[17].\n\nShareholders' rights and interests in the circumstances of this case could potentially suffer and require protection under two scenarios \u2013 after (a) and before (b) the bankruptcy procedure was initiated.\n\n[18].\n\n(a) In the exceptional situation of bankruptcy, the shareholders, under all jurisdictions, may be entitled to distribution of the assets of a liquidated company. This right to obtain a share of liquidation assets only exists, however, once all creditors (including the public authorities) have been paid off. This requirement has not been met in this case. Even disregarding the allegedly \"wrong maximum amount\", the applicant company continued to have debts towards its diverse creditors. As is stated in \u00a7 303 of the principal judgment, \"The applicant company ceased to exist, leaving over RUB 227.1 bn (around USD 9.2 bn) in unsatisfied liabilities\". This fact was confirmed by the national court. The majority based its logic, though, on the assumption that any liabilities towards the creditors ceased upon the applicant company's liquidation in November 2007 (see \u00a7 42 of the just satisfaction judgment). This assumption is wrong, since it contradicts the domestic court's findings of fact. Besides, the majority's logic to the effect \"no company \u2013 no liabilities\" ought to be consistent: \"no company \u2013 no liabilities, including liabilities to shareholders\", and termination of a company's existence must also mean termination not only of all liabilities, but also of all rights relating to compensation to the company \u2013 \"no company \u2013 no rights and obligations\".\n\n[19].\n\nThe idea that \"shareholders step in only after other stakeholders\" seems to have been acknowledged by Mr Gardner, who at the initial stage of the proceedings was accepted by the Court as Yukos's representative (see \u00a7 444 of the admissibility decision). Mr Gardner requested that payment be made to the Yukos International Foundation, the Charter of which provides a view of distributing the compensation \"*after [the] payment of the creditors* ... in accordance with the applicable law and principles of reasonableness and fairness\" (see \u00a7 11 of the just satisfaction judgment).\n\n[20].\n\n(b) Under the alternate scenario, where the applicant company continued to operate and had been deprived of its assets, that is, before bankruptcy was begun, payment to the shareholders as calculated under the majority's logic seems even less justified.\n\n[21].\n\nBefore liquidation, the share price was not and could not under any circumstances be equal to the value of the company's assets, with or without the \"wrong amount\" being taken into account. It is well known that the share price is affected more by a company's prospects, confidence in the management and other perceptions, rather than by the value of a company's assets. *Restitutio in integrum* in the case of the shareholders, i.e. putting them in the situation where they would have been had the company not been liquidated, or had the company been paid back the \"confiscated amount\", does not entail payment to the shareholders of the exact \"confiscated amount\". In the normal course of business, a link between the share price and the value of the company's assets (including also \"the confiscated amount\") is not direct, as the value of the company's assets and the share price may differ significantly.\n\n[22].\n\nThus, under any scenario, the Yukos shareholders could not acquire a property right to the part of the company's assets evaluated under the majority's approach.\n\n1.3. *There must be clear evidence that an injured person (the shareholders) sought protection under the Convention machinery. The Court may not decide on behalf of private persons how they should exercise a potential right to compensation in respect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention*.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[23].\n\nIt seems essential that a private person seeking compensation under a Convention provisions must explicitly say so. A pure assumption that no reasonable person would reject compensation if awarded, even if it had not been claimed, does not suffice to grant the status of victim and injured party. Moreover, as follows from paragraph 43 of this judgment, some shareholders did nonetheless express their interest in compensation, but they chose other *fora,* not this Court \u2013 they preferred the international arbitration procedures.\n\n[24].\n\nThe Court admits an exception to the requirement for a victim's explicit consent, but only in inter-State disputes, where the Government file a claim for the benefit of a certain category of the respective State's citizens (see *Cyprus v. Turkey* (just satisfaction) [GC], no. 25781/94, 12 May 2014). However, the present case clearly does not fall under such an exception.\n\n[25].\n\nNothing in the present judgment, or in the case file, clearly suggests that Mr Gardner was authorized (even implicitly) to represent not only all the shareholders, or any specific one of them, but even the Yukos Foundation in these proceedings. No power of attorney or equivalent evidence of authority to represent the injured party has been submitted to the Court in respect of the case at hand.\n\n[26].\n\nIt should be also borne in mind in this respect that the power of attorney submitted by Mr Gardner when lodging the application with the Court on behalf of Yukos, and while Yukos was still operating, was initially void, due to obvious breaches of Russian law; irrespective of whether or not it was void, it expired and in any event has not been renewed. It was cancelled by virtue of law as the bankruptcy was started by the international banks (as later confirmed and communicated by the liquidator). Such a situation with regard to Mr Gardner's authority does not meet the requirements of s. 11 of the Court's Practical Guide on Admissibility Criteria, in accordance with which \"It is essential for representatives to demonstrate that they have received specific and explicit instructions from the alleged victim within the meaning of Article 34 on whose behalf they purport to act before the Court\".\n\n[27].\n\nIn the case referred to by the majority in paragraph 38 of the just satisfaction judgment to justify the idea that the principal shareholders may succeed the liquidated company, the shareholders lodged their application while the company in question was in the process of liquidation and had not ceased to exist as a legal person. In the case at hand, however, no such application had been lodged by the shareholders, directly or indirectly (through a representative), either when the company existed or after its liquidation. For the same reason this case must be distinguished from the cases where successors of a deceased applicant receive the compensation.\n\n[28].\n\nIn addressing the issue of the need for explicit confirmation of a private person's consent to be subjected to the protection mechanism of the Convention we would like to support an idea of Judge Nina Vaji\u0107 (who, to our regret, joined the majority), as expressed in a recent scientific publication. Our respected colleague, when comparing the Court's pilot judgments with collective actions under American law, stated that the Court cannot satisfy claims from persons who are not direct applicants in the case resolved by it1. In contrast, as explained in her paper, under American law a court decision may have a direct effect on those who did not participate in the relevant proceedings. In both concepts the judicial decision relates to the interests of a group of people, whereas to be eligible for an award by the Court the beneficiary must specifically indicate his or her intention to the Court. Unfortunately, we find no reasoning in the just satisfaction judgment as to why this well-established approach to the protection of identical\n\nTranslation from Russian: \u00ab\u2026 \u0421\u0443\u0434 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0446, \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u00bb. \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0439\u0438\u0447, \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438: \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430? // \u0421\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (Comparative Constitutional Review). 2012. \u2116 5(90). \u0421. 99. interests of numerous persons may be changed in the present case. Moreover, departure from this principle will, in our view, compromise the subsidiary role of the Court.\n\n1.4. Payment to the shareholders is unjust in the circumstances of the case.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[29].\n\nIn addition to the argument that the shareholders in this case are not, by *status*, entitled to benefit directly from compensation (no \"direct effect\", no exception applicable; no right to a share of the applicant company's assets existed; no evidence of the shareholders' intention to seek for protection under the Convention instruments), we should like to make a few observations to the effect that the shareholders contributed to the damage to the applicant company and, therefore, indirectly to themselves.\n\n\u2022 As a general rule, a shareholder accepts a risk of devaluation of the relevant shares on account of mismanagement and other reasons. Besides, there is a well-established case-law under which the State, as a general rule, is not liable for misconduct by a private person (in this case, for the applicant company as a legal entity, separate from the shareholders' legal personality, the company's management and the majority shareholder). This case does not fall under the exceptions where the State may be held liable for misconduct by its agents or for breach of its positive obligations.\n\n\u2022 The shareholders tolerated the management's misconduct for a relatively long period. They had clear indications of mismanagement through the mass media, as well as in PwC's1 reports. None of the shareholders exercised their statutory right to sue the management team for mismanagement, or to challenge before the courts the sham and fraudulent transactions which led to the mounting of massive tax evasion schemes. The shareholders were entitled to elect and disqualify the applicant company's management, under whose leadership the company, as found by the Court in the principal judgment, had been engaged in illegal activities. In the meantime, the shareholders, while tolerating the management's illegal actions, were enjoying the dividends, despite the fact that the company was engaged in illegal business and did not have the right to distribute those dividends, given the huge and hidden debt towards the public authorities and to other creditors. The majority shareholders, who, if the majority's logic is followed, will be entitled to a large part of the satisfaction payment, are precisely those persons who involved the company in illegal practices.\n\n\u2022 Some of the shareholders obtained compensation through the Arbitration awards. There is, indeed, no evidence of payment of those awards by the State, as indicated in the just satisfaction judgment (see paragraphs 43-44). However, non-payment does not seem to be important for defining whether compensation was already (or, under the pending litigation, will be) granted. Under the Court's well-established case-law, such an award itself, like domestic judicial decisions, constitutes \"a property\" or \"possession\" which can be sold, used as collateral and be disposed of for value otherwise. Thus, having been granted the awards by the Arbitration tribunals, some shareholders obtained the property value, protected by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. Russia is a Contracting State to the New York Convention of 1958 and has an effective mechanism for the enforcement of arbitration awards, which potentially increases the value of such property.\n\n\u2022 Under any jurisdiction, heirs and successors acquire not only rights, but also obligations. Should, in the Court's view, the shareholders retain rights (to obtain compensation) after the respective company ceased to exist, the latter's unmet obligations should be deemed transferred to the shareholders as well.\n\nOne of the biggest private audit firms in the world.\n\n[30].\n\n*In conclusion*, in the circumstances of this case the Yukos shareholders may not be described as victims and injured parties, and in any event it would be unjust if the shareholders' contribution to the \"damage\" sustained by the applicant company is not properly taken into consideration.\n\n**2. Causality**\n----------------\n\n2.1. *Finding a violation is a separate precondition for any legal liability; causality is another precondition that must be present.*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[31].\n\nFinding a violation may not in itself automatically amount to a conclusion on causality. Causality depends on the context of the case and must be set in the course of analysis of all related facts. Thus, a typical example is where the drunken condition of a driver-participant in a traffic accident is obviously illegal (it might even amount to a grave breach of the law), and such a condition could contribute to the traffic accident. However, it might not necessarily be a direct cause for health damage to other persons involved in the accident.\n\n[32].\n\nIn all legal systems both a violation and causality are preconditions for implying legal liability. The Court's case-law contains many previous examples (including in respect of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1), where a violation was found but causality could not be established.\n\n[33].\n\nThus, in the judgment of 24 November 2005, in the case of *Capital Bank ad v. Bulgaria* (application no. 49429/99) the Court stated as follows in \u00a7 144:\n\n\"The Court finds that no causal link has been established between the violations of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 found in the present case and the revocation of the applicant bank's licence, its liquidation, and the alleged resulting mismanagement of its property. While the withdrawal of its licence and the order for its winding-up might well have had adverse financial consequences for the bank, the Court cannot speculate as to what the eventual result might have been if it had been able to challenge the imposition of those measures in administrative or judicial proceedings (see, *mutatis mutandis*, *Tre Trakt\u00f6rer* AB, p. 25, \u00a7 66, *Fredin (no. 1)*, p. 20, \u00a7 65; and *Credit and Industrial Bank*, \u00a7 88, all cited above). No award can therefore be made under this head\".\n\n[34].\n\nIn *Mascolo v. Italy* (no. 68792/01, 16 December 2004), the Court stated (in \u00a7 55) that: \"The violation of the applicants' right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property is *mainly* the consequence of the tenant's unlawful conduct\". In the case of *Lo Tufo v. Italy*, Judges Spielmann and Loucaides drew attention in their concurring opinion to the fact that the Court itself had acknowledged that the tenant's conduct was not the *exclusive* cause of the landlord's damage by stating that it was \"*mainly*\" so. The judges finally argued on that basis that the State and the tenant should be held jointly and severally liable for the damage caused.\n\n[35].\n\nIn *Campbell and Cosans v. the United Kingdom* (25 February 1982, Series A no. 48) the Court concluded that a violation of the Convention was not \"the principal cause\" of the damage, since the applicant had failed to mitigate the damage.\n\n[36].\n\nThe mere finding a link between the State's behaviour and damage does not suffice for meeting the causality test under Article 41 of the Convention. The Court's case-law poses a high standard for characteristics of causality to be acknowledged as a sufficient precondition for compensation under Article 41 of the Convention.\n\n2.2. *The characteristics of causality*\n---------------------------------------\n\n[37].\n\nThe causality between a violation found by the Court and damage to the victim must be clear, direct and sufficient. The damage shall be a direct and obvious result of the violation.\n\n[38].\n\nThus, as the Court's Practice Direction on \"Just satisfaction claims\" specifies:\n\n\"7. A clear causal link must be established between the damage claimed and the violation alleged. The Court will not be satisfied by a merely tenuous connection between the alleged violation and the damage, nor by mere speculation as to what might have been\".\n\n[39].\n\nThose criteria do not seem to us to be met in this case. It is stated in the principal judgment that \"[the violation] contributed\", [and] \"negatively affected\" the applicant company's situation, but only in respect of the enforcement violation is it stated that the manner in which the enforcement procedure was applied \"very seriously\" affected and contributed to the company's demise (see \u00a7 655 of the principal judgment). In other words, the violations had an influence, they were ministerial to the demise, but did not necessarily amount to a direct and clear cause. It is also noticeable that the majority admitted that \"it cannot be said that the above-cited defects [violation as regards the enforcement procedure] alone caused the applicant company's liquidation\"; yet, in the majority's view, which we cannot share, the causality criteria was met (see paragraph 29 of the just satisfaction judgment).\n\n[40].\n\nWe believe that the most serious contribution and material effect, i.e. direct and clear cause, came from the activity of the applicant company itself, due, in particular, to the following circumstances (but not limited to them).\n\n[41].\n\nIt is the applicant company which increased the amount of the alleged damage by making use of massive tax-evasion schemes (the more unpaid taxes \u2013 the higher the amount of the penalty), by disrespecting creditors' interests and by abusing procedural rights. It is the applicant company which, by actively impeding the tax investigation, as found by the domestic courts and not disputed by this Court (see, for example, paragraphs 17, 19 and 90 of the principal judgment), managed to extend the length of the investigation beyond the statutory limits. As a result, the majority found (by 4 to 3 votes) in the principal judgment, notwithstanding the interpretation of an allegedly unclear statutory provision provided by the national Constitutional Court, that a delay of three and a half months (which we believe is an insignificant overstepping of the 3-year time-bar in the circumstances of this case) amounted to a breach of the Convention requirement of legality (the statutory provision did not meet the criteria of reasonable clarity). The majority decided that *mala fide* behaviour by a taxpayer had not been specified or implied with the required level of certainty in Russian law, and that therefore the courts did not have sufficient legal grounds to prolong the term accordingly.\n\n[42].\n\nExpiry of the statutory term due to the applicant company's *mala fide* activity appears, in our view, to be a reason for a delay in the State's imposing of the tax liability. Indeed, the investigation had been started long enough in advance before the term expired, and the concluding documents had been provided within the term. Had the term not expired, the violation would not been have found. Had the term not expired, the imposition of the tax penalty for 2000-2001, the amount of which, in the majority's opinion, is now to be paid to the shareholders, would have had to be found legal.\n\n[43].\n\nThe lapse of time and duration of the proceedings are typically assessed by the Court in respect of cases concerning Article 6 of the Convention. Since we are here addressing the significance of timing for establishing causality, the analogy with that approach is admissible. The Court has stated that \"the lapse of time\" renders \"the [causal] link between the breach and the damage more uncertain\" (see *Smith and Grady v. the United Kingdom* (just satisfaction), nos. 33985/96 and 33986/96, \u00a7 18, ECHR 2000-IX; *Ramishvili and Kokhreidze v. Georgia*, no. 1704/06, \u00a7 147, 27 January 2009). Contribution by an applicant to the length of the proceedings is normally taken into consideration by the Court (see *Stork v. Germany*, no. 38033/02, \u00a7 43, 13 July 2006; *Peryt v. Poland*, no. 42042/98, \u00a7 63, 2 December 2003; and *Buscemi v. Italy*, no. 29569/95, ECHR 1999-VI).\n\n[44].\n\nAs regards calculation of the damage on the basis of the 7% enforcement fee, the approach employed appears to be too mechanical and far-fetched. Indeed, the Court found the entirety of the measures used by the State in the bankruptcy proceedings disproportionate. In this respect we see no direct and clear causality between the just imposition of the fee alone and the damage.\n\n[45].\n\nIn any event, it would be more logical to define a lump sum, rather than to single out one of the enforcement measures that were applied to the applicant company in order to protect the public interest in collecting taxes.\n\n[46].\n\nIt can also hardly be accepted that the majority took into its consideration the entirety of the enforcement fee, charged for all of the years investigated by the tax authorities (2000-2003), instead of only that for the years in respect of which the imposition of a penalty had been found to be illegal by the Court (2000-2001). The majority argued that the total amount of the fee was disproportionate in terms of compensating the cost which might have been incurred by the State to facilitate enforcement. This argument is not based on the specifics of Russian law. As in the principal judgment (\u00a7 655) the majority again used a mistaken interpretation of the nature of the fee (see paragraph 31 of the just satisfaction judgment). It is not compensation for the costs associated with the bailiffs' actions (which, in that amount, would indeed be disproportionate), but a penalty, the rate of which falls within the State's margin of appreciation, and which is comparable with similar penalties charged in many other jurisdictions.\n\n[47].\n\nIn addition, it is noticeable in what manner the applicant company, advised by numerous professional lawyers, exercised its right to apply for a decrease in the fee. In August 2004 the first-instance court quashed the bailiffs' decision on imposition of the fee for 2000 as disproportionate (see \u00a7 132 of the principal judgment), although this decision was quashed by the upper courts as erroneous (see \u00a7 133 of the principal judgment). The applicant company thereby obtained an indication of possible success in cancelling the fee, and at that time it obtained clarification by the Constitutional Court in Ruling no. 13-P of 30 July 2001 to the extent that a reduction of the fee is allowed in the context of Russian law (see \u00a7 485 of the principal judgment). Regardless of this opportunity, and in contrast to all the other proceedings, the applicant company did not actively challenge the fee imposed for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Thus, it exercised its statutory right to apply for a reduction of the fee for 2002, but this application was withdrawn before the court started considering the application (see \u00a7 201 of the principal judgment). It seems that the fee for 2003 was not challenged at all (see \u00a7 221 of the principal judgment). Such a development may raise the question of whether the applicant company intended to take the opportunity to preserve its assets for its stakeholders with regard to the amount of the fee, or whether instead it possibly chose the tactic \"the worse, the better\", the effectiveness of which has now been proved by the majority.\n\n[48].\n\nA well-established rule, supported by the Court's case law, \"*conditio sine qua non*\", states that: \"an activity or conduct (hereafter: activity) is a cause of the victim's damage if, in the absence of the activity, the damage would not have occurred\" (see also Art. 3:101 of Principles of European Tort Law). Based on this rule the cause for the damage to the applicant company was the company's own illegal behaviour, and, once such illegality had been discovered, the active impeding of the State's actions to safeguard the public interest in collecting taxes and other duties. We should like to draw attention to a few facts which demonstrate that the applicant company would have been liquidated even without disproportionate enforcement pressure by the State.\n\n\u2022 The applicant company was displaying the characteristic features of a bankruptcy situation before the enforcement procedure started, i.e. before the State committed the enforcement violation.\n\n\u2022 The applicant company applied for bankruptcy in the USA (December 2004, see \u00a7 249 of the principal judgment) long before the process started in Russia (September 2005, see \u00a7 269 of the principal judgment);\n\n\u2022 The applicant company's management repeatedly reported its intention to apply for bankruptcy in the press;\n\n\u2022 The bankruptcy procedure was initiated by a group of international banks, but not by the State (see \u00a7 269 of the principal judgment).\n\n\u2022 The Court did not find the choice to sell off Yuganskneftegaz (\"YNG\") entirely unreasonable (see \u00a7 654 of the principal judgment). After the sale of the shares in YNG (December 2004, see \u00a7 259 of the principal judgment), and before the start of the bankruptcy procedure, there were no enforcement actions for almost a year; the applicant company could have continued its operations, but it did not (see \u00a7\u00a7 268 and 302 of the principal judgment). Instead, the management was actively moving the company's assets outside Russia. Loss of the YNG shares (i.e. limited shareholder's control) was not a ground for termination of business (contractual) obligations between the applicant company and YNG. Nothing in the principal judgment or in the case files supports the idea that \"loss of the shareholder's control resulted in (or even negatively affected) YNG's ability to continue business in favour of the applicant company (no evidence of failure to respect business obligations, termination of contracts or the like)\". YNG continued to provide business support to the applicant company for almost a year, whereas, in the meantime, the applicant company was actively hiding its assets and decreasing its ability to meet the diverse creditors' claims.\n\n\u2022 As mentioned above, at the date of liquidation, the applicant company owed its creditors (not only the State) over USD 9 billion (approximately 8 billion euros). This amount was defined by the audit and confirmed by the national court. Even if the \"wrong amount\" (including the 7% fee for all years) is deducted, a substantial and justified debt (not only to the State) remained unpaid. This unpaid debt in itself constituted, under Russian law, sufficient grounds for liquidation, etc.\n\n\u2022 The applicant company has never admitted a breach of the tax laws, but self-confidently insisted on the schemes' legality and on no extra grounds for paying those taxes to the State budget.\n\n[49].\n\n*In conclusion*, there is no direct and sufficient causality between the violations found and the damage to the applicant company and to its shareholders, although the violations could potentially affect the amount of the damage.\n\n2.3. *Co-contributors to the damage and equitable principle of allocation the burden of compensation.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[50].\n\nThe majority placed the entire burden for compensating damage on the State, having nonetheless accepted that the State's actions alone could not be said to have caused the company's liquidation (see \u00a7 29 of the just satisfaction judgment). In consequence, the State must pay to the company's shareholders an amount, which, in contradiction to the principle of *restitutio in intergrum*, is most likely higher than the shareholders would have obtained either as a price for the applicant company's shares (bearing in mind that it was in bankruptcy situation \u2013 see point 1.2 (b) above) or as a liquidation quota (bearing in mind that there existed unpaid liabilities towards the creditors \u2013 see point 1.2 (a) above).\n\n[51].\n\nWhomever the direct and clear cause is attributed to, the applicant company contributed materially to the damage inflicted on its stakeholders.\n\n[52].\n\nIn this respect we refer to the provisions of s. 2 of the Court's \"Practice Direction \"Just satisfaction claims\", under which:\n\n\" ... [The Court] may also find reasons of equity to award less than the value of the actual damage sustained or the costs and expenses actually incurred, or even not to make any award at all. This may be the case, for example, if the situation complained of, the amount of damage or the level of the costs is due to the applicant's own fault. In setting the amount of an award, the Court may also consider the respective positions of the applicant as the party injured by a violation and the Contracting State as responsible for the public interest. Finally, the Court will normally take into account the local economic circumstances\" (emphasis added).\n\n[53].\n\nThis approach corresponds to the Principles of European Tort Law:\n\n\"The victim has to bear his loss to the extent corresponding to the likelihood that it may have been caused by an activity, occurrence or other circumstance within his own sphere\" (Art. 3:106). The Principles also provide that \"In the case of multiple activities, when it is certain that none of them has caused the entire damage or any determinable part thereof, those that are likely to have [minimally] contributed to the damage are presumed to have caused equal shares thereof\" (Art. 3:105).\n\n[54].\n\nBesides, by virtue of s. 9 of the Practice Directions:\n\n\"The purpose of the Court's award in respect of damage is to compensate the applicant for the actual harmful consequences of a violation. It is not intended to punish the Contracting State responsible\".\n\n[55].\n\nThe amount of compensation awarded, which is far above any maximum amount previously awarded by the Court, constitutes a significant part of the State's budget: it will have to be deducted from the funds disposed of in the public interest, and in this respect the payment will result in punishment to the State. Further, the majority's approach does not seem to take into account the financial situation of the State, which the Court has done many times in respect of Russia (see *Kazartseva and Others v. Russia*, no. 13995/02, \u00a7 46, 17 November; *Korchagina and Others v. Russia*, no. 27295/03, \u00a7 24, 17 November 2005; and *Shapovalova v. Russia*, no. 2047/03, \u00a7 26, 5 October 2006) and of other States.\n\n[56].\n\nIn this respect, placing the entire burden of compensation on only one party among several others which contributed to the damage would breach a principle of (just) equity. A decrease in the 7% enforcement fee, proposed by the majority, does not fall under this requirement, as it is grounded by other reasons.\n\n[57].\n\nRegard should be also given to the legality of the assets owned by the applicant company in the course of its operations and, in the light of the equity requirement, to the scope of protection to be provided by the Convention in this respect.\n\n**3.** ***Ex injuria jus non oritur.*** **Part of the applicant company's assets had been acquired as a result of illegal activities.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[58].\n\nThe applicant company was considered to be one of the most financially successful companies in Russia. However, at least, part of this achievement resulted from illegal activity.\n\n\u2022 The applicant company raised certain funds in the course of exercising business models (sham companies and transactions; see, for instance, PwC's report, admissibility decision, \u00a7\u00a7 186-188), which, as confirmed by the Court in the principal judgment, were illegal. Substantial \"income\" was obtained through a business culture of tax evasion, and then used for the applicant company's further expansion.\n\n\u2022 Part of the applicant company's assets was initially created through fraudulent schemes (sham tenders during the privatization process). We refer also to the judgment in *Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev v. Russia* (nos. 11082/06 and 13772/05, 25 July 2013.\n\n\u2022 The applicant company's value increased significantly due to an unprecedented and unpredictable jump in the price of oil, as well as an increase of the FX (foreign exchange rate), that is, as a gift (luck) and not due to efficiency on the part of the applicant company's governance.\n\n\u2022 The management did not include (consolidate) numerous foreign affiliates (see the PwC report), thus decreasing its ability to pay off the debts to the creditors and to pay the liquidation quota to the shareholders. Those assets remained under the control of the majority shareholders.\n\n\u2022 Part of the applicant company's assets was misappropriated by its management (majority shareholders). We refer to the *Khodorkovskiy and Lebedev* judgment, cited above.\n\n[59].\n\nWe believe that the Convention was not designed to protect property rights and interests which were acquired illegally, irrespective of whether they were later breached by the State's unlawful actions. This factor should also have been taken into consideration by the majority when reaching its decision on awarding damages in respect of deprivation of such assets. The illegal origin of the property may make it unnecessary to provide \"the victim\" with protection under the Convention, at least to the full extent (the full amount), and protection granted without paying due consideration to this factor goes against the principle of equity.\n\n**4. Reimbursement of costs and expenses**\n------------------------------------------\n\n[60].\n\nThe majority held that a sum of costs and expenses (plus any tax that may be chargeable in this respect) is to be paid to the Yukos International Foundation, at the request of the applicant company. With deep regret, I cannot join a decision under which compensation is based on activity by a representative who was not duly authorised by the applicant company throughout the whole course of the procedure before the Court (beginning in 2004 and until the applicant company's liquidation in November 2007), and who was not authorised to act as an agent before the Court by the beneficiaries of the majority's findings (i.e. the shareholders)."}]}
