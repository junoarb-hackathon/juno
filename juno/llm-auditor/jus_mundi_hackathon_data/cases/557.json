PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 September 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from (i) three U.S. (Delaware) companies, **Mobil Corporation** (\"Mobil\"), **Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd.** (\"Mobil CN Holding\"), and **Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc.** (\"Mobil Venezolana Holdings\"); (ii) two Bahamian companies, namely **Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd.** (\"Mobil CN\"), and, **Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc.** (\"Mobil Venezolana\"); and (iii) one Dutch company, **Venezuela Holdings, B.V.** (\"Venezuela Holdings\"), a request for arbitration, dated 6 September 2007, against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n2.\n\nOn the same day, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"the Institution Rules\") acknowledged receipt of the request and on the same day transmitted a copy to Venezuela and to its Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration, as supplemented by the Claimants\u2019 letters of 28 September 2007, was registered by the Centre on 10 October 2007, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. On the same day, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 7 of the Institution Rules, notified the parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of January 7, 2008, the Claimants confirmed the parties\u2019 agreement on the number and method for the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, according to which the Tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the third one, who shall serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties with the assistance of the first two appointed arbitrators.\n\n5.\n\nOn 7 January 2008, the Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as arbitrator. On 31 January 2008, the Respondent appointed Dr. Ahmed S. El-Kosheri, a national of Egypt, as arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nThe parties having failed to appoint a presiding arbitrator, and more than 90 days having elapsed since the registration of the request for arbitration, the Claimants, by letter of 16 May 2008, requested the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to appoint the presiding arbitrator, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4. On 25 July 2008, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, in consultation with the Parties, appointed H.E. Judge Gilbert Guillaume, a national of France, as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nAll three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, by letter of 8 August 2008, informed the Parties of the constitution of the Tribunal, consisting of H.E. Judge Gilbert Guillaume, Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler and Dr. Ahmed S. El-Kosheri, and that the proceeding was deemed to have begun on that day, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was, with the agreement of the parties, held on 7 November 2008, at the World Bank\u2019s Paris Conference Center.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**A - THE RESPONDENT\u2019S MEMORIAL ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 15 January 2009, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela submitted a Memorial containing its Objections to Jurisdiction (the \"Memorial\").\n\n**1- Background of the case**\n-----------------------------\n\n16.\n\nSuch Memorial first reviews the background of the case. In this respect it stresses the strategic nature of the oil industry in Venezuela under article 302 of the Constitution. It recalls that in 1975, the oil industry was nationalized through the Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons (the \"1975 Nationalization Law\"). In fact, the Law \"permitted only two means of private participation in the oil industry: (i) operating agreements, which were to be simple service contracts; and (ii) association agreements, which were permitted only in \"special cases\". \"The latter were valid only if a State company had a participation that guarantied control by the State and only if the agreement was approved by Congress\"1 In this context, a State-owned petroleum company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) was then created.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 12.\n\n17.\n\nThe 1990\u2019s marked a change of policy known as Apertura Petrolera. Foreign investors returned to the Venezuelan oil industry through \"progressively more strained interpretations of the 1975 Nationalization Law\"2. In this framework, an agreement was entered into on 28 October 1997 by Lagoven Cerro Negro S.A. (now PDVSA Cerro Negro S.A., hereinafter referred to as Lagoven or \"PDVSA CN\", a subsidiary of PDVSA with Veba Oel Venezuela Orinoco GmBH (Veba), a German corporation, and Mobil Producci\u00f3n e Industrializaci\u00f3n de Venezuela, Inc. (MPIV), a Delaware corporation, for the production and upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Oil Belt. The agreement (the \"Cerro Negro Agreement\") did not create any \"contractual relationship with the Republic and imposed no restriction on the right of the Government to exercise its authority over the petroleum industry\"3. It only provided for compensation of the contracting private parties by Lagoven in the event that certain governmental actions defined in the contract as \"Discriminatory Measures\" would result in a \"Material Adverse Impact\", subject to a ceiling on compensation. Disputes between the Parties related to the Cerro Negro Project would be governed by Venezuelan law and submitted to arbitration within the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).\n\nMemorial \u00a7 14.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 23.\n\n18.\n\nMoreover Profit Sharing Agreements were authorized by the Congress of Venezuela in 1995 to permit private investors \"to explore for oil with no participation by a State owned entity\"4 In this framework, the La Ceiba Agreement was concluded on 10 July 1996. As of June 2007, Mobil Venezolana (Bahamas) was one of the parties to that Agreement. Here again, the contract \"imposed no limitations whatsoever on the sovereign rights\" of Venezuela5.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 34.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 36.\n\n19.\n\nA new Hydrocarbon Law was adopted in 20016 and from October 2004, a number of measures were taken by the Government of Venezuela to regulate the petroleum industry. The royalty rates were increased in October 2004. Then \"the Minister of Energy and Mines issued an Instruction on April 12, 2005, declaring that the operating service agreements were illegal and setting in motion an orderly process of \"migration\" of those agreements to the new form of mixed companies required under the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law\"7. In May 2006, an extraction tax of 33 1/3 % was enacted. In August 2006, the income tax rate was increased to 50 % and \"term sheets were prepared for all companies involved in the associations, outlining the proposed conditions for conversion into mixed companies consistent with the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law. Discussions regarding migration failed to reach fruition, and on 8 January, 2007, the President of the Republic announced that all the projects that had been operating outside the framework of the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, including the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects would be nationalized\"8. A decree of 26 February 2007 called for the transformation (called \"migraci\u00f3n\") of the oil associations (including both Projects) into mixed companies approved by the National Assembly (the \"Nationalization Decree\"). Amicable settlements were arrived at in most cases. However for the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects, \"Exxon Mobil has insisted on demands for grossly exaggerated compensation that made settlement with it impossible\"9.\n\nMemorial - Footnote 52.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 39.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 45.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 52.\n\n20.\n\nIn the midst of the changes in the Venezuelan petroleum industry thus described, the Claimants in October 2005 created a new entity under the laws of the Netherlands, Venezuela Holdings, and inserted it into the corporate chains for the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects in February 2006 and November 2006 respectively.\n\n21.\n\nA sa result of this restructuring, Mobil (Delaware) owns 100% of Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands), which owns 100% of Mobil CN Holding (Delaware), which owns 100 % of Mobil CN (Bahamas), which finally owns a 41 2/3 % interest in the Cerro Negro Association.\n\n22.\n\nVenezuela Holdings (Netherlands) also owns 100 % of Mobil Venezolana Holdings (Delaware), which owns 100 % of Mobil Venezolana (Bahamas), which finally owns a 50 % interest in the La Ceiba Association.\n\n23.\n\nAs a consequence, according to Venezuela, the claims addressed to the Tribunal fall into three general categories:\n\n\"(a) claims deriving from Mobil CN\u2019s interest in the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(b) claims deriving from Mobil Venezolana\u2019s interest in the La Ceiba Project;\n\n(c) claims deriving from Mobil\u2019s investment in the capital of the two operators, OCN and Agenda Operadora La Ceiba\"10.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 73.\n\n24.\n\nThe jurisdictional grounds alleged for the first two categories are:\n\na. The 1999 Venezuelan Law on the promotion and protection of investments (the \"Investment Law\");\n\nb. The 1993 bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and Venezuela (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\").\n\n25.\n\nThe sole alleged basis for jurisdiction over the last of Mobil\u2019s claims is the \"Investment Law\".\n\n**2- Objections to Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nVenezuela first contends that Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide the requisite clear and unambiguous consent to arbitration of this dispute. In this respect, it refers to the text itself of the law, to Venezuelan legal principles and to a decision rendered on 17 October 2008 by the Venezuelan Supreme Court. It moreover stresses that a comparison of Article 22 with other national investment laws leads to the same conclusion. It adds that a comparison with the language of consent in ICSID\u2019s model clauses also makes clear that consent to ICSID jurisdiction does not exist in the present case. Finally it submits that in any case, Claimants Venezuela Holding, Mobil CN Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings are not \"the owners\" of the direct investments in Venezuela or \"the one who actually controlled\" them11. Therefore they do not qualify as \"international investors\" under the Investment Law.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 120.\n\n27.\n\nVenezuela contends that the BIT does not provide a basis for ICSID jurisdiction over the dispute. It submits that Venezuela Holdings is a \"corporation of convenience\" created in anticipation of litigation against the Republic of Venezuela for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction. It concludes that \"this abuse of the corporate form and blatant treaty-shopping should not be condoned\"12 In support of this argument, it invokes ICSID case law in *Autopista v. Venezuela, Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.* *Ukraine* and *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia.* It moreover submits that Claimants Mobil CN, Mobil CN Holding, Mobil Venezolana and Mobil Venezolana Holdings cannot obtain jurisdiction under the Dutch treaty, because of their nationality. It finally contends that indirect investments, as those cited by the Claimants, do not qualify for protection under that treaty.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 127.\n\n28.\n\nVenezuela concludes that \"for the reasons set forth above, the claims set forth in the Request should be dismissed in their entirety\"13.\n\nMemorial \u00a7 179.\n\n**B - THE CLAIMANT\u2019S COUNTER MEMORIAL ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn 16 April 2009, the Claimants submitted a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"Counter-memorial\").\n\n**1- Statement of facts**\n-------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants first state that \"there is no genuine dispute about the main events giving rise to this arbitration\"14. They stress in particular that Venezuela \"has admitted that it \u2018nationalized\u2019 the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects in 2007\"15.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 1.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 18.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants however submit that \"the Respondent\u2019s chronology of relevant events is misleading\"16. They contend that the Venezuelan Government gave repeated assurances after 2001 that it would honor contracts signed during the oil opening. In particular, the Government entered on 16 January 2002 into a Royalty Procedures Agreement accepting that the royalty rate for the Cerro Negro Project would remain at the reduced rate of 1% and would not for the life of the Cerro Negro Project exceed 16 2/3 % (instead of the 30 % provided for in the 2001 Law)17. Moreover, the Claimants submit that, contrary to the allegations of the Government of Venezuela, the Government was not willing in 2006 to negotiate the terms of a \"migraci\u00f3n\" of the Project to a mixed enterprise. Then, as a follow up to a speech by President Ch\u00e1vez of 8 January 2007, the National Assembly enacted on 1st February 2007 an Enabling Law under which a Nationalization Decree was taken on 26 February 2007. As ordered by that decree and under threat of military force, Operadora La Ceiba\u2019s and Operadora Cerro Negro\u2019s assets and operation were transferred to PDVSA in April 2007 \"with full reservation of rights\". In June 2007, Venezuela fully and finally expropriated the entire investments.\n\nCounter Memorial p.12\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 25.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants then explain how their investments were restructured in 2004-2006 through a holding company in the Netherlands. This process \"began in late 2004, immediately after the Respondent increased the royalty rate for Orinoco Oil Belt projects from 1 % to 16 2/3 %\"18' [It] \"was completed in 2006, well before the Republic of Venezuela made announcements that it intended to nationalize the Orinoco Oil Belt and profit-sharing projects\"19. During that period, new and important investments were projected and made. The restructuring \"was not intended, nor could it have been intended to \u2018position\u2019 the Claimants for disputes that \u2018had arisen,\u2019 as alleged by the Respondent\"20.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 42.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a746.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Cerro Negro Association Agreement does not curtail their rights to prosecute this case. On the contrary, it requires Mobil Cerro Negro to commence and pursue legal claims against Venezuela parallel to the proceedings in the ICC case against PDVSA and PDVSA-CN. Moreover, the agreement \"does not limit the recovery to which the Claimants are entitled in this arbitration\"21. They do not contest the right of Venezuela to expropriate their investments as long as the Respondent complies with the requirements under the Treaty, general international law and Venezuela's own law, \"including the payment of full compensation\"22. They assert that this obligation is referred to in the Offering Memorandum and the Common Security Agreement entered for the financing of the Cerro Negro Project, also mentioned by the Respondent.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 56.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 58.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that they engaged in good faith negotiations with the Government of Venezuela. The negotiation on the terms of the \"migraci\u00f3n\" open before the nationalization was completed, failed \"over non-economic terms imposed by the Government, including \u2018elimination of arbitration\u2019\"23. The negotiation failed because Venezuela was not prepared to pay compensation based on fair market value, as legally required.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 64.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants then contend that PDVSA purchased bonds related to the Cerro Negro Project to avoid a default resulting from the Respondent\u2019s expropriation.\n\n36.\n\nThey finally contend that Mobil Cerro Negro has not engaged in any campaign of harassment against PDVSA or PDVSA-CN, as the Respondent alleged. It only sought conservatory measures in various jurisdictions to ensure that the award to be rendered in the ICC arbitration would not become illusory.\n\n**2- Legal basis for jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nTurning to jurisdiction, the Claimants contend that the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction are met *ratione materias, ratione personae,* and *ratione voluntatis.*\n\n38.\n\nThey first submit that Venezuela consented to that jurisdiction through Article 22 of the Investment Law. This text must be interpreted objectively and in good faith under the ICSID Convention and the relevant principles of international law, as recognized by ICSID case law. It must, in particular, take into account the principle of *effet utile.* The Claimants add that their interpretation is confirmed by the context and purpose of the Investment Law, as well as the legislative intent. Moreover, \"the Respondent\u2019s strained comparisons of Article 22 of the Investment Law with consent formulations in other domestic investment statutes and the ICSID Model Clauses are irrelevant\"24. They submit that the decision rendered in 2008 by the Supreme Court of Venezuela is \"not binding on this Tribunal\" and \"is not entitled to authority of any kind\"25. They contend that \"there is no basis under the Investment Law for the proposition that the concepts of \"international investment\" and \"international investor\" presuppose direct ownership or direct control over the investment\"26. They add that in any case Venezolana Holdings, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings are international investors under the Investment Law.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 158.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 161.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 186.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants then state that Venezuela consented to ICSID jurisdiction under Article 9 of the BIT.\n\n40.\n\nIn this respect they first state that Venezuela Holding is not a \"corporation of convenience \"created\" for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction\"27. According to the Claimants, the objection raised on that basis by Venezuela fails both on factual and legal grounds. There is no legal basis for imposing nationality requirements extraneous to the Treaty or for disregarding the nationality of those holdings. There is no more legal basis for piercing Venezuela Holding\u2019s corporate veil.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 187.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that not only Venezuela Holdings, but also Mobil Cerro Negro, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Mobil Venezolana and Mobil Venezolana Holdings are nationals of the Netherlands protected by the Treaty. Finally they contend that the Treaty protects indirect investments. On all those points, they invoke ICSID case law.\n\n42.\n\nIn the light of those arguments, the Claimants \"request the following relief in the form of an Award on Jurisdiction:\n\ni. A declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\nii. An order dismissing all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\niii. An order that the Respondent pay all costs of the proceedings on jurisdiction, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and the costs of the Claimants\u2019 legal representation, subject to interest; and\n\niv. Such other relief as might be right and proper\"28.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 272.\n\n**C - THE RESPONDENT\u2019S REPLY ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 15 June 2009, Venezuela submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction (the \"Reply\").\n\n44.\n\nIt first states that the Claimants\u2019 version of the facts omits a few important points. It stresses in particular that Mobil CN \"received a very robust return\"29 from its investments and that, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 evaluation, the true value of the interest at issue in this case is substantially less than US$ 1 billion30. It adds that the measures complained of by the Claimants were taken in the legitimate exercise of Venezuela\u2019s sovereign rights and were reasonable and non discriminatory.\n\nReply \u00a7 5.\n\nReply \u00a7 15.\n\n45.\n\nVenezuela then contends that the language of Article 22 does not support Claimants\u2019 position on jurisdiction. It submits that Venezuelan law is necessarily part of the analysis of that article. Under the law of Venezuela, as well as under international law, consent to arbitrate must be clear and unequivocal. Article 22 does not contain such consent. \"The provision constitutes recognition and confirmation by the State that arbitration is a legitimate means of settling investment disputes with the State if and when the State has consented to arbitration under a specific treaty or agreement\"31. That interpretation corresponds to the text, is compatible with the principle of *effet utile* and is supported by ICSID case law, as well as the long standing Venezuelan hostility towards arbitration. A comparison of Article 22 with other examples of true consent further undermines Claimants\u2019 position in this case. Finally, \"there is no legislative history militating against the plain language of the statute\"32.\n\nReply \u00a762.\n\nReply p. 48\n\n46.\n\nVenezuela adds that, in any case, jurisdiction does not exist under the Investment Law and its implementing regulations for indirect investments, such as those of Venezuela Holdings, Mobil CN Holdings and Mobil Venezolana Holdings.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent then reaffirms that the Treaty does not establish a basis for jurisdiction in the present case. It stresses that ICSID case law provides \"a clear set of factors to be taken into account in determining whether there has been an abuse through a \u2018corporation of convenience\u2019 for purposes of obtaining ICSID jurisdiction\"33. Those conditions are not met here. The restructuring occurred long after the investment. It was took effect only in order to gain access to ICSID. The disputes were not only foreseeable, but they had actually been identified and notified to Respondent before the Dutch company was even created. The restructuring did not create a protected investment under the good faith standards articulated in the *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* case. There was an abuse of rights.\n\nReply \u00a7117.\n\n48.\n\nVenezuela further recalls that Mobil CN and Mobil Venezolana are companies organized under the laws of the Bahamas and that Mobil CN Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings are companies organized under the laws of the State of Delaware (USA). It submits that in any event those companies cannot bring claims as \"Dutch nationals\" in their own right. It contends in particular that this is incompatible with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent finally submits that the investments of Venezuela Holdings, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings consist of equity interests in their immediate subsidiaries organized under the laws of the USA and the Bahamas. As such they are not \"investments in the territory\" of Venezuela. Those companies thus lack standing to assert jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\n50.\n\nVenezuela finally maintains that the claims should be rejected for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n**D - THE CLAIMANT\u2019S REJOINDER ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nOn 17 August 2009, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n52.\n\nThey first reaffirm that the Respondent consented to ICSID jurisdiction in the Investment Law. According to the Claimants, Venezuela has retreated from its earlier position that its law controls this question, but it continues to distort the international standard of interpretation of consent instruments. They reaffirm that the Respondent\u2019s construction of the words \"if it so establishes\" in Article 22 is untenable. They stress that other parts of that article and the intent of the drafters confirm the result of the Claimants\u2019 textual analysis. They contest the Respondent\u2019s theory on the purpose of Article 22, as a matter of law and fact.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that \"nothing in the text of the Investment Law or the Regulation excludes protection of investors that control investments through ownership of shares in holding companies\"34. As a consequence, Venezuela Holdings, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings are protected by the Investment Law.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7 55.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimants then recall that Venezuela Holdings is a company incorporated in the Netherlands. It is thus a \"national\" of the Netherlands as required by the BIT. Its subsidiaries are genuinely and legally controlled by Venezuela Holdings. They are also covered by the BIT. Moreover, the Respondent\u2019s allegations of \"treaty abuse\" have no legal or factual ground, being observed that the Claimants \"are not seeking the protection of the Treaty in respect of acts performed before\"35 it became applicable to them.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7 79.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the BIT does not limit the definition of investment to direct investment. It does not require that the claim be related to an investment \"in the territory\" of Venezuela. The objections raised by the Respondent on those grounds are without basis.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants finally maintain their submission as stated in their Counter Memorial.\n\n**E - THE HEARING ON JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAt the hearing held on 23 and 24 September 2009, Venezuela maintained and developed its objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. It contends that it always had a \"reluctant attitude toward arbitration\"36, as shown by its Constitution, its 1998 Commercial Arbitration Law and the jurisprudence of its Supreme Court. It submits that under international law and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, consent to arbitration must be clearly and unequivocally expressed. It adds that this is also the case under Venezuelan law, which \"is of some relevance in this case, even if not dispositive\"37. It recalls that, under Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law, \"Venezuela shall submit to arbitration in accordance with treaties, if they so provide\"38. It concludes that \"if the treaties do not require the submission of a particular dispute to international arbitration, the provision is obviously inoperable\"39. This is the situation in the present case.\n\nHearing, 24 December 2009, transcript, p.9.\n\n*Ibidem* p.53.\n\n*Ibidem* p.55.\n\n*Ibidem* p.58.\n\n58.\n\nVenezuela further contends that the BIT does not provide a basis for ICSID jurisdiction. It recalls that the Claimants had already notified investment disputes in February, May and June 2005 before the Dutch company was inserted into the corporate chain of ownership. Thus the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the specific disputes that existed at that time. It has no more jurisdiction over the expropriation dispute which arose in 2007 because this dispute was already anticipated in 2005 and the Dutch company never made any bona fide investment in Venezuela. Thus, as in the *Phoenix* case, the creation of the Dutch company was not nationality planning, but abuse of right.\n\n59.\n\nIn answer to a question put by members of the Tribunal with respect to the arbitration pending in the International Chamber of Commerce between the Claimants and PDVSA Cerro Negro, the Claimants and the Respondent agreed that there was no risk of double recovery.\n\n60.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants reaffirmed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 22 of the Venezuelan Law. They stress that Article 22 must be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention and to general international law in good faith without bias for or against jurisdiction. They analyse that text in its context, taking account of its object and purpose and conclude that it expresses the consent of Venezuela to arbitration of controversies to which the ICSID Convention may be applicable. They add that Article 3 \u00a74 of the Investment Law covers Venezuela Holdings, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that, in the present case, the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the BIT both *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae.* They analyse the Phoenix award mentioned by Venezuela and stress that, the present situation is completely different, in particular with respect to anticipations and investments.\n\n**III. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nArticle 25 \u00a71 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre\".\n\n63.\n\nAccording to Article 25, consent by both parties to a dispute is thus an indispensable condition for jurisdiction. The fact that the host State and the investor\u2019s State of nationality are parties to the Convention does not suffice.\n\n64.\n\nConsent can be given through direct agreement between the host State and the investor. Under ICSID case law, consent may also result from a unilateral offer by the host State, expressed in its legislation or in a treaty, which is subsequently accepted by the investor.\n\n65.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants submit that Venezuela consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre through :\n\na. Article 22 of the Venezuelan Decree with rank and force of law N\u00b0356 on the promotion and protection of investments of 3 October 1999 (the \"Investment Law\").\n\nb. The Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela signed at Caracas on 22 October 1991 (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\").\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent objects to both of these alleged bases for jurisdiction.\n\n**A - ARTICLE 22 OF THE INVESTMENT LAW**\n----------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nArticle 22 of the Investment Law reads as follows:\n\n\"Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pa\u00eds de origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado o acuerdo sobre promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral de Garant\u00eda de Inversiones (OMGI-MIGA) o del Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados (CIADI), ser\u00e1n sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los t\u00e9rminos del respectivo tratado o acuerdo, si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece, sin peijuicio de la posibilidad de hacer uso, cuando proceda, de las v\u00edas contenciosas contempladas en la legislaci\u00f3n venezolana vigente\".\n\n68.\n\nTranslated to English, Article 22 could read as follows:\n\n\"Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provision of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI -MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides, without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in effect\"40.\n\nThis translation has been proposed by Venezuela (Memorial on objections to jurisdiction \u00a778). The Claimants have provided another translation in which the word \u00ab si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece \u00bb have been translated, not as \u00ab if it so provides \u00bb, but as \u00ab if it so establishes \u00bb. However the Claimants have stated that that difference of translation is immaterial (Counter-Memorial - footnote 205; Rejoinder - footnote 43). At the hearing, Venezuela declared that \u00ab The proper translation of \u00ab si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece \u00bb is \u00ab if it so provides \u00bb. One can also translate it as \"if it so establishes\", use the word \u00abestablishes\" as synonym with \u00abprovides...\u00bb (24 September 2009 p.46). The Parties seem in agreement on the immateriality of the difference between \"provided\" and \"established\", although they diverge on the meaning to be given to both words (see also the Reply Memorial of Venezuela - footnote 76).\n\n69.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the interpretation to be given to Article 22. The Claimants submit that Venezuela consented to ICSID jurisdiction under that article. Venezuela contends that that text does not provide such consent.\n\n70.\n\nIn order to clarify the meaning of Article 22, the Tribunal will first determine the standard of interpretation to be used and then apply that standard to Article 22.\n\n**1- Standard of Interpretation**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(a) Determination of the standard**\n-------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIn its Memorial, Venezuela submits that \"under Venezuelan Law, Article 22 does not provide the requisite clear and unambiguous consent to arbitration of this dispute41. In that perspective, it refers to the applicable \"Venezuelan legal principles\" and to a judgment issued by the Constitutional Division of the Venezuela Supreme Court of Justice of 17 October 2008 interpreting Article 22.\n\nMemorial p.45.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Reply, Venezuela adds that it \"did not say that the issue of consent in this proceeding is governed exclusively by Venezuelan law and did not say that the recent Venezuela Supreme Court decision alone requires dismissal of this case\". It only said that \"Venezuelan Law principles are highly relevant and must be taken into account in deciding whether a Venezuelan statute constitutes consent to arbitrate...\"42\n\nReply \u00a7 22.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants for their part submit that \"the meaning and effects of article 22 must be determined, first and foremost, under the ICSID Convention and the principles of international law\"43. They add that an ICSID Tribunal is judge of its own competence and that as a consequence the decision of the Venezuelan Supreme Court is not binding on the Tribunal.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7 98.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that under Article 41 \u00a7 1 of the ICSID Convention, it is \"judge of its own competence\". It is so whatever the basis of that competence, including a unilateral offer made in the Host State\u2019s legislation and subsequently accepted by the investor. This has been recognized by ICSID tribunals in a number of cases44.\n\nSee for example *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No.ARB/84/3, Second Decision on Jurisdiction (14 April 1988), 3 ICSID Reports 131 (1995), at \u00a7 60 (SPP v. Egypt), *Inceysa Vallisoletana, S.L. v. El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award (2 August 2006), \u00a7 212-213; *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1, Award (24 January 2003), 3 \u00a7 339.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that the same solution has been retained by the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice which made clear that a sovereign State\u2019s interpretation of its own unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is not binding on the tribunal or determinative of jurisdictional issues45. Thus, the interpretation given to Article 22 by Venezuelan authorities or by Venezuelan courts cannot control the Tribunal\u2019s decision on its competence.\n\nElectricity Cy of Sofia and Bulgaria (Preliminary objections), PCIJ. Series A/B N\u00b077 (1989); Aegean Sea Continental Shelf (Greece v. Turkey) - 19 December 1978 - ICJ Reports 1978 p.3; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - 4 December 1998 - ICJ Report 1988 p. 432.\n\n76.\n\nAnother issue is whether Article 22 must be interpreted according Venezuelan rules of interpretation or according to international law rules of interpretation. ICSID case Law on that question is rare and lacks coherence.\n\n77.\n\nIn a number of cases, ICSID tribunals had to apply national legislations which were so clear that neither the parties, nor the tribunal felt necessary to expressly take a position on the rules of interpretation to be applied.\n\n(i) In *Tradex v. Albania*46, the Tribunal noted that the Albanian investment law stated unambiguously that \"[t]he Republic of Albania hereby consents to the submission thereof to the ICSID\"47 and Albania only challenged the jurisdiction of the tribunal *ratione temporis.* In its decision, it rejected that objection through an analysis of the applicable text, without referring to any general principle of interpretation.\n\n(ii) In *Inceysa v. El Salvador,* four Salvadorian laws were invoked by the Claimant. In three cases, the Tribunal, observed that it was \"obvious\" that those laws did not confer jurisdiction to ICSID48. It specified twice that the laws invoked did not meet the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. By contrast, it said in five lines that the fourth text \"clearly indicates that the Salvadorian State... made to the foreign investors a unilateral offer\", which however did not cover the investment in question.49\n\n(iii) In *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan,* the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction on the basis of the BIT between Turkey and Kazakhstan. It added in two lines that it also had jurisdiction under the foreign investment law of Kazakhstan50. However, as that law had been repealed, there was a discussion on the jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of the Tribunal. In that respect, the Tribunal rejected the objection of the Respondent, basing itself both on the transitional provisions of the Kazakh law and on the fact that it is \"well established in international law that a State may not take away accrued rights of a foreign investor by domestic legislation abrogating the law granting these rights\"51.\n\n(iv) In *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* the Tribunal, after having quoted the relevant provisions of the Tanzanian investment law observed that, in view of those provisions, its jurisdiction was facing an \"immediate\" and \"insurmountable difficulty\"52.\n\n*Tradex Hellas S.A.v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Decision on Jurisdiction (24 December 1996), 14 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 161* (1999); 5 *ICSID Rep.* 47 (2002);\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a779.\n\n*Inceysa v. El Salvador,* Award, \u00a7 310, 316 and 327.\n\n*Ibidem,* \u00a7332.\n\n*Rumeli Telekom AS v. Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award (29 July 2008), \u00a7334.\n\n*Ibidem,* \u00a7333 and 335.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (18 July 2008), \u00a7329.\n\n78.\n\nIn three cases, however, ICSID Tribunals dealt explicitly with the question of the rules of interpretation to be applied.\n\n79.\n\nIn *SPP v. Egypt,* the Tribunal noted that, \"[t]he jurisdictional issue in this case involves more than interpretation of municipal legislation. The issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation\". \"Thus in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case, law N\u00b0 43 constitutes consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations\"53. However, one must note that in the rest of the award, the part to be played by those different norms of interpretation is not easy to identify.\n\n*SPP v. Egypt,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, (14 April 1988), \u00a761.\n\n80.\n\nIn *CSOB* v. *Slovak Republic,* the ICSID Tribunal had to decide whether it had jurisdiction both under a BIT and under a notice published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic. It stated on both grounds that \"the question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law; it is governed by international law as set out in article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention\"54.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka v. The Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction,, (24 May 1999), \u00a7 35, 36 and 46.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, in *Zhinvali v. Georgia,* the Tribunal took a third approach. Considering the Georgian investment law, it said that it was \"dealing with an internal statute rather than a bilateral agreement\". It observed that \"if the national law of Georgia addresses this question of consent which the Tribunal find that it does then the Tribunal must follow that national law guidance, but always subject to ultimate governance by international law\"55. It added that Georgian law was in \"keeping with any international law principles that may be applicable\"56 and on the basis of the law thus interpreted, it concluded that the Claimant and the Respondent did consent to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n*Zhinvali v. Georgia,* Award, (24 January 2003), \u00a7339.\n\n*Ibidem,* \u00a7340.\n\n82.\n\nFrom this review of ICSID case law, it results that:\n\n(i) In at least four cases, the question was not clearly dealt with.\n\n(ii) In *SPP v. Egypt,* the Tribunal decided to apply \"general principles of statutory interpretation\" taking into account both \"relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations\".\n\n(iii) In *CSOB v. Slovak Republic,* the Tribunal opted for international law without any reservation.\n\n(iv) In *Zhinvali v. Georgia,* it opted for domestic law \"subject to ultimate governance by international law\".\n\n83.\n\nThe hesitations of ICSID Tribunals on that question result from the fact that, in those ICSID cases, the State\u2019s consent to arbitration was not contained in a treaty to be interpreted according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, but in a unilateral act of a sovereign state, generally in the form of a national legislation.\n\n84.\n\nDetermining the applicable standard of interpretation is particularly difficult when the offer is contained in domestic legislation or other unilateral acts of the State, where there is no overarching convention regarding interpretation. The International Court of Justice had to face that very problem when interpreting optional declarations of compulsory jurisdiction made by States under Article 36 \u00a72 of its Statute. It observed that:\n\n\"A declaration of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court whether there are specified limits set to that acceptance or not, is a unilateral act of State sovereignty. At the same time, it establishes a consensual bond and the potential for a jurisdictional link with the other States which have made declarations pursuant to article 36 \u00a72 of the Statute and \"makes a standing offer to the other States party to the Statute which have not yet deposited a declaration of acceptance\"57.\n\nAccordingly, such \"international instrument must be interpreted by reference to international law\"58.\n\nLand and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria, Preliminary objections - ICJ Reports 1998 p. 291 \u00a725 ; Fisheries jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 p. 453 \u00a746.\n\nFisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 \u00a7 43, 64 and 68.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal shares that analysis, which is in line with the decision taken in *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* and ultimately also in *Zhinvali v. Georgia.* Legislation and more generally unilateral acts by which a State consents to ICSID jurisdiction must be considered as standing offers to foreign investors under the ICSID Convention. Those unilateral acts must accordingly be interpreted according to the ICSID Convention itself and to the rules of international law governing unilateral declarations of States.\n\n**(b) Content of the standard**\n-------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe ICSID Convention requires in Article 25 that parties to the dispute \"consent in writing\" to submit such dispute to the Centre. Under Article 25, consent in writing is thus indispensable, but the text does not give any further indication on the manner or timing of such written consent or on the way in which it must be interpreted.\n\n87.\n\nRules governing States\u2019 unilateral acts in international law have never been codified and remain controversial on a certain number of points. Moreover, as recognized by the International Law Commission in its report of 2006 to the General Assembly of the United Nations, \"the concept of unilateral act is not uniform\"59. According to the Commission a basic distinction must be drawn in that field between:\n\n(i) acts formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty,\n\n(ii) and other acts formulated by States in the exercise of their freedom to act on the international plane.\n\nDocument A/CN.4/L.703 dated 20 July 2006 \u00a73.\n\n88.\n\nBoth acts may have the effect of creating legal obligations. However when considering acts not formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty, it is often difficult to determine whether those acts imply such obligations. Facing situations of that kind in the Preah Vihear case in 1961 and in the Nuclear Tests cases in 1974, the International Court of Justice decided that \"when States make statements by which their freedom of action is to be limited, a restrictive interpretation is called for\"60.\n\nNuclear Tests- New Zealand v. France- Judgment of 20 December 1974, ICJ Reports 1974 p. 472- 473 \u00a7 47; Armed activities on the territory of the Congo (New application, 2002), (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda), ICJ Reports, 2006, p.28, \u00a749 and 50)\n\n89.\n\nSimilarly, the International Law Commission adopted in 2006 Guiding Principles covering this type of declaration under which \"a unilateral declaration entails obligation for the formulating State only if it is stated in clear and specific terms. In the case of doubt as to the scope of the obligations resulting from such a declaration, such obligations shall be interpreted in a restrictive manner\"61.\n\nDocument A/CN.4/L-703 dated 20 July 2006 - Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations - \u00a7 7.\n\n90.\n\nRules of interpretation are however somewhat different when, as in the present case, unilateral acts are formulated in the framework and on the basis of a treaty, such as the ICSID Convention.\n\n91.\n\nThose rules have been fixed by the International Court of Justice in a long series of cases, when interpreting unilateral declarations of compulsory jurisdiction made under Article 36 \u00a7 2 of its Statute. The Court recalled that such a declaration is a unilateral act of State sovereignty and that at, the same time, it establishes or could establish a jurisdictional link with other States (see \u00a7 84 above).\n\n92.\n\nAccordingly, the Court first stated that \"T[t]he regime relating to the interpretation\" of such declarations \"is not identical with that established for the interpretation of treaties by the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties\"62. It then stressed that every declaration \"must be interpreted as it stands, having regard to the words actually used\"63.\n\nFisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 p.453 \u00a746.\n\nAnglo-Iranian Oil Co. - Preliminary objection - Judgment - ICJ Reports 1952 p. 105.\n\n93.\n\nAt the same time, since declarations are unilaterally drafted instruments, \"the Court has not hesitated to place a certain emphasis on the intention of the depositing State\"64. \"In interpreting a unilateral declaration that is alleged to constitute consent by a sovereign State to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal, consideration must be given to the intention of the government at the time it was made\"65.\n\nFisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 p. 454 \u00a7 48.\n\n*SPP v. Egypt,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 April 1988, \u00a7 107.\n\n94.\n\nThe Court thus interprets \"the relevant words of a declaration including a reservation contained therein in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned\"66. That intention can be deduced from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served.\n\nFisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 p.454 \u00a7 49.\n\n95.\n\nIt is on the basis of those rules of international law governing the interpretation of unilateral acts formulated within the framework and on the basis of a treaty that this Tribunal will now proceed to the interpretation of Article 22 of the Investment Law.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal must add that the fact that domestic law and the international law of treaties are not controlling or dispositive does not mean that they should be completely ignored:\n\n(i) As stated in the preceding paragraphs, when tribunals interpret unilateral acts, they must have due regard to the intention of the State having formulated such acts. In this respect domestic law may play a useful role.\n\n(ii) Although the law of treaties as codified in the Vienna Convention is not relevant in the interpretation of unilateral acts, the provisions of that Convention may \"apply analogously to the extent compatible with the *sui generis* character\" of unilateral acts67.\n\n*Ibidem -* ICJ Reports 1998 p. 453 \u00a7 46.\n\n**2- Interpretation of Article 22**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(a) The text of Article 22**\n------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nAccording to Article 22, disputes arising under Venezuela\u2019s BITs or to which the MIGA or ICSID Convention is applicable, \"shall be submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides\".\n\n98.\n\nThe Parties agree that this provision creates an obligation to go to arbitration subject to certain conditions and in particular subject to the last condition thus incorporated in Article 22. But they disagree on the interpretation to be given to that condition.\n\n99.\n\nFor the Claimants, the terms \"if it so provides\" means \"if the respective treaty or agreement establishes (or provides for) international arbitration as a mean of dispute resolution\"68. The Claimants then note that the ICSID Convention establishes such a system of dispute resolution. They conclude that, in the case of ICSID, the condition expressed in Article 22 is fulfilled and that Venezuela has thus consented to arbitration of ICSID disputes through that article. The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction in the present case.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7 18.\n\n100.\n\nBy contrast, Venezuela interprets the word \"if it so provides\" as if \"the relevant treaty or agreement requires submission of the particular dispute to international arbitration\"69. It notes that there is no such obligation in the ICSID Convention. Thus the condition is not fulfilled in the case of ICSID and the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the present case.\n\nHearing - 24 September 2009, transcript, p. 45.\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 22 consists of one single long sentence of some complexity. As stated by Professor Christoph H. Schreuer in his Commentary to the ICSID Convention, this Article \"is drafted in ambiguous terms and is likely to give rise to difficulties of interpretation, notably as to whether it contains an expression of Venezuela\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration or not\"70.\n\nC. Schreuer et al, \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\"- Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 363.\n\n102.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that the disputes which Article 22 mentions \"shall be submitted to international arbitration\" subject to certain conditions. Article 22 thus creates a conditional obligation relating to the settlement of those disputes. Disputes covered by the text are:\n\n(i) disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has a BIT in effect with Venezuela;\n\n(ii) disputes to which the provisions of the MIGA Convention are applicable;\n\n(iii) disputes to which the ICSID Convention is applicable.\n\n103.\n\nIn this compound text, one observes that there is no mention of the Parties to the disputes in question. With respect to BITs, Article 22 refers to disputes arising \"between\" an international investor. One would have expected that, after the word \"between\", mention would have made not of one of the Parties, but of the two Parties to the dispute. This is not the case and the text must be completed in the light of BITs. A priori it could be construed as covering disputes between an international investor and Venezuela to which BITs are applicable.\n\n104.\n\nWith respect to the MIGA Convention, the Tribunal notes that the only disputes to which Venezuela could be a Party under that Convention are not disputes with investors, but disputes with the Agency itself71.\n\nConvention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of 11 October 1985 - Article 57 and Annex II.\n\n105.\n\nFinally, Article 22 covers disputes in which the ICSID Convention applies subject to two conditions.\n\n106.\n\nFirst, the text specifies that the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration \"according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement\". On that point, the Tribunal notes that, at the outset, Article 22 mentions \"treaty or agreement\" on the promotion and protection of investments and then the MIGA and ICSID Conventions. One could have expected that at the end of the article the text would have referred to the \"respective treaty, agreement or convention\". It does not do so. In spite of this awkward drafting, the Tribunal considers that the words \"treaty and agreement\" also cover the two Conventions.\n\n107.\n\nOne then reaches the second condition resulting from the words \"si as\u00ed \u00e9ste lo establece\", \"if it so provides\" or \"establishes\", on which the Parties disagree.\n\n108.\n\nGrammatically, it is undisputed that the word \"it\" refers to the preceding words \"treaty or agreement\", which as stated above include the ICSID Convention.\n\n109.\n\nThe difficulty is with the word \"lo\" (\"so\"). This word certainly refers to the preceding words \"shall be submitted to international arbitration\". However it could be interpreted in two ways. It could mean:\n\n(i) If the treaty, agreement or convention provides for international arbitration or\n\n(ii) If the treaty, agreement or convention provides for mandatory submission of disputes to international arbitration.\n\n110.\n\nBoth interpretations are grammatically possible. In the first one, the word \"lo\" (so) refers to international arbitration. In the second one, it refers to the obligation to submit disputes to international arbitration.\n\n111.\n\nIn a number of cases concerning unilateral declarations, the International Court of Justice decided that it \"cannot base itself on a purely grammatical interpretation of the text\"72. Facing an ambiguous and obscure text, the Tribunal is in the same situation in the present case and has to look further.\n\nAnglo-Iranian Oil Co. - Preliminary objection - Judgment - ICJ Report 1952 p. 104 ; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Report 1998 \u00a7 47 p. 454.\n\n**(b) The principle of** ***effet utile***\n------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants invoke the principle of *effet utile (ut res magis valeat quam per eat).*\n\n113.\n\nThey contend that construing \"if it so establishes\" as \"if the ICSID Convention provides consent to arbitration (or requires arbitration)\" \"would subject the mandate of the ICSID portion of Article 22 to a condition that could never be met\"73 Moreover, the final clause of Article 22 referring to the possibility of litigation in Venezuelan courts would in such a case be useless. This would be \"in flagrant violation of the principle of *effet utile\"74.*\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 113.\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00a7 115.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent opposes this view. It submits that Article 22 does not contain a general consent to arbitration of international investment disputes. It only constitutes recognition and confirmation by the State that arbitration is a legitimate means of settling investment disputes with investors, if and when the State has consented to arbitration under a specific treaty. In such an interpretation, the clause reserving the competence of Venezuelan courts would still be useful.\n\n115.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Claimants recognize that it would not \"be absurd\" for a statute \"to recognize and confirm the legitimacy of arbitration as a means of dispute settlement\"75. But they submit that such an interpretation cannot be given to Article 22.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7 42.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, as recognized by the International Court of Justice, \"the principle of effectiveness has an important role in the law of treaties\"76. As stated by the Tribunal in the *Eureko* v. *Poland* case \"[i]t is a cardinal rule of the interpretation of treaties that each and every clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless\"77. The International Court of Justice78 and ICSID Tribunals79 applied that principle in number of treaty cases.\n\nFisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada).

For such declaration \"what is referred to in the first place... is that it should be interpreted in a manner compatible with the effect sought\" by the State making it82.\n\n*SPP* v. *Egypt-* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, (4 April 1988), \u00a7 95-96.\n\nFisheries jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) - ICJ Reports 1998 p. 455 \u00a7 52.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n119.\n\nThis Tribunal agrees with this ruling. Thus in order to interpret Article 22, it will now consider its context, the circumstances of its preparation and its purpose in order to try to determine what was the intention of Venezuela when adopting Article 22..\n\n**(c) The intention of Venezuela**\n----------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants contend first that the provisions of the Investment Law \"are in many respects typical of investment treaties\"83 which usually includes arbitration clauses. Article 22 must be viewed in that context.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 119.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to its Article 1, the Investment Law was \"intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic and foreign with a stable and predictable legal framework in which the former and the latter may operate in a secure environment, through the regulation of actions by the State, towards these investments and investors, in order to achieve the increase, diversification and harmonious integration of investments to advance the objectives of national development\".\n\n122.\n\nSuch aims are in general terms comparable to those of the treaties on promotion and reciprocal protection of investments and are reflected in the text of the law itself. Thus, the law contains provisions relating to fair and equitable treatment (Article 7 \u00a7 1), nondiscrimination (article 8), confiscations and expropriations (Article 11) which are comparable to those incorporated in BITs. However, the rights thus recognized to international investors are often qualified in order not to affect the application of Venezuelan law84 or the rights of Venezuelan investors85. Moreover Article 24 of the law specifies that its provisions do not prevent the adoption by Venezuela of a number of measures it enumerates, inter alia for national security, the conservation of natural resources and the integrity and stability of the Venezuelan financial system.\n\nArticle 7; Article 7 \u00a7 1; Article 7 \u00a7 2; Article 11; Article 12; Article 12 \u00a7 2, Article 14\n\nArticle 7 \u00a7 1; Article 10; Article 15 \u00a7 2.\n\n123.\n\nThe law is thus in some respect different from BITs. Moreover, BITs do not always contain compulsory arbitration clauses. Therefore one cannot draw from the law as a whole the conclusion that Article 22 must be interpreted as establishing consent by Venezuela to submit ICSID disputes to arbitration.\n\n124.\n\nThe Parties further seek to interpret the Investment Law in the context of Venezuela's attitude *vis-\u00e0-vis* arbitration. The Respondent stresses that that attitude has always been and remains cautious and restrictive. By contrast, the Claimants contend that a proarbitration environment was prevailing in 1999. For each of the Parties, Article 22 must be interpreted in the light of the attitude thus put forward.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that Venezuela had some experience of arbitration at the end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th century which generated hostility in the country towards this form of settlement of disputes. Its boundaries with Colombia86 and the now Republic of Guyana87 were fixed at that time by two arbitral awards favourable to its neighbours, the validity of which was contested. Moreover in 1902, Venezuela had to face a military intervention by Germany, Italy and the United-Kingdom seeking to collect unpaid debts and had to accept the establishment of Mixed Commissions in charge of fixing the indemnities to be paid to its foreign creditors. Those events led to the formulation of the Drago doctrine and the Drago-Porter Convention of 1907 prohibiting the use of force for the recovery of contractual debts. It also favoured the insertion in concession contracts of the Calvo clause under which the investor commits itself not to ask for diplomatic protection by its State of origin.\n\nSentence arbitrale de la Reine r\u00e9gente d\u2019Espagne du 16 mars 1891; sentence arbitrale du conseil f\u00e9d\u00e9ral suisse du 14 mars 1922 - Reports of International Arbitral Awards of the United Nations - Volume I p. 225.\n\nSentence du 2 f\u00e9vrier 1897 - H. La Fontaine - Pasicrisie internationale - 1794-1900, p. 554.\n\n126.\n\nThe Constitution of Venezuela of 1999 describes in its Articles 253 to 261 \"the judicial power and the system of justice\" of Venezuela. Article 253 recognizes that \"the alternative means of justice\" are part of that system and Article 258, after having mentioned \"justice of peace\", provides that \"the law shall promote arbitration, conciliation, mediation and other alternative means of dispute settlement\".\n\n127.\n\nHowever, Article 151 of the 1999 Constitution (which reproduces Article 127 of the 1966 Constitution) provides that:\n\n\"In public interest contracts, unless inapplicable by reason of the nature of such contracts, a clause shall be deemed included, even if not expressed, whereby any doubts and controversies which may arise concerning such contracts and which cannot be resolved amicably by the contracting parties, shall be decided by the competent courts of the Republic, in accordance with its laws, and shall not on any grounds or for any reason give rise to foreign claims\".\n\n128.\n\nMoreover, Article 4 of the Law on Commercial Arbitration of 7 April 1998 provides that:\n\n\"When one party to the arbitration agreement is a company where the Republic, States, Municipalities or Independent Institutions have a capital share of at least fifty per cent (50 %) or a company in which the above mentioned parties have a capital share of at least fifty per cent (50%), such agreement shall require for its validity the approval of the competent statutory body and the written authorization of the Ministry of Legal Protection. The agreement shall specify the type of arbitration and the number of arbitrators, which shall in no event be less than three (3)\".\n\n129.\n\nThis reluctant attitude explains that, during the preparation of the ICSID Convention, Latin-American countries, including Venezuela, expressed reservations on the proposed text which, they said, contravened their constitutional principles88. It also explains why Venezuela signed the Convention only in 1993, almost thirty years after its adoption.\n\nHistory of ICSID Convention - Volume II - 1 \u00a7 39.\n\n130.\n\nAt that time, the environment in Venezuela had become more favourable to international arbitration. In 1993 and 1994, the Respondent ratified both the ICSID Convention and the New York Convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards of 10 June 1958, as well as the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency of 1985. From 1991 to 2001, it concluded 25 BITs; 19 of them had entered into force in 2004. Finally it adopted the Investment Law of 1999.\n\n131.\n\nIt thus appears that the traditional hostility of Venezuela towards international arbitration had receded in the 1990s in favour of a more positive attitude. However, Venezuela remained reluctant *vis-\u00e0-vis* contractual arbitration in the public sphere, as testified by the 1998 Arbitration Law and Article 151 of the 1999 Constitution. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot draw from this general evolution in favour of BITs the conclusion that Venezuela, in adopting Article 22, intended to give in advance its consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of such BITs.\n\n132.\n\nThe legislative history of Article 22 could in this respect provide more useful information on the intention of the drafters of the Investment Law89 However, the Investment Law of 1999 was a decree-law and as such was not discussed in Parliament. Moreover it contains no \"exposici\u00f3n de motivos\". Thus we have no direct information on its preparation.\n\nSee for instance International Court of Justice - Aegean Sea Continental Shelf case (Greece v. Turkey) Judgment of 17 December 1978 - ICJ Reports p. 26 to 43.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Investment Law was drafted in 1999 \"under the direction of Ambassador Werner Corrales\", who in \"a contemporaneous publication, acknowledged that it was the intent of the drafters of the Investment Law to provide for consent to ICSID arbitration\"90. Respondent doubts that the Investment Law had been drafted under Mr. Corrales\u2019 direction. It adds that even so, \"Mr. Corrales\u2019 writings are of no help in the interpreting Article 22\"91.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 122.\n\nReply \u00a785.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in 1999 Mr. Corrales was Representative of Venezuela to the World Trade Organisation. He recognizes himself that he is \"not an attorney\", or an \"expert in international law\" or \"investment arbitration\". In a communication at a conference on investment arbitration in comparative law organized in April 2009 by the Caracas Centro Empresarial de Conciliaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje (Caracas Business Centre of Conciliation and Arbitration), he stated that he advised in 1999 that the President of Venezuela should prepare a law \"that would serve as the compulsory framework for all international treaties and negotiations on investments\". He said that he was then entrusted with preparing reference terms to write the draft law and direct its preparation. He adds that the \"legal drafting\" was assigned to a legal consultant of the Institute of Foreign Trade, Mr. Gonzalo Capriles92.\n\nSpeech by Ing. Werner Corrales at CEDCA\u2019s event - Investment arbitration in Comparative Law - 28 April 2009 - Business - June 2009 p. 78 to 80.\n\n135.\n\nSoon after the publication of the Investment Law, Mr. Corrales in two articles gave \"algunas ideas\" (some ideas) on the legal regime of promotion and protection of investments in Venezuela. In those articles, he stated that in his \"opinion, a regime applicable to foreign investments must leave open the possibility to resort to international arbitration [unilaterally], which today is accepted almost everywhere in the world, whether through the mechanism provided by the ICSID Convention or through the submission of the dispute to an international arbitrator or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal as the one proposed by UNCITRAL. In any case, it must be clearly established that there may not be a simultaneous resorting to national courts and to the arbitration mechanism or to any other type of procedure of settlement of disputes. In our case, this subject is dealt with in Chapter IV (article 21-23)\" of the Investment Law, \"where a great part of the principles commented is accepted93.\n\nLa OMC como espacio normativo - p. 185/186. The word \"unilaterally\" did not appear in the first article of 30 April 1999. It was added in the second article in 2000.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in those articles, Mr. Corrales expressed his opinion on the provisions which, according to his judgement, must be incorporated in any regime of international arbitration. He adds that a \"great part\" of those principles \"is accepted in articles 21 to 23 of the Investment Law\"94. He did not say that the drafters of Article 22 intended to provide for consent to ICSID arbitration in the absence of any BIT.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n137.\n\nTen years later, at the conference already mentioned organized by the Caracas Centro Empresarial de Conciliaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje, Mr. Corrales was invited by the organisers of the conference to inform the audience of the \"drafter\u2019s intention\" for the law95 He then stated that, as far as he was concerned as co-drafter of the law, such intention was to offer \"the possibility of open unilateral arbitration\"96\n\nSpeech by Mr. Corrales - 29 April 2009 - Business - June 2009 p. 78 (Exh. C-187).\n\n*Ibidem* p.80. (\"In my scope of competence at least, I can state the intention of offering the possibility of open unilateral arbitration... [M]y purpose as co-drafter was to offer in the broadest and most transparent manner the possibility of the investors resorting to international arbitration as a unilateral offer made by the Venezuelan state.\")\n\n138.\n\nThis last statement was made at a time the present proceedings were already engaged. It is not supported by contemporaneous written documents and the Claimants themselves did not ask Mr. Corrales to appear in the proceedings as a witness. They stated at the hearing that they do not rely on Mr. Corrales\u2019 statement \"as legislative intent\", but only as \"confirmation\" of their analysis97. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the legislative history of Article 22 does not establish that, in adopting the Investment Law, Venezuela intended to consent in general and in advance to ICSID arbitration.\n\nHearing 24 September 2009, transcript, p. 19.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, at the time of the adoption of the Investment Law, Venezuela had already signed more than 15 BITs stating either that it gave \"its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes\" to ICSID arbitration or that its disputes with foreign investors \"shall at the request of the nationals concerned be submitted to ICSID\", or using both phrases. Comparable words were used in some national laws and in the ICSID model clauses. If it had been the intention of Venezuela to give its advance consent to ICSID arbitration in general, it would have been easy for the drafters of Article 22 to express that intention clearly by using any of those well known formulas.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal thus arrives to the conclusion that such intention is not established. As a consequence, it cannot conclude from the ambiguous text of Article 22 that Venezuela, in adopting the 1999 Investment Law, consented in advance to ICSID arbitration for all disputes covered by the ICSID Convention. That article does not provide a basis for jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present case.\n\n141.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Respondent, Venezuela Holdings, Mobil C.N. Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holdings do not qualify as \"international investors\" under the Investment Law. The Respondent adds that, even if Article 22 were to be construed as consent to jurisdiction, that article would not provide a basis for such jurisdiction with respect to the claims submitted by those entities. The Claimants conclude the contrary. As the Tribunal has arrived to the conclusion that Article 22 does not constitute consent to jurisdiction with respect to any of the Claimants, it does not have to take a decision on those alternative submissions.\n\n**B - ARTICLE 9 OF THE BIT BETWEEN THE NETHERLANDS AND VENEZUELA**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nOn 22 October 1991, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela concluded an Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments, which entered into force on 1st November 1993, after ratification by both Parties. That Agreement was \"done in the Spanish, Netherlands and English languages, the three texts being equally authentic\". However, under paragraph 3 of a Protocol signed on the same day, \"[i]n case of difference of interpretation between the three equally authentic texts of the present Agreement reference shall be made to the English text\".\n\n143.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT provides in its paragraph 1 that \"[disputes between one Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter, shall at the request of the national concerned be submitted to the International Centre for the settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under\" the ICSID Convention. Article 9 adds in its paragraph 4 that \"[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article\".\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the BIT to consider the case. The Respondent denies it. It describes the complex corporate form used by Mobil for its investment and submits that :\n\n(i) Some of the Claimants are not Dutch nationals and that the Dutch Claimant, Venezuela Holdings, has only made indirect investments in Venezuela. Thus, according to the Respondent, the BIT does not cover the present claims.\n\n(ii) Moreover, the Dutch entity is a \"corporation of convenience\" inserted into the corporate chain solely for the purpose of securing access to ICSID arbitration. Such an \"abuse\" of right should not be permitted98.\n\nReply, para 147.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal first recalls that the present dispute finds its origin in investments made by Mobil in Venezuela for the exploration of oil in la Ceiba from 1996 and for the production and upgrading of extra-heavy crude oil in Cerro Negro from 1997.\n\n146.\n\nSome difficulties arose with respect to those projects from October 2004 to August 2006, when Venezuela increased royalty rates and income taxes and created a new extraction tax. Then, in February 2007, a decree called for the transformation of the existing Oil Associations (including Cerro Negro and La Ceiba) into mixed companies. No agreement for such transformation was arrived at between Venezuela and the Claimants. Later in 2007, Cerro Negro\u2019s and La Ceiba\u2019s assets and operations were transferred to PDVSA and a decree of expropriation was issued.\n\n147.\n\nIn the meantime, the Exxon Mobil investments in Venezuela had been restructured through a holding company incorporated in The Netherlands. As a result of this restructuring, Mobil (Delaware) owns 100 % of Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) which owns 100 % of Mobil CN Holding (Delaware) which owns 100 % of Mobil CN (Bahamas) which finally owns 41.66 % in the Cerro Negro project.\n\n148.\n\nVenezuela Holdings (Netherlands) also owns 100 % of Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware) which owns 100 % of Mobil Venezolana (Bahamas) which finally owns 50 % interest in the La Ceiba Association.\n\n149.\n\nIn the light of those facts, the Tribunal will determine:\n\na. whether the BIT provides a jurisdictional basis in the present case\n\nb. and, if so, whether the Claimants have engaged in treaty abuse, which would exclude such jurisdiction.\n\n**1- Jurisdiction under the BIT**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(a) Nationality of the Claimants**\n------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIt is undisputed that Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) is an entity incorporated in the Netherlands and as such, a Dutch national entitled to prevail itself of the BIT. But Venezuela submits that its subsidiaries, Mobil CN Holding (Delaware), Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware), Mobil CN (Bahamas) and Mobil Venezolana (Bahamas) have been incorporated either in the United States of America or in the Bahamas and are not Dutch nationals. According to the Respondent, they cannot prevail themselves of the Dutch - Venezuela BIT.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants contend that subsidiaries of Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) are controlled by this Dutch Holding and must therefore be deemed to be Dutch entities under the BIT.\n\n152.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT provides that:\n\n\"For the purpose of this Agreement\n\n[...]\n\n\"(b) The term \"nationals\" shall comprise with regard to either Contracting Party:\n\n(i) national persons having the nationality of that Contracting Party;\n\n(ii) legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party;\n\n(iii) legal persons not constituted under the law of that Contracting Party, but controlled, directly or indirectly, by natural persons as defined in (i) or by legal persons as defined in (ii) above\".\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) owns 100 % of its US and Bahamian subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries are thus controlled directly or indirectly by a \"legal person constituted under the law\" of the Netherlands. Accordingly they must be deemed to be Dutch nationals under article 1 (b) (iii) of the BIT.\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent submits however, that this article is incompatible with Article 25 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention which, according to Venezuela, excludes the use of the control test for the determination of a corporation\u2019s nationality.\n\n155.\n\nArticle 25 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention provides the following definition of the term \"national of another Contracting State\":\n\n\"(i) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration, and,\n\n(ii) any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\".\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 25 fixes the \"outer limits\" of ICSID jurisdiction and that parties can consent to that jurisdiction only within those limits.\n\n157.\n\nHowever Article 25 (b) (i) does not impose any particular criteria of nationality (whether place of incorporation, *si\u00e8ge social* or control) in the case of juridical persons not having the nationality of the Host State. Thus the parties to the Dutch-Venezuela BIT were free to consider as nationals both the legal persons constituted under the law of one of the Parties and those constituted under another law, but controlled by such legal persons. The BIT is thus compatible with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that in fact Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) did not exercise any control on its subsidiaries. In the absence of genuine control, the BIT would not be applicable.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that a Protocol to the BIT was concluded on the same day by the Netherlands and Venezuela. This Protocol, which is an \"integral part\" of the BIT, provides in its paragraph 1 ad Article 1 (b) (iii) :\n\n\"A Contracting Party may require legal persons referred to in Article 1 Paragraph (b) (iii) to submit proof of such control in order to obtain the benefit provided for in the provisions of the Agreement. For example, the following may be considered acceptable proof:\n\na. that the legal person is an affiliate of a legal person constituted in the territory of the other Contracting Party;\n\nb. that the legal person is economically subordinated to a legal person constituted on the territory of the other Contracting Party\n\nc. that the percentage of its capital owned by national or legal persons of the other Contracting Party makes it possible for them to exercise control\".\n\n160.\n\nIn the present case, Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) owns 100 % of the share capital of its two American subsidiaries, which in turn own 100 % of the share capital of the two Bahamas subsidiaries. Thus the share capital of Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands) in those subsidiaries makes it possible for it to exercise control on them. The Tribunal does not have to consider whether or not such control was exercised in fact. In any case, under paragraph 1 (c) of the Protocol, those subsidiaries must be considered as nationals of the Netherlands benefiting of the provisions of the BIT.\n\n161.\n\nThis first objection to the tribunal jurisdiction based on the text of the BIT cannot be upheld.\n\n**(b) Direct and Indirect Investments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nVenezuela then submits that Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands), Mobil Cerro Negro Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware) are not entitled to assert claims against Venezuela for their indirect interests in the Venezuelan investment of their Bahamian subsidiaries. In this respect, it submits that \"the provisions of the Dutch Treaty establish that the obligations of a Contracting Party run only to nationals of the other Contracting Party with respect to their own investments and only to extent that those investments are located in the territory of the first Contracting Party\"99.\n\nReply \u00a7 167.\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants for their part contend that the BIT does not limit the definition of \"investment\" to direct investments. Moreover, it \"does not require that the claim be related to an investment \u2018in the territory\u2019 of Venezuela\"100. The Treaty was intended to protect investments in Venezuela held by a Netherlands company through a subsidiary whether such subsidiary is incorporated in the Netherlands or in a third country\"101.\n\nRejoinder \u00a7104.\n\n*Ibidem* \u00a7 105.\n\n164.\n\nThe BIT in its Article 1 provides that:\n\n\"For the purpose of this Agreement:\n\na. the term \"investment\" shall comprise every kind of asset and more particularly though not exclusively:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights *in rem* in respect of every kind of assets;\n\n(ii) rights derived from shares, bonds, and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures;\n\n(iii) title to money, to other assets as to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(iv) rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\n(v) rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources\".\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article 1 is very broad. It includes \"every kind of assets\" and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of \"shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures\". The plain meaning of this provision is that shares or other kind of interests held by Dutch shareholders in a company or in a joint venture having made investment on Venezuelan territory are protected under Article 1. The BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies between the ultimate owner of the company or of the joint venture and the investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments. Investments as defined in Article 1 could be direct or indirect as recognized in similar cases by ICSID Tribunals102.\n\n*Siemens AG v. The Argentine Republic -* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8 - Decision on Jurisdiction, (3 August 2004),- \u00a7136-137, 12 ICSID Reports 174 (2007) ; *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia -* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, (6 July 2007), \u00a7123-124.\n\n166.\n\nThe second objection to the Tribunal jurisdiction based on the text of the BIT cannot be upheld.\n\n**2- Abuse of right**\n---------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent then submits that the Exxon Mobil\u2019s corporate restructuring through the creation of the Dutch holding in 2005-2006 constituted an abuse of right and that, as a consequence, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the BIT. The Claimants contend that this allegation has no legal or factual basis.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the law applicable to abuse of right before applying it to the present case.\n\n**(a) The applicable law**\n--------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law. Reference may be made in this respect to \"good faith\" (\"bonne foi\"), \"d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir\" (misuse of power) or \"abus de droit\" (abuse of right).\n\n170.\n\nThe principle of good faith has been recognized by the International Court of Justice as \"one of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations\"103. It has been recognized in the law of treaties104 and has been referred to by a number of courts and tribunals including the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation105 and ICSID tribunals106.\n\nNuclear Tests - ICJ Report 1974 p. 268 \u00a746 - p.473 \u00a7 49; Armed action (Honduras v/Nicaragua - ICJ Report 1988 p. 105 \u00a7 94.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 23 May 1969, Articles 26and31 \u00a71.\n\nWTO Appellate Body WT/DS/08/AB/R - 24 February 2000 - US Tax Treatment for foreign sales corporations \u00a7 166- WT/DS/184/AB/R 24 July 2001.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation v.

Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26,(2 August 2006), \u00a7230.\n\n171.\n\nThe concept of *d\u00e9tournement de pouvoir* (misuse of power) has also been relied upon in international law, in particular in the law of the sea107, the law of international organisations108, and in European Community law109.\n\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982, Article 187.\n\nSee for instance Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation - Judgments N\u00b013 of 3 September 1954, N\u00b0 1129 of 3 July 1991 and N\u00b0 1392 of 1 February 1995.\n\nArticle 263 \u00a7 2 of the Treaty on European Union as revised in Lisbon. See for instance ECJC - Infried Hochbaumv. Commission - Aff. C 107/90 - Rep. 1992 p. 174 \u00a7 14.\n\n172.\n\nThe same is true of abuse of right. As Hersch Lauterpacht noted in his book entitled \"Development of International Law by the International Court\": \"There is no right, however well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on the ground that it has been abused\"110.\n\nSir Hersch Lauterpacht - Development of International Law by the International Court - London 1958 p. 164 - See also Oppenheim\u2019s International Law - Longman 9th Edition by Jennings and Watts Volume I \u00a7 124.\n\n173.\n\nIt has thus long been recognized in arbitration that \"abuse of authority\"111 or \"abuse of administration\"112 could engage State responsibility. The Permanent Court of International Justice referred in two judgments to \"abus de droit\" in general. In the Upper Silesia case, the Court recognized the right of Germany to dispose of her [its?] property in this district until the actual transfer of sovereignty has been made under the Versailles Treaty. However, it added that \"a misuse of this right could endow an act of alienation with the character of a breach of the Treaty\"113.\n\nMixed Claims Commission France-Venezuela - Lalanne and Ledour Case - United Nations Reports of International Awards - Volume X p. 17 and 18, in which the arbitrator sanctioned an \u00ab abuse of authority \u00bb of the President of the Venezuelan State of Guayana \u00bb.\n\nTacna - Arica Question (Chile v. Peru) - 4th March 1925 - United Nations Reports of International Arbitral awards - Volume II p. 941 and 945. In that case the arbitrator considered whether there had been \u00ab abuse of administration \u00bb by Chile in the disputed area. It arrives to the conclusion that Chile had used its conscription \"laws not so much for obtaining of recruits... but with the result, if not the purpose, of driving young Peruvians from the [disputed] provinces\u00bb. So far as it has been done, the Arbitrator holds it to be an abuse of Chilean authority \u00bb.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice - Polish Upper Silesia - PCIJ - Report - Serie A - Judgment N\u00b07 p. 30. The term \u00ab misuse of right \u00bb comes from the English version of the judgment. It corresponds to \u00ab abus de droit \u00bb and \u00ab manquement au principe de bonne foi \u00bb in the original French text.\n\n174.\n\nSome years later, in the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and District of Gex case, the Permanent Court recognized to France the right to impose \"fiscal taxes within the zones as apart from customs duties at the frontier\". However it added that \"a reservation must be made as regard the case of abuses of a right, since it is certain that France must not evade the obligation to maintain the zone by creating a customs barrier under the guise of a control cordon\"114.\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice - Free Zones of Upper Savoy and District of Gex - 7 June 1932 -Serie A.B N\u00b046.\n\n175.\n\nMore recently, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organisation stated that \"the principle of good faith, at once a general principle of law and general principle of international law, controls the exercise of rights by States. One application of this general principle, widely known as the doctrine of \"abus de droit\", prohibits the abusing exercise of a State\u2019s right\"115. The European Court of Justice in many cases also referred to such *Mbits de droit\"116.*\n\nWTO Appellate Body - Decision WT/DS58/AB/R of 12 December 1998 - US Import prohibition of certain shrimps and shrimps products \u00a7 158.\n\nSee Triantafilou, \u00ab L\u2019interdiction des abus de droit en tant que principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du droit communautaire \u00bb.

Venezuela,* the investor, a Mexican company, ICA, restructured its investment in a Venezuelan company, Aucoven in transferring 75 % of its shares to a US corporation. It was alleged by Venezuela that this restructuring had been an abuse of the corporate form in order to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal recalled that the transferee entity had been incorporated eight years before the parties entered into the concession agreement. It noted that the transferee was not just a shell corporation. It added that the Claimant had directly requested and had obtained in due time Venezuela\u2019s approval of the transfer of shares. It finally observed that the transfer was justified by the difficulties for Mexican companies to obtain financing for projects because of the peso crisis. On those bases it considered that the restructuring did not constitute \"an abuse of the Convention purposes\"121.\n\n*Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, CA v.

Ukraine,* the Claimant company was organised under Lithuanian law and was owned and controlled at 99 % by Ukrainian nationals. The tribunal noted that this enterprise was formed before the BIT between Ukraine and Lithuania entered into force. It added that there was \"no evidence in the record that the Claimant used its formal legal personality for any improper use\" such as fraud or malfeasance. It concluded that there had been no abuse of legal personality\"122. However, the President of the Tribunal dissented in a strongly motivated opinion noting that the investment had been made \"in Ukraine by Ukrainian citizens with Ukrainian capital\" and as such could not benefit from the protection of the ICSID mechanism123.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v.Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, (29 April 2004), \u00a7 53 to 56. 20 ICSID Review Foreign Investment Law Journal. 205 (2005).\n\n*Ibidem -* Dissenting Opinion \u00a7 23 and 25.\n\n180.\n\nIn *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia,* the Claimant, a Bolivian company, had entered into a water concession contract with the Bolivian authorities. Bechtel, a US corporation, owned 55 % of Aguas del Tunari. Bechtel then joined its water management projects with Edison and its shares in Aguas del Tunari were transferred to a Dutch company. The Tribunal was seized on the basis of the Dutch-Bolivian BIT. Bolivia argued that the Dutch entity was a mere shell created solely for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID and that therefore, the tribunal had no jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\n181.\n\nIn a divided opinion, the Tribunal held that the Dutch entity was \"not simply a corporation shell established to obtain ICSID jurisdiction over the case\"124. It added that \"it is not uncommon in practice and - absent a particular limitation - not illegal to locate one\u2019s operation in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment in terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction, including the availability of a BIT\"125. It concluded that it \"did not find a sufficient basis in the present record to support the allegation of abuse of corporate form or fraud\"126.\n\n*Aguas del Tunari SA. v.

Czech Republic.* In that case, the Claimant, Phoenix, was controlled by a former Czech national who incorporated Phoenix under Israeli law and caused it to acquire an interest in two Czech companies owned by members of his family. Before the acquisition, the Czech companies had already been involved in lawsuits in the Czech Republic and in disputes with the Czech authorities. Approximately two months after the acquisition, Phoenix notified the Czech Republic of an investment dispute and subsequently commenced ICSID arbitration.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal examined successively the timing of the investment, the initial request to ICSID, the timing of the claim, the substance of the transaction, and the true nature of the operation. It noted that \"all the damages claimed by Phoenix had already occurred and were inflicted on the two Czech companies, when the alleged investment was made\". It observed that the initial request \"was based on a claim by the two Czech companies, which were supposedly assigned to Phoenix\". It added that the timing of the claim showed that \"what was really at stake were indeed the pre-investment violations and damages\". The \"whole operation was not an economic investment, based on the actual or future value of the companies, but indeed, simply a rearrangement of assets within a family, to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction. Moreover, \"no activity was either launched or tried after the alleged investment was made\". \"All the elements analysed lead to the same conclusion of an abuse of right\". As a consequence the Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction on the Claimant\u2019s request127.\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd v.The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, (15 April 2009),- \u00a7 136 to 145.\n\n184.\n\nThose decisions and awards use different criteria to determine in each case whether or not there has been abuse of right. But in all cases, as stated by Professor Prosper Weil in his dissenting opinion in Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, the question is to give \"effect to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention\" and to preserve \"its integrity\"128.\n\n*Tokio Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine -* Dissenting Opinion \u00a7 25.\n\n185.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal has to act accordingly and to consider whether or not the restructuring of Mobil\u2019s investments in Venezuela in 2005-2006 is to be deemed as an abuse of right and as a consequence whether or not it has jurisdiction under the BIT.\n\n**(b) Application of the Law to the Case**\n------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nInitially, Mobil investments in Venezuela were structured as follows:\n\n(i) Mobil (Delaware) owned 100% of Mobil CN Holding (Delaware), which in turn owned 100 % of Mobil CN Holding (Bahamas), which has a 41 2/3 % participation in the Cerro Negro Association.\n\n(ii) Mobil (Delaware) also owned 100 % of Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware), which in turn owned 100 % of Mobil Venezolana (Bahamas), which had a 50 % participation in the La Ceiba Association.\n\n187.\n\nOn 27 October 2005, Claimants created a new entity under the law of the Netherlands, called Venezuela Holdings. On 21 February 2006, this entity acquired all the shares of Mobil CN Holding (Delaware). Then on 23 November 2006, it also acquired all the shares of Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware). The Dutch holding company was thus inserted into the corporate chain for the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba projects.\n\n188.\n\nRespondent submits that this restructuring occurred long after the investments. It adds that it did not consent to it. It contends that \"the disputes were not only foreseeable, but they had actually been identified and notified to Respondent before the Dutch company was even created\"129. Thus, according to Venezuela, the only purpose of this restructuring was to gain access to ICSID for existing disputes. This was \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs\"130. According to Venezuela it is therefore the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such manipulation and to decline its jurisdiction.\n\nRejoinder p. 83.\n\nRejoinder p. 147.\n\n189.\n\nClaimants contest each of those points. They explain that they were \"surprised\" by Venezuela\u2019s \"unilateral imposition of a 16 2/3 % royalty rate in October 2004\", which in their opinion was contrary to the existing agreements. They say that Mobil promptly \"undertook a review of the extent of the legal protection for its investments in Venezuela\". Upon doing so, it concluded in early 2005 that it should restructure its Venezuelan investments through a holding company incorporated in the Netherlands, which had a bilateral investment treaty with Venezuela\"131. This choice was considered as \"logical\", taking into account the double taxation agreements concluded by the Netherlands and the activities that Exxon Mobil already had in that country.\n\nCounter Memorial \u00a7 195-197.\n\n190.\n\nIt thus appears to the Tribunal that the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT.\n\n191.\n\nSuch restructuring could be \"legitimate corporate planning\" as contended by the Claimants or an \"abuse of right\" as submitted by the Respondents. It depends upon the circumstances in which it happened.\n\n192.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal first observes that, contrary to the situation in *Autopista v. Venezuela,* there was no contractual obligation in the present case for Mobil or its subsidiaries to submit the proposed restructuring to the approval of the Venezuelan authorities. Yet, Mobil did not hide this operation. In fact, Mobil Cerro Negro notified the Respondent of Venezuela Holdings\u2019 ownership of the Cerro Negro investment on 16 October 2006. On 7 March 2007, Venezuela Holdings also informed Venezuela of the acquisition of the La Ceiba investments. The Respondent did not raise any objection at the time.\n\n193.\n\nWith respect to the timing of the investments, the Tribunal observes that, as stated by the Respondent, \"the main investment at issue is the investment in the Cerro Negro project\"132. The bulk of this investment, *i.e.* 1,915 billion US dollars, was made from 1999 to 2002. \"By 2000, sales from early production of extra-heavy crude oil blended with condensate had commenced. By 2001 the upgrade had been completed and by 2002 the project was already generating more than enough income to cover all its expenses and cash needs\"133.\n\nReply \u00a7 119.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n194.\n\nAs a consequence from 2002 to 2005, the annual investment was far smaller than before and varied from a minimum of 45 million US dollars in 2003 to a maximum of 175 million US dollars in 2005.\n\n195.\n\nIn the last period, however, a gas facility modification and new wells (Pad 8) were constructed. The wells were completed in late 20 05134 and the gas facility became operational in December 2006135. The investments in 2006 amounted to 89 million US dollars.\n\nReply \u00a7 124.\n\nRejoinder-footnote 183.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal does not have at its disposal such precise figures in the case of the La Ceiba project. However the Claimants submit that in \"December 2005, Mobil Venezolana, along with its partner, Petro-Canada La Ceiba GmbH, commited itself to invest roughly US $ 1.3 billion in the La Ceiba project. Mobil re-confirmed its intention to proceed with that investment in January 2007\". This is not contested by the Respondent.\n\n197.\n\nMoreover, it is not disputed that the Claimants contributed their part to those investments.\n\n198.\n\nIt thus appears that in 2005-2006, the two projects had developed normally through the required investments. Therefore the investments made in 2006 in Cerro Negro were far lower than those made each year from 1999 to 2001 (although higher than in 2002 and 2003). As stated by the Respondent, they were financed, as through the funds \"generated by the project itself rather than brought into Venezuela from or through the Netherlands\"136. This was so because the project was already \"up and running\"137. The situation in the present case is thus quite different from the situation which the arbitral tribunal had to consider in the Phoenix case. The limited amount of investment made in particular in 2006 and the fact that it was financed without external funding was in harmony with the project at the time of the restructuring as it then stood. No adverse inference can be drawn from that situation. It should also be added that the Treaty contains no requirement that the origin of the capital be foreign. Nor does general international law provide a basis for imposing such a requirement138.\n\nReply \u00a7 124.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nFor comparable cases, see *Olguin v. Paraguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5, Award, (26 July 2001), IIC 97 (2001) at 13 n 4; *Saipem S.p.a. v. The People Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, (21 March 2007), IIC 280 (2007) at 106\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn from the timing of the investment to the timing of the dispute. To that end, it will recall what complaints had already been lodged by the Claimants at the time of the restructuring.\n\n200.\n\nIn two letters dated 2 February 2005, and 18 May 2005, drafted in comparable terms, the Claimants first complained of the increase from 1 % to 16 2/3 % of the royalties decided by Venezuela both for the Cerro Negro and the La Ceiba projects. They requested the Government to designate representatives to meet with them in order to discuss an amicable settlement. They added that \"as you well know, in accordance with Article 22 of the Investment Law, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has consented to submit to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, investment disputes between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and foreign investors\". They went on, consenting \"to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction for arbitration of the investment dispute, and of any further investment dispute with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, so that, should arbitration become necessary, it can be carried out under the ICSID Convention\". They finally concluded in requesting \"an early meeting to commence consultation\" in order \"to explore an amicable solution of the matter\"139.\n\nQuotations from the letter of 18 May 2005.\n\n201.\n\nThen, on 20 June 2005, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Mobil Cerro Negro and Operadora Cerro Negro informed the Venezuelan authorities that the recent ministerial decision to increase the royalties to 30 % \"has broadened the investment dispute\" previously brought to their attention. They stated that the introduction of a bill that would increase income tax rates from 34 % to 50 % would further broaden that dispute. They contended those decisions were \"in breach of the obligations\" of Venezuela and requested again consultations \"in an effort to reach an amicable resolution of this matter\". They recalled Article 22 of the Investment Law and the position they took on this matter in their previous letters. They added that \"[o]ut of an abundance of caution, each of the Mobil Parties hereby confirms its consent to ICSID jurisdiction over the broadened dispute described above and any other investment disputes with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela existing at the present time or that may arise in the future, including without limitation any dispute arising out of any expropriation or confiscation of all or part of the investment\" of the Mobil Parties.\n\n202.\n\nIt results from those letters that in June 2005 there were already pending disputes between the Parties relating to the increase of royalties and income taxes decided by Venezuela. Claimants had even accepted to submit those disputes to ICSID arbitration under Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law. \"Out of an abundance of caution\", they had further indicated that on the same basis they were also consenting to arbitration for any future dispute, including future dispute arising from expropriation or confiscation.\n\n203.\n\nAs recalled above, the restructuring of Mobil\u2019s investments through the Dutch entity occurred from October 2005 to November 2006. At that time, there were already pending disputes relating to royalties and income tax. However, nationalisation measures were taken by the Venezuelan authorities only from January 2007 on. Thus, the dispute over such nationalisation measures can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were taken.\n\n204.\n\nAs stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.\n\n205.\n\nWith respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs140. The Claimants seem indeed to be conscious of this, when they state that they \"invoke ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the consent expressed in the Treaty only for disputes arising under the Treaty for action that the Respondent took or continued to take after the restructuring was completed\"141.\n\n*Phoenix v. Czech Republic - \u00a7* 144.\n\nReply \u00a74.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal thus:\n\na. has jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT with respect to any dispute born after 21 February 2006 for the Cerro Negro project and after 23 November 2006 for the La Ceiba project, and in particular with respect to the pending dispute relating to the nationalisation of the investments;\n\nb. has no jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT with respect to any dispute born before those dates.\n\n207.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Mobil Corporation has only raised claims on the basis of Article 22 of the Investment Law and not on the basis of the BIT. In \u00a7 140 above, the Tribunal has concluded that Article 22 of the Investment Law does not provide a basis for jurisdiction in the present case. As a consequence, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims of Mobil Corporation, which will thus not be a Party to the continuation of these proceedings.\n\n**C - COSTS OF THE PROCEEDINGS**\n--------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal makes no order at this stage regarding the costs of the proceeding and reserves it to a later stage of the arbitration.\n\n**IV.

THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n28.\n\nThis Chapter summarizes the factual background of this arbitration insofar as is necessary to understand the issues that are raised in this case.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe five Claimants and their investments in Venezuela relevant to the present dispute are as follows1:\n\n(a) Venezuela Holdings, B.V. (Venezuela Holdings) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Venezuela Holdings' address is Graaf Engelbertlaan 75, Breda, 4837 DS, The Netherlands. Venezuela Holdings held, through the other Claimants described below, investments in the Cerro Negro Association and the La Ceiba Association;\n\n(b) Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd. (Mobil Cerro Negro Holding) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America. Mobil Cerro Negro Holding's address is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19808, United States of America. Mobil Cerro Negro Holding is a wholly owned subsidiary of Venezuela Holdings;\n\n(c) Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. (Mobil Cerro Negro) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Mobil Cerro Negro is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mobil Cerro Negro Holding. Mobil Cerro Negro was a party to the Cerro Negro Association Agreement and owned a 41 2/3% participation in the Cerro Negro Association;\n\n(d) Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings Inc. (Mobil Venezolana Holdings) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America. Mobil Venezolana Holdings' address is 2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, Delaware 19808, United States of America. Mobil Venezolana Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Venezuela Holdings; and\n\n(e) Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Inc. (Mobil Venezolana) is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Mobil Venezolana's address is Shirley House, 50 Shirley St., Nassau, New Providence, Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Mobil Venezolana was a party to the La Ceiba Association Agreement and owned a 50% participation in the La Ceiba Project.\n\nThe term \"the Claimants\" is used to refer to all of the Claimants collectively, as they remain after the Decision on Jurisdiction. To avoid repeated references to the \"Cerro Negro Claimants\" or \"La Ceiba Claimants\", the term \"the Claimants\" is also used to refer to a subset of the Claimants that have brought a particular claim. Accordingly, when referring to claims related to the Cerro Negro Project, \"the Claimants\" should be understood to refer to Venezuela Holdings, Mobil Cerro Negro, and Mobil Cerro Negro Holdings (the Cerro Negro Claimants). When referring to claims related to the La Ceiba Project, \"Claimants\" should be understood to refer to Venezuela Holdings, Mobil Venezolana, and Mobil Venezolana Holding (the La Ceiba Claimants). A graphical representation of each of the Claimants and their respective investments is at Mem. M., Annex A. Pursuant to the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, Mobil Corporation is no longer a Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Covington & Burling, LLP.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by the Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica and Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle, LLP.\n\n**B. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS**\n--------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe following summary is meant to give a general overview of the present dispute. It does not include all factual aspects that may be of relevance, particularly as these emerged from the extensive testimony of witnesses and experts at the hearing on the merits. Such testimony, insofar as it is relevant, will be discussed in the context of the Tribunal's analysis of the disputed issues.\n\n34.\n\nThe facts set forth in this section are those which are alleged by the Parties and that the Tribunal has found to be supported by the evidentiary record, as well as facts alleged by one Party that have not been disputed by the other. Where a fact is in dispute, the Tribunal has indicated as such.\n\n**1. Venezuela's Oil Reserves**\n-------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nVenezuela is one of the world's leading petroleum producing countries2. The petroleum industry in Venezuela has always been a strategic sector of vital national importance to the economy3.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 24.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 9.\n\n36.\n\nIn 1975, the oil industry was nationalized through the Organic Law that Reserves to the State the Industry and Trade of Hydrocarbons (\"1975 Nationalization Law\")4. The Law terminated the oil concessions held by private companies, expropriated their operating assets and generally reserved oil industry activities to the State5.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 10; Mem. M. \u00b6 28.\n\nMem. M. K 28; Mem. J. K 10.\n\n37.\n\nArticle 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law provided that activities in the Venezuelan petroleum industry were to be carried out by the State acting through State-owned entities. A new State-owned entity called Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\") was created to manage the \"reserved\" activities6. The Respondent was, and continues to be, PDVSA's sole shareholder7. After the passage of the 1975 Nationalization Law, PDVSA and its subsidiaries carried out activities in the Venezuelan petroleum industry, without the equity participation of private parties, for the following 15 years8.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 28.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 28.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 13.\n\n38.\n\nBy the 1980s, the Respondent wished to explore new fields or to look to the country's vast reserves of extra-heavy oil9. These reserves were primarily located in reservoirs in the Orinoco River Basin, in the Orinoco Oil Belt (*la Faja Petrol\u00edfera del Orinoco)*, which is a vast area covering approximately 55,000 square kilometres10. The Orinoco Oil Belt was divided into four areas, from east to west: Cerro Negro (renamed Carabobo), Hamaca (later renamed Ayacucho), Zuata (later renamed Jun\u00edn) and Machete (later renamed Boyac\u00e1)11.\n\nMem.

M. \u00b6 26; Cline Report at p. 5.\n\n39.\n\nTo meet these goals, the Respondent adopted a series of measures, collectively known as the *Apertura Petrolera* (\"Oil Opening\"), which allowed foreign investors to participate in the Venezuelan oil industry. One of the objectives of the Oil Opening was the development of the extra-heavy oil reservoirs in the Orinoco Oil Belt12.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 33.\n\n**2. The Oil Opening**\n----------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Oil Opening was implemented on the basis of Article 5 of the Nationalization Law, which authorized PDVSA to enter into two types of agreements with private companies13:\n\n(i) operating services agreements - which required private companies to provide specified services to PDVSA in exchange for a fee14; and\n\n(ii) association agreements - which were contractual joint ventures that PDVSA could form with private companies for a specified term in \"special cases [...] convenient to the public interest\"15. These agreements required specific authorization by the Venezuelan Congress16.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 34; Bond Offering Memorandum, Cerro Negro Finance Ltd. (11 June 1998) at F-6 (Ex.

C-214).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n41.\n\nTo encourage investment, the Respondent introduced economic incentives. These included:\n\n(i) Reduction in the income tax rate\n------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn August 1991, the Respondent amended the Income Tax Law to provide that income arising from new exploitation and refinement of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil under association agreements would be subject to the general corporate rate (then 30%) instead of the rate applicable to other oil activities (then 67.7%)17. In 1993, the Respondent enacted Decree No. 188 on Amendment to the Income Tax Law (*Decreto de Reforma de la Ley de Impuesto sobre la Renta*) expressly providing that participants in \"vertically integrated projects related to the exploitation, refining, industrialization, emulsification, transport and commercialization of extra-heavy crude oil\" would be subject to the general corporate rate of 30%, instead of the 67.7% rate otherwise applicable to oil activities18. This general corporate rate was later raised to 34%19.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 49.\n\nMem. M. \u00b650. See also 1993 Law on Partial Amendment to the Income Tax Law *(Ley de Reforma Parcial de la* *Ley de Impuesto sobre la Renta*) (26 August 1993), Article 1 (Ex. C-58).\n\nMem. M. \u00b650. See also Decree No. 188 on Amendment to the Income Tax Law *(Decreto de Reforma de la Ley de Impuesto sobre la Renta*) (25 May 1994) (Ex. C-59).\n\n(ii) Reduction in the Applicable Royalty\n----------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe 1943 Hydrocarbons Law then in force empowered the Respondent to reduce the \"exploitation tax\" (*i.e.*, the royalty payable) in some circumstances. It provides that:\n\n\"All concessionaires referred to in Article 39 shall pay (...)  \n 1. - The exploitation tax, which will be equal to 16 2/3 percent of the crude oil extracted, measured in the production field in the facilities where the inspection is carried out (...)  \n Sole Paragraph- For the purpose of extending the economic exploitation of certain concessions, the Federal Executive is hereby authorized to reduce the exploitation tax referred to in this subparagraph in those cases in which it is demonstrated to its satisfaction that the increasing production cost, including tax amounts, has reached the limit which does not permit commercial exploitation. The Federal Executive may also increase again the reduced exploitation tax until restoring it to its original amount, when, in its judgment, the causes which gave rise to the reduction have changed20\".\n\n1943 Hydrocarbons Law, Article 41(1) and Sole Paragraph (Ex. Ex. R-30).\n\n44.\n\nExercising the discretion conferred on it by this provision, the Respondent, through the La Ceiba Royalty Reduction Agreement, provided that the applicable royalty would be 16 2/3% during early production and would be reduced, according to a sliding scale, once commercial production was achieved. The sliding scale linked the royalty rate (ranging from 1% to 16 2/3%), to the profitability of the project21. Similarly, under the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement, the royalty rate was set at 16 2/3% during the early production phase of the Project22. Upon achieving commercial production, the rate would be reduced to one percent until such time as the accumulated gross income from the Project exceeded three times the total initial investment, but in no event would the reduction period exceed nine years from the beginning of commercial production. On expiry of the reduction, the royalty rate would revert to 16 2/3%.\n\nMem. M. \u00b654.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 57.\n\n**3. Mobil Investment**\n-----------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn September 1990, PDVSA approached Mobil Corporation23 to \"hear out and react to\" PDVSA's \"new policy of international cooperation being considered to foster expansion\"24. Eventually, after studies, discussions and negotiations25, Mobil participated in two projects that the Respondent offered during the Oil Opening: (i) the Cerro Negro Project - a joint venture to exploit extra-heavy crude in the Orinoco Oil Belt26; and (ii) the La Ceiba Project - a joint venture to explore and exploit, on a shared-risk-and-profit basis, an area with light and medium crude potential adjacent to Lake Maracaibo27.\n\nMobil Corporation is a corporation organized and existing under the law of the State of Delaware, United States of America. It owns all of the equity of Operadora Cerro Negro, S.A. and Agencia Operadora La Ceiba. Mobil Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. Exxon Corporation and Mobil Corporation merged on 30 November 1999 to form the Exxon Mobil Corporation.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 44\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 4.\n\nCerro Negro Association Agreement (Ex.

Cerro Negro Investment**\n-----------------------------\n\n(a) *Context of the Cerro Negro Investment*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn December 1991, Mobil and Lagoven S.A. (\"Lagoven\" or \"PDVSA P&G\")28 agreed to conduct a joint study to determine the feasibility of producing, transporting, upgrading and marketing extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco Oil Belt29. On 20 December 1994, Lagoven and Mobil signed a Letter of Intent agreeing to conduct a joint project study to determine the optimum technical, marketing, economic, financial, legal and fiscal conditions required to develop an extra-heavy oil project30.\n\nAlong with Corpoven and Maraven, Lagoven was one of the three main operating subsidiaries of PDVSA until 1 January 1998. On 1 January 1998, as part of a corporate reorganization, Lagoven and Maraven were merged into Corpoven. Corpoven was then renamed PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo y Gas, S.A.\n\nRFA \u00b6 60.\n\nRFA \u00b6 64.\n\n47.\n\nOn 17 September 1996, Lagoven, Mobil and Mobil Producci\u00f3n e Industrializaci\u00f3n de Venezuela, Inc. (\"Mobil PIV\")31 signed a non-binding Heads of Agreement (\"First Heads of Agreement\")32 concerning the proposed terms and conditions of: (i) the Cerro Negro synthetic crude oil joint venture (\"Cerro Negro Association\"); and (ii) a second joint venture that would own and operate the Chalmette Refinery in Louisiana, which would buy synthetic crude oil from the Cerro Negro Association and refine it using specially designated facilities33. Lagoven and Mobil would have equal equity participation in each joint venture34.\n\nMobil PIV is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America. Mobil PIV acquired a 41 2/3% interest in the Cerro Negro Association when the association was formed on 28 October 1997. At that time, Mobil PIV was a wholly owned subsidiary of Mobil Corporation. Mobil PIV assigned its interest in the Association Agreement to Mobil Cerro Negro on 29 October 1997.\n\nHeads of Agreement among Lagoven, S.A., Mobil Oil Corporation and Mobil Producci\u00f3n e Industrializaci\u00f3n de Venezuela dated 17 September 1996 (hereinafter \"First Heads of Agreement\") (Ex. C-238).\n\nRFA \u00b6 70.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n48.\n\nThe First Heads of Agreement provided that Lagoven would compensate Mobil PIV in the event that certain governmental actions resulted in a \"Material Adverse Impact\"35. Specific limits were placed on the circumstances under which compensation would be granted and the extent of such compensation, as discussed further below36.\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b6 21.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 24.\n\n49.\n\nOn 1 January 1997, Lagoven, Mobil and Veba Oel37 signed a Second Heads of Agreement, which superseded certain parts of First Heads of Agreement. Under the Second Heads of Agreement, Lagoven and Mobil PIV would each own a 41 2/3% interest in the synthetic crude oil joint venture, and Veba Orinoco38 would own the remaining 16 2/3% interest39.\n\nVeba Oel is an oil and gas exploration and production company based in Germany. Veba Oel was acquired by BP Amoco in 2002.\n\nVeba Oel Venezuela Orinoco, GmbH (\"Veba Orinoco\") is a subsidiary of Veba Oel and participant in the Cerro Negro Association. Veba Orinoco held a 16 2/3% interest.\n\nRFA \u00b6 74.\n\n50.\n\nNegotiations progressed between the Parties and proved successful. In order to proceed further, the authorization of the Venezuelan Congress was required pursuant to Article 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law. Consequently, on 17 March 1997, the Ministry of Energy and Mines (\"MEM\")40 submitted to the Venezuelan Congress, the proposed Framework of Conditions for the Cerro Negro Association (*Marco de Condiciones*)41.\n\nOn 20 January 2005, President Chavez changed the name of the Ministry of Energy and Mines to Ministry of Energy and Petroleum. On 8 January 2007, President Chavez changed the name again to Ministry of the People's Power for Energy and Petroleum.

M. \u00b6 67.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n57.\n\nThe Cerro Negro Association Agreement established an unincorporated joint venture for a term of thirty-five years starting from 30 June 200067. The project contemplated by the Cerro Negro Association Agreement - the Cerro Negro Project - was a set of activities that included68 (i) exploiting and developing the extra-heavy crude oil fields in the Cerro Negro area; (ii) constructing and operating an upgrader in the Jose Industrial Complex on the Venezuelan coast with the capacity to upgrade approximately 120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy crude oil to a level of 16.5\u00b0 API; (iii) laying and operating pipelines between the Cerro Negro area and the Jose Industrial Complex (approximately 315 km); and (iv) selling the resulting products of Mobil Cerro Negro and PDVSA-CN to Chalmette Refining69. The Cerro Negro Association Agreement authorized the parties to expand the capacity of the Project to produce extra-heavy crude as well as its capacity to upgrade that crude into synthetic crude oil. An expansion project could be undertaken by unanimous agreement of the participants or, alternatively, under certain conditions, by fewer than all of the participants70.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nMem.

This compensation structure was also contained in the Cerro Negro Association Agreement75. Clause 15 provided that PDVSA-CN would compensate Mobil Cerro Negro and Veba Orinoco for the economic consequences of governmental measures defined as \"Discriminatory Measures\"76. The relevant compensation provisions of the Cerro Negro Association Agreement began with the definition of the term \"Discriminatory Measure\" as follows77:\n\n\"\u2018Discriminatory Measure\" shall mean any change in (or any change in the interpretation or application of) Venezuelan law, or any Governmental Measure, which is unjust and is applicable to the Project or any Foreign Party in its capacity as a participant in the Project and is not generally applied to public or private entities engaged in Extraheavy crude upgrading projects in the Republic of Venezuela; or, with respect to tax rates, foreign exchange controls or the expropriation or seizure [\"ocupaci\u00f3n\"] of assets of the Project or of a Foreign Party's interests in the Project, provided that such change in (or any change in the interpretation or application of) Venezuelan law, or any Governmental Measure is not generally applicable to Companies in the Republic of Venezuela (including the imposition of income tax on the Project or on any Foreign Party in its capacity as a participant in the Project, at a rate that does not correspond with what is set forth in the last sentence of the Fifteenth Condition); or with respect to municipal taxes (license to perform industrial and commercial activities), the imposition of municipal taxes on the Foreign Parties in their capacity as participants in the Association notwithstanding the provision in the Fifteenth Condition, only if the aggregate burden of the municipal taxes on the affected Foreign Party's gross revenue from the Project exceeds by four percent (4%) the affected Foreign Party's gross revenue from the Project in the Fiscal Year at issue, in which event the amount of municipal taxes that exceeds such four percent (4%) shall be a discriminatory measure. A measure that falls within the definition of Discriminatory Measure shall be deemed unjust if it results in a Material Adverse Impact.\"\n\nC-Mem.

M. \u00b6 22.\n\n60.\n\nClause 15 of the Cerro Negro Association Agreement then provided substantive provisions for compensation for Discriminatory Measures. These provisions set forth the requirements for obtaining compensation, such as giving immediate notice to PDVSA-CN upon the occurrence of an event that might lead to a \"Material Adverse Impact\" (as defined in the Agreement), giving another notice immediately to PDVSA-CN upon determination by the party seeking compensation that it actually had suffered a \"Material Adverse Impact\", and taking all steps to \"reverse or obtain relief from\" the measure in question78. Pursuant to this provision, Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd. initiated arbitration proceedings at the ICC International Court of Arbitration (see below).\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b6 24.\n\n61.\n\nClause 15 also established the limitation of liability referred to in the Twentieth Condition of the Framework Conditions for the Cerro Negro Association. Specifically, Clause 15.2 provided as follows79:\n\n\"15.2 Limitation on Lagoven CN's Obligation. (a)... after the first period of six (6) consecutive months during which the Price of Brent Crude exceeds the Base Price, Lagoven CN shall not have the obligation to compensate any Foreign Party for Discriminatory Measures with respect to any Fiscal Year in which the average Price of Brent Crude Oil exceeds Base Price, and such Foreign Party receives a Net Cash Flow, after taking into account the effect of the Discriminatory Measure, commensurate with a reference price for the Production produced by the Parties which bears at least a reasonable relationship, adjusted for quality and transportation differences, to the Reference Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year.\"\n\nCerro Negro Association Agreement, Articles 15.1(a)-(c), 15.2(a) (Ex.

The agreement provided for a royalty reduction for Orinoco Oil Belt projects in accordance with the following formula: the applicable royalty would be 16 2/3% (the maximum allowed under the then existing law) during the early production or development phase of the project. Upon achieving commercial production (defined under the Cerro Negro Association Agreement as the upgrader completion date), the royalty would be reduced to 1% until such time as the accumulated gross income from the project exceeded three times the total investment (from the start of the project until the beginning of commercial production), but in no event would the reduction period exceed nine years from the beginning of commercial production81.

M. \u00b694.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n74.\n\nThe international tender process contemplated by the Framework of Conditions for At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Exploration Agreements (also known as the Exploration Bidding Round), took place between July 1995 and January 1996108. On 5 December 1995, Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. (\"CVP\")109 and the MEM entered into a Royalty Reduction Agreement for At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Exploration Projects (the \"La Ceiba Royalty Reduction Agreement\")110. Under that agreement, the royalty would be 16 2/3% during early production and would be reduced, according to a sliding scale, once commercial production was achieved111.\n\nMem.

Mobil Venezolana formed a consortium with Veba Oel Venezuela Exploration GmbH (\"Veba La Ceiba\") and Nippon Oil Exploration (Venezuela), Inc. (\"Nippon La Ceiba\") (collectively, \"the Mobil Consortium\") to bid for the La Ceiba area113. Mobil Venezolana held a 50% interest in the Mobil Consortium, Veba La Ceiba held a 30% interest, and Nippon La Ceiba held the remaining 20% interest114.\n\nMem. M. \u00b696.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nMem. M. \u00b696, fn. 192.\n\n76.\n\nOn 16 January 1996, the Respondent awarded the La Ceiba area to the Mobil Consortium115. On 19 June 1996, the Venezuelan Congress determined that the La Ceiba Association Agreement complied with the terms of the Framework of Conditions for At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Association Agreements and authorized execution of the La Ceiba Association Agreement116.\n\nMem. M. \u00b699.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n(b) *Elements of the La Ceiba Investment*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nOn 10 July 1996, CVP, Mobil Venezolana, Veba La Ceiba and Nippon La Ceiba entered into the La Ceiba Association Agreement to explore, develop and exploit oil fields in the La Ceiba area117. The La Ceiba Association Agreement expressly provided that it imposed no limitations on the sovereign rights of the Respondent118.

M. \u00b6100.\n\n79.\n\nThe La Ceiba Association Agreement provided for the creation of a management company, Administradora La Ceiba, to direct, coordinate and supervise the Project122. CVP held a 35% interest in Administradora La Ceiba and Mobil Venezolana and Petro-Canada each held a 32.5% interest123. The La Ceiba Association Agreement also established a Control Committee, which was responsible for \"fundamental decisions of national interest to the Venezuelan State related to the performance\" of the agreement124.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6101.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n80.\n\nIn the event of an oil discovery, the private investors were entitled to submit an Evaluation Plan for assessment of the commercial potential of the discovery to Administradora La Ceiba and the Control Committee125. Upon a Declaration of Commerciality (*i.e*., the notification of an intention to prepare and submit a Development Plan for approval), Mobil Venezolana and Petro-Canada could submit a Development Plan to Administradora La Ceiba and the Control Committee for approval126.\n\nMem.

(\"Operadora La Ceiba\", a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobil), Administradora La Ceiba, CVP, Mobil Venezolana, Veba La Ceiba and Nippon La Ceiba entered into the La Ceiba Operating Agreement127. Under that agreement, all activities related to the exploration, development and exploitation of the fields in the La Ceiba area were entrusted to Operadora La Ceiba128.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n82.\n\nBased on those exploration activities, on 11 December 2001, Operadora La Ceiba submitted an Evaluation Plan to Administradora La Ceiba and the Control Committee129. Administradora La Ceiba and the Control Committee approved the Evaluation Plan soon after it was submitted130.\n\nMem.

On 12 December 2005, Operadora La Ceiba, acting on behalf of Mobil Venezolana and Petro-Canada, submitted to Administradora La Ceiba a detailed Development Plan, which set forth the technical and financial blueprint for exploiting commercial discoveries in the La Ceiba area132. The Development Plan called for an investment of U.S.$1,347 billion to produce up to 50,000 barrels of oil per day for an estimated field life of 27 years133.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 109.\n\nMem.

Each of them also agreed to reduce, *pro rata*, its 50% interest in the project once CVP declared its intent to participate in the consortium and designated its percentage interest, up to a limit of 35%135.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 111.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n85.\n\nThe Development Plan was automatically approved by Administradora La Ceiba on 27 January 2007, under the terms of the La Ceiba Association Agreement136. The Development Plan should then have been submitted to the Control Committee for final approval. However, as asserted by the Claimant, \"the Respondent frustrated that step and soon thereafter expropriated the Claimants' interests in the Project\"137.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 113. The La Ceiba Association Agreement provides that \"any proposal as to which no decision is made within [60 days] shall be deemed approved\". See La Ceiba Association Agreement (Ex.

Origin of the Present Dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the alleged wrongful measures at issue in the present case were all taken after Mr. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez Fr\u00edas was elected President of Venezuela in December 1998138. In approximate chronological order, the alleged adverse measures taken by the Respondent for which the Claimant seeks compensation include the following139:\n\n1. The unilateral termination of the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement and the Cerro Negro Royalty Procedures Agreement;\n\n2. The further increase in the royalty rate through the imposition of the extraction tax;\n\n3. The increase in the income tax rate applicable to participants in Orinoco Oil Belt ventures;\n\n4. The production and export curtailments imposed on the Cerro Negro Project; and\n\n5. The direct expropriation of Mobil Cerro Negro's and Mobil Venezolana's entire interests in the activities of the Cerro Negro Joint Venture and the La Ceiba Joint Venture, as well as the related assets.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 122. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez became President of Venezuela in February 1999.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6124.\n\n87.\n\nThe facts relevant to these alleged wrongful measures are discussed below.\n\n(a) *Increase in the Royalty Rate in 2004 and 2005*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAs indicated above, a reduced royalty rate was applicable to the Cerro Negro Investment and the La Ceiba Investment. On 13 November 2001, President Ch\u00e1vez (exercising delegated legislative powers) issued the Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, replacing the 1975 Nationalization Law and the 1943 Hydrocarbons Law140. Under the new law, production activities were reserved to the State, and private Parties would be authorized to participate in those activities only through mixed enterprises in which the State owned more than 50% of the shares141. Any production from a mixed enterprise would be subject to a royalty of 30% and would have to be sold to PDVSA or another State-owned company142.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6127; 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons *(Ley Org\u00e1nica de Hidrocarburos)* (Ex. C-93).\n\nMem. M. \u00b6127.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n89.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, both before and after the adoption of the 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, President Ch\u00e1vez's administration reaffirmed its assurances that pre-existing contracts (such as the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Association Agreements) would be respected143. Further, on 16 January 2002, the MEM and Operadora Cerro Negro (on behalf of the Cerro Negro Project participants) signed an Agreement on Procedures for the Payment of the Exploitation Tax (Royalty) of the Extra-Heavy Crude Produced and the Sulphur Extracted by Operadora Cerro Negro, S.A. (\"Royalty Procedures Agreement\")144. Although the 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons (which provided for a royalty rate of 30%) was already in effect, the Royalty Procedures Agreement reaffirmed that the royalty for participants in the Cerro Negro Project would remain at the reduced rate of 1% in accordance with the formula set forth in the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement and that it would not exceed 16 2/3% during the lifetime of the Project145.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6128.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6131.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6131; Royalty Procedures Agreement (Ex. C-30).\n\n90.\n\nHowever, on 19 October 2004, PDVSA served notice on Mr. Mark Ward, President of ExxonMobil de Venezuela S.A. (\"ExxonMobil de Venezuela\")146 that, by order of President Ch\u00e1vez, the MEM was \"leaving without effect\" the 1% royalty rate that had been guaranteed by the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement147. A royalty rate of 16 2/3% was imposed on the Project starting from 11 October 2004148.\n\nAn affiliate of Mobil Cerro Negro.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6134.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, at the time, neither of the alternative conditions specified in the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement for ending the rate reduction had been met. Specifically, (i) the accumulated gross income from the Cerro Negro Project had not reached three times the aggregate investment, and (ii) nine years had not yet elapsed since the beginning of commercial production149. This is not disputed by the Respondent, who emphasizes that it had the discretion under the 1943 Hydrocarbons Law to end the royalty concession150.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6135.\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b658.\n\n92.\n\nSimilarly, on 25 February 2005, CVP informed Mr. Ward that the MEM, by express instructions of President Ch\u00e1vez, was \"leav[ing] without effect\" the royalty reduction established in the La Ceiba Royalty Reduction Agreement and imposing a royalty rate of 16 2/3% on the La Ceiba Project151.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6136; Letter from PDVSA to Mark Ward, President of ExxonMobil de Venezuela dated 25 February 2005 (Ex. C-39).\n\n93.\n\nIn its letter of 8 June 2005 to Mr. Ward, the Ministry of Energy and Mines stated that \"[t]he payment of royalties required from companies that process extra-heavy crude in the Orinoco Oil Belt is 30%, as set forth in Article 44 of the Organic Hydrocarbons Law in force\"152. On 23 June 2005, the Ministry of Energy and Mines informed Mobil Cerro Negro that average monthly production above 120,000 barrels per day would be subject to a royalty rate of 30%153.\n\nLetter dated 8 June 2005 from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to Operadora Cerro Negro, S.A. (Ex. C-40). See Reply M. \u00b646.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6144.\n\n(b) *Creation of the Extraction Tax in 2006*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nDuring the course of 2005 and 2006, the price of crude oil continued to soar, reaching new record highs each year154. By May 2006, the price of crude oil had risen to US$69.78 per barrel155.\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b664.\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b666.\n\n95.\n\nOn 16 May 2006, the National Assembly enacted a partial amendment to the 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, which created an additional royalty in the form of an \"extraction tax\" (*Impuesto de Extracci\u00f3n*)156. The new law, which took effect on 29 May 2006, imposed an extraction tax of 33 1/3% on all liquid hydrocarbons extracted from the ground157. Under the new scheme, royalty payments were to be credited to the liability for the extraction tax158.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6149; Law on Partial Amendment to the Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, Article 5.4 (*Ley de reforma* *Parcial del Decreto 1,510 con Fuerza de Ley Org\u00e1nica de Hidrocarburos*) and Organic Law of Hydrocarbons (as amended) (Ex. C-337).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nMem. M. \u00b6150.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, Mobil Cerro Negro was liable to pay an additional 16 2/3% as an extraction tax (*i.e.*, 33 1/3% minus 16 2/3% equals 16 2/3%) for its production share159. This change increased the royalty rate applicable to the Cerro Negro Project to 33 1/3%160.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6151.\n\n*Ibid.* See also Transcript of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, *Al\u00f3 Presidente* No. 288 (29 July 2007) (Ex. C-415).\n\n97.\n\nMobil Cerro Negro paid the increased royalty and the extraction tax under protest and with full reservation of rights161. It paid the royalty at the rate of 16 2/3% from 11 October 2004 and the extraction tax at the rate of 16 2/3% from 29 May 2006, in both cases until the investment was expropriated in June 2007162.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6152.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n(c) *Increase in the Income Tax Rate Applicable to Participants in Orinoco Oil Belt Ventures*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nOn 29 August 2006, the National Assembly amended the Income Tax Law to repeal the provision that subjected income from the extra-heavy oil projects in the Orinoco Oil Belt to the general corporate rate, instead of the higher rate applicable to the oil industry163. This amendment had the effect of increasing from 34% to 50% the rate applicable to income from those projects, including the Cerro Negro Project164. The measure took effect on 1 January 2007165.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6153.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n99.\n\nAccordingly, after 1 January 2007, Mobil Cerro Negro was subject to an income tax rate of 50%166. Mobil Cerro Negro made two income tax advance payments at the rate of 50% from 1 January 2007 until its investment was expropriated in June 2007167.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6154.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 155.\n\n(d) *Production and export curtailments on the Cerro Negro Project*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nUnder the terms of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions and the Cerro Negro Association Agreement, production and export curtailments could be imposed on the Cerro Negro Project provided that they were necessary to comply with the Respondent's international commitments. They were to be applied on a *pro rata* basis on all oil producers in Venezuela. From late 2006 through the first part of 2007, the Respondent imposed a series of production and export curtailments on the Cerro Negro Project168.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 156.\n\n101.\n\nOn 9 October 2006, the Ministry of Energy ordered Operadora Cerro Negro to reduce extra-heavy oil production for that month by a total of 50,000 barrels (\"October 2006 Production Cut\")169. Shortly thereafter, the Respondent agreed to participate in two OPEC production cuts170. The first cut, which was applied between November 2006 and February 2007, reduced Venezuela's oil production by 138,000 barrels per day171. The second cut, which took effect on 1 February 2007 and remained in effect in June 2007, reduced oil production by an additional 57,000 barrels per day172.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 157.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n102.\n\nToward the end of 2006, the production cuts imposed by Venezuela were replaced by restrictions on exports in each of November, January, February and March 2007173. The export curtailment imposed for March 2007 was to remain in effect until the end of June 2007.\n\nRFA \u00b6 156; Mem. M. \u00b6 159.\n\n103.\n\nAs a consequence of these production and export cuts, the Cerro Negro Project allegedly produced approximately 560,000 fewer barrels of extra-heavy crude in 2006, as compared with the production target for 2006174, and exported about 5.5 million fewer barrels of synthetic crude oil by the end of June 2007 than the export target for the first half of 2007175.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 160.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n104.\n\nMobil Cerro Negro formally objected to these curtailments as violations of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions and the Cerro Negro Association176.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 162.\n\n(e) *Expropriation of the Claimants' Investments in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs described above, pursuant to the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, operating service agreements were to be reformed as mixed enterprises177. The only activities remaining outside of this legal framework were the Orinoco Oil Belt associations (such as the Cerro Negro Project) and the Profit Sharing Agreements (such as the La Ceiba Project)178.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 127.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 44.\n\n106.\n\nOn 8 January 2007, President Chavez announced that all of the projects that had been operating outside of the framework of the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, including the Cerro Negro Project, would be nationalized179. On 1 February 2007, through the Enabling Law (see below), the Respondent made clear that it also intended to nationalize profit-sharing projects such as the La Ceiba Project180.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 45.\n\nC-Mem. J. p.11 at K 19.\n\n107.\n\nOn 1 February 2007, the National Assembly enacted a law entitled the \"Law that Authorizes the President of the Republic to Issue Decrees with Rank, Value and Force of Law in Delegated Subject Matters\" (\"Enabling Law\")181. The Enabling Law authorized President Ch\u00e1vez to take over the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba joint ventures and other similar associations by182:\n\n\"[D]ecree[ing] norms allowing the State to assume directly or through corporations of its exclusive property, the control of the activities performed by the associations operating in the Orinoco Oil Belt, including the upgraders and the associations for exploration at risk and shared profits, to regularize and adjust their activities within the legal framework that governs the national oil industry, through the contractual form of mixed enterprises or companies [that are] exclusive property of the State.\"\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 171; Enabling Law (Ex. C-69).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n108.\n\nOn 26 February 2007, President Ch\u00e1vez issued Decree No. 5200 on the \"Migration to Mixed Companies of the Association Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt, as well as of the At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Exploration Agreements\" (\"Decree-Law 5200\")183. The Decree-Law ordered, *inter alia*, that the associations located in the Orinoco Oil Belt (such as the Cerro Negro Association), and the At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Associations, (such as the La Ceiba Association), be \"migrated\" into new mixed companies under the 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons, in which PDVSA or one of its subsidiaries would hold at least a 60% participation interest184. This process of transformation from the association form to a mixed company was referred to as \"migration\"185.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 172; Decree-Law 5200 (Ex. C-339)\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b6 81.\n\n109.\n\nDecree-Law 5200 provided a roadmap and schedule for the migration of the associations186. Article 3 thereof required Operadora Cerro Negro and Operadora La Ceiba, the operators of the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects, to transfer control of all activities and operations related to those projects to Corporaci\u00f3n Venezolana del Petr\u00f3leo, S.A. (or another affiliate of PDVSA) no later than 30 April 2007187. Accordingly, on 30 April 2007, Operadora Cerro Negro transferred to PDVSA Petr\u00f3leo S.A. the operations and control of all activities related to the Cerro Negro Project, with full reservation of rights188. On 27 April 2007, Operadora La Ceiba did the same in respect of the La Ceiba Project189.\n\nC-Mem. M. \u00b6 82.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6175.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6176.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n110.\n\nArticle 4 of Decree-Law 5200 gave Mobil Cerro Negro, Mobil Venezolana and participants in other associations in the Orinoco Oil Belt and in At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Associations, four months (until 26 June 2007) to agree to participation in the new mixed companies190. The mixed companies would be established and would operate under a different statutory framework (the 2001 Organic Law of Hydrocarbons) and under new contractual arrangements that would replace the previous association agreements191. Article 5 of Decree-Law 5200 provided that, if no agreement was reached on the establishment and functioning of the new mixed companies by the end of the four-month period, \"the Republic, through Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. or any of its affiliates [...] shall directly assume the activities of the associations,\" namely, the Cerro Negro Association and the La Ceiba Association192.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6173.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nMem. M. \u00b6174.\n\n111.\n\nThroughout the four-month period specified in Article 4 of Decree-Law 5200, discussions took place between Mobil Cerro Negro and Mobil Venezolana and the Respondent about the potential participation of the Claimants in the new mixed enterprises193. By 26 June 2007, no agreement had been reached on such participation194.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6177.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6180.\n\n112.\n\nOn 27 June 2007, when the four-month term imposed by Decree-Law 5200 expired, the Respondent seized the investments of Mobil Cerro Negro in the Cerro Negro Project and the investments of Mobil Venezolana in the La Ceiba Project195. This is not disputed by the Respondent. The Respondent has admitted that it \"nationalized\" the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects in 2007196.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 181.\n\nMem. J. \u00b6 45.\n\n113.\n\nOn 5 October 2007, the National Assembly enacted the \"Law on the Effects of the Process of Migration to Mixed Companies of the Agreements of the Orinoco Oil Belt, as well as of the At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Exploration Agreements\" (\"Law on Effects of the Migration\")197. The Law ratified the expropriation effected by Decree-Law 5200 and ordered that the interests and assets, formerly belonging to those companies that had not agreed to \"migrate\", be formally transferred to the new mixed companies by application of the \"reversion principle\"198.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 186.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 187.\n\n114.\n\nArticle 1 of the Law on Effects of the Migration provided that association agreements would \"be extinguished as of the date of publication in the Official Gazette [...] of the decree that transfers the right to exercise primary activities to the mixed enterprises constituted according to what is provided in said Decree-Law [Decree-Law 5200]\"199. Article 1 also provided a special rule for association agreements in which none of the Parties had agreed to \"migrate\" to mixed enterprises within the four-month period established in Decree-Law 5200. In such a case, the association agreement would be extinguished as of the date of publication of the Law on Effects of the Migration in the Official Gazette200.\n\nLaw on Effects of the Migration, Article 1 (Ex. C-313).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n115.\n\nBy Decree No. 5916, published on 5 March 2008, the Respondent transferred to PetroMonagas, S.A201. \"[t]he right to develop primary activities of exploration in search of reservoirs of heavy and extra-heavy crude oil, the extraction of such crude oil in its natural state, and its initial production, transport and storage\"202. Consequently, pursuant to Article 1 of the Law on Effects of the Migration, the Cerro Negro Association Agreement was terminated as of that date.\n\nA new mixed enterprise created in 2007, owned 83 1/3% by CVP and 16 2/3% by Veba Oil & Gas Cerro Negro GmbH.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6190; Decree No. 5916 Transferring to Petro Monagas S.A. the Right to Develop Primary Exploration Activities Specified Therein (*Decreto No. 5916, mediante el cual se transfiere a la empresa PetroMonagas, S.A. el derecho a desarrollar actividades primarias de exploraci\u00f3n que \u00e9l se especifican*), Article 1 (Ex. C-316).\n\n116.\n\nNeither Mobil Venezolana nor Petro-Canada agreed to \"migrate\" the La Ceiba Project to a new mixed enterprise203. Consequently, the La Ceiba Association Agreement fell under the special rule of Article 1 of the Law on Effects of the Migration. Accordingly, the La Ceiba Association Agreement was terminated as of 8 October 2007, the date of the publication of the Law on Effects of the Migration.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6191.\n\n**C. THE ICC ARBITRATION**\n--------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that several proceedings have been initiated by the Claimants, including proceedings against PDVSA before courts in London and New York. The Tribunal will consider the impact of those proceedings, if any, in the course of this Award.\n\n118.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal notes that, in 2008, Mobil Cerro Negro initiated ICC proceedings against PDVSA and PDVSA-CN. That proceeding was initiated pursuant to Clause 15 of the Association Agreement, which affords Mobil Cerro Negro the right to indemnification by PDVSA-CN in the event of certain governmental measures, but requires Mobil Cerro Negro to initiate a legal action against the Government to enforce that right and sets forth a mechanism to prevent double recovery.\n\n119.\n\nThe ICC proceeding has a direct bearing on the present proceeding in as much as the \"Discriminatory Measures\" at issue in that proceeding are among those before the Tribunal in this case. Further, in the ICC arbitration Mobil Cerro Negro submitted that: \"if MCN receives from the Respondents payment of any damages awarded in this [ICC] Arbitration, and later receives payment of any damages awarded in the ICSID case, MCN will reimburse the Respondents (after deducting legal costs) for the payment they made, to the extent both payments relate to the same Discriminatory Measures\"204.\n\nClaimant's post-hearing brief (25 October 2010) in the ICC Arbitration.\n\n120.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, the award was issued in the ICC proceeding, finding PDVSA and PDVSA-CN jointly and severally liable for the economic consequences of the \"Discriminatory Measures\". Setting off the counterclaim, the ICC Tribunal directed the Respondents in the ICC arbitration to pay to Mobil Cerro Negro a sum of US$746,937,958, together with interest thereon. The implications of the ICC Award on the various issues before this Tribunal (in particular, compensation) are considered in the context of the Tribunal's discussion of those issues.\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated and thoroughly considered the Parties' written submissions on the merits and the oral arguments delivered in the course of the evidentiary hearing.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe following section briefly summarizes the Parties' allegations, which are fully addressed in the Tribunals analysis (see sections IV to XI below).\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' MEMORIAL**\n------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Venezuelan Government adopted a series of measures adverse to the Claimants' investments. In particular, the Claimants refer to the following:\n\n(i) Breach of the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement, the Royalty Procedures Agreement and the La Ceiba Royalty Reduction Agreement;\n\n(ii) Imposition of increased royalty rates on production above 120,000 barrels per day for the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(iii) Unilateral termination of the Cerro Negro Royalty Reduction Agreement and the Cerro Negro Royalty Procedures Agreement;\n\n(iv) Further increase in the royalty rate through imposition of the extraction tax;\n\n(v) Increase in the income-tax rate applicable to participants in the Orinoco Oil Belt ventures;\n\n(vi) Production and export curtailments on the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(vii) Direct expropriation of Mobil Cerro Negro's and Mobil Venezolana's entire interests in the activities of the Cerro Negro Joint Venture and the La Ceiba Joint Venture and related assets;\n\n(viii) Unjustified post-expropriation tax assessments; and (ix) Harassment of Claimants' witnesses and Venezuelan counsel205.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6124.\n\n125.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants have reshaped their claims as follows:\n\n\"(i) claim arising out of the imposition of the Extraction Tax on the Cerro Negro Project; (ii) claim arising out of the increase in the income-tax rate for the participants in the Cerro Negro Project; (iii) claim arising out of production and export curtailments imposed on the Cerro Negro Project; and (iv) claim arising out of the expropriation of the Claimants' investments in the Cerro Negro Project and the La Ceiba Project... [They] also note that they have sustained and continue to sustain damage from the unconstitutional or otherwise unjustified post-expropriation tax measures. and reserve their right to assert claims arising from those measures depending on the outcome of pending appeals and any further unreasonable delay in the reimbursement of VAT credits\"206.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6226.\n\n126.\n\nRegarding the law applicable to the merits, the Claimants submit that \"the ICSID Convention and the Treaty determine the rules of law under which the claims asserted in this proceeding must be adjudicated\"207. In particular, Article 9 (5) of the Treaty enumerates the sources of law upon which an arbitral award under the Treaty must be based208. The Claimants acknowledge that Venezuelan law is of some relevance, in particular with respect to the evidence of the Respondent's commitments and conduct. However, they consider that the main source of law must be the Treaty itself given that the claims are for breach of the Treaty209.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 237.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 240.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 241.\n\n127.\n\nOn that basis, the Claimants contend that the Respondent is in breach of the Treaty in several respects.\n\n128.\n\nFirst, Venezuela violated the Treaty by wrongfully expropriating the Claimants' investments. That expropriation fails to meet at least three of the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT in that it was (i) conducted without due process of law; (ii) contrary to the Respondent's undertakings; and (iii) not taken against any compensation, let alone just compensation210.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 246.\n\n129.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that Venezuela has violated Article 3 (1) of the BIT by failing to ensure fair and equitable treatment (FET) to its investments. \"In brief, the Respondent's measures have frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations, which the Respondent itself created by inducing the Claimants to invest on the basis of a specific legal framework that established economic incentives and legal protections for the duration of the investment\"211.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 271.\n\n130.\n\nThird, the Claimants submit that Venezuela has also violated Article 3 (1) of the BIT by \"taking arbitrary and discriminatory measures that impaired the operation, management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of the Claimant's investments\"212.\n\nMem. M. p.134.\n\n131.\n\nThey contend that those \"wrongful measures have directly caused severe damage to the Claimants' investments in Venezuela, culminating in the total deprivation, without compensation, of the Claimants' interests in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects. The Claimants are therefore entitled to reparation in accordance with the standards prescribed by international law for internationally wrongful acts\"213.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6289.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they are entitled to be restored to the position they would occupy without the Respondent's wrongful conduct (*restitutio in integrum*). Since the Treaty permits only monetary compensation, the Claimants request monetary compensation that financially puts them in the same position they would be absent the Respondent's wrongful acts214.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n133.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their damages relating to the Cerro Negro Project consist of (i) the damages sustained as a consequence of the measures taken before the expropriation; plus (ii) the loss of interests in that project, as a going concern, as a consequence of the expropriation. Given that the value of the lost interest in the Project had increased since the expropriation, the Claimants contend that they are entitled to the current fair market value, which they calculate by means of a discounted cash flow analysis. Assessed as of 30 September 2010, and subject to updating to the date of the Award in this proceeding, the Claimants calculate the *quantum* of damages in respect of the Cerro Negro Project as approximately $14.5 billion215.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6292.\n\n134.\n\nRegarding the La Ceiba investment, the Claimants contend that \"particular circumstances warrant a different method to determine the *quantum* of compensation needed to provide full reparation\"216. The Claimants consider that damages in this respect \"are properly measured by the value of the Claimant's actual investment in that Project, which amounts to $179 million\"217.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 293.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Tribunal should also address other aspects of the full reparation required by international law. In particular, the Claimants allege that, insofar as the damages have been determined on an after-tax basis, the Claimants are entitled to protection against potential taxes on the compensation to be awarded. Finally, the Claimants consider that they are also entitled to pre- and post-award compound interest for the relevant periods, and to their costs and attorneys' fees in this proceeding218.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 294.\n\n136.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants request that the Tribunal render an award in its favor:\n\n\"a. Upholding the claims asserted by the Claimants in this proceeding;\n\nb. Determining that the Respondent has breached the Treaty and applicable principles of customary international law:\n\nBy expropriating the Claimants' investments concerning the Cerro Negro Project and the La Ceiba Project without complying with the requirements of the Treaty, including observance of due process of law, respect for undertaking, and payment of compensation as required by the Treaty;\n\nBy failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant's investments concerning the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects;\n\nBy taking arbitrary and/or discriminatory measures that impaired the operation, management, use, enjoyment and/or disposal of the Claimants investments concerning the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects;\n\nc. Determining that such a breach has caused damages to the Claimants;\n\nd. Ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants compensation, in accordance with the Treaty and customary international law, in an amount sufficient to provide full reparation to the Claimants for the damages incurred as a result of the Respondent's conduct in violation of the Treaty, including:\n\nCompensation for damages sustained by the Claimants in respect of their Cerrro Negro investment as a result of Decree-Law 5200 and the wrongful measures that preceded it;\n\nCompensation for damages sustained by the Claimants in respect of their La Ceiba investment as a result of Decree-Law 5200 and the wrongful measures that preceded it;\n\nPre-Award compound interest at a normal commercial rate;\n\nPost-Award compound interest at a rate reflecting the yield of the Respondent's sovereign date as of the date of the Award;\n\ne. Determining that the Claimants shall be protected from taxation of such compensation, in the manner specified in this Memorial;\n\nf. Ordering the Respondent to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the tribunal and the cost of legal representation, plus interest thereon in accordance with applicable law; and\n\ng. Such other additional relief as may be appropriate under the applicable law or may otherwise be just and proper\"219.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6371.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S COUNTER-MEMORIAL**\n----------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Counter Memorial on 15 June 2011\n\n138.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"confirm its Decision on Jurisdiction and refuse to entertain jurisdiction for any claim based on royalty or tax increases\" as well as for \"any claim based on production in excess of 120,000 barrels per day\"220.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 125.\n\n139.\n\nWith respect to the applicable law, the Respondent submits that Venezuelan law must be taken into account both under article 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention and under article 9 (5) of the BIT. This includes \"the relevant hydrocarbon legislation and the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization, as well as the terms and conditions of the special agreement relating to the Cerro Negro Project, particularly the compensation provisions agreed at the outset of the Project in implementation of the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization\"221.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 132.\n\n140.\n\nOn the merits, the Respondent contends that the measures adopted did not violate the Treaty.\n\n141.\n\nRegarding the allegations of breach of FET, the Respondent submits that the FET claims under the Dutch Treaty based on the fiscal measures are untenable for several reasons, each of which would independently require dismissal of these claims: \"(i) they are precluded by Article 4 of the Dutch Treaty, the provision expressly dealing with fiscal measures; (ii) they conflict with the Dutch Treaty Protocol, under which non-discriminatory measures that do not violate the minimum standards of international law are beyond the scope of the Dutch Treaty's FET clause, Article 3 (1); (iii) they do not violate even the most expansive notions of FET, based on \u2018legitimate expectations' at the time of the original investment or Claimants' notion of a \u2018reasonable stable and predictable environment'; and (iv) Claimants do not even attempt to make their FET argument from the standpoint of Venezuela Holdings at the time of the \u2018Dutch' acquisition of the investment\"222.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 211.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent observes that in addition to their FET claims based upon tax and royalty measures, the Claimants allege breach of the FET with respect to \"(i) the production or export cutbacks, and presumably the production limitation (...) (ii) the change in operationship, (iii) negotiation under alleged duress, (iv) lack of approval of the La Ceiba development plan and (v) alleged violation of Venezuelan law\"223. The Respondent contends that all these claims are without merit.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6212.\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the measures that it took were neither arbitrary, nor discriminatory, and therefore did not violate article 3(1) of the BIT. Like the FET allegations, the claims relating to the fiscal measures would have to be dismissed because they are beyond the scope of Article 4 of the BIT. In addition, the Respondent considers that there is no basis for claims of arbitrariness or discriminatory treatment as the Government measures do not rise to the established thresholds.224\n\nC. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 219-226\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent submits that this case involves no wrongful or unlawful expropriation. According to the Respondent, the pre-migration measures do not constitute expropriation. The Respondent states that the 2007 migration was not a wrongful or unlawful expropriation\"225. In particular, \"the mere lack of agreement on compensation does not render an expropriation unlawful.226 Therefore, compensation must be calculated in accordance with the BIT and the damage assessed as of 26 June 2007.\n\nC. Mem. M. p. 194.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6282.\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent identifies the following key issues on *quantum* for the Cerro Negro Project: \"(i) the impact of the limitation on the amount of compensation to be granted for adverse governmental action specifically negotiated and agreed at the outset of the Cerro Negro Project as an express condition of the Project's authorization by Congress; (ii) the discount rate to be applied to projected future cash flows; and (iii) the price, cost and volume projection (with the 120,000 barrels per day limit) that are necessary to project cash flows\"227.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6288.\n\n146.\n\nOn the first point, the Respondent contends that the price cap set forth in the Cerro Negro Associate Agreement in implementation of the Congressional authorization must be applied in the present case. Regarding the discount rate, the Respondent submits that the only reasonable proposal is to take the average of appropriate methodologies for an international oil project228, which leads to a 19.8 % discount rate to calculate compensation in this case229. Finally, regarding future cash flows, the Respondent contends that Claimants seek to inflate compensation by inflating cash flows. Instead, the Tribunal should apply the price cap resulting from the agreed limitation on compensation and the 19.8% discount rate to the cash flow calculated by Respondent's experts, which yields a value as of June 26, 2007 of US$ $353,542,997230.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 344.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6369.\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the compensation for the La Ceiba Project could be limited to the value of the investment, *i.e.* US$ 75,000,000.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the outstanding Cerro Negro debt amounts to US$ 238,139,797. According to the Respondent, this debt must be taken into account, with the total compensation therefore being limited to US$ 190,403,200.231\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6371.\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' request to increase the amount of the award in this case by taking into account any potential tax consequences must be denied232, and that simple, post award interest should be applied. Finally, the Respondent considers that the Claimants should bear all costs.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6378.\n\n150.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the appropriate amount of compensation for the nationalization is US$ 190,403,200, and all other claims should be dismissed.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANTS' REPLY**\n---------------------------\n\n151.\n\nIn their Reply dated 15 September 2011, the Claimants note that the Respondent does not dispute the core facts of the case, including the expropriation, the Republic's reassurances and inducements to Mobil, the benefits derived from the Claimants' investments and the Cerro Negro annual net income in the years preceding the expropriation.233\n\nReply M. U 19.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's jurisdictional objections have no merit. They observe that the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the claims for expropriation and for production and export curtailments is uncontested. According to the Claimants, the Tribunal also has jurisdiction over the claims arising out of the imposition of the extraction tax and of the increase in the income tax rate in the Cerro Negro Project.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they had a right to increase production over 120,000 barrels per day. They recognize that in June 2005, Venezuela imposed a higher royalty over production exceeding that figure. The Claimants add that they are not pursuing a claim relating to the dispute over such royalty, but stress that they retained the right to increase their production at a higher level, and contend that the \"Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims arising out of the expropriation\" of that right234.\n\nReply M. p. 39.\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that Article 9(5) of the Treaty includes, among the sources of applicable law, the law of the Contracting Party and the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments235. However, they submit that this does not imply that \"Condition Eighteen of the Framework of Conditions excuses non-performance of the Respondent's obligations under the Treaty236 or that Condition Twentieth of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions authorizes incorporation of contractual limitations in a Treaty Dispute237.\n\nReply M. U 60.\n\nReply M. p. 46.\n\nReply M. p. 49.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"the Respondent concedes the expropriation and its liability for compensation, but mischaracterizes the expropriation process\"238. The Claimants state that the expropriation was carried out without due process and was contrary to undertakings. They stress that the Respondent did not pay or even offer to pay compensation in accordance with the Treaty and its compensation standard. Moreover, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's pre-Decree-Law 5200 measures expropriated discrete rights of the Claimants.\n\nReply M. p. 51\n\n156.\n\nThe Claimants reiterate that Venezuela breached the FET standard set forth in Article 3(1) of the BIT and Section 2 of the Protocol. They contend that, contrary to the Respondent's arguments, fiscal measures are not excluded from the scope of that standard. In fact, according to the Claimants, the standard contained in those provisions guarantees three different forms of treatment of foreign nationals under international law, only one of which (the floor) is the International Minimum Standards (IMS).\n\n157.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Venezuela \"breached the FET and the IMS by frustrating the Claimants' legitimate expectations based on specific undertakings\"239. Furthermore, the Claimants contend that the Respondent \"breached Article 3 (1) in subjecting the Claimants to a coercive \u2018migration process'\"240.\n\nReply M. \u00b6123.\n\nReply M. \u00b6136.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants reaffirm that the Respondent's conduct was arbitrary and that the production curtailments on the Cerro Negro Project were discriminatory. Therefore, the Respondent is in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimants note that \"the Respondent has conceded that it is liable to pay compensation for the expropriation of the Claimants interest in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects. Although the Respondent has also (belatedly) conceded that the applicable standard of compensation is fair market value, it admits a *quantum* of compensation which is wholly inadequate (\u2026), based on false factual premises and untenable legal arguments\"241.\n\nReply M. U 161.\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimants reaffirm that the Respondent owes full reparation under international law for the breach of its obligation under the Treaty. Thus, they must \"receive compensation that is *at least* equal to the fair market value of the property at the time of the expropriation\"242. They add that, if the property has increased in value since that time, further compensation is due for the loss represented by the foregone increase243. In the light of these considerations, the Claimants updated their Cerro Negro *quantum* submissions.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nReply M. U 185.\n\n161.\n\nIn this respect, they submit that the Respondent's Cerro Negro compensation analysis is factually and legally flawed. The Claimants contend that the Respondent's *quantum* calculations are debased from the outset by unfounded assertions, and that they are invalidated by other serious errors. According to the Claimants, market transactions discredit the Respondent's valuation for Cerro Negro. Similarly, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's position concerning compensation for La Ceiba is untenable.\n\n162.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's arguments on the remaining *quantum* issues are without merit, whether they concern protection against taxation of the Award, compound interests, costs and expenses of the Award or outstanding Mobil Cerro Negro debts.\n\n163.\n\nConcluding on *quantum*, the Claimants assert that they \"are entitled to an award of compensation in an amount of not less than $ 16,802.3 million, plus pre-award interest and all other relief sought herein\"244. They finally ask the Tribunal to dismiss \"the defenses raised in the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, and render an award in favor of the Claimants in the form requested in the Claimants' Memorial\"245.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 272.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 275.\n\n**D. THE RESPONDENT'S REJOINDER**\n---------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIn its Rejoinder dated 15 December 2011, the Respondent reaffirms that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any fiscal claims under the Decision on Jurisdiction because they were part of an already pending dispute at the time of the Dutch restructuring246. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction to entertain a claim for project expansion247. In particular, claims based on the imposition of the production limit of 120,000 barrels per day are beyond the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and \"cannot be brought into this case under the guise of calculating compensation for the 2007 nationalization\"248.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 50.\n\nRej. M. p. 43\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 76.\n\n165.\n\nWith respect to the applicable law, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal must take into account Venezuelan law, including the relevant hydrocarbon legislation and the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization, as well as the terms and conditions of the special agreement relating to the Cerro Negro Project, in accordance with Article 9(5) of the BIT. This means that both the merits of the claims and the issue of *quantum* must be analyzed in light of the reservation by the Republic in the Eighteenth Condition, and the special compensation provisions of the Twentieth Condition of the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization (as implemented by the Cerro Negro Association Agreement), which includes a limitation on compensation that is established through the price cap249.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 97.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent reaffirms that \"apart from the lack of jurisdiction under the Decision on Jurisdiction, there are several grounds for rejecting Claimants' fiscal FET claims\"250, as fiscal measures are not cognizable under Article 3 of the BIT and Claimants make no argument under Article 4. Moreover, according to the Respondent, the record of negotiations \"shows that the right of the Government to change law was anticipated, expressly preserved and addressed through the special compensation mechanism Claimants want this Tribunal to ignore. On those facts, no fiscal FET claims could be sustained under any standard\".251\n\nRej. M. U 168.\n\nRej. M. U 168\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent submits that investment treaty cases are unanimous in holding that \"non-confiscatory fiscal measures do not constitute an expropriation\"252 and that there can only be an expropriation if there is substantial deprivation of the entire investment253. Accordingly, the pre-migration measures could not have constituted an expropriation of \"discrete rights\"254.\n\nRej. M. U 206.\n\nRej. M. U 213.\n\nRej. M. p.154.\n\n168.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the 2007 Nationalization does not constitute an unlawful expropriation, as it was (i) \"carried out pursuant to a law of public policy in an orderly and non-discriminatory manner and for a public purpose, so acknowledged by companies from all over the world; and (ii) serious compensation negotiations took place, but agreement was simply not possible due to Claimants demands\"255. The Respondent adds that \"a nationalization is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact that compensation has not yet been determined or paid so long as the government recognizes its obligation to compensate256.\n\nRej. M. U 230.\n\nRej. M. U 249.\n\n169.\n\nWith respect to the Cerro Negro Project, the Respondent stresses that compensation must be calculated based on the fiscal regime in place in 2007, and that the proper valuation date for the 2007 nationalization is the date of dispossession257, *i.e.*, 26 June 2007. The Respondent contends that: (i) the compensation must be limited as agreed pursuant to the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization; (ii) the discount rate must be calculated not according to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), but taking into consideration a number of elements which the Respondent's experts have analyzed when recommending a discount rate of 19.8% and (iii) the projected cash flow must be calculated taking into account \"all of the historical data as well as all of the information that would have been available to a buyer as of June 26, 2007\"258.\n\nRej. M. p. 208.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 416.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimants have designed \"various maneuvers to justify the exorbitant claims asserted, including ignoring the Decision on Jurisdiction to apply an outdated fiscal regime, postulating a hypothetical new project almost triple the size of the existing one, using unreasonable price scenarios and an indefensible discount rate, and ignoring the carefully tailored compensation provisions and limitations agreed as a fundamental condition to the authorization of the Cerro Negro Project\"259. It then provides a table showing \"how one goes from the exorbitant compensation claimed by the Claimant\" (*i.e.*, US$ 16,486 billion) \"to the compensation calculated by Respondent's expert even before applying the limitation\"260 (*i.e.*, US$ 844 million). When applying such limitation, the compensation figure becomes US$ 354 million for the Cerro Negro Project.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 419.\n\n*Ibid.*.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent reaffirms its previous submissions with respect to the \"Claimants request for a tax indemnity\"261, pre-award and post-award interest and costs.\n\nRej. M. p. 337.\n\n**E. HEARING AND POST-HEARING BRIEFS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nAt the hearing held from 7 to 16 February 2012, the Parties maintained and developed their arguments. Five days before the hearing, on 2 February 2012, the Tribunal had been informed by the Respondent that a final award had been rendered on 23 December 2011 in the ICC arbitration. The Tribunal requested both Parties to address in their post-hearing briefs the impact, if any, of the ICC award on the award to be rendered in this case.\n\n173.\n\nOn 30 April 2012, the Claimants submitted their Post-Hearing Brief. In their brief, the Claimants refer to their statement at the hearing about President Ch\u00e1vez's public declaration that his government would not comply with any decision by Tribunal, and they stress that the Respondent did not comment on that statement at the time.\n\n174.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's question, the Claimants contend that \"the ICC award should have no impact on the award to be rendered in this case, either on liability or *quantum...* The ICC award and this case concern the liability of different parties under different normative regimes\"262. According to the Claimants, the ICC Award does not end the compensation dispute, and the various arguments that the Respondent has offered in that respect are untenable.263\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 1.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 3\n\n175.\n\nRegarding jurisdiction, the Claimants reaffirm that the Tribunal has jurisdiction on all claims that remain at issue. In particular, it has jurisdiction over the disputes arising out of (i) the imposition of the 33 1/3% extraction tax (the extraction tax dispute) and (ii) the repudiation of the guarantee that Mobil CN would be subject to the general corporate income tax rate (the income tax dispute)264.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 10.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimants confirm their interpretation of Conditions 18 and 20 of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions and of Articles 3(1), 4 and 6 of the BIT. They stress that the hearing confirmed that, at the time of the investment, they had a legitimate expectation about the fiscal regime that would be applicable to the CN Project265, and that their investments in the La Ceiba and the Cerro Negro Projects have been unlawfully expropriated. The Claimants contend that they have a right to full compensation of their interests in those projects, which, after a detailed analysis, they evaluate at US$ 16.6 billion in the case of Cerro Negro.\n\nC-PH Brief. p.19.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the Respondent's sovereign debt yield at the date of the award should be used to determine the rate of interest266.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 82.\n\n178.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Memorial dated 30 April 2012, the Respondent, in response to the Tribunal's question regarding the ICC Award, states that the Cerro Negro claim should be dismissed since compensation has already been paid in accordance with the agreed compensation mechanism267. In any case, the Respondent considers that the Cerro Negro result would not change even if the ICC award were to be ignored\"268.\n\nR-PH Brief p. 4.\n\nR-PH Brief p. 8.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent reaffirms that the \"Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the royalty and tax claims, which means that valuation of the Cerro Negro Project for purposes of the 2007 nationalization must be made applying the fiscal regime of 2007\"269. Regarding the production limit claim, the Respondent states that it \"had no doubt that production was limited to 120,000 barrels per day from the moment the project was authorized in the 1990s\"270. \"Thus, there is no jurisdictional basis for any claim for a 344,000 barrels per day project\"271.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b6 16.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b6. 18.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b6 19.\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent maintains its position with respect to the merits of the Cerro Negro claims. It adds that the hearing confirms the reasonableness of the cash flow projections prepared by its expert for Cerro Negro, on which it comes back with some detail. The Respondent contends that the \"344,000 barrels per day\" project advanced by the Claimants is based on untenable assumptions.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent further reaffirms that the appropriate compensation for La Ceiba is US$ 75 million, with a simple interest at the same rate specified in the ICC Award or a similar rate.\n\n182.\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Reply dated 14 May 2012, the Claimants maintain their observations with respect to the impact of the ICC Award on the award to be rendered in this case. They submit that the \"Respondent's Post Hearing Memorial adds nothing new on the question of liability\"272. They summarize their position with respect to the expected cash flow of the Cerro Negro Project (oil price, production, volume and production costs forecasts as well as inflation adjustments) and the discount rate to be applied. The Claimants finally request the Tribunal to award \"the amount necessary to provide full reparation, calculated in accord with the Claimants' prior submissions\"273.\n\nC-PH Reply \u00b6 9.\n\nC-PH Reply \u00b6 52 and C-PH Brief \u00b6 38-41 (Cerro Negro) *and* U 81 (La Ceiba); Reply M. \u00b6 206, table 2.\n\n183.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Reply Memorial dated 14 May 2012, the Respondent reiterates that \"the ICC award and its satisfaction should end the compensation controversy with respect to the Cerro Negro Project and the Cerro Negro claims should be dismissed\"274, and that the result would be the same without the ICC Award. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to royalties, taxes and production limit and that the fiscal FET claims have to be dismissed on the merits. The Respondent contends that there has been no expropriation of \"discrete rights\" and that the 2007 expropriation was not unlawful. The Respondent maintains its position on *quantum (* cash flow, production limits and discount rate).\n\nR-PH Reply \u00b6 15.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n184.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 10 June 2010, the Tribunal decided that \"it has no jurisdiction under article 22 of the Venezuelan Decree with rank and force of law N\u00b0 356 on the protection and promotion of investments of 3 October 1999\".\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered whether or not it had jurisdiction under the BIT. According to the Respondent, the restructuring of the Mobil Corporation through the creation in 2005-2006 of the Dutch holding constituted an abuse of rights, which deprived the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the BIT. According to the Claimants, the Respondent's allegation lacked a legal and factual basis. The Tribunal decided that:\n\n\"204. As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.\"\n\n205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, \"an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs.\"275\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ICSID Tribunal in *Pac Rim* recently took a comparable approach. It expressed the view that the dividing line occurs when the relevant party can foresee an actual dispute or a specific future dispute with a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy. In the Tribunal's view, before that dividing line is reached, there can be no abuse of process; but after that dividing line is passed, there will be. *Pac Rim Cayman Ltd v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case ARB/09/12) - Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4. and 10.20.5 (2 August 2012) K 2.99.\n\n186.\n\nIn light of those considerations, the Tribunal noted that the restructuring of Mobil's investments through a Dutch entity occurred from October 2005 to November 2006, and it went on to decide whether at those dates there were pending disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent. The Tribunal concluded that \"complaints had already been lodged by the Claimants at the time of the restructuring\"276.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 199.\n\n187.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal noted the following:\n\n\"200. In two letters dated 2 February 2005, and 18 May 2005, drafted in comparable terms, the Claimants first complained of the increase from 1% to 16 2/3% of the royalties decided by Venezuela both for the Cerro Negro and the La Ceiba projects. They requested the Government to designate representatives to meet with them in order to discuss an amicable settlement. They added that \u2018as you well know, in accordance with Article 22 of the Investment Law, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has consented to submit to arbitration, under the ICSID Convention, investment disputes between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and foreign investors'. They went on, consenting \u2018to ICSID's jurisdiction for arbitration of the investment dispute, and of any further investment dispute with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, so that, should arbitration become necessary, it can be carried out under the ICSID Convention'. They concluded in requesting \u2018an early meeting to commence consultation' in order \u2018to explore an amicable solution of the matter\".\n\n188.\n\nThen, on 20 June 2005, Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Mobil Cerro Negro and Operadora Cerro Negro informed the Venezuelan authorities that the recent ministerial decision to increase the royalties to 30% had \"broadened the investment dispute\" previously brought to their attention. They stated that the introduction of a bill that would increase income tax rates from 34% to 50% would further broaden that dispute, and contended that those decisions were \"in breach of the obligations\" of Venezuela. They requested consultations \"in an effort to reach an amicable resolution of this matter\", and added that \"[o]ut of an abundance of caution, each of the Mobil Parties hereby confirms its consent to ICSID jurisdiction over the broadened dispute described above and any other investment disputes with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela existing at the present time or that may arise in the future, including without limitation any dispute arising out of any expropriation or confiscation of all or part of the investment of the Mobil Parties\"277.\n\nEx. C-12.\n\n189.\n\nIt results from these letters that, in June 2005, there were already pending disputes between the Parties relating to the increase of royalties and income taxes decided by Venezuela. The Claimants had even accepted to submit those disputes to ICSID arbitration under Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment Law and, \"[o]ut of an abundance of caution\", they had further indicated that, on the same basis, they were also consenting to arbitration for any future dispute, including future disputes arising from expropriation or confiscation.\n\n190.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n\"(a) that it has jurisdiction over the claims presented by Venezuela Holdings (Netherlands), Mobil CN Holding and Mobil Venezolana Holding (Delaware), Mobil CN and Mobil Venzolana (Bahamas) as far as:\n\n(i) they are based on alleged breaches of the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments concluded on 22 October 1991 between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Venezuela;\n\n(ii) they relate to disputes born after 21 February 2006 [i.e. the date of the restructuring] for the Cerro Negro Project and after 23 November 2006 [i.e. the date of the restructuring] for the La Ceiba project and in particular as far as they relate to the dispute concerning the nationalization measures taken by the Republic of Venezuela\"278.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6209.\n\n191.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the interpretation to be given to the Decision. Specifically, they disagree on which disputes relating to the Cerro Negro Project were born after 21 February 2006 and, as a consequence, they disagree on which claims fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants first state that, as a consequence of the Decision on Jurisdiction, they \"are no longer asserting in this proceeding the following claims, which arose before the respective Treaty Application Date: (i) claim arising out of the premature termination of the 1% royalty rate reduction (that is, the royalty-rate increase to 16 1/3%) in breach of the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Royalty Reduction Agreements and the Royalty Procedures Agreement; (ii) claim arising out of the royalty-rate increase to 30% on production over 120,000 bpd; (iii) claim arising out of the imposition of the extraction tax on the La Ceiba Project; (iv) claim arising out of the frustration of the De-Bottlenecking Project; and (v) claim arising out of the right to early production beyond the evaluation phase of the La Ceiba Project\"279.\n\nMem. M. fn. 501.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants add that, in accord with the Decision on Jurisdiction, they are now\n\n\"...pursuing only the following four claims:\n\n(i) claim arising out of the imposition of the extraction tax on the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(ii) claim arising out of the increase in the income-tax rate for the participants in the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(iii) claim arising out of production and export curtailments imposed on the Cerro Negro Project in 2006 and 2007; and\n\n(iv) claim arising out of the 27 June 2007 expropriation of the Claimants\" investments in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects\"280.\n\nReply M. \u00b641.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent contests jurisdiction over claims (i) and (ii), but concedes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims (iii) and (iv) (with the exception of the increase in production claim).\n\n195.\n\nTherefore, the main question in dispute today is whether the claims relating to the creation of the extraction tax and the increase of the income tax rate fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent denies it. The Respondent states that the Tribunal had already decided that \"there were already pending disputes relating to royalties and income tax\" at the time of the Dutch restructuring, and contends that the Claimants themselves recorded those disputes in their letters of 2005, prior to the restructuring. Moreover, according to the Respondent, \"In fact, the record is clear that the dispute over the right of the government to change the fiscal regime dates back not only to 2005, but actually to 2004, when the first royalty measure was taken\"281.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b615.\n\n197.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"it makes a mockery of the system of international arbitration to argue that if a government announces a measure on day one and enacts the legislation to implement it on day three, a non-treaty investor can acquire ICSID jurisdiction by transferring its investment to an affiliate in a treaty jurisdiction on day two, particularly after the non-treaty investor has specifically notified the government of an investment dispute. That is the very definition of treaty abuse\"282.\n\nC. -Mem. M. \u00b6 119.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction is *res judicata*. However, they submit that the Tribunal has not already declined jurisdiction over any royalty and tax claim\"283. According to the Claimants:\n\n(a) The Respondent imposed the extraction tax by a statutory amendment that was adopted on 16 May 2006 and took effect on 25 May 2006.\n\n(b) The Respondent increased the income tax rate applicable to extra-heavy oil projects by means of a statutory amendment adopted on 29 August 2006 with effect on 1 January 2007.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 43.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimants consider that both dates are well after the date of the restructuring for the Cerro Negro Project.\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that none of the letters cited by the Respondent or sent by the Claimants on 2 February 2005, 18 May 2005 and 20 June 2005 refer to any \"extraction tax\" or to the effective increase of the royalty to 33 1/3% that resulted from that measure284. They add that the letter of 20 June 2005 refers to \"a *potential* dispute that would arise *if and when* the increase in the income-tax rate were enacted\".285 This happened only in August 2006. Therefore, there was no actual dispute and no claim of a Party that was positively opposed by the other.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 46.\n\nReply M. \u00b649\n\n201.\n\nFinally according to the Claimants, the present case concerns concrete measures, as opposed to \"an abstract, single dispute regarding the Respondent's \u2018right to adopt fiscal measures in the face of changing circumstances in the international oil market'\"286. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the disputes born from such measures and the corresponding claims.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b613\n\n202.\n\nThe Parties refer to various cases287 in support of their respective positions.\n\nBoth Parties refer to *Mavromatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. Britain),* PCIJ, Judgment No. 2 (30 August 1924), (Ex. R-249). They also refer to the decision by the International Court of Justice in the *Headquarters Agreement Case* (26 April 1988) and to the *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia*), Judgment (25 September 1977) (Ex. CL-103). They also refer to several ICSID cases (in particular, *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7) and *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23), (See Mem. M. fn. 504; C-Mem. M \u00b6115; *and* Reply M. fn. 147).\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that several disputes had arisen between the Claimants and the Respondent with respect to royalties and tax measures taken from October 2004 to June 2007. All these measures might have been prompted by a single reason: the evolution of the oil market during that period. However, they were distinct measures taken and contested at different dates, and the Tribunal has to take into account those dates when deciding upon its jurisdiction.\n\n204.\n\nWith respect to the extraction tax, the Tribunal recalls that, in its Decision of 20 June 2010, it stated that \"in June 2006, there were already pending disputes between the Parties regarding the increase of royalties\". However, it did not specify what those disputes were and it did not mention the extraction tax.\n\n205.\n\nIn fact, that tax was established by a statutory amendment adopted on 16 May 2006 with effect on 29 May 2006. That law imposed a tax of 33.33% on all liquid hydrocarbons extracted from the ground. Under the new scheme, former royalty payments (at the rate of 16 2/3 or 30%) were to be credited to the liability for the extraction tax.\n\n206.\n\nBy letter dated 26 May 2006, Cerro Negro protested against the creation of the Tax, \"which would have the practical consequence of increasing the royalty applicable to participants in the Cerro Negro Strategic Association to 33.33%\"288 and would thus constitute a breach of the existing agreements. In the same letter, the Cerro Negro parties reserved their rights to submit that dispute to ICSID Arbitration.\n\nEx. C-14.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal did not find in the record any previous protests by the Claimants relating to the extraction tax. In particular, the Tribunal notes that the letter of 20 June 2005 referred to in the Tribunal's Decision of 20 June 2010 does not mention that tax. It merely contests the legality of a previous increase of the royalty tax to 30%. In fact, the extraction tax was never mentioned in any of the letters exchanged between the Parties in 2005289. Accordingly, the Tribunal arrives to the conclusion that the dispute concerning the extraction tax was born after the date limit of 21 February 2006. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claim relating to that dispute.\n\nSee the Claimants' letters of 2 February 2005 (Ex. C-9), 18 May 2005 (Ex. C-10) and 20 June 2005 (Ex. C-12), and the Respondent's letters of 8 June 2005 (Ex. C-40) and 23 June 2005 (Ex. C-41).\n\n208.\n\nThe situation is different with respect to the increase of the income tax. It appears from press reports that in April 2005, Mr. Rafael Ram\u00edrez, Ministry of Energy, told local television that President Ch\u00e1vez had \"announced that the Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administraci\u00f3n Aduanera y Tributaria (SENIAT) tax agency will reclassify taxes and a company that drills, produces, operates or processes oil must pay income tax of 50%\"290. Then, on 16 June 2005, according to a LexisNexis report, the Ministry of Energy and Venezuela's tax authority, the SENIAT, were \"reportedly in the advanced stages of drafting the legislation that reflects the higher tax rates\". According to the same source, this move would \"increase the tax rate on the four Orinoco heavy oil upgrading projects from 34% to 50%\"291.\n\nEx. R-219.\n\nEx. R-222.\n\n209.\n\nAs a consequence, in its letter of 20 June 2005, Cerro Negro dealt not only with the increase of the royalty rate to 30%, but also with the increase of the income tax rate to 50%. On this last point, it noted:\n\n\"As reported by news services, on 15 June 2005, Minister Ramirez announced that the government will introduce a bill in the National Assembly that would increase the income tax rate applicable to the income of participants in Orinoco Oil Belt Project from 34 to 50%. In 1991, the Venezuelan Congress reduced the income tax rate to 34% as a financial incentive for investors to invest in those projects. This reduction was an essential inducement to MCN's predecessor to participate in the Cerro Negro project and a key element of the agreement between the participants and the Venezuelan Government.\"292 The Mobil parties considered that these measures were \"in breach of the obligations of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela under the Royalty Reduction Agreement, the Procedures Agreement, the [Investment Law] and other applicable provisions of Venezuelan law and international law\"293. As a consequence, the Mobil parties requested consultations with the Government \"on the broadened dispute, in an effort to reach an amicable resolution of this matter and avoid dispute resolution proceedings\"294.\n\nEx. C-12.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n210.\n\nThus, although the increase of the income tax was formally enacted only in August 2006, a dispute relating to the Government's decision to increase the income tax already existed in June 2005, before the date limit fixed in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction. This was not a potential dispute relating to a measure to be taken, but a real dispute concerning a decision already made, as recognized by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction. That dispute would have been resolved if President Chavez and its Government had abandoned the idea to propose to the Congress the adoption of the increase they had already decided or if the Congress had rejected the bill, but that was not the case. Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claim relating to the increase in the income tax dispute.\n\n211.\n\nA third jurisdictional issue divides the Parties. It relates to the production volume to be taken into account for the determination of the compensation due for the expropriation of Cerro Negro. The Respondent contends that production was limited to 120,000 barrels per day before the Dutch restructuring. Accordingly, a dispute over production volume already existed before the restructuring date, which means that any claim based on this dispute is beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction and may not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the compensation due for the expropriation.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants deny that any such limit existed. They submit that the dispute that arose before the restructuring date relates to the imposition of a 30% royalty on production above 120,000 barrels per day. According to the Claimants, this dispute is no longer at issue because they are not contesting the increased royalty, but the expropriation of their right to increase production at the higher royalty295. In fact, the Claimants contend that production could go up to 344,000 barrels per day. Accordingly, the compensation due for the expropriation must be calculated on that basis.\n\nReply M, \u00b657.\n\n213.\n\nThe jurisdictional objection relating to the production increase, as well as the other objections raised by the Respondent in relation to the calculation of the *quantum*, will, if necessary, be examined by the Tribunal at a later stage, when conducting such a calculation (see paragraph 314 below).\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider the merits of the claims relating to the alleged breach of FET, arbitrary or discriminatory treatment and expropriation. However, before doing so, the Tribunal will consider the effects of the ICC Award on the present case and determine the applicable law.\n\n**V. EFFECTS OF THE ICC ARBITRATION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, at the Hearing, it specifically requested the Parties to address the question whether the ICC Award should have any impact on the award to be rendered in these proceedings.296 According to the Claimants, \"the ICC Award should have no impact on the award to be rendered in this case, either on liability or quantum, simply because there is no legal basis for any such impact.\"297 By contrast, the Respondent submits that the ICC Award \"should end the compensation dispute and effectively put an end to this case\".298 According to the Respondent, \"[the] Claimants have argued from the beginning that this is the proceeding contemplated under the Cerro Negro Association Agreement to mitigate the \u2018damages payable' as a result of the Government's measures. Now that the 'damages payable' have been determined by the ICC tribunal and the ICC Award has been paid, there is no point or basis for a continuation of the Cerro Negro compensation controversy.\"299\n\nTr. Day 8 43:12-18.\n\nC-PH Brief. \u00b62.\n\nR-PH Brief. \u00b65.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b65.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Respondent's position ill-founded. The Tribunal recalls that the ICC arbitration was initiated pursuant to Clause 15 of the CNAA300, which affords Mobil Cerro Negro a right to be indemnified by PDVSA-CN in the event of certain governmental measures, but requires Mobil Cerro Negro to initiate a legal action against the Government to mitigate the damages suffered as a result of those measures. The parties to the ICC arbitration were Mobil CN, PDVSA and PDVSA-CN. The ICC Award established the contractual liability of PDVSA and PDVSA-CN to pay the limited indemnity required by the CNAA. It is clear that the ICC Award and the present case concern the liability of different parties under different normative regimes. The State was not a party to the ICC arbitration. Neither are PDVSA and PDVSA-CN parties to this case. These proceedings concern the responsibility of the State for breach of the Treaty and international law, a matter that was not (and could not) have been resolved by the ICC tribunal, which jurisdiction was limited to the contractual dispute.\n\nCNAA, Clause 15(1)(a), Ex. C-68: \"To the extent any legal recourse is available to reverse or obtain relief from such Discriminatory Measure, [MCN] shall commence and pursue legal actions to mitigate any damages suffered as a result of the Discriminatory Measure. [...] Any net benefits received by [MCN] as a result of the pursuit of the aforesaid legal actions (after deduction of the legal costs incurred by [MCN] in connection therewith) shall be (i) applied against any amount ultimately determined to be owed by [PDVSA-CN] pursuant to this Clause or (ii) reimbursed to [PDVSA-CN] if [PDVSA-CN] has previously made payments to [MCN] with respect to the Discriminatory Measure in question.\"\n\n217.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the ICC Award does not, as the Respondent contends, put an end to this case. However, it is true that some facts that were relevant in the ICC arbitration are also relevant in the present case, such as the facts underlying the production and export curtailments claim. In its analysis, the Tribunal has thus considered the findings of the ICC tribunal in an attempt to avoid inconsistent outcomes whenever possible.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the CNAA limits the compensation due by PDVSA, a limitation reflected in the amount awarded by the ICC tribunal. No such limitation applies, however, to the State's responsibility under the BIT. The Government was neither a party to the CNAA nor a third-party beneficiary. Neither has the Respondent advanced any relevant argument that the limitations on PDVSA-CN's contractual liability under Clause 15 should be transmuted into limitations of the State's responsibility under international law.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal will assess the effect of the ICC Award on quantum where relevant in section VIII.C.5 below.\n\n**VI. APPLICABLE LAW**\n----------------------\n\n220.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides the following:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n221.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties have made a choice of law, which is reflected in Article 9(5) of the BIT. The Respondent consented to this choice of law when ratifying the BIT, and the Claimants have done so when they accepted to arbitrate under the Treaty, or, at the latest, when they filed the request for arbitration with ICSID.\n\n222.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the Treaty designates the following sources of law to govern disputes under the Treaty:\n\n\"The arbitral award shall be based on:  \n the law of the Contracting Party concerned;  \n the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;  \n the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;  \n the general principles of international law; and  \n such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.\"\n\n223.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will apply the BIT and the other agreed sources of law where appropriate. Article 9(5) of the Treaty does not allocate matters to any of those laws. Accordingly, it is for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law. Further, if and when an issue arises, the Tribunal will determine whether the applicable international law should be limited to general principles of international law under Article 9(5) of the BIT or whether it includes customary international law. Moreover, with respect to the interpretation of the BIT, the Tribunal will resort to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,301 which both States have ratified, as a \"relevant Agreement between the Contracting Parties\".\n\nVienna Convention (Ex. CL-71).\n\n224.\n\nArticle 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty quoted above includes \"the law of the Contracting Party\" and \"the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments\" among the sources of applicable law. In reliance on these provisions, the Respondent appears to argue that the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions (i) relieve the Republic from its obligation to comply with the standards set forth in the Treaty, and/or (ii) import the contractual limitations to PDVSA-CN's indemnity obligations under Clause 15 of the CNAA into the State's responsibility for breach of the Treaty.302\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6132.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with this position. The Tribunal recalls that it is a fundamental principle of international law that \"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\"303 Under this principle, international obligations arising from a treaty cannot be discarded on the grounds of national law. Among the legal systems on which the Award \"shall be based\" pursuant to Article 9(5) of the Treaty, the Tribunal has no doubt in concluding that this issue must be governed by international law. Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty or under customary international law. Bearing this in mind, the Tribunal has considered the effect of the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions in the section on quantum below.\n\nVienna Convention, Article 27 (Ex. CL-71).\n\n**VII. FET AND ARBITRARY OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal will not address the claims over which it has no jurisdiction, namely, the FET and the arbitrary/discriminatory claims concerning the increase in the income tax (see paragraph 210 above). The Tribunal will successively consider the FET and the arbitrary/discriminatory claims concerning (A) the extraction tax; (B) the production and export curtailments; (C) the coertion and the expropriation measures; and (D) the severance payments.\n\n**A. THE EXTRACTION TAX**\n-------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction over the extraction tax claim (see paragraph 207 above). It will thus now consider whether that tax was imposed by the Respondent in violation of the FET and arbitrary or discriminatory treatment standards.\n\n228.\n\nThe FET standard is contained in Article 3(1) of the Treaty. The Respondent submits that Article 4 precludes claims under Article 3(1) \"with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions\".304 According to the Claimants, there is nothing in Article 4 of the BIT that carves out fiscal measures from the FET standard contained in Article 3(1).305 The Tribunal will start by determining whether fiscal measures are covered by the FET standard in Article 3(1) of the Treaty.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 138.\n\nReply M, \u00b6103.\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent considers that Article 4 of the Treaty is the only provision addressing fiscal measures in the BIT, and that \"it is appropriate to accord priority to the more specific provision, even absent an express carve-out or exception\"306 under the well-established principle of *lex specialis*.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 108; see also \u00b6\u00b6 101-107.\n\n230.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's interpretation, Article 4 of the BIT sets forth the standard of treatment with respect to fiscal measures. Since Article 4 only protects investors from discriminatory treatment, the Respondent contends that FET treatment does not apply to fiscal measures. Once the limited standards of treatment under Article 4 are met, the provision precludes claims under other provisions of the Treaty \"with respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions\"307.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 138.\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 4 of the Treaty imposes a requirement of nondiscriminatory treatment, but it does not contain any references to FET. Since the Claimants have not alleged that the fiscal measures in question were discriminatory under Article 4, and the FET standard of Article 3(1) does not apply to fiscal measures, the Claimants' claims must be dismissed308.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6\u00b620, 99; C. Mem. M. \u00b6135.\n\n232.\n\nIn support of its position, the Respondent compares the exemptions from nondiscriminatory treatment in Article 4 with those in Article 3(3) of the Treaty. Article 4 provides that a Contracting State's obligation of non-discrimination *inter alia* with regard to taxes, fees, charges and fiscal deductions does not extend to \"special fiscal advantages\", which it may accord on the basis of reciprocity with a third State or under double taxation treaties. By contrast, Article 3(3) of the Treaty provides that a Contracting State's non-discrimination obligation does not extend to \"special advantages\" accorded by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions, or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions. It makes no reference to double taxation agreements or to special treatment based on reciprocity. The Respondent considers that \"[t]he inclusion of these latter two exemptions in Article 4, and their absence from Article 3, demonstrates that Article 4 was intended as the exclusive provision addressing fiscal measures. If this were not the case, then an investor whose claim for fiscal measures was barred by one of the \u2018special fiscal advantage' exemptions in Article 4 would be permitted to circumvent the bar by pursuing the claim under Article 3, a result that would make Article 4's exemptions meaningless\"309.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6139.\n\n233.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, accepting the Claimants' submission that \"[n]othing in [Article 4] carves out fiscal measures from the FET standard of Article 3(1)\", would render Article 4 superfluous. Article 4 does not provide additional requirements to FET. According to the Respondent, Article 4 is more restrictive than Article 3, not more expansive.310\n\nRej. M. \u00b6\u00b6100-101.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent considers that \"entertaining Claimants' FET claims based on fiscal measures would be tantamount to rewriting the Dutch Treaty to create a new form of claim for non-discriminatory fiscal measures\", which would be contrary to the rules established in the Vienna Convention.311\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 141.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants submit that nothing in Article 4 of the Treaty carves out fiscal measures from the FET standard of Article 3(1).312 Just because Article 4 regulates *some* aspects of fiscal measures, it cannot be inferred that Article 4 regulates *all* aspects of fiscal measures.313 According to the Claimants, Article 4 does not exclude all other provisions of the Treaty that apply to the State's treatment of investments (such as the FET standard of Article 3(1), the umbrella clause in Article 3(4) and the expropriation standards of Article 6).314\n\nReply M. \u00b6 103.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nReply M. \u00b6 104 *.*\n\n236.\n\nIt is the Claimants' position that, if Article 4 were to be construed as an exception to Article 3, then it should have included language to that effect. The Tribunal cannot do violence to the terms of Article 4 and read language into the provision that is not there. This is all the more so, according to the Claimants, when Article 4 can be given meaning without adding language.\n\n237.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's reliance on Article 3(3) of the Treaty, the Claimants submit that \"at most, Article 4 of the Treaty provides a special rule that supersedes the more general rule of Article 3(3) in the matter in which both rules overlap, that is, in respect of the State's obligation to afford MFN treatment.\"315 According to the Claimants, the Respondent wrongly extends Article 4 of the Treaty beyond the area of its overlap with Article 3(1). There is no basis for applying Article 4 to standards (such as FET and expropriation) that are not set forth in Article 3(3), but in other provisions of the Treaty316.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as Article 4 itself requires MFN treatment for taxation measures, \"it is absurd to construe Article 4 as (i) excluding taxation measures from most of the substantive standards of the Treaty while (ii) allowing the MFN principle of Article 4 to subject taxation measures to analogous substantive standards incorporated from other treaties made by Venezuela.\"317 The Claimants also contend that the Respondent's reliance on other treaties and on decisions of other arbitral tribunals is misplaced. In fact, the authorities cited by the Respondent explicitly state that substantive protections do not extend to taxation measures. Since that explicit language is absent in Article 4, the Claimants contend that, by contrast, Article 4 was not intended to carve out taxes from its scope of protection318.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b626.\n\nReply M. \u00b6105.\n\n239.\n\nBefore analyzing the Parties' positions on the interaction between Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty, it is helpful to quote the relevant provisions. Article 3 of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\n\n(2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full physical security and protection which in any case shall not be less than that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the national concerned.\n\n(3) If a Contracting Party has accorded special advantages to nationals of any third State by virtue of agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions, or on the basis of interim agreements leading to such unions or institutions, that Contracting Party shall not be obliged to accord such advantages to nationals of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to the treatment of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contacting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.\"\n\n240.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT provides the following:\n\n\"With respect to taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other Contracting Party with respect to their investments in its territory treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or to those of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose, however, there shall not be taken into account any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party;\n\n(a) Under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or\n\n(b) by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union, or similar institutions; or\n\n(c) on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.\"\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants postulate that nothing in Article 4 carves out fiscal measures from the FET standard of Article 3(1) of the Treaty. To the contrary, the Respondent contends that Article 4 of the Treaty carves out fiscal measures from the FET standard of Article 3(1).\n\n242.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the Tribunal must interpret Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty, for which it turns to the Vienna Convention. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires that a treaty be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". To confirm the meaning of the provision of a treaty, recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, which include the circumstances of the treaty's conclusion319.\n\nVienna Convention, Article 32 (Ex. CL-71).\n\n243.\n\nBroadly put, Article 4 of the Treaty guarantees national and most favored nation treatment to investors with respect to \"taxes, fees, charges, and to fiscal deductions and exemptions.\" Article 4 is more specific than Article 3, which is generally concerned with the \"treatment of investments\". However, Article 4 contains no mention of \"fair and equitable treatment\". In addition, the treatment guaranteed by Article 4 is subject to three exceptions, two of which are not included in Article 3(3). The Tribunal considers that Article 4 comprehensively regulates the standards of treatment with respect to fiscal measures by providing for national and most favored nation treatment, and a list of applicable exceptions.\n\n244.\n\nIf the Claimants' argument were followed, namely that Article 3(1) operates in parallel with Article 4 regarding fiscal measures, the two exceptions in Article 4 that do not appear in Article 3(3) would be rendered meaningless, as they could be circumvented by relying on the broader provisions of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n245.\n\nConversely, the one exception covered by both Article 4 and Article 3(3) would be duplicated and therefore redundant. In particular, Article 3(3) of the BIT contains an exception in respect of \"agreements establishing customs unions, economic unions, monetary unions or similar institutions\", which is essentially reproduced in Article 4: \"participation in a customs union, economic union, or similar institutions.\" Thus, the Claimants' interpretation would result in at least one provision being rendered redundant - an outcome that should be avoided in treaty interpretation.\n\n246.\n\nMoreover, if the purpose of the Treaty had been not to carve out fiscal measures from the more general Article 4, then the easiest way to achieve it would have been to incorporate the exceptions contained in Article 4 in Article 3(3) itself. There would have been no need to draft an article dealing with fiscal measures and containing specific exceptions (double-taxation agreements, customs, economic or similar unions and special treatment based on reciprocity with a third State).\n\n247.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants' interpretation is not supported by the structure and wording of Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty, and that the correct interpretation is that Article 3 and Article 4 are distinct provisions, the latter governing fiscal measures exclusively. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that fiscal measures are subject only to the national and most favored nation treatment obligations contained in Article 4 of the Treaty, and are carved out of Article 3(1), which contains the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.320 The Tribunal notes that the claim relating to the extraction tax is based only on Article 3(1) of the Treaty, not on Article 4. Since Article 3(1) does not apply to fiscal measures, the extraction tax claim based on the breach of the FET standard is rejected.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the same conclusion was recently reached in *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V.,* *ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and Conoco Phillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Veneuzela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30), Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits of 3 September 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 297-317.\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusions regarding FET also apply to arbitrary or discriminatory treatment relating to the extraction tax. The extraction tax claim for arbitrary or discriminatory treatment is made under Article 3(1) of the Treaty, which, for the reasons given, is inapplicable. As a result, the arbitrary or discriminatory claim relating to the extraction tax is equally rejected.\n\n**B. THE PRODUCTION AND EXPORT CURTAILMENTS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the series of production and export curtailments imposed by the Respondent on the Cerro Negro Project from late 2006 through the first part of 2007321 reduced its production by approximately 560,000 barrels of extra-heavy crude in 2006, as compared with the production target for 2006, and reduced its exports by about 5.5 million barrels of synthetic crude oil by the end of June 2007, when compared to the export target for the first half of 2007322.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6156.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6160.\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimants' contend that these production and export cuts violated both the Framework of Conditions of the Cerro Negro Project and the Association Agreement, which permitted \"production cuts only if they were necessary to comply with Venezuela's international commitments, and only if they were applicable on a *pro rata* basis to all producers in Venezuela\"323. According to the Claimants, the production cut imposed in October 2006 was not required to comply with any international obligation of the Republic, and none of them were applied on a *pro rata* basis to all producers in Venezuela324. To the contrary, the Claimants contend that they were in breach of FET as well as arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, and thus violated Article 3(1) of the BIT325.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6161.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6162. See also Reply M. \u00b6\u00b6152 to 160.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6279 and \u00b6 283; Reply M. \u00b6\u00b6141 and 143.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they have sustained damages amounting to a total of US$ 53.6 million as a result of the curtailments imposed during this period326.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6312; Graves First Expert Report, Section IV.B.\n\n252.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the 2006 curtailments did not meet the *de minimis* exception set forth in the Cerro Negro Association Agreement, and the same would have been true for 2007 had Mobil Cerro Negro remained in the Project327. The Respondent contends that the discriminatory treatment claim cannot be sustained given that the export curtailments were not directed at the Cerro Negro Project because of the nationality of Mobil Cerro Negro. In fact, all of the upgrading projects of the Orinoco Oil Belt were curtailed, regardless of nationality. Finally, the Respondent alleges that the differences of the Cerro Negro Project when compared to the other projects in Venezuela render any discrimination claim without merit328.\n\nC.Mem. M. \u00b6 79.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 226.\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent considers that any adverse impact of the 2007 measures has been grossly inflated by the Claimants329.\n\nC. Mem. M. fn. 176; Rej. M. \u00b6 175.\n\n254.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal would like to point out that it is seized of a treaty claim, which must be carefully distinguished from the contract claims submitted to the ICC tribunal. Thus, and as explained in paragraph 218 above, the contractual limitation contained in Clause 15 of the Association Agreement concluded between PDVSA and the Claimants and referred to in the ICC arbitration does not apply in the present case, which concerns Venezuela's responsibility under the Treaty. The arguments developed by the Respondent to the contrary, as well as those based on the Twentieth Condition of the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization, cannot be upheld.\n\n255.\n\nThe Tribunal has only to consider whether the measures taken by Venezuela regarding production and exports were compatible with the fair and equitable treatment standard and with the prohibition of arbitrary or discriminatory treatment contained in Article 3(1) of the BIT - quoted in paragraph 239 above.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the alleged breach of the FET standard. In the Tribunal's opinion, this standard may be breached by frustrating the expectations that the investor may have legitimately taken into account when making the investment. Legitimate expectations may result from specific formal assurances given by the host state in order to induce investment330. The Tribunal will thus consider whether in the present case legitimate expectations could reasonably have been the result of such assurances.\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States* (NAFTA Ch. 11, 8 June 2009), (Ex. CL-189); *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v.* *Republic of Lithuania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8), (Ex. R-303); *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), (Ex. CL-167); *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic* (PCA-UNCITRAL, IIC 210 (2006)), (Ex. CL-123).\n\n257.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal recalls that the Framework of Conditions of the Association Agreement for the exploitation, upgrading and marketing of extra-heavy crude oil to be produced in the Cerro Negro area of the Orinoco Oil Belt was approved by the Congress of Venezuela on 24 April 1997.\n\n258.\n\nCondition Ninth of the Framework of Conditions specified that \"an optimal production level was to be obtained \"by the time the upgrading installations start commercial operations\". The level of said production would be specified in the Association Agreement. Clause 8 of the Association Agreement fixed that level at 120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy oil (with the possibility of some increase, which the Tribunal will consider further on (see paragraphs 320 and 321below).\n\n259.\n\nCondition Thirteenth of the Framework of Conditions added that \"[i]f the Parties are required to reduce their production as a result of the international commitments of the Republic of Venezuela, such reduction shall not exceed the reduction percentage generally applicable to the national oil industry as a whole. This percentage shall be calculated based on the available production capacity. The Parties shall agree on an appropriate extension of the terms of the Association in the event of a reduction as those indicated herein\".\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, when making their investment, the Claimants could reasonably and legitimately have expected to produce at least 120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy crude oil and that their production would not be unilaterally reduced at a lower level except as provided for in Condition Thirteenth of the Framework of Conditions. Accordingly, the Tribunal will now examine whether the measures taken by Venezuela in 2006 and 2007 were contrary to those expectations.\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a distinction must be made between the production curtailment decided in October 2006 and the curtailments imposed later.\n\n262.\n\nOn 9 October 2006, Venezuela imposed a production cut of natural hydrocarbon to all oil producers, applicable on a *pro rata* basis. It is not contested that this reduction was not the result of an OPEC decision. It was a measure imposed by Venezuela in spite of the assurances given in Condition Ninth of the Framework of Conditions, as specified in Clause 8 of the Association Agreement, and it did not fall within the requirements of Condition Thirteenth of the Framework of Conditions.\n\n263.\n\nA new production curtailment was decided on November 2006, followed from January 2007 to March 2007 by export curtailments. All these curtailments constituted measures adopted as a consequence of OPEC decisions, and in this sense it is not contested that they fall within the requirements of Condition Thirteenth of the Framework of Conditions. However, these measures only concerned the Orinoco oil producers. They were not shared on a *pro rata* basis as required by Condition Thirteenth.\n\n264.\n\nIt thus appears that the production and export curtailments imposed from November 2006 were incompatible with the Claimants' reasonable and legitimate expectations, and thus breached the FET standard contained in Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Respondent is responsible for the damage resulting from this breach.\n\n265.\n\nIn order to calculate the quantum of the damages suffered as a consequence of this breach, the Claimants produced an Expert Report by Mr. R. Dean Graves evaluating the damages resulting from the production and export curtailments at US$ 53.6 million.\n\n266.\n\nThe Expert calculates the volume of extra heavy oil that the Cerro Negro project would have produced between October 2006 and June 2007 had the curtailments not been imposed, and determines the corresponding curtailed SCO sales. The figure of 41 2/3% reached by Mr. Graves for Mobil Cerro negro must be revised for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the export curtailments were not a limiting factor on SCO production and sales since April 2007. Instead, SCO production and sales were constrained because of \"repairs to the coker drums that reduced the EHCO feed rates to the upgrader by almost half\"331. Moreover, according to the Respondent, in 2007 the Project was not in a position to produce at the levels relied on by the Claimants because of the large inventory of inactive wells that existed in the first half of 2007332. The Claimants did not persuasively contest these statements either at the hearing or in their post-hearing briefs.\n\n(b) Mr. Graves bases his calculations on the difference between the sales that would have been achieved if the Project had produced 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO and the sales that were actually made. However, starting in November 2006, the figure must be lowered to reflect the *pro rata* production cut which was legally imposed in accordance with Condition Thirteenth of the Framework of Conditions as a result of the OPEC decision.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 175.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 175.\n\n267.\n\nTaking these elements into account, the Tribunal evaluates the impact of the curtailments on the Claimants' SCO volume of sales at a total of 815,068 barrels of EHCO.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the oil prices used by the Claimants' Expert, which from October 2006 to March 2007 vary from US$ 39.96 to US$ 44.74 per barrel of SCO. It is on that basis that the Tribunal has calculated the value of the Claimants' curtailed SCO sales at US$ 30,781,144 for the relevant period.\n\n269.\n\nThe curtailed co-production sales, amounting to US$ 850,442, must be added to this amount. The balance amount must then be reduced by deducting: (i) production costs, which amount to US$ 2,716,663; (ii) taxes, which amount to US$ 655,195 in science and technology tax, US$ 239,169 in drug and alcohol tax, US$ 31,631 in export registration contribution; (iii) US$ 34,868 in co-production royalties; and (v) US$ 10,667,359 in extraction tax at the rate of 33 1/3% (see paragraph 96 above). It must also be reduced by deducting the income tax at the rate of 34% for 2006 and 50% for 2007, for a total amount of US$ 8,104,531. Finally, capital expenses must be deduced, in the amount of US$ 139,688.\n\n270.\n\nOn the basis of these calculations, the Tribunal evaluates the damages suffered by the Claimants as a result of the production and export curtailments at US$ 9,042,482.\n\n271.\n\nThe ICC tribunal had decided that the export curtailments taken in 2007 constituted discriminatory measures under the Association Agreement and awarded compensation to Cerro Negro Ltd (Bahamas) for the damages suffered as a result of those measures. It is not contested that these damages have been paid by Lagoven CN, the respondent in the ICC proceeding. It is also not contested that, under clause 15(1) of the Association Agreement, the Claimants must, upon payment of the compensation awarded in this proceeding for the same measures, reimburse Lagoven CN the sum already recovered as compensation for the prejudice resulting from the 2007 curtailments. The Claimants have expressly stated that they will make the required reimbursement to PDVSA-CN. Although this statement is based on a contractual obligation that is foreign to the present case, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt the Claimants' representation. Double recovery will thus be avoided.\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants add that the Respondent's conduct was not only contrary to the FET standard, but also arbitrary and discriminatory. On that ground too, the Respondent would be in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT and therefore responsible for the damage suffered by the Claimants as a result of this breach.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the production and export curtailment measures breached the FET standard contained in Article 3(1) of the Treaty (see paragraph 264 above). The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to separately examine whether the Respondent's conduct was also arbitrary and/or discriminatory. Indeed, the Claimants would not be entitled to greater relief even if the Tribunal were to establish a breach of these BIT protections.\n\n**C. THE COERCION AND THE EXPROPRIATION MEASURES**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nIn addition to their expropriation claims under Article 6 of the BIT, the Claimants briefly submit that \"each of the Respondent's measures giving rise to claims is in breach of the unqualified Fair and Equitable Treatment standard\"333 and that \"the Respondent's measures discussed earlier as violations of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard were arbitrary\"334. The inference seems to be that the alleged coertion and expropriation measures are also claimed to breach Article 3(1) of the BIT335.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 271.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 280.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 284.\n\n275.\n\nIn respect of the claims regarding the alleged coercion of the Claimants into migration and the claim relating to the expropriation measures, the Tribunal has found that the expropriation was conducted in accordance with due process (see paragraph 297 below), that it was not carried out contrary to undertakings given to the Claimants in this respect (see paragraph 299 below) and that the Claimant have not established that the offers made by Venezuela were incompatible with the \"just\" compensation requirement of Article 6(c) of the BIT (see paragraph 305 below). The Tribunal has concluded that the expropriation itself was conducted in a lawful manner (see paragraph 306 below).336\n\nThe expropriation of the Claimants' \"discrete rights\" is also claimed to be arbitrary. The measures in question for this claim (reproduced at para. 282 below) are the same as those challenged in this section VII, in which the Tribunal has examined the consistency of the measures with Article 3(1) of the Treaty. Hence, the Tribunal no longer needs to decide this claim.\n\n276.\n\nOn this background, the Tribunal finds no additional elements in the record establishing a violation of FET or the arbitrary or discriminatory treatment standard in respect of these measures. These claims have been too briefly and too unconvincingly developed to enable the decision sought from the Tribunal. Accordingly, these claims are dismissed.\n\n**D. THE SEVERANCE PAYMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the removal of Operadora Cerro Negro from its role as the operating company for the Cerro Negro Project by Decree-Law 5200, which took effect in April 2007. They submit that this change was arbitrary and discriminatory and violated the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in Article 3(1) of the BIT. According to the Claimants, as a consequence of the removal, the company was required to make severance payments to Operadora Cerro Negro's displaced Venezuelan employees. On the basis of Mr. R. Dean Graves' report, the Claimants contend that the damages resulting from those payments amount to US$ 2.7 million337, and request the corresponding compensation. The Respondent contested this claim in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits338 and the matter was not further addressed in any detail.\n\nMem. M. \u00a7313\n\nC.Mem M. \u00a7215\n\n278.\n\nUnder the circumstances and bearing in mind the findings recalled in paragraph 275 above, the Tribunal is unable on the basis of the record to conclude that the removal of Operadora Cerro Negro from its role as the operating company for the Cerro Negro Project by Decree-Law 5200 constituted a violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty. In any case, besides relying on the expert report of Mr. Graves, the Claimants have not furnished any evidence of damage suffered as a consequence of this alleged breach. Therefore, this claim must be dismissed.\n\n**VIII. EXPROPRIATION**\n-----------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Venezuela has breached Article 6 of the BIT by wrongfully expropriating its investments in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects. The Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant's investments were expropriated, but contends that that expropriation was lawful.\n\n280.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT provides the following:\n\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take measures to expropriate or nationalise investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party or take measures having an effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation with regard to such investments, unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\na) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\nb) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party taking such measures may have given;\n\nc) the measures are taken against just compensation.\n\nSuch compensation shall represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is earlier; it shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and, shall, in order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable, without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in any convertible currency accepted by the claimants.\"\n\n**A. EXPROPRIATION OF \"DISCRETE RIGHTS\" BEFORE JUNE 2007**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants submit that before \"Decree-Law 5200 directly expropriated the Claimants' rights and interests in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects, they had already been permanently deprived of the benefit of discrete rights pertaining to their investments339 by measures having an effect equivalent to expropriation340. The indirect expropriation of the Claimants' rights was wrongful under the BIT because it was carried out without due process of law, contrary to undertakings and without compensation341.\n\nMem.

M. 1 243.\n\n282.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the following measures permanently deprived them of the benefit of their rights:\n\n**.** Imposing a higher income-tax rate to the participants in extra-heavy oil projects;\n\n**.** Adopting an extraction tax;\n\n**.** Imposing unjustified and discriminatory production and export curtailments;\n\n**.** Appointing a new operator for the Cerro Negro Project by decree (severance payments claim).\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants state that each of the expropriated rights falls within the definition of investment given in article 1(a) of the BIT and is separately protected by Article 6 of the BIT342.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 1, 102:22-23.\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in the absence of special circumstances, such as it would be in the case of confiscatory taxes, taxation does not constitute expropriation.343 According to the Respondent, the fiscal measures adopted did not prevent the Claimants from enjoying profitable operations in Venezuela due to the unprecedented environment of high oil prices. Accordingly, the fiscal measures may not be considered \"confiscatory\" and therefore did not constitute expropriation344.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 228.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6239.\n\n285.\n\nRegarding the non-fiscal measures, the Respondent considers that they do not satisfy the \"substantial deprivation\" test for expropriation345. Moreover, according to the Respondent, \"there is no authority to support the theory of partial expropriation on the basis of a right that is not capable of independent economic exploitation severable from the remainder of the investment\"346. According to the Respondent, the proper analysis for determining whether an expropriation has occurred is the effect on the investment as a whole347.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6244.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 2, 156:5-9.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6250.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal has to determine whether the measures referred to by the Claimants had an effect equivalent to expropriation within the meaning of Article 6 of the BIT. The Tribunal considers that, under international law, a measure which does not have all the features of a formal expropriation may be equivalent to an expropriation if it gives rise to an effective deprivation of the investment as a whole. Such a deprivation requires either a total loss of the investment's value or a total loss of control by the investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature.\n\n287.\n\nIt is undisputed that those conditions are not fulfilled in the present case with respect to either the Cerro Negro Project or the La Ceiba Project. Accordingly, the premigration measures enumerated by the Claimants cannot be characterized as equivalent to an expropriation of the Claimants' investments.\n\n**B. EXPROPRIATION OF THE CERRO NEGRO AND LA CEIBA PROJECTS IN JUNE 2007**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Claimants' investments were expropriated on 27 June 2007 in implementation of Decree-Law 5200 (see paragraphs 111 to 113 above). The Claimants submit that that expropriation was unlawful and that, as a consequence, the Respondent is under the obligation to make full reparation for the damages caused, in conformity with international law348. By contrast, the Respondent contends that the expropriation was lawful and that the indemnity to be paid to the Claimants must represent the market value of the investment in June 2007, as provided for in article 6 of the BIT.349 The Respondent considers that the same rules would apply even if the expropriation was deemed to have been unlawful350.\n\nMem. M. 11295 to 304, referring in particular to the *Factory of Chorzow* case (Germany v. Poland, Judgment on the merits, 13 September 1928), (Ex. CL-150) 1 47.\n\nC. Mem. M. 1 260.\n\nC. Mem. M. 1 262.\n\n289.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether the expropriation of the Claimants' investments was carried out lawfully, and then address the compensation claim.\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the measures taken by Venezuela fail to meet at least three of the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT in that: (i) they were taken without due process of law; (ii) they were contrary to the Respondent's undertakings; and (iii) they were not taken against any compensation, let alone just compensation. Non-compliance with any of these requirements would render the expropriation wrongful under the BIT351.\n\nMem. \u00b6 257.\n\n291.\n\nOn the first point, the Claimants submit that the process through which the expropriation was carried out was a coercive process which did not follow any established legal procedure to determine their rights before title of the assets was transferred to a PVDSA subsidiary352. On the second point, the Claimants submit that the expropriation was made against specific commitments regarding the legal frameworks applicable to the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects353. On the third point, the Claimants contend that the Respondent has not provided any compensation to the Claimants. Failure to pay compensation itself renders the expropriation wrongful354.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6\u00b6 262, 264.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 265.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 259.\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the nationalization was carried out pursuant to a law of public policy, in an orderly and non-discriminatory manner and for a public purpose, in accordance with a process established by duly enacted laws which in fact satisfied most of the oil companies operating in the country355. The Respondent denies that specific commitments were made by Venezuela surrendering its sovereign right to regulate or even expropriate interests in the oil sector. The Respondent further contends that it engaged in bona fide negotiations with the Claimants regarding compensation, but an agreement was not possible due to the Claimants' demands356. Failure to agree upon the amount of compensation does not render an expropriation unlawful357.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6\u00b6 230-231.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 230.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 266.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, under the 2001 Hydrocarbon Law, oil production activities were reserved to the State and that private Parties were authorized to participate in those activities only through mixed enterprises in which the State owned more than 50% of the shares. However, the Orinoco Oil Belt Associations (such as the Cerro Negro Project) and the Profit Sharing Agreements (such as the La Ceiba Project) remained outside that legal framework.\n\n294.\n\nSix years later, the Venezuelan authorities decided to put an end to this special regime. On 1 February 2007, the National Assembly adopted a law enabling the President to take the measures required to that effect. In implementation of the Enabling Law, Decree-Law 5200 ordered that the Associations located in the Orinoco Oil Belt and the At-Risk-and-Shared-Profits Associations be \"migrated\" into new mixed companies under the 2001 Hydrocarbon Law. Article 4 of DecreeLaw 5200 gave the oil company four months, until 26 June 2007, to agree to participate in the new mixed companies. Article 5 provided that, if no agreement was reached on such a migration by the end of that period, Venezuela would \"directly assume the activities of the Associations\"358.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 174.\n\n295.\n\nThroughout those four months, discussions took place between Mobil Cerro Negro, Mobil Venezolana and the Respondent about the potential participation of the Claimants in the new mixed enterprises. No agreement was reached.\n\n296.\n\nAs a consequence, on 27 June 2007, the Respondent seized the investments of Mobil Cerro Negro in the Cerro Negro Project and the investments of Mobil Venezolana in the La Ceiba Project. The Law on Effects of the Migration, enacted on 5 October 2007, ratified the expropriation and ordered that the interests and assets formerly belonging to the companies that had not agreed to migrate be formally transferred to the new mixed companies (see paragraphs 113 and 114 above).\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the expropriation of the Claimants' investments was the result of laws enacted by the National Assembly and of decisions taken by the President of the Republic of Venezuela, the purpose of which was to create new mixed companies in which the State would own more than 50% of the shares. Negotiations with the oil companies were foreseen to that effect for a period of four months, and nationalization was contemplated only in case of failure of those negotiations. In the present case, the negotiations failed. In other cases recalled by the Respondent, the negotiations were successful, e.g. with Chevron, Total, Statoil, Sinopec or BP. The Tribunal considers that this process, which enabled the participating companies to weigh their interests and make decisions during a reasonable period of time, was compatible with the due process obligation of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n298.\n\nRegarding the Claimants' allegation that specific commitments were made by the Respondent that the 2001 Hydrocarbon Law would not be applied to the existing associations, the Tribunal notes that (i) the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization specifically indicates that the Association Agreement and all activities and operations conducted under it would not impose any obligations on the Respondent, nor restrict its sovereign powers; and that (ii) the Congressional Authorization covering La Ceiba stated that the Agreement, as well as all activities and operations derived from it, would in no case create liability for the Respondent nor diminish its sovereign rights.\n\n299.\n\nBoth Authorizations provided that Venezuelan Law would govern the Agreements. Both Agreements referred to those Authorizations. In reserving its sovereign rights, the Respondent reserved *inter alia* its right to expropriate the Claimants' investments. There is no indication that Venezuela later committed not to exercise that right. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the expropriation was not carried out contrary to undertakings given in this respect to the Claimants.\n\n300.\n\nRegarding the Claimants' allegation that the Respondent \"has not determined, has not tendered, and has not paid the compensation required by the Treaty\"359, which is enough to render the expropriation wrongful360, and the Respondent's counterargument that it has always been willing to provide compensation and that in any case the mere fact of not having received compensation does not render a nationalization unlawful, the Tribunal observes the following.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6\u00b631-32.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b631.\n\n301.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Claimants did not receive compensation and that Venezuela did not fulfil its obligation to pay compensation in accordance with Article 6(c) of the BIT. However, the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful. An offer of compensation may have been made to the investor and, in such a case, the legality of the expropriation will depend on the terms of that offer. In order to decide whether an expropriation is lawful or not in the absence of payment of compensation, a tribunal must consider the facts of the case.\n\n302.\n\nThere are no provisions in Decree-Law 5200 envisaging compensation. In fact, the Tribunal also notes that the Law on the Effects of Migration contains a reference to a \"reversion principle\" which could be construed as excluding compensation. However, it is undisputed that discussions took place in 2007 between the Parties on the compensation that was due to the Claimants on account of the expropriation.\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal has limited information concerning those discussions361. The Claimants largely rely on press reports to substantiate their position362. They also rely on a statement made on 14 February 2008 by Minister Ramirez (the Minister of Energy at the time) in the National Assembly stating that the Government would only pay book value for the extra-heavy oil assets in the Orinoco Oil Belt.363 But these press reports and public statements do not constitute evidence of what exactly happened during the discussions in 2007.\n\nFor a case in which more information was available, see fn. 320 above.\n\nEx. C-439.\n\nEx. C-483.\n\n304.\n\nIn this respect, Mr. Cutt (the then President of Mobil Oil Cerro Negro) testified that: \"We had several meetings with the Ministry of Energy regarding compensation for the government's taking of our interests in [the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba]... joint ventures. We engaged in those meetings with the understanding that the content of those discussions was not going to be used in any contentious proceeding between the Government, including its state-owned entities, and Mobil Cerro Negro\".364 However, at the hearing, the Respondent denied that the Claimants were under any kind of confidentiality obligation365 and even released them from that commitment should one exist366. Despite the Respondent's confirmation, the Claimants have not sought leave to make a late filing of contemporaneous correspondence that would support their position.\n\nCutt WS \u00b6 57.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 3, 109:14-25.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 2, 159: 22-24.\n\n305.\n\nIt was the Claimants' burden to prove their allegations concerning the position taken by Venezuela during the discussions regarding the compensation to be paid. It is not disputed that negotiations too place, and it has been established that Venezuela made proposals during those negotiations. It seems likely that there were discussions at the time on the method of valuation of the expropriated interests, on the relevance of the cap provisions referred to by Venezuela and on the exact amount of the compensation payable to the Claimants.367 The Tribunal finds that the evidence submitted does not demonstrate that the proposals made by Venezuela were incompatible with the requirement of \"just\" compensation of Article 6(c) of the BIT. Accordingly, the Claimants have not established the unlawfulness of the expropriation on that ground.\n\nOn that last point, the Tribunal has been presented with contemporaneous press report indicating that \"Exxon has demanded $5 billion in redress of its assets; but PVDSA claims $750 million would be fair compensation\" (First Cline Expert Report).\n\n306.\n\nIn light of the above, the claim that the expropriation was unlawful is rejected. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not need to consider the standard for compensation in case of unlawful expropriation or whether it would differ from the standard for compensation to be paid in case of lawful expropriation. The compensation must be calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.368\n\nNeither Party has questioned the Tribunal's jurisdiction to fix the compensation payable to the Claimants in conformity with Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n**C. QUANTUM OF THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT requires that \"just compensation\" be paid to the Claimants. Such compensation must \"represent the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier\". In the present case, the market value must be determined immediately after the failure of the negotiations between the Parties and before the expropriation, *i.e.*, on 27 June 2007369, and it must correspond to the amount that a willing buyer would have been ready to pay to a willing seller at the time in order to acquire the expropriated interests.\n\nSee, for instance *Libyan American Oil Company (LIAMCO) v. The Government of the Libyan Arab Republic* (Award, 12 April 1977), (Ex. R-340) p.p. 138-139.\n\n308.\n\nWith respect to Cerro Negro, the Parties agree that this evaluation must be made in accordance with a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis for the Claimants' lost interests370. Accordingly, the Parties have evaluated the net cash flows that would have been generated by the investment over its remaining life, *i.e.*, until June 2035, and discount them to their present value. However, they diverge in their determination of the net cash flows and the discount rate.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have consistently used the date of 27 June 2007 in their calculations for this purpose. (See, Mem. M. \u00b6\u00b6 330-331; Reply M., fn. 642).\n\n**1. Net Cash Flow**\n--------------------\n\n309.\n\nTo calculate the net cash flows, one must forecast the future revenues and expenses of the Cerro Negro Project. In the present case, the revenues forecast is mainly determined by the volume of production of oil and by the oil price level, while the expenses forecast depends on the cost of the operations, the capital investment, if any, and the royalties and taxes to be paid to the Government. On these points, the Parties have developed detailed legal arguments and produced several witness statements and expert reports, which have been most helpful to the Tribunal.\n\n**a) Volume of Production**\n---------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Parties disagree with respect to the future volume of production to be taken into consideration in order to calculate the compensation. The Claimants submit that: \"At the time the Cerro Negro Project was built, the participants and the Venezuelan Congress set an initial production target of 120,000 barrels per day of extra-heavy oil\" (EHCO), but they add that that was \"without prejudice to the right to expand production later\"371. Accordingly, the Claimants contend that the initial production facilities were designed to produce 120,000 barrels per day, but they retained the right to expand this amount. They submit that, by applying thermal EOR techniques, improving existing facilities and constructing a second upgrader, they would have produced 344,000 barrels of EHCO per day as soon as 2014372. They request compensation on the basis of such volume of production.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 326.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 327.\n\n311.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that the proper valuation needs to consider a maximum EHCO production of 120,000 barrels per day, not any other increased number373. According to the Respondent, a production limit of 120,000 barrels per day was fixed and implemented long before the Dutch restructuring. In fact, a dispute arose between the Parties at that time on the subject. Accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider that dispute and, as a consequence, it also lacks jurisdiction over any claim for a project expanded beyond 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO. Such a project may not be taken into account for the purposes of determining compensation.\n\nRej. M \u00b6227.\n\n312.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants would have required the approval of the Venezuelan authorities for the contemplated expansion, and such approval could only have been given in conformity with the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law, under conditions which the Claimants twice found to be unacceptable. Finally, the Respondent adds that the expansion scenario depicted by the Claimants is not technically feasible and relies on unrealistic economic assumptions. As an alternative, the Respondent points out that there would be no basis for using the discount cash flow method to assess the value of a new project.\n\n313.\n\nIn response to these arguments, the Claimants contend that the Respondent never imposed a production limit to the Project. According to the Claimants, in 2005 Venezuela imposed a 30% royalty rate on production volumes exceeding a monthly average of 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO. At the time, the Claimants complained about that new royalty. However, they retained their right to increase production despite the imposed royalty. Accordingly, the dispute that existed at the time about the royalty does not affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider the expanded project, which was technically and economically feasible, and to take it into account when determining the amount of compensation.\n\n314.\n\nWith respect to jurisdiction, the Tribunal observes that the Claimants' claim is not directed against the measures adopted in 2005 by the Respondent. It is a claim for compensation for the expropriation done in 2007. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider that claim and to establish the amount of compensation to be paid to the Claimants as a result of that expropriation. Accordingly, the analysis of the Tribunal must include the volume of production forecasted from 27 June 2007 to 30 September 2035. In order to determine that volume, the Tribunal must decide whether a willing buyer would have taken into account in June 2007 that the Claimants had the right to increase their production beyond 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to make this determination.\n\n315.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal first notes that, under article 5 of the 1975 Nationalization Law, the execution of association agreements such as the Cerro Negro one required the prior authorization of the Congressional Chambers in joint session, within their established conditions and having been duly informed by the National Executive of all the pertinent circumstances374.\n\nEx. C-214.\n\n316.\n\nThe Cerro Negro Association Agreement, approved by the National Assembly, contemplated a volume of production of 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO. However, Article 8(1)(c) did not exclude the possibility to \"increase the capacity of the upgrader or the production of Extra-Heavy Oil\", and specified that the consequential amendments to the Association Agreement and the other agreements relating to the Project would have to be agreed upon by the parties. No agreement would be required where the increase was carried out by one or more of the parties to the Association Agreement at their own risk and expense and assuming the title of all assets and rights derived from it. While this provision reserved the possibility of increasing the production of EHCO by increasing the capacity of the existing upgrader, it did not contemplate the possibility of building a new upgrader.\n\n317.\n\nIn 2004, all the participants to the Association Agreement considered a \"debottlenecking\" project, intended to increase the production from 120,000 to 144,000 barrels per day of EHCO. This increase would have been achieved by enhancing the capacity of components of the Project in order to allow full use of the capacity already available in other components375. However in December 2004, PDVSA-CN informed its partners that the agreement of the company and of the Ministry would be subordinated to the payment of a higher royalty, the use of EOR production techniques and the signature of a memorandum of understanding called Cerro Negro II, under which the incremental production would be commercialized by PVDSA. It added that the new 2001 Hydrocarbon Law would apply to the project376. In light of these requirements, the project was abandoned.\n\nMem. M., \u00b6139.\n\nEx. C-96.\n\n318.\n\nIn 2005, the Venezuelan authorities accused some oil associations of producing more than they had been authorized to produce. The companies were informed that production limits had to be respected and that any excess production would be subject to higher royalties. This was specified in particular in a letter377 from the Minister of Energy and Mines to the Cerro Negro Association dated 23 June 2005, which stated the following:\n\n\"...the volumes of hydrocarbons that exceed the average monthly production of 120 MBD are subject to the royalty of thirty percent (30%) provided for in Article 44 of the above-mentioned Decree with Force of Organic Law on Hydrocarbons. The same amount of royalty must be paid in cases of volumes related to the mixture of extra-heavy crudes [...]  \n The payment of the royalty referred to above does not legitimize the over-production indicated above and, consequently, does not imply any authorization of the activies referred to above or of the situations created.\"\n\nEx. C-41.\n\n319.\n\nIt appears that the Claimants abided by the production limit at all times after that decision was made and notified to the Projects participants378.\n\nMommer Supplemental WS \u00b612.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Project as contemplated today by the Claimants would almost triple the production of oil. This volume of production would require the construction of a new upgrader, at a cost evaluated by the Claimants at US$ 2.3 billion, as well as the extension of the existing facilities and of the maritime terminal at the San Jos\u00e9 Complex. A project of this magnitude does not fall within the scope of Clause 8(1)(c) of the Association Agreement approved by the Venezuelan legislature. This new project would require the approval of the Venezuelan authorities. In view of the position taken by the Administration in 2004 and 2005, such approval could not have been taken for granted by a prospective buyer in 2007.\n\n321.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that it cannot use the production volume that would have resulted from the adoption and implementation of this new project. The net cash flows must be calculated on the basis of an average monthly production of 120,000 barrels per day of EHCO. Based on the past experience analyzed in the experts' reports, this volume of production would, in the opinion of the Tribunal, allow for an average monthly production of 108,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude oil (SCO)379.\n\nC. Mem. M 354, fn. 689.\n\n322.\n\nThe experts agree that it would not be possible to achieve such a level at all times. Prof. Myers, the expert appointed by the Claimants, calculated the impact on production of risks such as \"episodes of civil unrest\", \"major unplanned outrages due to accidents or equipment failures\" and the possibility of OPEC curtailments. On these grounds, he proposes to reduce the expected production by 3.2%380. Prof. Myers specifies that this percentage does not take into account \"operational down time, typical failures and maintenance\"381. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells, the experts appointed by the Respondent, consider that the reductions made by Prof. Myers understate the effects of the events they address. Mr. Brailovsky and Prof. Wells stress that certain types of minor incidents and turn around factors must also be taken into account, and propose a reduction of approximately 5%.\n\nMyers Second Expert Report, Exhibit 59, table 6, p. 3.\n\nMyers First Expert Report, Appendix D.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered this question in light of the expert reports. The Tribunal concludes that the future average planned production must in the long run be reduced by approximately 4%, and that it could accordingly be fixed at 104,300 barrels per day of SCO. The corresponding production, year by year, appears in column 2 of the table annexed to this Award382.\n\nCalculations made on the basis of 188 days for 2007 and 273 days for 2035.\n\n**b) Oil Price**\n----------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Parties have produced detailed expert reports containing price forecasts for the Cerro Negro Synthetic Crude Oil (CN - SCO). These reports forecast SCO prices by benchmarking SCO to other price series for which there is more forecast information. In this respect, the experts (i) refer first to the price to be paid for West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil (WTI); and then (ii) derive the CN - SCO price from WTI in two steps, using a Mexican heavy sour crude oil called Maya as an intermediary. The experts differ on their forecast of WTI prices and on the discount to be applied from the benchmark WTI price to the SCO price.\n\n325.\n\nIn her second report, Ms. Sarah Emerson, of Energy Security Analysis (ESAI), expert for the Claimants, forecasts WTI prices as of 27 June 2007 on the basis of market analyses made by ESAI in 2007 and, in particular, on the basis of a report of that firm entitled \"Atlantic Basin Stockwatch\", published on 16 July 2007. Ms. Emerson anticipates a price of US$ 72.91 per barrel of WTI in the second half of 2007,383 decreasing to US$ 67.60 in 2013, then going up to US$ 105.52 in 2035384.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 6, p.50\n\nThis calculation is made in nominal US$ (\"actual dollars in the day\", Hearing Tr. Day 6, 29).\n\n326.\n\nThe three experts of Econ One Research, appointed by the Respondent, analyzed this differently. They collected twenty-three publicly available WTI price forecasts \"representing a view of the market formed during the first half of 2007\"385. They then chose the average WTI price forecast for each future year, and forecast a WTI price of US$ 67.97 per barrel in 2007, decreasing to US$ 59.69 in 2013, and finally increasing to US$ 92.78 in 2035.\n\nEcon One First Expert Report \u00b6 39.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered these reports. It first notes that from 2003 to 2006, WTI oil prices rose significantly above the US$ 20 / US$ 30 range of the late 1980s and 1990s. It peaked in the summer of 2006, reaching the US$ 70 range, but started to fall in autumn that year. In October 2006, OPEC decided to cut production in order to protect prices around US$55 / US$ 60. There was then some expectation of an increased production from non-OPEC countries, and analysts considered that the price could stay in the US$ 55/ US$ 65 range. However, there was no such increase, and the International Energy Agency tried in April and May 2007 to obtain an increase of production from OPEC in order to avoid running out of oil in 2007386. On 18 June 2007, OPEC formally rejected this option387. It then became clear that oil prices would rise again.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 6, pp. 78- 81.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n328.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the forecast of WTI prices made by the Econ One experts is based on data which, to some extent, no longer correspond to the situation as it was at the end of June 2007. By contrast, the forecast made by Ms. Emerson took those circumstances into account. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to use Ms. Emerson's forecast.\n\n329.\n\nTo determine the discount to be applied from WTI prices to SCO prices, Ms. Emerson first observed that the spread between ultra-low-sulfur diesel and high sulfur fuel oil constitutes a fairly good comparison of the spread between WTI and Maya prices. She then forecasted that spread, taking into account the foreseen evolution of the markets. In this respect, Ms. Emerson noted that OPEC intervention supported heavy sour crude388, that complex refiners sought heavy crude when crude quality differentials widened389 and that European diesel demand had grown390. On those grounds, she forecasted that the WTI-Maya spread would be reduced in the future. Then, Ms. Emerson used the SCO price formula contained in the Association Agreement to forecast the price of CN - SCO, and finally evaluated the spread WTI/SCO at around 22% for the second half of 2007, decreasing later to 19%.\n\nEmerson Expert Report, p. 15.\n\nEmerson Reply, p. 17.\n\nEmerson Reply, p. 16.\n\n330.\n\nThe Econ One experts analyzed the past relationship between WTI, Maya and SCO prices. From that analysis, they derived equations, which they used for their forecasts. On those grounds, they concluded that, as of mid-2007, Maya prices would fall 21% below WTI prices, while SCO prices would fall 7% below Maya prices.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, under the method used by the experts of Econ One, the spread between WTI, Maya and SCO prices will essentially remain unchanged in percentage in the future. The Tribunal considers that their method does not take into account the changes that could be foreseen in the market of oil products, or their consequences on the price of the different types of oil. Ms. Emerson's approach takes these elements into account, and therefore her method seems preferable to the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal will adopt Ms. Emerson's approach.\n\n**c) Future Revenues**\n----------------------\n\n332.\n\nIn her second report, Ms. Emerson produced a table indicating the CN - SCO prices forecasts from 2007 to 2035391. For the reasons mentioned above, the Tribunal will use Ms. Emerson's price forecasts (see Annex 1, column 3), and multiply them for each year by the annual SCO production on the basis of the figures referred to in paragraph 323 above. As a result of this calculation, the Tribunal obtains the SCO revenue forecast for the period that amounts to US$ 69,515.5 million (see Annex 1, column 4).\n\nSee p. 11, table A, second column.\n\n333.\n\nThis figure must be increased by adding the revenues from products other than SCO, such as petroleum coke, sulfur and natural gas. Prof. Myers considered that there could be some variations from year to year of the gross revenue resulting from the sale of those by-products. It results from these calculations that the revenue would generally amount to 2.20% to 2.70% of the gross revenue resulting from the synthetic crude oil sale392. The Respondent's experts evaluated them at 2.15%. Having carefully examined these reports in light of past experience and market forecasts in June 2007 (in particular for natural gas), the Tribunal has decided to fix that percentage at 2.50%. Accordingly, the by-products revenue forecast from 2007 to 2035 is calculated at US$ 1,737.9 million (see Annex 1 column 5).\n\nMyers First Expert Report, table 2.\n\n334.\n\nThe tribunal concludes that, on 27 June 2007, the future revenues of the Cerro Negro Project could be forecasted at US$ 71,253.4 million (see Annex 1, column 6).\n\n**d) Royalties and Extraction Tax**\n-----------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nIn order to obtain the net cash flow, this figure must be reduced by deducting the royalties and the extraction tax to be paid to Venezuela on oil production at the rate of 33 1/3% under the regime in effect at the date of the expropriation (see para 96 above). Since the royalties and the extraction tax are applied to the value attributable to EHCO, the amount to be paid must be calculated by converting the SCO prices and volumes into EHCO prices and volumes. The Tribunal used 94.09%393 for SCO and 110% for EHCO, and arrived to the conclusion that the deduction to be made for the royalties and the extraction tax amounts to US$ 23,982.6 million (see Annex 1, column 7).\n\nThe 94.09% had been agreed by the parties to the ICC arbitration (Econ One First Report \u00b612).\n\n336.\n\nThe royalties and the extraction tax are also applicable to the by-products referred to in paragraph 333 above. Applying a rate of 16 2/3%, the royalties and extraction tax deduction applicable to by-products amounts to US$ 289.6 million (see Annex 1, column 8).\n\n337.\n\nTherefore, the total amount to be deducted from the gross revenue in application of the royalties and the extraction tax amounts to US$ 24,272.3 million (see Annex 1, column 9).\n\n**e) Cost of Operation and Capital Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe second type of deduction to be made concerns the Project's costs of operation and the disbursements necessary to maintain oil production at the required level.\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimants produced detailed reports from Muse Stancil, which evaluate the cost of maintaining and improving upstream and downstream Cerro Negro installations in order to achieve a production of 344,000 barrels per day. In turn, Prof. Myers analyzed the risks that could affect those forecasts and made upward adjustments to account for inflation and uncertainty in currency exchange rates394.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 337.\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Econ One, started the evaluation of costs with the 2007 budget of the Cerro Negro Project. Econ One considers that this budget substantially underestimated inflation, did not take into account additional labor costs and did not include sufficient funds for repairs to the coker drums. It states that, \"in light of the low level of production capacity and the 11% rate of natural field decline, the Cerro Negro Project would have been required to undertake an immediate aggressive program both to repair inactive wells and to drill additional wells\"395. Accordingly, Econ One calculates the costs of such a program and adds the costs for well repairs and major maintenance of the upgrader, plus inflation in US dollars and overvaluation of the Bolivar396.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 362.\n\nC. Mem.M. \u00b6 368.\n\n341.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Econ One's cash-flow analysis exaggerates production costs. According to the Claimants, \"Econ One has assumed that capital expenditures would be incurred between 2008 and 2034 to prepare every well for EOR even though the Project would not use EOR\"397. They add that the Respondent's experts have also overestimated the capital cost of the well pads and the cost of major maintenance campaigns, and made unjustifiable adjustments to the amounts budgeted in 2007 because of local inflation398.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 230.\n\nReply M. \u00b6\u00b6232-234.\n\n342.\n\nWith respect to the costs of operation, the Tribunal recalls that, on 2 November 2006, a business plan prepared by OCN was presented to the Cerro Negro Board of Directors. This plan budgeted US$ 145.1 million in operating expenses for the whole year 2007, and the Tribunal regards it as the best indicator of what the Project participants expected to happen in the future in the absence of any adverse measures taken by the Venezuelan authorities399. The plan would have been available to any prospective buyer, and the Tribunal considers that such a buyer would have relied on it when forecasting the Project's operational costs for a production of 120,000 barrels per day. Accordingly, the Tribunal will also use it.\n\nICC Award \u00b6677.\n\n343.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the 2007 budget requires various adjustments in order to develop the operating costs projections. It contends that the Cerro Negro Project had a serious labor issue due to OCN's failure to pay a large number of workers the entire amount that was due to them regarding overtime400. According to Venezuela, the future operating costs must for that reason be annually increased by US$ 6.3 million, as calculated by Econ One on the basis of the testimony of Mr. Pereira401. By contrast, one of the Claimants' witnesses, Mr. Lawless, testified that, during the time when OCN operated the Cerro Negro Project, workers were paid in accordance with the provisions of the labor law then in effect. He added that he was \"not aware of any outstanding grievances relating to unpaid compensation of any sort that had been made against OCN through the time of the expropriation in June 2007\"402.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6358\n\nEcon One First Report \u00b616\n\nLawless WS \u00b615.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with a labor liability agreement signed on 30 October 2007 between the Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Empresa Operadora Cerro Negro and PDVSA, granting various indemnities to certain categories of workers403. However, the Tribunal has no evidence relating to the costs of that agreement. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that a prospective buyer could not have foreseen in June 2007 that such an agreement would be signed several months later. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not take into account the alleged increased labor costs in its calculation.\n\nLabor Liability Agreement, Pereira Second Supplementary WS, Appendix 26.\n\n345.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal considers that every five years extra expenses must be added to the budget to account for the maintenance of the upgrader and the CPF turnaround. In light of the expert reports, the Tribunal considers that the cost of each turnaround should be fixed at US$ 32.6 million for the upgrader and at US$ 0.5 million for the CPF turnaround. In addition, when projecting annual expenses after 2007, the figures must be corrected by applying an inflation factor of 2% per year and increasing costs by 6% to take into account the overvaluation of the Bolivar404. On these bases, the Tribunal considers that the total operating costs amount to US$ 6,056.7 million (see Annex 1, column 10).\n\nEcon One First Report \u00b622; Appendix 5, table 3.\n\n346.\n\nWith respect to investments to be made, the Tribunal notes that the experts of both Parties are roughly in agreement about the number of wells to be drilled, and that they have limited divergences on the cost and timing of the work to be done in order to maintain production at the appropriate level with the existing technique405.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 5, p.124 to 128.\n\n347.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimants were under an obligation to make further investments in order to prepare every well for EOR. The Tribunal is not aware of the existence of any legal or contractual obligation of that kind and will not take the proposed EOR investments into account. Accordingly, the Tribunal will determine the deduction corresponding to the investments to be made in accordance with the proposal made by Mr. Cline, expert for the Claimants, in table 5 of exhibit 1 to his first report. When projecting the deduction by year, the Tribunal has applied an inflation rate of 2% per year and increased costs by 6% to take into account the overvaluation of the Bolivar. On these bases, the reduction corresponding to the investments to be made amounts to US$ 1,779.9 million (see Annex 1, column 11).\n\n**f) Special Contributions**\n----------------------------\n\n348.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Cerro Negro Project had to pay special contributions, which must be deducted from the cash flows before applying the income tax. These special contributions are: (i) a contribution to science and technology of 2% of the gross revenue two years prior; (ii) an anti-drug enforcement contribution of 1% of the prior year's taxable income; and (iii) an export registration tax of 0.1% of the value of the exported hydrocarbons.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal has evaluated these contributions in accordance with the method used by the Econ One experts in their first report, and arrived to the conclusion that the sums to be paid on account of special contributions amount to (i) US$ 1,382.8 million for science and technology; (ii) US$ 387.6 million for anti-drug enforcement; and (iii) US$ 69.5 million for export registration (see Annex 1, columns 12, 13 and 14).\n\n**g) Income Tax**\n-----------------\n\n350.\n\nUnder the applicable Income Tax Law at the date of the expropriation, income tax is to be paid on the taxable income at a rate of 50% (see paragraph 99 above). The taxable income corresponds to the gross revenue less the OPEX, extraction taxes and other contributions, and it has been established at US$ 39,084.6 million (see Annex 1, column 15).\n\n351.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to take into account the full impact of income tax regulations in Venezuela.406 In particular, the Parties disagree on the consequences to be drawn from Venezuela's inflation. The Claimants' expert, Prof. Myers, recalls that depreciation \"is a tax deductible expense\" and adds that \"depreciation is determined by Venezuelan tax accounting rules, which are based on the inflation adjusted cost of capital investment\"407. As a consequence, he computed future depreciation expenses and deducted them from the taxable income.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 408\n\nMyers Expert Report, p. 49 and table 2. See also Graves Expert Report, p. 13.\n\n352.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Econ One, recognizes that inflation increases depreciation deductions over time. However, Econ One stresses that inflation also drives up the value of the assets. Therefore, it concludes that the income tax effects of inflation \"reflect the combined result of the additional tax owed on the appreciation less the reduction associated with the (...) added depreciation\"408. As a result, the effects of inflation on depreciation would increase, while the asset appreciation effects would diminish over the remaining life of the asset409.\n\nEcon One First Report \u00b6 26.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimants do not contest that inflation will create appreciation of taxable assets, but contend that Econ One has ignored other offsetting inflation adjustments to the taxable income410. In particular, the Claimants refer to Articles 179 and 184 of the Venezuelan Income Tax Law and submit that, \"[b]y considering only the inflation adjustment for non-monetary assets and liabilities, but disregarding the corresponding adjustment to equity, Econ One has substantially overstated tax expenses in its forecasted flows\"411.\n\nReply. M. \u00b6 235.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n354.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Venezuela's Income Tax Law requires that a second set of accounts, independent from those used for financial reporting, be maintained for tax purposes. In these accounts, the appreciation of assets that has been caused by inflation is counter-balanced by an account called \"Readjustment for inflation\", not by an increase to equity. According to the Respondent, \"[i]n the end, the increase depreciation allowance (a tax benefit) will equal the increased asset value (a tax liability)\"412.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 409.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Claimants have calculated the taxable income by deducting only the future depreciation expenses from the income. They agree with the Respondent that non-monetary assets and liabilities must also be re-evaluated, as provided for in Article 179 of the Income Tax Law, but add that this is also the case for equity under Article 184. According to the Claimants, in the past \"Mobil-CN's net equity balance exceeded its net non-monetary assets and liabilities balance, resulting in a net inflation readjustment that reduced Mobil-CN's taxable income\".413 The Claimants consider that this would be the situation in the future, and explain that, in order to avoid complex calculation which in any case would have been in their favor, they have limited their claim to the deduction of the future depreciation expenses414. The Respondent contests both the application of Article 184 and the result of this calculation.\n\nReply M. \u00b6235.\n\nHearing, Day 5, p. 164.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties have offered a rather simplified view of the readjustments to be made under Venezuela's Income Tax Law in case of inflation. The Claimants' expert, Mr. Graves, recognized at the hearing that \"[t]he tax return includes not just 179 and 184; it includes a whole of inflation adjustments\"415. The Respondent's expert, Econ One, specified that :\"[a] complete application of the 21 articles in the Income Tax Law and the 34 articles in the rules of the Income Tax Law dealing with inflation readjustments would require, among other things, evaluating which assets and liabilities are to be treated as monetary and nonmonetary, and considering whether and how the law requires readjustments for inflation on inventories (...) retained earnings and assets outside of Venezuela, among other issues\"416.\n\nHearing, Day 5, p.159:24-25\n\nEcon One Reply Report, fn. \u00b630.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, for the purposes of this calculation, it cannot take into account some of the provisions of Venezuelan tax law relating to the consequences of inflation on the taxable income and ignore other provisions. Accordingly, it cannot proceed to a readjustment of the depreciation expenses without considering the other legally required readjustments. The Tribunal notes that it has not been provided with the relevant information for this purpose. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it cannot uphold the Claimants' submissions on this point.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the income tax to be paid on oil and by-products amounts to US$ 19,542.3 million (see Annex 1, column 16). After payment of the tax, the balance amounts to US$ 19,542.3 million.\n\n359.\n\nIn order to obtain the net cash flow amount, the balance (US$ 19,542.3 million) must be reduced by deducting the CAPEX (US$ 1,779.9 million). As a consequence, the forecasted net cash flow of the Cerro Negro Project from 2007 to 2035 is US$ 17,762.4 million. It is not disputed that the Claimants own 41 2/3% of Cerro Negro. Accordingly, the net cash flow of the Cerro Negro Project from 2007 to 2035 corresponding to the Claimants amounts to US$ 7,399.8 million (see Annex 1, columns 17 and 18).\n\n**2. Discount Rate**\n--------------------\n\n360.\n\nHaving established the net cash flow amount, the Tribunal still has to determine how that cash flow should be discounted to its value in June 2007.\n\n361.\n\nProf. Myers submits that the appropriate discount rate for a project's cash flow is the cost of capital. The cost of capital is defined as the expected rate of return offered by other investments with the same risk as the project417, and it is determined by using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which depends upon three components: the ratio of return for risk free investments, the market risk premium that is generally expected by investors and a measure of a particular investment's contribution to the risk of a diversified portfolio, which is known as the beta value418. Professor Myers made the corresponding assessments and calculations, and arrived to the conclusion that the discount rate in June 2007 could be fixed at 8.7%.\n\nMyers Reply Expert Report, Appendix A, p. 1.\n\nMyers Expert Report, p. 22.\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the CAPM methodology is of little relevance in determining the value of an international oil project419 because it does not take into consideration the country risk. According to the Respondent, Prof. Myers has relied on a single, inappropriate method, whereas Respondent's experts have used four separate methods, ICAPM and country risk survey (\"market acquisition approach\"), and backward- and forward-looking data (\"make-whole approach\")420. These four methods resulted in discount rates \"within a relatively narrow range\", which the Respondent's experts averaged, yielding a discount rate of 19.8%421.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6304.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6321.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6\u00b6321, 344.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the country risk is largely composed of the risk of uncompensated expropriation, which cannot be taken into consideration in order to valuate such an expropriation. Similarly, the Claimants consider the \"make-whole approach\" to be incompatible with article 6 of the BIT and the principle of full reparation422. According to the Claimants, the methods used by the Respondent's expert indicate a wide range of discount rates that have been \"de-emphasized by the liberal use of averaging\"423.\n\nReply M. \u00b6247.\n\nReply M. \u00b6243.\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the basic divergence between the Parties concerns the question of what they refer to as the \"confiscation risk\"424, or more specifically, whether the risk of confiscation should be taken into account when calculating the discount rate applicable to the compensation due for an expropriation. The Claimants submit that under Article 6(c) of the BIT, \"a valuation of the expropriated property that complies with the Treaty cannot include the risk that the property might be expropriated later without the compensation required by the Treaty\"425. In their opinion, the discount rate can take into consideration country risks such as those resulting from a volatile economy or civil disorder, but not the confiscation risk. The Respondent does not share that interpretation of article 6(c) and contends that elements such as the risk of taxation, regulation and expropriation are essential to the country risk426 and must be taken into consideration in the determination of the discount rate.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b648.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b649.\n\nC-PH Reply \u00b6 46.\n\n365.\n\nArticle 6(c) of the BIT requires that the compensation due in case of expropriation represent \"the market value of the investments affected before the measures are taken or the impending measures became public knowledge, whichever is earlier\". This means that the compensation must correspond to the amount that a willing buyer would have been ready to pay to a willing seller in order to acquire his interests but for the expropriation, that is, at a time before the expropriation had occurred or before it had become public that it would occur. The Tribunal finds that, it is precisely at the time before an expropriation (or the public knowledge of an impending expropriation) that the risk of a potential expropriation would exist, and this hypothetical buyer would take it into account when determining the amount he would be willing to pay in that moment. The Tribunal considers that the confiscation risk remains part of the country risk and must be taken into account in the determination of the discount rate. Accordingly, the Tribunal is unable to adopt the approach used by the Claimants' expert, which does not take this risk into account.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Respondent's experts have used different methods to calculate the discount rate, which take into account the confiscation risk and a number of other relevant elements. On these bases they arrive to discount rates ranging from 18.5% to 23.9%.\n\n367.\n\nOther arbitral tribunals have adopted discount rates in circumstances comparable to the present case. In those cases, they have used rates ranging from 18.5% to 21%427. The Tribunal in the ICC Award applied a discount rate of 18%428.\n\n*Himpurna California Energy Ltd v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara* (Award, 4 May 1999), (Ex. R- 354) *; Patuha Power Ltd (Bermuda) v PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara* (Award, 4 May 1999), (Ex. R-473); *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18 (Ex. R-474); *Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, The National Iranian Oil Company,* Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal (CL-152).\n\nICC Award \u00b6\u00b6768, 777.\n\n368.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, that 18% discount rate appropriately reflects the existing risks in the present case. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to adopt it, and arrived to a discounted net cash flow of US$ 1,411.7 million (see Annex 1, column 19).\n\n**3. Price Cap**\n----------------\n\n369.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the price cap set forth in the Cerro Negro Association Agreement in implementation of the Twentieth Condition of the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization is applicable in this case. The Eighteenth Condition of the Association Agreement establishes that \"it shall not be considered that a Party has suffered an adverse and significant economic consequence as a result of any said decisions or changes in legislation, at any time when the Party is receiving income from THE ASSOCIATION equal to a price of crude oil above a maximum price that shall be specified in the Association Agreement\"429. According to the Respondent, that limitation was embodied in Clause 15(2)(a) of the Agreement, which establishes that, under certain conditions, \"compensation would not be granted for any fiscal year if the price of the benchmark crude oil (Brent) has exceeded US$ 27 per barrel in 1996 dollars\"430 (corresponding to US$ 25.07 in 2007 dollars). According to the Respondent, compensation must be limited in accordance with this price cap.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 289 and following Reply M. \u00b6 224 and following \u00b6\u00b6.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6298.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent was not a party to the Cerro Negro Association Agreement and that this case does not involve a claim under Clause 15431. Therefore, the price cap provided for in the Agreement is not applicable. The Respondent considers that the Claimants' argument does not address the issue, since \"[t]his is not a matter of enforcing a contract; it is a question of respecting the terms and conditions under which the Project was authorized (,..)\"432. According to the Respondent, any prospective buyer would have taken this price cap into consideration when evaluating Mobil Cerro Negro's interests.433\n\nReply M. \u00b6 66.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 314.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 297.\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Twentieth Condition of the Congressional Authorization refers to the income to be provided to the parties by the association, and to a price cap to be established in the association agreement. In the present case, Clause 15(1) of the Association Agreement provides for the consequences of Governmental actions, covering discriminatory measures taken by the Government that result in a materially adverse effect for the foreign party to the Agreement, and allowing that foreign party to initiate arbitration proceedings against Lagoven (a subsidiary of PDVSA) in order to obtain compensation for the economic consequences of those measures.\n\n372.\n\nIn accordance with the Twentieth Condition of the Congressional Authorization, Clause 15(2)(a) of the Agreement fixes a price cap for the compensation. Clause 15(1) establishes that: \"[t]o the extent any legal recourse is available to reverse or obtain relief from such Discriminatory Measure, the Foreign Party shall commence and pursue legal actions to mitigate any damages suffered as a result of the Discriminatory Measure \", and adds that any net benefit received as a result of these legal actions \"shall be (i) applied against any amount ultimately determined to be owed by Lagoven CN pursuant to this Article; or (ii) reimbursed to Lagoven CN if Lagoven CN previously has made payments to the Foreign Party with respect to the Discriminatory Measure in question\".\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Twentieth condition of the Congressional Authorization does not impose a specific price cap, but provides for a price cap to be established in the Association Agreement. In the present case, Clause 15(1) of the Association Agreement makes a clear distinction between the action that the Foreign Party may initiate against Lagoven CN on the one hand, and the action that it may initiate against the Government on the other. The price cap contained in Clause 15(2)(a) is applicable only to the compensation payable by Lagoven CN. Since the Respondent in this proceeding is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, not Lagoven CN, the Tribunal concludes that it may not oppose this price cap to the Claimants.\n\n374.\n\nAs a consequence, the compensation to be paid by the Respondent for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project remains in the amount of US$ 1,411.7 million (see para 368 above).\n\n**4. Offset Claim**\n-------------------\n\n375.\n\nIn its analysis of the compensation due to the Claimants, the Respondent has included an offset request in the amount of US$ 238,139,797. According to the Respondent, this figure representas the amount of debt relating to the Cerro Negro Project that was paid on behalf of the Claimants434.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 371, fn. 737.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has failed to explain why it is entitled to an offset for purported debts to PDVSA, which is not a party to these proceedings. In any case, the Claimants note that the Respondent has not brought or substantiated any counterclaim based on this alleged debt. The Claimants consider that this alleged obligation to PDVSA is irrelevant and outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal435.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 268-269.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this offset request has been enunciated and contested without any elaboration or substantiation. The Tribunal has not been provided with the grounds or with cogent evidence to decide this request, including convincing reasons why it should have or lack jurisdiction over a request involving a third party. Accordingly, to the extent that the Tribunal has jurisdiction, the offset request must be dismissed in any case.\n\n**5. Double Recovery**\n----------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe prohibition of double recovery for the same loss is a well-established principle, also referred to as *enrichessement sans cause*. The issue has arisen in a number of ICSID cases436, and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n*Pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Company v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13), (CL-176) \u00b6 219. See also *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23) \u00b6265; and *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1) \u00b6155.\n\n379.\n\nIn the parallel ICC case, the tribunal decided that the expropriation caused by Decree-Law 5200 constituted a discriminatory measure in the sense of the Association Agreement, and awarded Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd (Bahamas), one of the Claimants in this proceeding, compensation covering the damage suffered as a result of that measure. It is not contested that the compensation awarded by the ICC tribunal has been paid437. Although the dispute before the ICC Tribunal and the dispute before this Tribunal are different, the measure that gave rise to the dispute before the ICC Tribunal is also a measure at issue in this proceeding, and one of the Claimants in the present case has already been compensated for the loss incurred as a consequence of that measure. Therefore, there is a risk of double recovery in the present case for the Cerro Negro Project.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 8 24:19-23.\n\n380.\n\nClause 15(1) of the Association Agreement requires the \"Foreign Party\" to pursue legal action which is available to it in order to mitigate any damages it may have suffered as a result of the alleged discriminatory measures. In addition, Clause 15(1) establishes that any net benefits received by the \"Foreign Party\" as a result of such legal action, (and after deduction of the legal costs incurred by the \"Foreign Party\" in this connection) shall be reimbursed to Lagoven CN if Lagoven CN had previously made payment to the \"Foreign Party\" with respect to the discriminatory measures in question. The Claimants have expressly stated that \"in the event of an award in this case in favor of the Claimants, the Claimants are willing to make the required reimbursement to PDVSA\"438. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the Claimants' representation.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 9.\n\n381.\n\nEffectively, the total compensation payable to the Claimants is the amount specified in paragraph 374 above, less the amount already received by the Claimants under the ICC Award for the same damage. Double recovery will thus be avoided.\n\n**D. QUANTUM OF THE EXPROPRIATION OF THE LA CEIBA PROJECT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n382.\n\nIt is not disputed that, at the time of the expropriation, the La Ceiba Project was in a phase of development, which excludes the application of the DCF method in order to evaluate the market value of the Claimants' interests in accordance with Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, under the circumstances, the more appropriate form of reparation would be compensation measured by the Claimants' actual investment in the Project439. On that basis, they ask for US$ 179.3 million.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 350.\n\n384.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the Claimants had a 50% interest in the La Ceiba Project. The other 50% was the property of Petro Canada, which accepted the sum of US$ 75 million as compensation for the expropriation of its interests in the Project. According to the Respondent, that sum corresponds to the value of the Claimants' investment in June 2007.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the market value under Article 6 of the BIT must correspond to the sum that a willing buyer would have been ready to pay to a willing seller at the time of the expropriation, none of them being under pressure to buy or to sell. This was not the situation of Petro Canada when it accepted to sell its interests in the La Ceiba Project for US$ 75 million, one day before the expiry date established by Decree-Law 5200. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it cannot rely on the figure proposed by the Respondent, and that the market value of the Claimants' interests in the La Ceiba Project must be established at the total of their investment in that Project, *i.e.*, US$ 179.3 million.\n\n**IX. TAXES AND INTEREST**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. PROTECTION AGAINST TAXATION OF THE AWARD**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimants contend that compensation should be calculated and payable in an amount net of any taxes, domestic or foreign. Accordingly, they request that compensation be calculated on an after-tax basis and that the quantum of the compensation be increased to include the amount of any tax levied by the Respondent and the amount of any tax liability that may be incurred as a result of the Award and as a consequence of the Respondent's wrongful measures440. The Claimants consider that, \"at the very least\", the Tribunal should specify that the compensation established in the Award \"is net of taxes and shall be automatically grossed up to offset any Venezuelan tax liability that may be imposed or purportedly may arise from that compensation\"441.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 358.\n\nReply M. \u00b6 264.\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there should be no increase in the amount of the compensation to account for the hypothetical tax consequences of the Award, since this claim is speculative, contingent and uncertain442.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 374.\n\n388.\n\nRegarding foreign taxation, the Claimants contend that there is a risk that other jurisdictions will seek to impose taxes that would have been prevented in the absence of the expropriation. According to the Claimants, such taxation would constitute additional consequential damages443. The Tribunal considers that this claim is speculative and uncertain. Accordingly, the claim is dismissed.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 357.\n\n389.\n\nRegarding taxation by Venezuela, the Tribunal recalls that the compensation awarded to the Claimants has been calculated taking into account all taxes to be paid to the Venezuelan authorities. As a consequence, that compensation should be paid net of any Venezuelan tax444.\n\nSee *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award of 6 February 2007 (CL-112) \u00b6403.\n\n**B. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n390.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Article 6(c) of the BIT requires that pre-award interest be paid at a normal commercial rate. The Claimants consider that a normal commercial rate includes compounding of interest, and therefore claim compound pre- and postaward interest for both the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects.\n\n391.\n\nRegarding accrual of pre-award interest for the Cerro Negro Project, the Claimants consider that, (i) for the first tranche, between 29 May 2006 and 26 June 2007, preaward interest should accrue at the times when those damages occurred as a result of the extraction tax, curtailments of production and exports and severance payments445; (ii) for the second tranche, representing net cash flows that would have been received between 27 June 2007 and 30 September 2010 (as a placeholder for the date of the Award), pre-award interests must be calculated from the times when the lost net cash flows would have been received during that period446; and (iii) for the third tranche, measured by the fair market value of the lost interests in the Cerro Negro Project, pre-award interests should begin to accrue on the final valuation date which is used447.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 364.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 365 and Reply M. \u00b6 13.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 366.\n\n392.\n\nRegarding accrual of pre-award interest for the La Ceiba Project, the Claimants contend that pre-award compound interests should accrue from 27 June 2007, *i.e.*, the date of the expropriation.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimants contend that post-award compound interest should be paid on the quantum of compensation from the date of the Award until payment in full \"at the rate reflected by the yield for the Respondent's sovereign debt as of the date of the Award\"448. This rate could also be used for pre-award interest449. In the alternative, the Claimants refer to a prime lending rate, to be increased by an additional 3.1 percentage points \"to encompass the \u2018sovereign spread' that the market demands to account for the Respondent's risk of default\"450.\n\nMem. M. \u00b6 369.\n\nC-PH Brief \u00b6 82.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants should be granted no pre-award interest \"given their choice of pursuing worldwide litigation rather than negotiating reasonable compensation\"451. In the alternative, simple pre- and post- award interest should apply452. According to the Respondent, there is no reason to depart from international law, which does not require compound interest, and Venezuelan law, which does not provide for compound interest453. With respect to the interest rate, the Respondent contends that the LIBOR or US Treasury rate should be used.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 379.\n\nRej. M. \u00b6 427.\n\nC. Mem. M. \u00b6 382.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal will address first the applicable rate of interest, then turn to the question of the date from which interest should accrue and finally decide whether interest should be simple or compound.\n\n396.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT requires that the compensation to be paid in case of expropriation \"include interest at a normal commercial rate\". Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants' request to apply the rate reflected by the yield for the Respondent's sovereign debt. Considering the circumstances of the case, the parties involved and the fact that the compensation is to be awarded in United States dollars, the Tribunal considers that the current US prime rate of 3.25% is the appropriate rate for the whole period.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the practice of awarding pre-award interest is common in cases of expropriation and that, in order to ensure full compensation, such interest generally accrues from the date of the expropriation. In the present case, the Tribunal considers that the valuation date under Article 6 of the BIT should be the date of the expropriation. Accordingly, accrual of pre-award interest would start on 27 June 2007 and continue until the date of the Award. Post-award interest will accrue from the date of the Award and until compensation has been paid in full.\n\n398.\n\nThe production and export curtailments have also been found to breach the Treaty (see paragraph 264 above). Interest is payable in respect of this breach as well. The Tribunal notes that the last measure regarding this breach occurred in April 2007, less than three months prior to the starting date from which interest is payable for the expropriation of the Claimants' investments. For the sake of convenience, the Tribunal decides that the interest payable on account of the production and export curtailments shall also be calculated from 27 June 2007.\n\n399.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Venezuelan law provides for simple rather than compound interest. However, the compensation due to the Claimants has been determined under the BIT and not under Venezuelan law. Accordingly, the Tribunal must decide in accordance with Article 6 of the BIT, which provides for a \"normal commercial rate\". The Tribunal considers that a normal commercial rate generally includes compounding of interest, and notes that there is a growing tendency of international tribunals to award such interest in order to ensure full compensation of the damage. Therefore, the Tribunal decides that interest shall be compound and that, in the present case, compounding of interest shall be done annually. For any period less than a full year, interest shall be calculated on a prorated basis.\n\n400.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the interest due on the sum to be paid in implementation of paragraph 385 above (La Ceiba *quantum*) shall be calculated from the same date and in the in the same manner.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Claimants submit that \"the Tribunal should assess all costs against the Respondent, because it violated the Treaty, erroneously contended that this Tribunal lacked competence over *any* claims, and advocated amounts of *quantum* that utterly disregard the standard of compensation required by the Treaty\"454.\n\nC-PH Reply \u00b6 51.\n\n402.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that the costs of the proceeding should be assessed against the Claimants because of the abusive manner in which they have pursued compensation in national courts and presented exorbitant compensation claims in the present case, as well as their insistence on relitigating claims that are manifestly beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal455.\n\nR-PH Brief \u00b6 87.\n\n403.\n\nTaking into account the conduct of both Parties, the Tribunal decides that each of them shall bear its own costs and counsel fees, and that the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, as well as the costs of the ICSID Secretariat, shall be equally shared between them.\n\n**XI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, The Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(a) the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claim arising out of the increase in the income tax rate for the participants to the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(b) the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the remaining claims, *i.e.* :\n\na. the claim arising out of the imposition of the extraction tax on the Cerro Negro Project;\n\nb. the claim arising out of the production and export curtailments imposed on the Cerro Negro Project in 2006 and 2007; and\n\nc. the claim arising out of the expropriation of the Claimants' investments in the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba Projects;\n\n(c) the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants the sum of US$ 9,042,482 (nine million, forty two thousand, four hundred and eighty two United States dollars) in compensation for the production and export curtailments imposed on the Cerro Negro project in 2006 and 2007;\n\n(d) the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants the sum of US$ 1,411.7 million (one thousand, four hundred and eleven million, seven hundred thousand United States dollars) in compensation for the expropriation of their investments in the Cerro Negro Project;\n\n(e) the Tribunal takes note in both cases of the Claimants' representation that, in the event of favourable award, the Claimants are willing to make the required reimbursements to PDVSA. Double recovery will thus be avoided;\n\n(f) the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants the sum of US$ 179.3 million (one hundred seventy nine million, three hundred thousand United States dollars) in compensation for the expropriation of their investments in the La Ceiba Project;\n\n(g) these sums shall be paid to the Claimants net of any Venezuelan tax;\n\n(h) these sums shall be increased by annual compound interest on their amount at the rate of 3.25% from 27 June 2007 up to the date when payment of this sums has been made in full;\n\n(i) each Party shall bear its own costs and counsel fees;\n\n(j) the Parties shall equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat; and\n\n(k) all other claims are rejected.\n\nANNEX 1\n-------\n\n|  |  |

The first session was held on 10 December 2014 by conference call.\n\n1.6.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, the Secretary circulated Procedural Order No. 1, containing the Parties\u2019 procedural agreements and the Tribunal\u2019s decisions.\n\n1.7.\n\nOn 19 January 2015, The Applicant submitted its (i) Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request to Lift the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award and (ii) Memorial in Further Support of its Application for Revision of the Award.\n\n1.8.\n\nOn 27 February 2015, the Respondents submitted their Counter-Memorial in Opposition to the Application for Revision of the Award.\n\n1.9.\n\nOn 11 March 2015, the Secretary circulated the Tribunal\u2019s invitation for the Parties\u2019 submissions regarding the existence of a time requirement contained in Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties submitted their respective positions on 19 March 2015.\n\n1.10.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Parties, on 6 April 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that a hearing would not be necessary, in accordance with Section 12 of Procedural Order No. 1. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit statements of costs. The Parties submitted their respective statements of costs on 13 April 2015.\n\n1.11.\n\nThe proceeding was declared closed on 11 May 2015, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**2. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------\n\n**2.1 Application for Revision**\n--------------------------------\n\n2.1.1.\n\nThe Applicant claims that the Respondents\u2019 actions after the Award was rendered show that they had no intention of honoring representations made before the Award was rendered.1 Had these facts been known, they would have decisively affected the relief granted in the Award.2\n\nApplication, paras. 4-5.\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\n2.1.2.\n\nIn particular, before the Award was rendered, the Respondents stated that, in order to avoid double recovery in the event of an Award in their favor, they were willing to reimburse Petr\u00f4leos de Venezuela, S.A. (\"PDVSA\") in accordance with Clause 15(1) of the Cerro Negro Association Agreement (\"CNAA\") for the compensation already received in the ICC arbitration. The Tribunal relied on this representation in its decision regarding double recovery.3\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\n2.1.3.\n\nHowever, after the Award was rendered, the Respondents sought and obtained in a U.S. federal court an *ex parte* Order and Judgment in the full amount of the Award without mentioning the double recovery issue, and have not acknowledged that recovery should be reduced by the full amount already paid in satisfaction of the parallel ICC arbitration. As these facts occurred after the Award was rendered, they were not known or capable of being discovered by the Tribunal or Venezuela at the time when the Award was rendered. Had they been known, they would have decisively affected the relief granted, including the method to effectuate and calculate the reduction to avoid double recovery.4\n\nApplication, para. 12.\n\n2.1.4.\n\nAccordingly, the Applicant requests the following revisions to paragraph 404 of the Award:\n\n*Paragraph 404(e) of the Award should be revised to add the following sentence as the second sentence of the subparagraph: \"The required reimbursements to PDVSA will be made simultaneously with the satisfaction of this Award. and*\n\n*Paragraph 404(h) of the Award should be revised to add the following sentence at the end of the subparagraph: \"The reimbursement contemplated by subparagraph (e) above shall be with interest at the same rate of interest specified in this subparagraph (h) or, in the alternative, the portion of the Award equal to the amount of the reimbursement referred to in subparagraph (e) above shall not bear interest from the date such amount was paid to Mobil Cerro Negro.\"5*\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n2.1.5.\n\nThe Applicant further requests that the stay of enforcement of the Award be maintained until the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application for Revision and that the Respondents be ordered to pay the full costs of these proceedings, including attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.6\n\nApplication, para. 14.\n\n**2.2 Preliminary Response to the Application for Revision**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.2.1.\n\nIn their Preliminary Response to the Application for Revision, the Respondents qualify the Application as an abuse of the revision procedure aimed to delay compliance with the Award.7 The Respondents contend that the Application should be dismissed for any of the following reasons.\n\nPreliminary Response, p. 1.\n\n2.2.2.\n\nFirst, the Application does not meet the admissibility requirements of Article 50(1)(c)(ii) of the ICSID Convention as it does not identify any new facts. The Respondents\u2019 interpretation of Clause 15.1(a) of the CNAA is the same now as it was before the Award was rendered, and the Respondents remain fully prepared to reimburse the relevant amount in accordance with the CNAA.8\n\nPreliminary Response, pp. 1-2.\n\n2.2.3.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, as it would require interpreting a provision of the CNAA, which contains its own dispute settlement mechanism and to which the Applicant is neither a party nor a beneficiary.9\n\nPreliminary Response, pp. 2-3.\n\n2.2.4.\n\nThird, the Application is based on a false premise because the Award does not require Mobil Cerro Negro (\"MCN\") to repay Petr\u00f4leos de Venezuela, S.A. Cerro Negro (\"PDVSA-CN\") the full amount paid in satisfaction of the Award in the ICC arbitration. To the contrary, reimbursement is only required for the payments made after deducting legal costs and to the extent that both payments relate to the same measures. In addition, the CNAA does not require that reimbursement be made with interest, and any dispute over this issue is beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.10\n\nPreliminary Response, pp. 3-5.\n\n2.2.5.\n\nBased on the above, the Respondents conclude that the Application is of a \"frivolous nature\" and constitutes \"nothing more than a dilatory tactic\" that should be overruled forthwith.11\n\nPreliminary Response, p. 5\n\n**2.3 Request to lift the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.3.1.\n\nThe Respondents request that the stay of enforcement provisionally granted by the Secretary-General with the registration of the Application be entirely or partially lifted.\n\n2.3.2.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the circumstances of the present case do not require that enforcement be stayed since the Application has no factual or legal basis and, even if granted, it would affect less than twelve percent of the Applicants compensation obligations under the Award.12\n\nRequest to Lift the Provisional Stay, p. 1.\n\n2.3.3.\n\nThe Respondent refers to instances where annulment committees have denied stays of enforcement when the application had a dilatory purpose or the State did not give reasonable assurances that it would comply with the award. The Respondents contend that the rationale for these decisions applies all the more to a revision proceeding, where the merits of the decision are not contested.13\n\nRequest to Lift the Provisional Stay, pp. 1-3.\n\n2.3.4.\n\nShould the Tribunal decide to continue the stay, the Respondents request that the Tribunal maintain the stay subject to the conditions that (i) it extends only to the portion of the Award affected and that it be subject to (ii) payment of the undisputed balance of the Award and (iii) posting an irrevocable guarantee or bond as security for the remainder of the Award.14\n\nRequest to Lift the Provisional Stay, pp. 3-5.\n\n**2.4 Memorial in Support of the Application for Revision and in Response to the Request to lift the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.4.1.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Applicant addresses the Respondents\u2019 arguments. As to admissibility of the Application, the Applicant identifies:\n\na) The \"new facts upon which the Application for Revision is based\". Namely, the Mobil Parties (i) having made clear after the Award that they have no intention of honoring representations made before the Award regarding double recovery; and (ii) proceeding immediately after the rendering of the Award, *ex parte* and without consulting the Applicant to attempt to enforce the full amount of compensation without mentioning any reduction necessary to avoid double recovery.15\n\nb) Two ways in which these facts affect the Award. Namely, by (i) making it impossible to calculate the amount due under the Award and (ii) violating the terms on which the Award was made.16\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 9.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 11.\n\n2.4.2.\n\nAs to the jurisdictional argument, the Applicant recognizes \"certain jurisdictional issues\", but considers that that the Tribunal has the power to take the necessary steps to ensure there is no double recovery.17 The Applicant argues that, irrespectively of how the amounts are calculated under the CNAA, both the ICC Tribunal and the ICSID Tribunal awarded compensation for the same act, namely the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project. In this sense, the Applicant\u2019s request is limited to the Tribunal giving effect to its directive to avoid double recovery by requiring that the credit for the compensation already paid be made simultaneously with the payment of the Award.18 Regarding interest, the Applicant does not consider that there is a jurisdictional issue. According to the Applicant, when the Tribunal awarded interest it could not have intended for such interest to run on the full compensation awarded irrespective of interest on the amount thereof that had already been paid.19\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 12.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 13-15.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 16.\n\n2.4.3.\n\nThe Applicant finally rejects the accusation of dilatory tactics.20\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 17.\n\n2.4.4.\n\nRegarding the request to lift the stay of enforcement, the Applicant states the following:\n\na) The stay should be maintained because it is necessary to prevent abusive litigation tactics during the pendency of the revision proceeding. The Applicant further argues that the characterization of the Application as a ploy to delay payment cannot be reconciled with the willingness to proceed with briefing on an accelerated scheduled. Moreover, it is not unusual for ICSID tribunals to maintain stays of enforcement for extended periods of time, and in this particular case with an expedited briefing schedule there is no reason to prematurely lift the stay when the entire revision proceeding has almost been completely briefed.21\n\nb) The stay should not be subject to the provision of a bank guarantee since there is no general consensus that ICSID tribunals have the power to require security as a condition of exercising the right under the ICSID Convention to seek revision of an award. Moreover, requiring security would place the Mobil Parties in a better position than they enjoyed before the Application.22\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 19-22.\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 23-24.\n\n2.4.5.\n\nAccordingly, the Applicant request that the Application be admitted, that paragraph 404 of the Award be revised as specified in paragraph 2.1.4 above, that the stay of enforcement be maintained until a decision on the Application is rendered, that the alternative request for the stay to be partially lifted and conditioned on the provision of a bank guarantee be rejected and that the Mobil Parties be ordered to pay the full costs of these proceedings, including attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.23\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial, para. 26.\n\n**2.5 Counter-Memorial in Opposition to the Application for Revision**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.5.1.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial, the Respondents argue that the Application:\n\na) Fails to identify a fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the Award or to provide evidence that this fact was unknown to the Tribunal and Applicant at the time the Award was rendered. The only alleged new fact is the Respondents\u2019 attempt to recognize the Award, which as a threshold matter cannot possibly constitute a new fact in the sense of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention.24\n\nb) Would require the Tribunal to decide matters outside its jurisdiction. First, the Applicant\u2019s request that paragraph 404(e) of the Award be revised to require that the reimbursements to PDVSA be made simultaneously with the satisfaction of the Award would require the Tribunal to rule on matters (a) affecting PDVSA and MCN, which are not parties to the ICSID proceedings; and (b) concerning the CNAA, over which this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.25 Second, the Applicant\u2019s request that paragraph 404(h) of the Award be revised to include interest on the reimbursement would require a determination by the Tribunal of whether the CNAA requires reimbursement to include interest, a matter falling outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.26\n\nc) Is premised on false contentions and mischaracterizations of the relevant facts. Generally, the Respondents contend that the Application is rooted in the premise that the Award requires the Mobil Parties to reduce, credit or offset the entirety of the amounts obtained under the ICC award from the amounts due under the ICSID Award, which is false. What the Award orders is payment of the entire amount to the Mobil Parties while recording MCN\u2019s obligation to reimburse PDVSA under the CNAA upon receipt of these funds.27 The Respondents further deny the allegation that they have no intention of honoring their assurances that MCN will make the reimbursement required by the CNAA to prevent double recovery.28 Finally, the Respondents contend that the Applicant has mischaracterized the ICC award in arguing that it provided a remedy solely for the expropriation through Decree Law 5200. In fact, the Respondents contend that the contractual indemnity determined by the ICC Tribunal was calculated to include compensation for every Discriminatory Measure, including the Income Tax Measure. Since the ICSID Tribunal found that it could not provide a remedy for the Income Tax Measure, reimbursement under Article 15 of the CNAA may not apply to the entire amount of compensation awarded by the ICC Tribunal.29 Accordingly, offsetting Venezuela\u2019s payment under the ICSID Award by the full amount of the ICC award would create a windfall for the Applicant30 and ignore the requirement under the CNAA that reimbursement be reduced by the costs incurred to obtain relief from Venezuela.31\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, para. 8.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, paras. 16-18.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, paras. 9-10.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, paras. 24-25.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, paras. 28-34.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, para. 35.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter-Memorial, para. 37.\n\n2.5.2.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondents request that the Tribunal deny the Application and award the Mobil Parties all associated costs.\n\n**2.6 Applicant\u2019s Response to the Tribunal\u2019s Question**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.6.1.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s question, the Applicant\u2019s position32 is that Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention does not require that the discovered fact predate the Award. However, even if this were a requirement, the Application would still be admissible as it involves facts both before and after the Award was rendered, the latter being a manifestation and revelation of the former.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 Mach 2015.\n\n2.6.2.\n\nIn support of its argument that there is no time requirement under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Applicant states that (i) the provision itself does not expressly require that the fact predate the award;33 (ii) there is nothing in the *travaux* that would lead to the conclusion that a time requirement exists;34 (iii) Prof. Schreuer acknowledges the possibility that facts subsequent to an award may give rise to an application for revision;35 (iv) when interpreting a similar provision, the European Court of Justice acknowledged that the relevant new fact may have arisen after the judgment;36 and (v) the only ICJ decision on the issue involved a fact emerging years after the judgment that could not have had any impact on it.37\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 2.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 2.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 4.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 3.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 5-6.\n\n**2.7 Respondents\u2019 Response to the Tribunal\u2019s Question**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.7.1.\n\nThe Respondents argue that the newly discovered fact referred to by Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention must predate the rendering of the award. The Respondents reach this conclusion by analysing the language of the article and the practice of the ICJ.\n\n2.7.2.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the remaining requirements of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention reflect an understanding that the fact existed prior to the rendering of the award. In particular, (i) a fact that did not exist before the award could never have been known by the Tribunal, (ii) its ignorance could never have been due to negligence; and (iii) such inexistent fact could not have been capable of decisively affecting the award.38\n\nRespondents\u2019 letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 2-3.\n\n2.7.3.\n\nThe Respondents further rely on the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of Article 61 of the Statute of the CJJ, on which Article 51(1) is based.39\n\nRespondents\u2019 letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 6-15.\n\n2.7.4.\n\nFinally, the Respondents acknowledge the potential exception referred to by Professor Schreuer relating to costs but consider that it is not applicable to the present case, since the Application is not based on a new fact that relates to costs.40\n\nRespondents\u2019 letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 16-18.\n\n**3. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n3.1.1.\n\nArticle 51 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) Each Party may request revision of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of the fact was not due to negligence.\n\n(2) The application shall be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.\"\n\n3.1.2.\n\nThe text of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in the context and in the light of its object and purpose\", in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.41\n\nVienna Convention on the law of treaties, concluded at Vienna on 23 May 1969.\n\n3.1.3.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, an application for revision must satisfy the following conditions:\n\na) the application should be based upon the \"discovery\" of a \"fact\";\n\nb) the fact, the discovery of which is relied on, must be \"of such a nature as decisively to affect the award\";\n\nc) the fact should have been \"unknown\" to the Tribunal and to the applicant \"when the award was rendered\";\n\nd) the applicant\u2019s ignorance of the fact must not be due to \"negligence\"; and\n\ne) the application for revision must be made within 90 days after the discovery of the fact and in any event within three years after the date on which the award was rendered.\n\n3.1.4.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these constitute cumulative requirements and that, if any among them is not met, the application must be dismissed.\n\n3.1.5.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal\u2019s request that the Parties provide their comments on whether it was also a condition under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention that the discovered fact predate the Award, the Respondents contended that \"the newly discovered fact must be a fact that predates the rendering of the Award.\"42\n\nRespondents\u2019 letter of 19 Mach 2015, p. 1.\n\n3.1.6.\n\nIn response to the same question, the Applicant stated that the discovered fact \"may have been pre-existing or may have arisen subsequent to the award\". However, the Applicant added, \"the reality in this case is that the steps taken by the Mobil Parties immediately after the rendering of the Award are inextricably linked to the intentions and strategy formulated by the Mobil Parties prior to the Award when they made their representations to the Tribunal, which intentions and strategy were unknown to either the Tribunal or the Applicant until they were revealed after the rendering of the Award, when the Mobil Parties sought to enforce the full amount of the Award without recognition of the compensation already paid in 2012 or even any interest thereon.\"43 The Applicant concluded that this case involves \"facts both before and after the award was rendered, the latter being a manifestation and revelation of the former.\"44\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 Mach 2015, para. 1.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 Mach 2015, para. 7.\n\n3.1.7.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Venezuela\u2019s position is that there is no requirement under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention that the discovered fact predate the Award. However, this requirement, even if it existed, would be irrelevant in the present case because the postaward facts are not relied on independently but in connection with pre-award facts. Specifically, the Applicant argues an inextricable link between the two, where the subsequent facts constitute a revelation of the prior facts. In other words, the subsequent facts are presented as evidence of the prior facts.\n\n***Whether the discovered fact has to predate the award under Article 51(1) of the ICSID****Convention***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1.8.\n\nIn support of its position that post-award facts are covered by Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Applicant contends that (i) the provision itself does not expressly require that the fact predate the award;45 (ii) there is nothing in the *travaux* that would lead to the conclusion that a time requirement exists;46 (iii) Prof. Schreuer acknowledges the possibility that facts subsequent to an award may give rise to an application for revision;47 (iv) when interpreting a similar provision, the European Court of Justice acknowledged that the relevant new fact may have arisen after the judgment;48 and (v) the only ICJ decision on the issue involved a fact emerging years after the judgment that could not have had any impact on it49\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 2.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 2.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 4.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 3.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 5-6.\n\n3.1.9.\n\nWhile it is true that Article 51(1) does not expressly require that the discovered fact predate the Award, both the textual implications of the provision as well as its object and purpose confirm that the discovered fact needs to have existed before the Award was rendered.\n\n3.1.10.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, an application for revision of an award requires that (i) the fact \"was unknown\" and that (ii) ignorance of the fact \"must not be due to negligence\". These requirements must be met \"when the award was rendered\".\n\n3.1.11.\n\nThus, Article 51 presupposes that the relevant fact *could have been known when the award was rendered* and that, had it not been known, said ignorance *could have been due to negligence when the award was rendered.* Only a fact that existed when the award was rendered could have been known when the award was rendered. Only ignorance of a fact that existed when the award was rendered could be due to negligence. It follows that only a fact that existed when the award was rendered may form the basis for a request for revision under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.1.12.\n\nThat interpretation not only corresponds to the terms of Article 51(1), but also to its object and purpose. The concept of revision adversely affects the principle of *res judicata* and is therefore capable of impairing the stability of legal relations.50 It is not accepted in all arbitral rules51 and, when accepted, it must remain exceptional.\n\nSh. Rosenne, *The Law and Practice of the International Court,* Vol. III, 167 1.\n\nChristoph Schreuer et at, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. 2009), p. 879.\n\n3.1.13.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges Prof. Schreuer\u2019s opinion that \"[e]exceptionally, a new fact may arise after the award has been completed that may be an appropriate basis for revision. For instance, payments made to ICSID towards the costs of proceedings after the awards\u2019 completion or legal fees that are billed after the award\u2019s signature will not be reflected in the award\u2019s determination on costs.\"52 However, the Tribunal notes that Article 51 of the ICSID Convention does not contemplate exceptions. In any event, the exception referred to by Prof. Schreuer would not be applicable in the present case.\n\nChristoph Schreuer et at, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. 2009), pp. 879-880.\n\n3.1.14.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that there are few cases dealing with revision, including non-ICSID cases, and that both Parties have relied on judgments of international courts in furtherance of their arguments. According to the Applicant, the ECJ has acknowledged that facts occurring after the issuance of a judgment may constitute grounds for an application for revision,53 whereas the ICJ\u2019s contrary position does not apply to the present case as it is distinguishable on the facts.54 To the contrary, the Respondents rely on the ICJ\u2019s reasoning because Article 51 of the ICSID Convention was modeled after Article 61 of the ICJ Statue,55 and because there is no substantive difference between the texts of these articles that could justify a different interpretation.56\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 3.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 5-6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, para. 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 19 March 2015, paras. 11-15.\n\n3.1.15.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that the ECJ acknowledged in *Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ferrandi v. Commission of the European Communities57* that facts occurring after the issuance of a judgment may constitute grounds for an application for revision. In fact, the ECJ does not address this issue. The application in that case was deemed inadmissible on the grounds that it was untimely filed. Conversely, the European Court of Justice addressed this issue in *Riseria Modenese Srl v Council and Commission of the European Communities and Birra Peroni SpA,* where it decided that the admissibility of an application for revision is conditional on the existence of a fact \"antedating the delivery of the judgment\".58\n\n*Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ferrandi v. Commission of the European Communities,* Case C-403/85 Rev., ECR1991 1-01215, para. 12.\n\n*Riseria Modenese Srl v Council and Commission of the European Communities and Birra Peroni SpA.,* Case 267/80 r\u00e9v., ECR 1985 -03499.\n\n3.1.16.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Applicant\u2019s assessment of the ICJ\u2019s judgment in *Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia59* when interpreting Article 61 of the ICJ Statute. In 2003, the Court had to examine a request presented by Yugoslavia to revise a judgment rendered in 1996. Yugoslavia was *inter alia* founding its request on a fact which occurred in 2000. The Court decided that it could not be regarded as \"a new fact within the meaning of Article 61 capable of founding a request for revision of that Judgment\".60\n\n*Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

A fact which occurs several years after a judgment has been given is not a \u2018new\u2019 fact within the meaning of Article 61. This remains the case irrespective of the legal consequences that such a fact may have.\"62 The Court went on to analyze the legal consequences of the alleged new facts and concluded that they did not have the effects sought by the applicant and, even if they did, they did not constitute facts in the sense of Article 61.63\n\nChristoph Schreuer et at, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. 2009), p. 879.\n\n*Application for Revision of the Judgment of 11 July 1996 in the Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v.

REPORTS 2003, para. 69.\n\n3.1.18.\n\nThe same solution has been retained by a number of arbitral tribunals in comparable circumstances. Thus, the Franco-Bulgarian Mixed Arbitral Tribunal held in 1929 that \"the use of the word \u2018discovery\u2019 implies unquestionably the existence of the fact, which was unknown to the Tribunal, at the time when it gave the decision.\"64\n\n*Battus case,* Franco-Bulgarian Mixed Arbitral Tribunal, RDTAM, vol IX, p. 284-286. Cf. also decisions of the Franco-German mixed Arbitral Tribunal, *Creange case,* RDTAM 1924, vol V, p.114-116; *Guillaume Krichel case* RDTAM,1928, Vol. VIII, p. 764; *Otzenberger case,* RDTAM 1929, vol IX, p.272.\n\n3.1.19.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that all international courts and tribunals which had the opportunity to consider the matter arrived at the conclusion reached by this Tribunal in paragraphs 3.1.10 to 3.1.11 above. Under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, an application for revision requires that the fact motivating it existed when the award was rendered. Facts arising after the award was rendered are not capable of funding an application for revision under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, an application that relies on post-award facts is not admissible.\n\n***Whether the Application relies on facts that predate the Award***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.1.20.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Venezuela\u2019s position has shifted from being based on postaward facts to being based on pre- *and* post-award facts, where the facts arising after the award was rendered serve as evidence of the facts arising before the award was rendered.\n\n3.1.21.\n\nThe alleged facts predating the Award are identified as \"intentions and strategy\". The Tribunal considers that \"intentions and strategy\" may or may not materialize into facts. Intentions and strategy characterise a state of mind and do not constitute events that may be considered facts in the sense of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, even if the Tribunal were minded to find that an application for revision under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention may be based on the discovery of post-award facts relied on as evidence of preaward facts, the Application would still be dismissed for want of pre-award facts.\n\n3.1.22.\n\nMoreover, even if intentions and strategy were considered facts, the Applicant has not provided evidence of the Mobil Parties\u2019 intentions and strategy at the time the contested representations were made to the Tribunal in the original proceeding.\n\n3.1.23.\n\nSince the only facts relied on in the Application arose after the Award had been rendered and have no connection to pre-award facts in the sense of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal finds that the Application is not admissible. As a consequence, the Tribunal dismisses the Application in its entirety.\n\n**3.2 Stay of Enforcement**\n---------------------------\n\n3.2.1.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states as follows:\n\n\"(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\"\n\n3.2.2.\n\nIn the present case, a provisional stay was granted by the Secretary-General upon registration of the Application, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2). Subsequently, the Tribunal decided to continue the stay in Section 15 of Procedural Order No. 1, in accordance with the last sentence of the same provision of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n3.2.3.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay is automatically terminated on the date of rendering of this Decision.\n\n**4. COSTS**\n------------\n\n4.1.1.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention states as follows:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n4.1.2.\n\nThe Parties agreed the following in Section 3(2) of Procedural Order No. 1 :\n\n\"The Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the costs set forth in Convention Article 61(2), and its decision pursuant to that Article as to how and by whom those costs should be paid, may be set forth at the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in the Decision or in one or more separate Orders preceding or subsequent to the Decision. Each Party may present, in addition to the information required by Arbitration Rule 28(2), its position as to how and by whom costs should be paid and arguments supporting that position. Without prejudice to the foregoing, absent any contrary decision by the Tribunal, all costs shall be borne by both Parties in equal shares.\"\n\n4.1.3.\n\nBoth Parties have requested that the Tribunal award them all costs related to the proceedings.\n\n4.1.4.\n\nIn their submission on costs, the Respondents contended that they should be awarded all of their costs in accordance with the prevailing practice in international arbitration, which consist in apportioning costs on the basis that costs must follow the event. In addition, awarding costs to the Mobil Parties would be particularly appropriate in this case, where the Application is alleged to be manifestly inadmissible and unmeritorious and filed for the sole purpose of delaying enforcement. While the Applicant also requested that costs be awarded to Venezuela, it did not elaborate on why the apportionment of costs should be made in that manner.\n\n4.1.5.\n\nVenezuela has filed an application for annulment of the Award, in addition to the Application that triggered the current revision proceedings. The Tribunal notes that parallel post-award proceedings relating to the same award are permitted under the ICSID Convention. In fact, concurrent or overlapping applications may constitute the only procedural avenue for a party seeking the alternative application of these remedies as a consequence of the time limits envisaged in the Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot conclude on this ground that the Application was filed for the sole purpose of delaying enforcement.\n\n4.1.6.\n\nOn the other hand, the Application has been dismissed as inadmissible on the grounds that it is not based on pre-award facts. Every international court and tribunal considering this issue in the context of a revision proceeding has decided that the discovered fact must predate the award. However, the Application was originally based on post-award facts only. Moreover, Venezuela has consistently relied on the post-award nature of the alleged facts to substantiate another requirement of Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, namely that the discovered fact be unknown when the award was rendered. In this sense, Venezuela argued that facts arising after the Award was rendered \"could only become known after the Award\". It was only when the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their positions on the timeliness of the discovered facts that the Applicant shifted to a position according to which the post-award facts constituted mere evidence of pre-award facts.\n\n4.1.7.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the change in the Applicant\u2019s position is the result of the speedy preparation of the Application following the Mobil Parties\u2019 attempt to enforce the Award one day after it had been rendered. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the purpose of the Application was not to request the revision of the Award on the basis of a genuine concern that an unknown decisive fact had been left out, but rather to hinder the Respondents\u2019 swift attempt at enforcement.\n\n4.1.8.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 legal fees and expenses amount to USD 93,463 and GBP 32,561.16.\n\n4.1.9.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s legal fees amount to USD 157,999.25.\n\n4.1.10.\n\nIn the exercise of the discretion granted to the Tribunal by Article 61(1) of the ICSID Convention as well as Section 3(2) of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to award (i) *all* of the costs of the proceedings, including ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses and the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses,65 as well as (ii) *all* of their legal fees and expenses to the Mobil Parties. In making this decision, the Tribunal has taken into account the circumstances described in paragraphs 4.1.6 to 4.1.7 above. Accordingly, the Applicant shall pay the Mobil Parties the following amounts:\n\na) USD USD93,463 and GBP32,561.16 as legal fees and expenses; and\n\nb) all of the costs of the proceedings, once they have been definitely established by ICSID and no later than 30 days after ICSID has notified the Final Financial Statement to the Parties.\n\nThe costs of the proceedings, which include the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, are paid out of the deposit on costs made by the Parties. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with an *Interim* Financial Statement of the case account as of the date of this Decision. A detailed *Final* Financial Statement of the case account will be provided as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final. The remaining balance in the account will be reimbursed by ICSID to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**5. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n5.1.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, in accordance with Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, the Arbitral Tribunal makes the following Decision, which shall become part of its Award dated 9 October 2014:\n\n(i) The Application for Revision is dismissed as inadmissible;\n\n(ii) The stay of enforcement is hereby automatically terminated; and\n\n(iii) The Applicant shall bear all costs related to the proceeding, including the administrative fees and expenses of the Centre, the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the costs and legal fees of the Mobil Parties, as described in paragraph 4.1.10 above."}, {"Title": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2015-09-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 July 2015, the Committee ordered as follows:-\n\n*a. The enforcement of the Award of the Tribunal dated 9October 2014 (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) is stayed pending the Committee's decision on Venezuela's application of 2 February 2015 for its annulment.*\n\n*b. The continued effect of Paragraph a. above is conditional on the receipt, within 30 days of the date of this Order, of an official undertaking in writing, by a Minister or other senior officer empowered to commit the Government of Venezuela, that, if the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, Venezuela will promptly comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled. The written undertaking will be addressed to the Committee and copied to each of the Mobil Parties.*\n\n*c. If no undertaking satisfying the terms of Paragraph b. above has been received at the end of the time limit specified in that paragraph, the stay will automatically be lifted 15 days later, but only if there has by then been received an official undertaking or undertakings in writing, by a senior officer or officers empowered to commit each of the Mobil Parties, that no attempt will be made to enforce any part of the Award in a manner that does not take full account of the requirement set forth in the above-cited paragraphs of the Award to avoid double recovery. In the absence of an undertaking or undertakings to that effect, the stay will continue in effect until such time as the requisite undertaking or undertakings have been received. The written undertaking or undertakings will be addressed to the Committee and copied to each of the other Parties to the present annulment proceedings.*\n\n*d. It is open to any Party to apply at any time for a modification or termination of the above in accordance with the provisions of Arbitration Rule 54.*\n\n*e. Any Party may apply to the Committee, if the need arises, to certify whether the conditions laid down in Paragraphs b. or c. above have been duly complied with.*\n\n2.\n\nOn 18 August 2015, within the period laid down in sub-paragraph b. above, the Committee received a letter from the Viceprocurador General de la Rep\u00fcblica of Venezuela, which, in relevant part, read as follows (in translation):-\n\n*The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has always recognized the principle of compensation in case of nationalization, and has acted accordingly. We are convinced that our Application for Annulment of the Award dated 9 October 2014 in the previously referenced case has solid legal grounds. However, this communication is for the purposes of confirming that, should the Application for Annulment not be successful, in whole or in part, the Republic, in accordance with the terms of the ICSID Convention, will recognize the binding character of the part of the Arbitral Tribunal's award in the proceeding that is not annulled and will recognize and enforce, within its territory, the pecuniary obligations imposed by it.*\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 August 2015, the Committee received a letter from the Mobil Parties denying that the Venezuelan letter met the requirements of sub-paragraph b.; and indicating that the stay ordered by the Committee should be lifted unless Venezuela provided a more ample undertaking by the end of the period specified in sub-paragraph c. or alternatively provided a bank guarantee covering a specified portion of the Award.\n\n4.\n\nOn 24 August 2015, the Secretary to the Committee informed the Parties by e-mail as follows:-\n\n*\"The Committee acknowledges receipt of the letters of 18 August 2015 from the Viceprocurador de la Rep\u00fcblica Bolivariana de Venezuela and 20 August 2015 from the Mobil Parties in connection with Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 July 2015. The Committee draws the attention of the Parties to paragraph 10 of that Order, and in particular to the terms of sub-paragraphs b., d. and e. In sub-paragraphs 10.d. and 10.e. the Committee has laid down the procedure to be followed in certain specified circumstances.*\n\n*The Committee now invites Venezuela to confirm in writing, at Ministerial level, not later than 31 August 2015, that the above letter from the Viceprocurador de la Rep\u00fcblica does constitute a formal and binding undertaking on the part of the Government of Venezuela, in the words of sub-paragraph 10.b., \"that, if the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, Venezuela will promptly comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled\".*\n\n*The Mobil Parties are at liberty thereafter, if they consider it necessary, to avail themselves of the procedure specified in sub-paragraph 10.e.*\n\n*The time limits specified in paragraph 10 are for the time being suspended.\"*\n\n5.\n\nOn 27 August 2015, the Committee received a letter from the Minister of Petroleum and Minerals of Venezuela, which, in relevant part, reads as follows (in translation):-\n\n*In reference to the Annulment Committee's communication dated August 24, 2015 this letter is to confirm that the letter sent by the Deputy Attorney General of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela..., to this Committee on August 18, 2015, constitutes a formal and binding commitment on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. In the event that the Annulment Application of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is unsuccessful, in whole or in part, the Republic will promptly comply with any or all parts of the Award dated October 9, 2014 that have not been annulled.*\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 1 September 2015, the Mobil Parties applied to the Committee under the terms of sub-paragraph 10 e. of Procedural Order No. 2 to \"confirm that Venezuela has not complied with paragraph 10(b) of PO 2\" and to \"order that the stay will be lifted immediately upon provision by the Mobil Parties of the undertaking referred to in paragraph 10(c) of PO 2.\" In support of this application, the Mobil Parties invoked defects in: the authority of the Minister of Petroleum and Minerals or the Deputy Attorney General to bind the Government; the reach and scope of the Minister's undertaking; the time element in the Minister's undertaking.\n\n7.\n\nOn 2 September 2015, the Committee invited the Applicant to respond to the Mobil Parties' application by 16 September 2015 while indicating that the time limits under paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 2 remained suspended.\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 September 2015, counsel for Venezuela wrote to the Committee submitting that the statement from the Minister complies with the Committee's communication set out in paragraph 5 above.\n\n9.\n\nThe Committee is thus in a position to proceed to a decision on the Mobil Parties' application described in paragraph 6 above.\n\n10.\n\nSub-paragraph e. of Procedural Order No. 2 was deliberately inserted by the Committee, in the light of the complex nature of the conditional stay order contained in sub-paragraphs a., b., and c., taken together, in case questions might arise as to compliance with the conditions laid down in those sub-paragraphs. So it has proved. The Committee's purpose was to provide a simple and definitive procedure to determine any such question. The Committee observes that it is not its function under that procedure to confirm (or otherwise) the position of one or other Party, but to rule autonomously on the matter. Having examined all of the submissions and supporting documents, the Committee is in no doubt that the two communications made on behalf of Venezuela correspond to the precise requirements laid down in Procedural Order No. 2, notably as regards the scope of the undertaking and its operation in time. The Mobil Parties' objections to the Minister's competence miss the distinction between a Minister's individual power of decision, and the position of a minister as the spokesperson to convey an official undertaking by the Government. The Committee is accordingly satisfied that the Government of Venezuela has formally engaged itself, in the event that the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, promptly to comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled. That being so, and as laid down in sub-paragraph 10 a. of Procedural Order No. 2, the enforcement of the Award of the Tribunal dated 9 October 2014 (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) is stayed pending the Committee's decision on Venezuela's application of 2 February 2015 for its annulment.\n\n11.\n\nIn consequence of the above, sub-paragraphs 10 b., c., and e. of Procedural Order No. 2 cease to have effect."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2017-03-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. APPLICATION, REGISTRATION, PROVISIONAL STAY OF ENFORCEMENT AND CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 February 2015, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\" or \"the Applicant\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") an Application under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (\"the Application\"), seeking the annulment of the Award rendered on 9 October 2014 (\"the Award\") of the Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings between Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. (\"the Mobil Parties\" or \"Respondents\") and Venezuela. The Application sought annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the Convention.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application also included a request for a stay of enforcement of the Award under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* Committee pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of 8 May 2015 the Secretary-General notified the Parties that a Committee had been constituted, composed of Sir Franklin Berman (British) as President, Tan Sri Cecil Abraham (Malaysian) and Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper (German) as Members, and that, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date. The Parties were also informed that Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n**2. FIRST SESSION AND PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 1**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 22 May 2015, the Secretary circulated a draft agenda for the first session and invited the Parties to consult and revert to the Committee with their joint or separate proposals on the draft agenda items as well as on any item they might wish to add.\n\n6.\n\nAfter consultation with the Parties, the Committee notified the Parties on 10 June 2015, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 13(1) that the first session would be held on 7 July 2015.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 June 2015, the Parties jointly submitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 with their agreement on all the items included in the draft agenda and confirmed that they had no items that they wished to add. It was also agreed that the first session would be held by telephone conference.\n\n8.\n\nOn 15 June 2015, the Mobil Parties enclosed a copy of the Decision on Revision that had been issued by the Tribunal on 12 June 2016. In its Decision, the Tribunal dismissed the Application for Revision as inadmissible, declared the stay of enforcement automatically terminated and decided that all costs related to the proceeding would be born by the Applicant.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session was duly held by telephone conference on 7 July 2015. The list of participants was as follows:\n\nMembers of the Committee:\n\nSir Franklin Berman, President of the Committee\n\nTan Sri Cecil Abraham, Member of the Committee\n\nProfessor Dr. Rolf Knieper, Member of the Committee\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Secretary of the Committee\n\nAttending on behalf of the Applicant:\n\nMr. George Kahale, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle Mr. Ben Preziosi, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle Ms. Gabriela Alvarez Avila, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle Ms. Arianna Sanchez, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle\n\nMr. Fuad Zarbiyev, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondents:\n\nMr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel, Three Crowns\n\nMr. Scott Vesel, Three Crowns\n\nMr. Thomas L.

STAY OF ENFORCEMENT**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 9 June 2015, the Mobil Parties submitted a communication contending that \"the provisional stay of enforcement granted by the Secretary General on 9 February 2015 [had] automatically terminated as of 8 June 2015\" and seeking confirmation from the Committee. On the same day the Applicant wrote to the Committee opposing the Respondents' interpretation of Rule 54(2). The Applicant contended that the stay remained in place and should continue in place until the conclusion of the proceeding. If the Respondents wished the Committee to rule on the continuation of the stay, the Applicant proposed that the Committee establish a briefing schedule for that purpose. The Parties exchanged further communications on whether the request was properly framed as a request for a new stay (assuming the stay had been automatically terminated) or as a request for the continuation of the stay (assuming the stay continued in place).\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 June 2015, the Committee established a schedule of submissions on the issue of a stay and indicated that the Parties would be given the opportunity to argue this issue orally before the Committee during the first session.\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 June 2015, the Mobil Parties filed their submission on the stay issue.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 June 2015, Venezuela filed its submission on the stay issue.\n\n15.\n\nHaving heard the Parties' oral arguments at the first session on 7 July 2015, the Committee issued its decision concerning the stay in Procedural Order No. 2 dated 28 July 2015. In the Order, the Committee noted that \"[t]he Parties were in disagreement over the essential nature of the stay application. In the view of Venezuela, it was applying for a prolongation of the provisional stay brought into effect by the Secretary-General in application of Article 52.5 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 54(2). In the view of the Mobil Parties, that provisional stay had lapsed, and the application could therefore only be for the imposition of a fresh stay *de novo*. Given the actual enforcement situation, however, both Parties had indicated that, in the circumstances, the question was not one which the Committee was required to decide. The Committee was moreover satisfied that the criteria to be applied, in deciding whether to grant or to deny a stay, would be the same under either of the two alternative scenarios.\" Paragraph 10 of the Order reads as follows:\n\na) The enforcement of the Award of the Tribunal dated 9 October 2014 (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) is stayed pending the Committee's decision on Venezuela's application of 2 February 2015 for its annulment.\n\nb) The continued effect of Paragraph a. above is conditional on the receipt, within 30 days of the date of this Order, of an official undertaking in writing, by a Minister or other senior officer empowered to commit the Government of Venezuela, that, if the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, Venezuela will promptly comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled. The written undertaking will be addressed to the Committee and copied to each of the Mobil Parties.\n\nc) If no undertaking satisfying the terms of Paragraph b. above has been received at the end of the time limit specified in that paragraph, the stay will automatically be lifted 15 days later, but only if there has by then been received an official undertaking or undertakings in writing, by a senior officer or officers empowered to commit each of the Mobil Parties, that no attempt will be made to enforce any part of the Award in a manner that does not take full account of the requirement set forth in the above-cited paragraphs of the Award to avoid double recovery. In the absence of an undertaking or undertakings to that effect, the stay will continue in effect until such time as the requisite undertaking or undertakings have been received. The written undertaking or undertakings will be addressed to the Committee and copied to each of the other Parties to the present annulment proceedings.\n\nd) It is open to any Party to apply at any time for a modification or termination of the above in accordance with the provisions of Arbitration Rule 54.\n\ne) Any Party may apply to the Committee, if the need arises, to certify whether the conditions laid down in Paragraphs b. or c. above have been duly complied with.\n\n16.\n\nOn 18 August 2015, the Centre received a letter addressed to the Committee by the Viceprocurador de la Rep\u00fablica of Venezuela, which was however challenged by the Mobil Parties by letter of 20 August 2015 as failing to comply with the requirements of paragraph 10(b) of Order No. 2; the Mobil Parties requested that the stay be lifted in accordance with paragraph 10(c) of the Order unless Venezuela provided a compliant undertaking by 26 August 2015 or a bank guarantee covering the full amount of the La Ceiba portion of the Award by 10 September 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn 24 August 2015, the Committee suspended the time limits under paragraph 10 of Order No. 2 and invited Venezuela to confirm in writing, at Ministerial level, not later than 31 August 2015, that the letter did constitute \"a formal and binding undertaking on the part of the Government of Venezuela, in the words of sub-paragraph 10(b), \u2018that, if the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, Venezuela [would] promptly comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled'.\" The Committee further noted that the Mobil Parties would be at liberty thereafter, if they considered it necessary, to avail themselves of the procedure specified in sub-paragraph 10(e) of the Order.\n\n18.\n\nOn 28 August 2015, a letter dated 27 August 2015 was received from the Minister of Petroleum and Mines of Venezuela containing a confirmation as requested by the Committee. On 1 September 2015, the Mobil Parties requested the Committee to confirm under paragraph 10(e) of Order No. 2 that Venezuela had not complied with paragraph 10(b) of the Order and to order that the stay be lifted immediately upon provision by the Mobil Parties of the undertaking referred to in paragraph 10(c) of the Order. On 2 September 2015, the Committee invited the Applicant's response; the time limits under paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 2 would in the meanwhile remain suspended. On 4 September 2015, the Applicant wrote asserting that the Minister's letter did comply with the Committee's request.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 September 2015, the Committee issued a decision in the following terms:\n\n[...] Having examined all of the submissions and supporting documents, the Committee is in no doubt that the two communications made on behalf of Venezuela correspond to the precise requirements laid down in Procedural Order No. 2, notably as regards the scope of the undertaking and its operation in time.\n\n[...] The Committee is accordingly satisfied that the Government of Venezuela has formally engaged itself, in the event that the Committee decides not to annul the Award, or to annul it only in part, promptly to comply with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled. That being so, and as laid down in subparagraph 10 a. of Procedural Order No. 2, the enforcement of the Award of the Tribunal dated 9 October 2014 (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) is stayed pending the Committee's decision on Venezuela's application of 2 February 2015 for its annulment. [...] In consequence of the above, sub-paragraphs 10 b., c., and e. of Procedural Order No. 2 cease to have effect.\n\n**4. WRITTEN PROCEDURE**\n------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn 22 July, 16 September, 4 November, and 23 December 2015, the Parties duly filed their respective written Memorials in support of and in opposition to the Application for Annulment.\n\n**5. HEARING ON ANNULMENT**\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, the Committee determined, on the basis of agreement between the Parties, that the hearing would be held on 25 and 26 January 2016.\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 December 2015, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and try to reach agreement on the procedural arrangements for the hearing and submit any such agreements or points or disagreement by 15 January 2016.\n\n23.\n\nOn 12 January 2016, the Parties submitted their agreements and points of disagreement concerning procedural hearing matters. The Committee issued its decision concerning procedural arrangements on 14 January 2016 and confirmed that a pre-hearing organizational meeting would not be necessary.\n\n24.\n\nOn 21 January 2016, the Committee sent a communication to the Parties concerning a severe snow storm forecast for the hearing venue during the period immediately prior to the hearing. The Committee noted that the storm was expected to disrupt transport and power, and put forward possible alternative arrangements for that eventuality. After numerous exchanges between the Parties and the Committee and two conference calls with its President, the hearing days were finally vacated.\n\n25.\n\nAfter consultation with the Parties, the Committee confirmed 8 and 9 March 2016 as the new hearing dates, and further confirmed that the timing arrangements would be those established for the original hearing but transposed to the new dates.\n\n26.\n\nThe hearing was duly held at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. on 8 and 9 March 2016. The list of participants was as follows:\n\nMembers of the Committee:\n\nSir Franklin Berman, President of the Committee\n\nTan Sri Cecil Abraham, Member of the Committee\n\nProfessor Dr. Rolf Knieper, Member of the Committee\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Secretary of the Committee\n\nAttending on behalf of the Applicant:\n\nMr. George Kahale, III, Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle\n\nMr. Benard V.

POST-HEARING PHASE**\n-------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 25 March 2016, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the hearing transcript.\n\n28.\n\nOn 15 April 2016, as requested by the Committee, the Parties submitted their respective statements of costs.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal declared the proceeding closed on 6 January 2017 in accordance with Rules 53 and 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. APPLICANT**\n----------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Applicant makes the following request for relief:1\n\n(i) [T]he portion of the Award dealing with the Cerro Negro Project should be annulled due to the tribunal's manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons in holding that it had jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty; (ii) in the event that the portion of the Award dealing with the Cerro Negro Project is not so annulled, then the part of the Award dealing with the amount of compensation for the Cerro Negro Project and the determination of such compensation in paragraph 404(d) of the Award should be annulled on the grounds of (a) manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons in failing to apply the special agreement regarding compensation and (b) manifest excess of powers, failure to state reasons and serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in failing to order document production relating to the special agreement regarding compensation; and (iii) the portion of the Award dealing with the La Ceiba Project should be annulled due to the tribunal's manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons in holding that it had jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty.\n\nReply, para. 323.\n\n**2. RESPONDENTS**\n------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondents makes the following request for relief:2\n\nThe Mobil Parties respectfully request that the Committee dismiss the Application and award them all costs incurred in connection with these proceedings.\n\nRejoinder, para. 112\n\n**III.ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. APPLICANT**\n----------------\n\n***A. Grounds for annulment***\n------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Applicant seeks annulment of the Award under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. Specifically, the Applicant relies on the following three grounds for annulment:3\n\n\u2022 Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) ICSID Convention);\n\n\u2022 Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) ICSID Convention); and\n\n\u2022 Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) ICSID Convention).\n\nMemorial, para. 102.\n\n***B. Standard for annulment***\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Applicant acknowledges that annulment constitutes an exception to the finality of awards and that annulment does not constitute appeal. According to the Applicant, what matters is that this exception to finality does exist under the ICSID Convention and that the Applicant is not seeking an appeal but has filed a \"bona fide application for annulment that fits squarely within Article 52 of the ICSID Convention\".4\n\nReply, paras. 156, 157.\n\n34.\n\nThe Applicant rejects the limiting proposition put forward by the Mobil Parties that annulment is discretionary even when the grounds for annulment are met. According to the Applicant, this proposition is not supported by the text or the drafting history of the ICSID Convention;5 \"[i]n sum, if the Committee finds that a ground for annulment exists, it must annul the Award.\"6\n\nReply, para. 160.\n\nReply, para. 170.\n\n35.\n\nConcerning the specific three grounds for annulment it relies upon, Venezuela asserts the following:\n\n*(i) Manifest excess of powers:*\n\n- Failure to apply the proper law : it is well established that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers when it fails to apply the law agreed upon by the parties, even if the tribunal is nominally applying the correct law.7 The Applicant does not dispute that a mere error of law or a failure to apply individual provisions of the applicable law do not constitute a manifest excess of power, but rejects the allegation that it is seeking annulment on that basis; annulment is sought rather on the grounds that the Tribunal either completely failed to apply the proper law or referred to it but then effectively disregarded it. The Applicant contends that the Mobil Parties do not dispute that failure to apply the proper law altogether or gross misapplication of the law that amounts to failure to apply it amount to a manifest excess of power.8\n\n- Lack of jurisdiction : the Applicant rejects the notion that it is \"merely attempting to challenge the tribunal's \u2018factual findings' on jurisdiction;\" the lack of jurisdiction follows from the application of the standard established by the Tribunal, such that its conclusions on jurisdiction cannot be reconciled with its factual findings.9 Lack of jurisdiction amounts to an excess of powers that is manifest *per se*.10\n\n- Admissibility : the Applicant rejects the argument that the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction amounts in reality to a decision on admissibility. Even if it were, a characterization as admissibility does not prevent annulment for manifest excess of powers (or failure to state reasons).11\n\n*(ii) Failure to state reasons:*\n\n- The Applicant contends that the obligation to state reasons \"flows from\" Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, which requires that the award \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and [...] state the reasons upon which it is based.\"12 Specifically, this ground for annulment has two main components: (first) that it is not possible to follow the Tribunal's reasoning to its conclusion, and (second) that the Tribunal failed to deal with questions raised by the applicant, the answer to which might have affected its conclusion.13 The Applicant submits that neither of these components is disputed by the Mobil Parties.14\n\n*(iii) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure:*\n\n- The Applicant contends that this ground involves a two-part test: (first) the departure must be *serious*, which refers to its actual or potential impact on the award; and (second) the procedural rule affected must be *fundamental*, which refers to the minimal standards of procedure including the right to be heard.15\n\n- The Applicant understands that the Mobil Parties do not dispute the test itself but rather whether it has been met in the present case. According to the Applicant:\n\na. The \u2018seriousness' test is met because the Tribunal's decision on document production prevented the Applicant from fully presenting its case.16\n\nb. The \u2018fundamental' test is equally met because the taking of evidence forms part of the right to be heard.17 The discretion enjoyed by tribunals in managing document production does not \"alter the principle that flat denial of a request for production of highly relevant and material documents is tantamount to a denial of due process.\"18 In other words, tribunals do not have discretion to deviate from a fundamental rule of procedure.19\n\nMemorial, paras. 106-110.\n\nReply, paras. 172-175.\n\nReply, paras. 182-183.\n\nReply, paras. 177-181, 185.\n\nReply, para. 186.\n\nMemorial, paras. 112-115.\n\nReply, paras. 188-189.\n\nReply, paras. 190-191.\n\nReply, para. 193.\n\nReply, para. 194.\n\nReply, para. 195.\n\nReply, para. 197.\n\nReply, para. 198.\n\n***C. Facts alleged supporting the grounds for annulment***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe three grounds for annulment relied on by the Applicant are based on the following three contentions, of which (i) and (ii) are relevant to the Cerro Negro Project, and (iii) is relevant to both the Cerro Negro and the La Ceiba Projects:20\n\n\"(i) the tribunal did not apply the applicable law and the special agreement relating to the investment of the Mobil Parties in the Cerro Negro Project, thereby disregarding the basic terms and conditions on which that investment was authorized; (ii) the tribunal refused to allow essential document production with respect to the fundamental issue in (i) above, applying the wrong standard and denying the Applicant due process; and (iii) the tribunal exercised jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty based on a corporate restructuring effected by the Mobil Parties in anticipation of litigation for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID.\"21\n\nMemorial, para. 102.\n\nMemorial, para. 102.\n\n*(i) Failure to Apply the Proper Law and the Special Agreement concerning the Cerro Negro Project*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicant alleges that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it failed to apply the proper law and the special agreement concerning the Cerro Negro Project.22\n\nMemorial, paras. 105, 123.\n\n38.\n\nIt emphasizes that its Application for Annulment does not seek to challenge any findings of fact by the Tribunal: \"On the contrary, the Applicant fully agrees with the tribunal's principal findings relating to the compensation structure of the Cerro Negro Proj ect.\"23 According to the Applicant, it is \"the Mobil Parties [who] are forced to either distort or ignore every single piece of evidence in the record to sustain their position on the facts concerning the compensation structure of the Cerro Negro Project.\"24\n\nReply, paras. 201, 204.\n\nReply, para. 203.\n\n39.\n\nVenezuela contends that the portion of the Tribunal's decision relating to the compensation for the Cerro Negro Project must be annulled precisely because the Tribunal's conclusions do not follow from the Tribunal's factual findings.25 The Tribunal's conclusions are at odds with its own findings of fact as a result of its failure to apply the proper law under Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty, which amounts to a manifest excess of power. The Tribunal also failed to state the reasons that would carry its findings of fact to its conclusions on the Cerro Negro Project compensation structure.\n\nReply, para. 206.\n\na) Manifest excess of powers Failure to apply Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty required that the Award be based \"not only on the provisions of the Dutch Treaty and international law, but also on Venezuelan law and \u2018the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments'.\"26 The Tribunal acknowledged this provision but manifestly exceeded its powers when it disregarded the compensation structure for the Cerro Negro Project applicable under Venezuelan law and the special agreement on compensation for the Cerro Negro Project, namely the Cerro Negro Association Agreement, as authorized by the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization.27\n\nMemorial, para. 105.\n\nMemorial, paras. 106-110, 121-122. Reply, para. 207.\n\n41.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers when it fails to apply the law agreed upon by the parties,28 even if the tribunal is nominally applying the correct law.29 In the present case, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal referred to Article 9(5) of the BIT but then ignored both the applicable law (Venezuelan law) and the special agreement under that provision (the Cerro Negro Association Agreement, as authorized by the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization).30\n\nMemorial, para. 106.\n\nMemorial, para. 107.\n\nMemorial, paras. 106-110, 124.\n\n42.\n\nVenezuela rejects the Mobil Parties' argument that in order to establish a manifest excess of powers \"the Republic would need to establish that either (a) the Tribunal applied a law different than the ones enumerated in Article 9(5) or (b) under the exception recognized by some committees, the Tribunal erred so egregiously in its determination as to which of these sources of law applied to which issues as to amount to a failure to apply these sources of law at all.\"31 According to Venezuela, Article 9(5) does not establish options, and so the Tribunal was not free to disregard a special agreement on compensation.32 This is also not contrary to international law; when a State admits an investment under certain conditions, the State does not violate international law by applying those conditions.33\n\nReply, para. 207, quoting from Counter-Memorial, para. 180.\n\nReply, para. 208.\n\nReply, para. 210.\n\n43.\n\n*Regarding failure to apply Venezuelan law*, the Applicant ultimately relies on the argument that \"[a] party cannot claim compensation for the expropriation of rights it never had.\"34 Because the scope of an investor's rights is always determined by national law, the Tribunal should have applied Venezuelan law in order to determine the scope of the Mobil Parties' rights.\n\nReply, para. 219.\n\n44.\n\nIn this sense, the relevant enquiry35 is not \"whether a particular asset \u2018qualifies as an investment under the Treaty' but rather what that asset consists of.\"36 What the asset consists of (or the scope of the rights attached to it) is determined by national law, not international law. International law can only provide protection for rights recognized by domestic law, but not create new property rights or expand existing property rights.37\n\nReply, para. 225.\n\nReply, para. 219.\n\nReply, paras. 211, 219.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal determined the extent of the compensation due for the expropriation of the Respondents' rights under international law, in reliance on the fundamental but irrelevant principle that a State may not invoke its internal law as an excuse to escape international obligations. In so doing, the Tribunal failed to address the Applicant's argument that an investor's property rights are defined by local law or its corollary that an investment treaty merely protects these rights but does not create or expand them.38 By applying international law instead of domestic law to determine the scope of the expropriated rights the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nMemorial, paras. 128-132.\n\n46.\n\n*Regarding failure to apply the special agreement*, the Applicant relies on the combination of the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization and the Cerro Negro Association Agreement.39 Together, these instruments established the terms and conditions of the Cerro Negro Project, including its compensation structure, which included the price cap on compensation for governmental action affecting the project. This compensation structure constituted a special agreement in the sense of Article 9(5) regardless of whether the State was a party to the Association Agreement because the parties to the Association Agreement could not depart from the terms of the Congressional Authorization, as mandated by Article 5 of the Nationalization Law.40 The conditions laid down by the Congressional Authorization would apply even if the Treaty did not specifically include special agreements in Article 9(5). This is (i) because the Congressional Authorization constituted a condition for the investment established from the outset by the State and (ii) because, as a matter of principle, property rights are created and defined by national law.\n\nVenezuela rejects the Mobil Parties' argument that there was no special agreement capable of being applied as a source of law. Reply, para. 226.\n\nReply, paras. 227-230.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the purported reasons given by the Tribunal to ignore the Cerro Negro Project compensation structure are \"not reasons at all\". They were facts that bore no relevance to the issue before the Tribunal and did not address the core point made by Venezuela that \"a party cannot receive compensation for rights it never had or beyond the rights it did have.\"41\n\nReply, paras. 236-241. Memorial, paras. 123-130.\n\n48.\n\nThe Applicant claims that the Tribunal also failed to state reasons in the sense of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention in that it failed to address the Applicant's argument that an investor's property rights are defined by domestic law, which would have affected the outcome of the Award. A failure to deal with material issues is tantamount to a failure to state reasons.42\n\nReply, para. 243. Memorial, paras. 131-132. The Applicant rejects the Respondents' argument that this is a new issue that was not presented before the Tribunal. Reply, paras. 245-249.\n\n49.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal also failed to address the Applicant's arguments (i) that the compensation structure established for the Cerro Negro Project pursuant to the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization was an integral part of the fair market value analysis;43 (ii) that the relevance of the compensation provisions was not a matter of a \"third-party beneficiary\" analysis, which was not part of Venezuela's argument;44 as well as (iii) Dr. Mommer's uncontested testimony which would have supported the Tribunal's own findings of fact concerning the compensation structure under the Association Agreement and the Congressional Authorization.45\n\nReply, paras. 250-264. Memorial, paras.133-137.\n\nReply, paras. 265-273. Memorial, paras. 138-142.\n\nReply, paras. 274-276. Memorial, paras. 143-147.\n\nc) Conclusion\n-------------\n\n50.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Applicant frames the argument concerning annulment under Article 52(1)(b) and/or (e) of the ICSID Convention based on the Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law and the special agreement as follows:\n\nThe issue of whether the portion of the Award relating to compensation for the Cerro Negro Project should be annulled for manifest excess of powers or failure to state reasons, or both, hinges upon whether there was any basis for the tribunal to disregard the terms and conditions established for the Cerro Negro Project pursuant to the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization.46\n\nReply, para. 277.\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant answers this issue in the negative, on the ground that the reasons provided by the Tribunal are not sufficient to establish a link between the bases or factual findings relied on by the Tribunal and the conclusions reached by it, and must therefore result in the annulment of the portion of the Award that deals with compensation for the Cerro Negro Project.47\n\nReply, paras. 242, 279-280.\n\n*(ii) Refusal to allow essential document production*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the same portion of the Award should be annulled as a consequence of the Tribunal's refusal to allow document production concerning the applicability of the compensation structure of the Project pursuant to the Congressional Authorization.48 According to the Applicant, the Tribunal's refusal to allow this request for document production constitutes a manifest excess of powers,49 a failure to state reasons50 and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure51 pursuant to Article 52(1)(b), (e) and (d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMemorial, para. 149.\n\nMemorial, paras. 152-158.\n\nMemorial, para. 159. Reply, paras. 291-298.\n\nMemorial, para. 160-167. Reply, paras. 299-303.\n\n53.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the request for document production (i) was sufficiently narrow,52 related to the Mobil Parties' \"theory of the compensation structure of the Cerro Negro Project being an \u2018incentive'\" and (ii) was relevant to the Applicant's argument \"that under the Congressional Authorization for the Cerro Negro Project, Respondent expressly reserved all of its sovereign rights to take action affecting the Project, that this was a fundamental condition to obtaining the authorization of the Project that was required by law, that Mobil Cerro Negro agreed that compensation would be subject to the terms, conditions and, most importantly, limitations on compensation through a price cap to be set forth in the Cerro Negro Association Agreement, and that Mobil Cerro Negro understood from the outset that any compensation for adverse governmental action would be subject to those terms, conditions and limitations.\"53\n\nReply, paras. 302.\n\nReply, paras. 282-283, quoting from Venezuela's Observations on Mobil Parties' Reply to Venezuela's Application for an Order Requiring the Production of Documents.\n\n54.\n\nThe Applicant acknowledges \"that the record is clear and that the tribunal found the material facts to be exactly as the Applicant has presented them, but that does not mean that the Mobil Parties were entitled to hide highly relevant documents that would have confirmed the Applicant's position...\"54 According to the Applicant, these documents would have shown the Mobil Parties' understanding of the special agreement on compensation for governmental action against the Project and would have had a significant and material impact on the Tribunal's determination of the relevance of the price cap.55\n\nReply, para. 287.\n\nMemorial, paras. 150-151.\n\na) Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal's refusal to order document production was effected in one sentence, where the Tribunal \"consider[ed] that [Venezuela] ha[d] not demonstrated that the documents requested [were] necessary as required under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 34(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\"56 According to Venezuela, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it failed to apply the applicable law in so far as it failed to apply any proper standard for document production57 even if, as the Mobil Parties argue, ICSID provides no specific rules of document production58 and even if the Tribunal mentioned Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2(a).59 Failing to apply \"well-known principles\" is equivalent to failing to apply the provisions mentioned or constitutes a \"gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the governing principles, amounting to a failure to apply the applicable law.\"60\n\nMemorial, para. 150.\n\nMemorial, paras. 152-158.\n\nReply, para. 288.\n\nReply, para. 289.\n\nMemorial, para. 153.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal also failed to state reasons for its denial of the document production request. In fact, the Tribunal \"provided no supporting reasons at all, simply reciting the ultimate conclusion that the standard for document production had not been met.\"61 The Applicant contends that it is not possible to decipher how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion.62\n\nReply, para. 292.\n\nReply, para. 294.\n\nc) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nFinally, the Applicant argues that the refusal constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Applicant contends that tribunals do not have unfettered discretion to manage document production to the extent of including unjustified denials of document production. This would constitute a denial of the right to be heard, which itself constitutes a fundamental rule of procedure.63\n\nReply, para. 300\n\n*(iii) Exercise of Jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty based on a Corporate Restructuring Effected to Gain access to ICSID*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal's failure to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction constitutes a manifest excess of powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention and a failure to state reasons in the sense of Article 52(1)(e).64\n\nReply, para. 304.\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it found that it had jurisdiction despite the abuse of rights constituted by the corporate restructuring undertaken by the Mobil Parties with the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction and in anticipation of litigation.65\n\nMemorial, para. 168.\n\n60.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal failed to state reasons to explain how it reached the conclusion that it had jurisdiction having found \"that the sole purpose of the corporate restructuring was to gain access to ICSID, that there were existing and foreseeable disputes between the Mobil Parties and Venezuela prior to the Dutch restructuring and that the Mobil Parties had already notified the Applicant of tax disputes and of a potential expropriation dispute before the restructuring.\"66\n\nMemorial, para. 168.\n\na) Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicant contends that a tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction when jurisdiction does not exist constitutes in itself a manifest excess of powers,67 and lists a \"set of factors to be taken into account in determining whether there has been an abuse through a \u2018corporation of convenience' for purposes of obtaining ICSID jurisdiction\". The Tribunal referred to the cases where these factors are considered but \"failed to apply the principles they represent.\"68\n\nMemorial, para. 169.\n\nMemorial, paras. 171, 181.\n\n62.\n\nThe Applicant relies in particular on the principle that \"transfers into a treaty jurisdiction for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction in anticipation of litigation constitute treaty abuse.\"69 According to the Applicant, all the factors identified were present in this case. Therefore, there could have been no doubt that the corporate restructuring constituted an abuse of rights.70 The exercise of jurisdiction in those circumstances constituted a manifest excess of powers.71\n\nMemorial, para. 182.\n\nMemorial, para. 186.\n\nMemorial, para. 188.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Award should be annulled for failure to state reasons, this being a ground that applies when the reasons given are insufficient or contradictory.72\n\nReply, paras. 318-319.\n\n64.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal's conclusion that there was no abuse of rights in the Mobil Parties' corporate restructuring does not follow from the Tribunal's factual and legal findings that (i) a restructuring effected with the sole purpose of securing access to ICSID jurisdiction would constitute an abuse of right; and that (ii) the corporate restructuring of the Mobil Parties was done with the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction and at a time when there were existing and foreseeable disputes.73\n\nMemorial, para. 190.\n\n65.\n\nThe Applicant further contends that the Tribunal's different conclusions on jurisdiction concerning the expropriation claim and the income tax measure claim are contradictory; : \"...the tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction over the expropriation claim on the ground that the expropriation did not occur until after the Mobil Parties had restructured their interests directly contradicts the tribunal's determination that it did not have jurisdiction over the claim based on the income tax measure, which did not take effect until January 2007, after the restructuring of both the Cerro Negro and the La Ceiba Projects.\".74\n\nMemorial, para. 191.\n\n66.\n\nFinally, the Applicant submits that, even though the Tribunal recognized the foreseeability principle as stated in the *Pac Rim* Decision, it (i) failed to analyze it and therefore to address the argument that jurisdiction cannot be exercised where the restructuring that brings about the protection of a treaty occurs when the claim is foreseeable, which applied to the expropriation claim in this case; and (ii) upheld jurisdiction over the expropriation claim on the basis of when the nationalization measures were actually taken, instead of considering when the dispute concerning those measures was foreseeable.75\n\nMemorial, para. 192.

RESPONDENTS**\n------------------\n\n***A. Concerning the grounds for annulment***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Mobil Parties consider the application for annulment part of a tactic to evade or at least delay payment of the compensation awarded to them in the Arbitration.76\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 2, 5.\n\n68.\n\nThe Mobil Parties contend that none of the complaints raised against the Award has any merit; \"[w]hat is relevant to - and dispositive of - the Republic's Application is that none of its complaints could possibly give rise to a valid basis for annulment under any of the grounds listed in Article 52.\"77\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 8.\n\n***B. Concerning the standard for annulment***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Mobil Parties state that annulment is \"constrained by three fundamental propositions\",78 which results in the grounds for annulment being subject to \"particularly high standards\"79:\n\n\u2022 annulment constitutes an extraordinary and limited exception to the finality of awards.80\n\n\u2022 annulment does not constitute appeal and therefore does not allow for revision of errors of fact or law.81\n\n\u2022 annulment is discretionary.82\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 46.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 47.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 46, 52-55.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 46, 56-64.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 46, 65-69.\n\n70.\n\nConcerning the three specific grounds for annulment relied on by Venezuela, the Mobil Parties argue as follows:\n\n*(i) Manifest excess of powers:*\n\n- The Mobil Parties contend that manifest excess of powers contains a \"dual requirement\" that the Tribunal acted in excess of powers and that the excess qualifies as manifest.83 In particular, the word \"manifest\" was intended to place a serious restriction and emphasizes the extraordinary nature of the annulment remedy. They refer to decisions of previous *ad hoc* committees which found that: (i) manifest means \"\u2018evident', \u2018obvious', and \u2018plain on its face' such that it can be discerned without any elaborate analysis of the Award\"84; and that (ii) the excess must give rise to serious consequences.85\n\n- Failure to apply the proper law : the Mobil Parties distinguish between failure to apply the law and an error in the application of the law, and contend that only the former could constitute a basis for annulment - albeit not every failure to apply the law will meet the threshold for annulment.86 In the same sense, failure to apply individual provisions of the law87 and failure to refer to the governing law would not amount to failure to apply the law.88 The Mobil Parties also note that a few *ad hoc* committees have differentiated between a mere error of law and an atrocious error of law, and acknowledged the possibility that an \"atrocious\" error could constitute basis for annulment.89 In addition, they argue that even if failure to apply the law was established, the Applicant would also have to show that the failure was manifest, and contend that, so long as a tribunal endeavoured to apply the proper law (as they suggest the Committee will be satisfied is the case here), that would discharge its duty and would thus fail to cross the \"manifest\" threshold.90\n\n- Lack of jurisdiction : The Mobil Parties argue that a manifest excess of powers concerning jurisdiction should be treated no differently from any other ground for annulment, in that it must meet the dual requirement that jurisdiction was exercised where there was none and that the non-existence of jurisdiction was manifest.91 They reject the argument that the manifest requirement should not apply in relation to jurisdiction (or that exercising jurisdiction where none exists in itself raises to the level of manifest excess of powers).92\n\n- Admissibility : The Mobil Parties submit that an allegation of abuse of right is a claim of admissibility and not an objection to jurisdiction. Since admissibility is discretionary in nature, it \"cannot provide a basis for annulment for an alleged manifest excess of powers.\"93\n\n*(ii) Failure to state reasons:*\n\n- The Mobil Parties contend that the standard for annulment for failure to state reasons requires the following: (i) that the failure result in \"a particular point essentially lacking any expressed rationale\"; and (ii) that the point itself be necessary for the tribunal's decision.94 According to the Respondents, so long as the reasoning can be followed, is \"plausible\" and not \"clearly frivolous\", there is no basis for annulment under this ground.95 The Mobil Parties further state that this ground does not cover failure to address a question (which is governed by Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention)96 unless the particular failure \"amounts to a failure in the intelligibility of the reasoning in the award.\"97 Similarly, the Tribunal's reasoning need not be exhaustive or explicit.98 The Mobil Parties acknowledge that contradictory reasons may fall under this ground for annulment, but argue that the contradiction would have to render the reasoning incomprehensible and not constitute a mere inconsi stency.99\n\n*(iii) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure:*\n\n- The Mobil Parties contend that this ground involves a \"three-stage test\": (i) that the procedural rule be fundamental or limited to the principles of natural justice; (ii) that there be a departure as opposed to an exercise of the Tribunal's discretion; and (iii) that the departure be sufficiently serious to merit annulment, *i.e.*, that it cause the Tribunal to reach \"a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"100\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 71.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para.73.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 74.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 80-85.

Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 106.\n\n***C. Concerning the alleged facts supporting the grounds for annulment***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Mobil Parties describe the Applicant's \"theory\" as follows: \"that in order to participate in the Cerro Negro Project, Mobil CN was forced to agree to a contract with PDVSA-CN, the terms of which (through an unspecified legal mechanism) precluded the pursuit of treaty-based remedies against the Republic to obtain full compensation in case of expropriation.\"101\n\nRejoinder, para. 16.\n\n72.\n\nAccording to the Mobil Parties, this theory is not supported by either the facts or the language of the Cerro Negro Association Agreement.102 In particular, the Mobil Parties argue that Section 15 of the CNAA contains a \"limited indemnity\" granted by a subsidiary of PDVSA for certain governmental actions, not a limitation on Venezuela's compensation obligation under the Dutch Treaty,103 not least because the limitation of liability constituted a limitation on the investors and PDVSA under a contract, whereas the payment of just compensation for expropriation constituted an obligation of Venezuela under a treaty.104 The contractual indemnity provided protection to the Mobil Parties as an incentive to invest in the Cerro Negro Project, and was additional to the treaty protection.105\n\nRejoinder, para. 17.\n\nRejoinder, para. 26.\n\nRejoinder, para. 42.\n\nRejoinder, para. 36.\n\n73.\n\nThe Mobil Parties similarly contend that the Applicant's position finds no support in its own Congressional enactments or the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Framework of Conditions.106 The Venezuelan Congress did not enact provisions \"capable of being read as disclaiming the Republic's international law obligations or as providing a basis to construe the Mobil Parties' decision to invest as a waiver of the Mobil Parties' international law rights to obtain just compensation in the event of an expropriation.\"107\n\nRejoinder, paras. 27-43.\n\nRejoinder, para. 41.\n\n*(i) Failure to Apply the Proper Law and the Special Agreement concerning the Cerro Negro Project*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Mobil Parties state that the complaint of manifest excess of powers must be rejected because the Tribunal correctly identified and applied the proper law, because there was no special agreement in the sense of Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty between the Parties and because Venezuela could not rely on its domestic legislation to amend or avoid its obligations under the Treaty.108\n\nRejoinder, para. 45.\n\n75.\n\n*Regarding identification and application of the proper law*, the Mobil Parties contend that the Tribunal observed the possible sources of law listed by the Parties in Article 9(5) of the Treaty, which did not in itself allocate matters to one law or another, leaving it therefore for the Tribunal to determine which issues would be governed by which law.109 The Tribunal's approach \"is consistent with well-established principles of international law and the practice of other investment tribunals.\"110\n\nRejoinder, para. 51.\n\nRejoinder, para. 52.\n\n76.\n\nThe Mobil Parties submit that the Tribunal's determination that international law governed the amount of compensation due for the expropriation of their interests is \"unassailable\" and supported by \"ample and unanimous authority,111 whereas Venezuela's position that this issue should have been determined under domestic law instruments is \"untenable\" under the principle that a State cannot rely on its domestic law to thwart its international obligations enshrined in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention.112\n\nRejoinder, para. 54.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 56-57.\n\n77.\n\n*Regarding the existence or otherwise of a special agreement within the meaning of Article 9(5) of the Treaty*, the Mobil Parties reject the argument that the CNAA can be used as the basis for such special agreement since the Republic was not a party to the contract and \"[i]t is axiomatic that a contract can only be a source of law as between the parties to the contract.\"113 The Tribunal also reached this conclusion and its findings are not subject to review on annulment.114\n\nRejoinder, para. 58.\n\nRejoinder, para. 60.\n\n78.\n\nSince the CNAA does not constitute a special agreement and the Framework of Conditions and Congressional Authorization constitute pieces of legislation, not agreements, the combination of these instruments does not result in a special agreement under Article 9(5) of the Treaty.115\n\nRejoinder, paras. 61-62.\n\n79.\n\n*Regarding the argument that domestic law governs the scope of property rights and therefore that the extent of compensation is dependent on the scope of these rights under national law* *(and its corollary that the Tribunal should have applied domestic law to determine the amount of compensation)*, the Mobil Parties state that it is inadmissible on annulment as (i) it constitutes a new argument that was not presented before the Tribunal;116 and (ii) the Applicant is unable to identify any such right.117 In any event, the Mobil Parties contend that the principles relied on are not applicable to the present case.118\n\nRejoinder, paras. 66-69.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 66, 70-72.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 66, 73-79.\n\n80.\n\nThe Mobil Parties contend that it is a well-established argument that annulment cannot be based on new evidence or new arguments, which makes this new argument inadmissible. A reference made by Venezuela in the context of its FET argument to \"rights and expectations\" being defined by Venezuelan law and special agreements is not equivalent to its current argument on the scope of \"property rights\" and its impact on the amount of compensation.119\n\nRejoinder, paras. 67-69.\n\n81.\n\nThe Mobil Parties state that there was no dispute relating to the scope of property rights, and therefore the Applicant is unable to identify which property right exactly is under discussion. The dispute identified by Venezuela before the Tribunal concerned whether its liability under the Treaty was limited by the CNAA or the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions, which did not require a determination on the scope of a property right.120\n\nRejoinder, paras. 70-72.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, the Mobil Parties argue that the authorities relied on by the Applicant do not support its position concerning the limitation of an investor's treaty rights through a contract with the State. In particular, the Mobil Parties refer to the *Siag* case and distinguish it from the present situation in that the underlying contract in *Siag* was between the parties to the dispute and it contained a provision requiring payment of a share of the sale value of the transferred investment to the State for which there is no equivalent in the CNAA.121\n\nRejoinder, paras. 73-79.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Mobil Parties assert that the Tribunal provided \"clear, cogent, and correct reasons for rejecting the Republic's attempts to invoke the indemnity provisions to limit the Republic's liability\" in particular, that Venezuela was not a party to the CNAA and that the Republic's domestic legislation cannot alter its international law obligations. In addition, the Mobil Parties contend that there is no contradiction between the \"description of undisputed facts\" provided by the Tribunal in the Award and the Tribunal's legal conclusions.\n\n84.\n\nThe Mobil Parties refer to the Applicant's \"new argument\" and contend that Venezuela may not challenge the Award on the basis of a failure to address an argument that was never presented to the Tribunal. In any case, the Mobil Parties find that the reasons provided for not applying either the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions or the CNAA were correct.122\n\nRejoinder, para. 84.\n\n85.\n\nRegarding the argument that the Tribunal should have considered the indemnity provisions in the analysis of the fair market value, the Mobil Parties state that the Republic cannot fault the Tribunal for inconsistency in finding that the Republic may not rely on the indemnity provisions and then not considering the indemnity provisions in the analysis of the fair market value.123\n\nRejoinder, paras. 85-86.\n\n86.\n\nThe Mobil Parties also reject Venezuela's arguments concerning the third-party beneficiary analysis and Dr. Mommer's testimony.124\n\nRejoinder, paras. 87-88.\n\n*(ii) Refusal to allow essential document production*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\na) Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Mobil Parties say that the Tribunal applied the standard contained in Article 43 of the ICSID Convention to decide the document production request. Accordingly, Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law is untenable. Article 43 is the only applicable standard for document production under the ICSID Convention, and therefore the Applicant's references to \"all recognized standards\" or to \"any proper standard\" are unavailing.125\n\nRejoinder, paras. 96-97.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Mobil Parties, the Applicant is ultimately arguing that the Tribunal reached the wrong decision \"when exercising its discretion in applying the standard\", which is not reviewable on annulment.126\n\nRejoinder, para. 98.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Mobil Parties contend that the Tribunal provided adequate reasons for its decision to deny document production, and add that (i) \"brevity of the Tribunal's order alone is not a meaningful criterion for determining a failure to state reasons, particularly here where the parties' pleadings clearly provided context and documentation for the Tribunal's order\"; and that (ii) the Tribunal's reasoning \"may be implicit in other considerations and conclusions in the award\".127\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 323-326. Rejoinder, para. 100.\n\n90.\n\nLikewise, the Mobil Parties assert that Venezuela has not (i) produced support for its contention that procedural orders must state reasons; or (ii) explained \"how its contention of an inadequate explanation of the denial is consistent with its own inaction\" after the decision was issued by the Tribunal. Specifically, the Mobil Parties remark that the Republic never complained of lack of reasoning or demanded that the Tribunal elaborate. As a consequence, the Applicant has forfeited its ability to bring this complaint on annulment.128\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 322. Rejoinder, para. 99.\n\nc) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Mobil Parties argue that the Applicant has failed to establish any of the three necessary elements under this ground for annulment.129\n\nRejoinder, para. 89.\n\n92.\n\nFirst, the Applicant has failed to establish that there was a fundamental rule that entitled it to the production of these documents. In particular, the Mobil Parties contend that the Tribunal applied the relevant standard under Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, which is inherently discretionary and therefore cannot constitute a fundamental rule which would have required the Tribunal to rule in a particular way.130\n\nRejoinder, paras. 89-91.\n\n93.\n\nSecond, even if there was a fundamental rule, the Applicant has failed to establish that there was a departure from it, since the denial of documents was justified. In particular, the documents failed to meet the standard of materiality under the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration. This is supported by the Applicant's own contention that it had presented sufficient evidence in support of the factual premises of its legal contentions.131\n\nRejoinder, paras. 89, 92-94.\n\n94.\n\nThird, even if there was a departure, Venezuela has failed to establish that the departure was serious in the sense of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, and in particular to demonstrate that \"the application was \u2018materially prejudiced' and the Award might have been different had the alleged departure not occurred.\"132\n\nRejoinder, paras. 89, 95.\n\n*(iii) Exercise of Jurisdiction under the Dutch Treaty based on a Corporate Restructuring Effected to Gain access to ICSID*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na) Manifest excess of powers\n----------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Mobil Parties contend that the Applicant's argument on \"abuse of right\" lacks merit, firstly because \u2018abuse of right' is a question of admissibility, falling within the discretion of the Tribunal, and is not therefore subject to review on annulment; secondly because it seeks to relitigate factual or legal issues, which is not possible on annulment; and thirdly because in any event the Committee should uphold the determinations made by the Tribunal.133\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 348-350.\n\n96.\n\nFirst, concerning the question of admissibility, the Mobil Parties assert that Venezuela does not dispute that \"all mandatory requirements for ICSID jurisdiction were satisfied in this case\", nor the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility, nor that issues of admissibility are not subject to review on annulment. The Mobil Parties deny that the abuse of right objection can properly be framed as a jurisdictional argument, and contend that both the Parties and the Tribunal distinguished between issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, and included abuse of right among the latter. Even if the Tribunal had classified this issue as one of jurisdiction, \"nomenclature alone cannot alter the substance of the Tribunal's decision and render it reviewable at the annulment phase.\"134\n\nRejoinder, paras. 102-106.\n\n97.\n\nSecond, the Mobil Parties state that the fact that Venezuela is raising the same arguments on annulment as it raised at the jurisdictional phase means that it is seeking to have the issue relitigated in the hopes of obtaining a different result. This is not permissible on annulment since *ad hoc* committees do not have the authority to substitute their own findings for those of the tribunal.135\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 356-360.\n\n98.\n\nThird, even if the Committee were to review the abuse of right objection at the annulment stage, the Mobil Parties contend that it would find that it does not warrant annulment. In particular, the Mobil Parties say that the Tribunal acted within its discretion when analyzing the abuse of right objection and concluding that the restructuring of the Mobil Parties was \"a perfectly legitimate goal\" because it occurred before the expropriating measures had been implemented and the dispute had arisen. The Mobil Parties in addition reject Venezuela's contention that the Tribunal did not consider foreseeability when deciding whether it had jurisdiction over the expropriation claim; on the contrary, the Tribunal found that the absence of references to expropriating measures in contemporaneous correspondence and press announcements indicated that the measures had not been foreseeable at the time of the restructuring.136 In any case, the decisions in *Pac Rim*, *Tidewater* and *Gremcitel* are consistent with the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction.137\n\nRejoinder, paras. 107-108.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 368-377.\n\nb) Failure to state reasons\n---------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAccording to the Mobil Parties, Venezuela's argument that the Tribunal's reasoning is contradictory should be dismissed because it is premised on the mischaracterization of the Tribunal's findings of fact and l aw;138 the Tribunal's reasoning is in fact \"complete and coherent, and displays no trace of the sort of self-contradiction that could render the relevant parts of the Award incomprehensible, as would be required for annulment.\"139\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 378.\n\nRejoinder, para. 109.\n\n100.\n\nAccording to the Mobil Parties, the Tribunal did not find that it is invariably an abuse of right to restructure with the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID jurisdiction. Instead, what the Tribunal found is that it could constitute an abuse of right to do so for pre-existing disputes, but was legitimate for future disputes. The Mobil Parties also dispute that there was any finding by the Tribunal that the restructuring was effected to access ICSID jurisdiction for existing disputes. To the contrary, their position, as supported by the Tribunal's findings, has always been that jurisdiction was sought for \"action that the Respondent took or continued to take after the restructuring was completed\".140 In order to reach its conclusion the Tribunal had analyzed several legal authorities that had addressed restructurings as an alleged abuse of right, and had applied the legal principles derived from these authorities to the facts of the case.141\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 379.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 380-383.\n\n101.\n\nThe Mobil Parties also dispute the claim that there was a contradiction in the exercise of jurisdiction over the expropriation claim but not over the claim concerning income tax. According to the Mobil Parties, the Tribunal found that the income tax claim constituted a preexisting claim that was known at the time of the restructuring, so that the Tribunal's denial of jurisdiction over this claim was consistent with its assuming jurisdiction over the expropriation claim, which the Tribunal considered a future claim unknown at the time of the restructuring.142 In particular, the Tribunal found that although the income tax rate was formally enacted after the restructuring, \"a real dispute concerning a decision already made\" to increase the income tax existed before the restructuring.143 By contrast, the nationalization measures had not been undertaken, were not known, and had not been raised as a dispute before the restructuring occurred.144\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 385.\n\nAccording to the Mobil Parties, this finding also disproves the Applicant's allegation that the Tribunal assumed that a dispute cannot arise until a measure is taken. Rejoinder, para. 110.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 385-391.\n\n102.\n\nThe Mobil Parties further deny that the Tribunal failed to address Venezuela's argument regarding foreseeability of the expropriation claim. According to the Mobil Parties, the Tribunal acknowledged and dismissed this argument, albeit analyzing it in different terms. The Tribunal was not required to frame its reasoning in the precise language of foreseeability, but the reasoning behind the Tribunal's approach \"was not only clearly articulated but has been endorsed and followed by subsequent Tribunals.\" In particular, the Tribunal's finding that the dispute regarding the expropriation was a \"future dispute\" at the time of the restructuring impliedly concludes that the dispute was not foreseeable at the time.145\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 392-397.\n\n103.\n\nFinally, the Mobil Parties contend that Venezuela's reliance on *Pac Rim* is misplaced because that decision considered the foreseeability of an actual or specific future dispute as opposed to the foreseeability of a potential dispute or a possible controversy. According to the Mobil Parties, the Tribunal's observation that it concurred in the view taken by the *Pac Rim* Tribunal is consistent with its analysis on foreseeability. In particular, the Tribunal's approach is \"\u2018comparable' to that of the *Pac Rim* tribunal because both decisions analyzed when the specific disputes arose in respect of each measure.\"146\n\nRejoinder, para. 111.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAs already indicated, the Applicant, Venezuela, makes three requests for annulment of the Award: the Tribunal's erroneous assumption of jurisdiction (as a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); the Tribunal's refusal, for no adequate reason, to order production of certain documents (as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d)); and the Tribunal's decision not to apply the price cap provisions of the Cerro Negro Project to the assessment of Venezuela's admitted liability to pay compensation (as a combination of manifest excess of power for failure to apply the proper law and failure to state reasons, under Article 52(1)(b) and (e)).\n\n105.\n\nTwo of these three requests can be disposed of without great difficulty, and will be dealt with first. The third, however, raises questions of some difficulty and importance and will therefore form the main focus of this Decision.\n\n*(i) Jurisdiction*\n------------------\n\n106.\n\nIt should be recalled that Venezuela's arguments under this head are directed at the Tribunal's decision to assume jurisdiction both in respect of the Cerro Negro Project and of the La Ceiba Project.\n\n107.\n\nThe burden of Venezuela's complaint under this head is that the corporate re-structuring undertaken by the Mobil Parties in 2005 was for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID under the Netherlands/Venezuela BIT; that it was done in anticipation of litigation; and that there is ample precedent for regarding that combination of circumstances as an abuse of right \"that should have led the tribunal to find that it lacked jurisdiction to hear this case.\"147\n\nApplicant's Memorial, paragraph 168.\n\n108.\n\nThe essence of the Mobil Parties' answer is that an \u2018abuse of right' argument goes to admissibility, not jurisdiction, and is therefore outside the scope of the annulment process, inasmuch as it relates to an issue that is recognized to lie within a tribunal's discretionary assessment. But the Mobil Parties assert also that the restructuring was entirely legitimate (and was found to be so by the Tribunal), and moreover that the Tribunal gave ample attention to Venezuela's contention that the litigation was foreseeable at the time, and gave that contention a reasoned rejection.\n\n109.\n\nVenezuela retorts that the issue is not the legitimacy of the restructuring as such, but rather, given the circumstances under which it was undertaken, whether it was effective to bring the dispute between the Parties within the jurisdictional consent to arbitration under the BIT. To which the Mobil Parties reply that in the arbitral proceedings there was no dispute between the Parties that all of the formal conditions for jurisdiction were satisfied, so that the real issue raised by Venezuela is indeed one of admissibility, not jurisdiction.\n\n110.\n\nThe Committee accepts that there is some force in the argument advanced by Venezuela that matters of jurisdiction may call for a more rigorous approach than other grounds for annulment, simply because a tribunal ought not to be allowed to exercise a judicial power it does not have (or vice versa). The Committee also accepts that there is weight in the Mobil Parties' contention that questions of admissibility may require to be approached in a different way from questions of jurisdiction for the purposes of the annulment scheme laid down in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It is plain on the face of it that the reference in Article 52(1)(b) to a tribunal having \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" fits most naturally into the context of jurisdiction, in the sense that it covers the case where a tribunal exercises a judicial power which on a proper analysis had not been conferred on it (or vice versa declines to exercise a jurisdiction which it did possess). It follows that it is less easy to apply the criterion laid down in Article 52(1)(b) - and in particular when it comes to deciding whether the excess was \u2018manifest' - when what the tribunal is doing is to make a discretionary assessment of whether, assuming the existence of its judicial power in principle, it is proper in the particular circumstances for that power to be exercised.\n\n111.\n\nThe Committee does not, however, have to decide any of these questions. The issue that divides the Parties in these annulment proceedings, as it divided them in the underlying arbitration proceedings, is the extent to which the dispute or disputes that went to arbitration were in fact within the contemplation of the Mobil Parties, as foreign investors in Venezuela, at the time at which the corporate restructuring was undertaken; in other words whether there had been a manipulation of the ownership of an established investment with the express purpose of bringing an already existing dispute within a favourable jurisdictional regime from which it did not benefit at the time the dispute emerged. This is the central question which the Tribunal addressed, and it did so *in extenso*, devoting a full twenty-one paragraphs to the question in its Decision on Jurisdiction;148 the Tribunal had, immediately previous to that, devoted eighteen paragraphs to the law on \u2018abuse of right' including an analysis of the prior case-law before international courts and tribunals and in investment arbitration.149 The outcome of this eleven-page treatment is that the Tribunal adopts, as the basis for its decision on the point, the need \"to give \u2018effect to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention' and to preserve \u2018its integrity'\".150 It finds that \"the main, if not the sole purpose of the restructuring was to protect Mobil investments from adverse Venezuelan measures in getting access to ICSID arbitration through the Dutch-Venezuela BIT\", but that this still remained capable of being either legitimate corporate planning or, alternatively, an abuse of right; which of those two it was, would depend on the circumstances. Having proceeded to consider the circumstances, i.e. those specific to the case, notably the timing of new investment into the Claimants' projects, measured against the timing of the assertion by the Claimants vis-\u00e0-vis Venezuela of the existence of investment disputes, the Tribunal draws a distinction between pre-existing and future disputes, which it then applies so as to include within its jurisdiction Cerro Negro and La Ceiba disputes \"born\" after specified dates, while excluding any dispute \"born\" before those dates.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction of 10 June 2010, paragraphs 186-206.\n\nIbid., paragraphs 167-185.\n\nAt paragraph 184.\n\n112.\n\nThe dispute over jurisdiction then carried itself forward into the merits phase of the arbitral proceedings, in the form of a disagreement between the Parties over which of the complex series of claims by the Claimants against the Respondent in respect of the Cerro Negro Project did or did not fall within the Tribunal's conclusions in its Decision on Jurisdiction. These were in turn analysed in detail by the Tribunal in paragraphs 191-210 of the Award. The analysis culminates in the enunciation of a distinction between \"a potential dispute relating to a measure to be taken\" and on the other hand \"a real dispute concerning a decision already made.\" On the basis of which distinction the Tribunal confirms that it has no jurisdiction over the dispute relating to the increase in income tax, but proceeds to the merits on the dispute in relation to expropriation.151\n\nAward, at paragraph 210.\n\n113.\n\nFor the purposes of the present Decision, the Committee will treat as a composite whole all of these jurisdictional findings, those which appear in the Decision on Jurisdiction and those which appear in the Award, and will apply the provisions of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention accordingly.152\n\nThe Tribunal has itself stated, quite properly, that its Decision on Jurisdiction is to be regarded as an integral part of the Award; see Award, paragraph 15.\n\n*(ii) Excess of power (Article 52(1)(b)*\n----------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nHowever the argument may be put, it seems to the Committee beyond doubt that it has no legitimate power to control the Tribunal's specific findings on either of the two elements in its jurisdictional findings, i.e. either the legal theory which the Tribunal applied in order to distinguish between legitimate corporate planning and abuse of right, or the application of that theory to the particular circumstances of the case. That would amount to appeal, not annulment; on the first point, it would be an appeal on a point of law, on the second point, an appeal on the facts. As the *ad hoc* Committee in the *CMS v. Argentina* annulment proceedings pithily put the matter, \"the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal.\"153\n\n*CMS v. Argentina*, Decision on Annulment of 5 September 2007, at paragraph 158.\n\n115.\n\nThe Committee is thus unable to find that there has been an excess of power by the Tribunal on this issue, let alone a manifest one.\n\n*(iii) Failure to give reasons (Article 52(1)(e)*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe only basis on which, within the accepted limits of the annulment procedure, the Committee could legitimately be asked to intervene would be if it were alleged that the process by which the Tribunal had arrived at one or another of these findings was vitiated by a defect so serious as to invalidate the findings themselves.\n\n117.\n\nThis is indeed the basis on which Venezuela has brought its application invoking Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, namely a failure to state reasons. Although, as set down in that Article, the vitiating factor is the failure by a tribunal to state reasons for its \"award\", it is common ground that that criterion has to be applied *mutatis mutandis* when, as in this case, the challenge is not directed at the eventual decision on the merits itself, but at a finding contained in a decision on preliminary objections, or (again as in this case) largely in a decision on preliminary objections but completed in the final award.\n\n118.\n\nFor the reasons already stated in paragraphs 111 and 112 above, however, the Committee cannot find any substance in the claim that the Tribunal failed to state sufficient reasons in support of the conclusions it had reached either on the point of law or on the question of fact. The Committee has not been able to identify a fault of any kind in the quality or sufficiency of the Tribunal's reasoning on either point to sustain the conclusions the Tribunal ultimately arrived at. To repeat the frequently cited test laid down by the *ad hoc* committee in *MINE v. Guinea*, \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law.\"154 The Committee is in no doubt that the relevant portions of the Decision on Jurisdiction meet that basic test, as do the relevant paragraphs in the Award. All that can remain, therefore, is Venezuela's complaint that the Tribunal's composite decision on jurisdiction suffers from an internal contradiction when it arrives at opposite conclusions in respect of the expropriation claim (found to be within the jurisdiction) and the income tax claim (found to fall outside the jurisdiction).\n\nDecision on Annulment, 22 December 1989, at paragraph 5.09.\n\n119.\n\nFor a complaint of that kind to be valid, two conditions would have to be satisfied: first, that there was indeed a contradiction which was apparent on the face of the Decision; but second, and in the circumstances more important still, that the contradiction, once demonstrated, was serious enough to vitiate the Tribunal's reasoning on jurisdiction as a whole. This latter condition stems from the fact that, when applied mutatis mutandis to a decision on jurisdiction, what Article 52(1)(e) opens to challenge is a failure to state reasons for the decision on jurisdiction as such, not alleged insufficiencies in parts of the reasoning along the way.\n\n120.\n\nThe Committee does not, however, believe that the reasoning of the Tribunal is open to objection under either of those heads.\n\n121.\n\nTo begin with, the notion of a contradiction in its reasoning would have to entail, in the specific circumstances, either that the Tribunal had applied different (and mutually incompatible) legal theories in accepting jurisdiction over one head of claim while rejecting another, or that the Tribunal, even while applying one and the same legal theory, had nevertheless reached opposite assessments of identical or substantially similar sets of facts. The first of these possibilities is however excluded by the plain fact that, in paragraphs 186-205 of its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal can be seen to be applying exactly the same legal theory just enunciated in the preceding paragraph, without exception, to all of the Cerro Negro and La Ceiba claims. Venezuela challenges whether the analysis and application which the Tribunal made in this connection of earlier awards by other tribunals is correct, but - even if it were the case that those awards were binding in law on the Tribunal - a challenge of that kind quite clearly takes on the quality of an appeal on a point of law, which is in turn not an admissible ground for annulment.\n\n122.\n\nConversely, with regard to the factual analysis, what Venezuela asserts is that the Tribunal's holding that the income tax measures which took effect only after the restructuring of both projects were outside its jurisdiction is irreconcilable with its holding that the expropriation, which likewise took place after the restructuring, was within its jurisdiction.155 The essence of the argument raised by Venezuela on this point is that the Tribunal wrongly failed to apply to the expropriation claims the foreseeability test it had applied to the tax claims. The Committee does not however see that this argument is well-founded. It appears clearly from the relevant portion in the Decision on Jurisdiction (at paragraphs 202-204) that the Tribunal made the distinction turn on the difference between pre-existing disputes, notably those that had already been identified by the investors and notified as such to the Respondent, and future disputes, the origin of which lay in measures taken by the Venezuelan authorities after the restructuring which brought the investment under the umbrella of the BIT. In particular, in paragraphs 202203, the Tribunal notes: that by June 2005 there were already pending disputes relating to royalties and income tax in respect of which the investors had actually consented to ICSID arbitration under the Venezuelan Investment Law; that their parallel consent for any future disputes was expressly made \u2018out of an abundance of caution' and explicitly in connection with possible future expropriation or confiscation; and that the nationalization measures happened only from January 2007 onwards.\n\nParagraph 65 above.\n\n123.\n\nThe key passage in paragraph 203 of the Decision contrasts \u2018already pending disputes' with disputes based on measures still to be taken later on. The Committee can find no contradiction, let alone a manifest contradiction, between this finding and the finding in paragraph 210 of the Award (dealing with the tax disputes), which makes the Tribunal's decision turn on whether the disagreement was a \u2018potential dispute,' or alternatively a \u2018real dispute concerning a decision already made.' The assessment of the facts, and specifically the assessment of whether the facts showed the difference to be in fact a \u2018potential dispute,' or alternatively a \u2018real dispute concerning a decision already made,' was a matter within the authority of the Tribunal, and the Committee cannot find that there was anything in the way this was done that might justify intervention within the framework of the annulment process.\n\n124.\n\nThis ground for annulment is accordingly rejected.\n\n*(iv) Document production*\n--------------------------\n\n125.\n\nVenezuela's submission under the head of document production can be disposed of even more shortly.\n\n126.\n\nThe object of Venezuela's complaint is a decision by the Tribunal on March 24, 2011 in which it denied the Respondent's application for an order for the production of documents that had been lodged a month earlier. The Tribunal's decision had been preceded by a double round of exchanges between the Parties (application - reply - observations on reply - comments on observations), but the Tribunal's lapidary decision is in two sentences, one sentence stating that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the documents requested are \"necessary as required under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 34(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\" and the next that the application is therefore denied. Venezuela says that this represented a further sanctionable failure to state reasons, a manifest excess of powers, and in addition constituted a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee shares to a certain extent Venezuela's sense of surprise at the cursory nature of the Tribunal's decision. It might perhaps have been desirable for the Tribunal, having once allowed the sequential exchanges between the Parties described above, to have said a little more about why it was declining to accede to the application. That is however an aspect on which it would be rash to pronounce without a full investigation of the content of the exchanges and the elements of the developing argument in the arbitral proceedings to which the Respondent's request for production related, and an investigation of that kind lies plainly beyond the functions of an *ad hoc* annulment committee. It could also be said that the Tribunal was a little imprecise in choosing to couch the decision in terms of a failure by the Respondent to demonstrate necessity; in fact, the provisions both of the Convention and of the Arbitration Rules cited leave little room for doubt that what these provisions establish is not a right or duty inhering in one or other party but rather a power conferred on the tribunal itself. What both Convention and Rules say is that a tribunal \"may,\" \"if it deems necessary,\" call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence. The use of the verb \u2018may' shows in itself that we are in the presence of a power to be exercised by the tribunal at its own discretion, and this is then redoubled by the express indication that the tribunal is to be the sole judge of necessity. That said, the Committee can find no warrant for saying that the exercise of that discretion is subject to control through the annulment procedure on the basis simply that the tribunal has not offered sufficiently ample reasons for how it has chosen to exercise its discretion.\n\n128.\n\nVenezuela has in addition argued that the Tribunal's rejection of the document production request represents a \u2018manifest excess of powers for failure to apply applicable law,' which it justifies on the basis that the Tribunal must have failed to apply the standard of \u2018necessity' laid down in other arbitral decisions, but the Committee can find no substance in this argument at all, which is on the one hand inconsistent with the discretionary power vested in a tribunal, and (even if not) would be tantamount to a straightforward appeal against the Tribunal's decision.\n\n129.\n\nIt remains then to consider whether the Tribunal's refusal to order production of the requested documents can be impugned as a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee notes at the outset that the bar is set high; the rule of procedure must be a \u2018fundamental' one, and the departure from it must in addition be a \u2018serious' one. This is common ground between the Parties on both sides.156 Venezuela rests the substance of its argument on the submission that the denial of the particular documents adversely affected its right to be heard and the associated requirement that a party be given a full opportunity to present its case, which it says are unanimously recognized as basic and fundamental elements of fair arbitral procedure.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties, either, that refusals to compel production of documents have been accepted as the ground for annulment in no more than a very small number of cases; cf. ICSID Secretariat Background Paper on Annulment (updated version, May 2016), paragraph 101.\n\n130.\n\nThe Committee agrees that the right of a party to be heard and the full opportunity to present its case, whether taken singly or in combination, fall squarely within the category of what Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention refers to as a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure'. The Committee will therefore examine whether there was \u2018a serious departure from' that right (or those rights) as a result of the Tribunal's denial of Venezuela's request to order production of the particular documents in question.\n\n131.\n\nThe Committee notes in this connection that the documents Venezuela sought were \u2018presentations that relate to the legal and financial aspects of the Cerro Negro Project referred to by [one of the witnesses in the parallel ICC arbitration]'; and on the other hand \u2018presentations and similar documents prepared by or for Mobil or its subsidiaries or affiliates... during the period prior to the execution of the Cerro Negro Association Agreement that relate to the contractual and financial aspects of the Cerro Negro Project.'157 The Committee notes further that the Mobil Parties' response was that this represented a fishing expedition, that the requests covered a broad category of documents that were irrelevant and immaterial, and the documents were in any case unnecessary for the resolution of the case.158 They particularly argued in further support that the request was based on a confusion of the treaty claims under litigation in the arbitration with the contract claims being heard in the parallel ICC arbitration.159\n\nSee Memorial, paragraph 76.\n\nCited *ibid.*, paragraph 77. See also Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 295 ff.\n\n*ibid.*\n\n132.\n\nThe point for decision by the *ad hoc* Committee in these proceedings is not, however, whether either side was right or wrong in these arguments, or indeed whether the Tribunal was right or wrong in accepting one set of arguments or the other, whether as a matter of law or as a matter of discretionary assessment. That, once again, would constitute appeal. The only aspect properly for consideration by the Committee is the possible effect of the Tribunal's refusal to order disclosure. Specifically, did that refusal infringe Venezuela's right to be heard, or did it at least deny Venezuela a full opportunity to present its case?\n\n133.\n\nThe Committee considers the first of these two contentions to be unsustainable. In the limited number of prior cases in which *ad hoc* committees have given serious consideration to the contention that a party has been denied the right to be heard, it has been on the basis that a tribunal reached its ultimate award on a ground that one or both parties had had no opportunity to address at all in its argument. The Committee can see no sign whatever in the text of the Award itself, nor in the submissions of either side in these proceedings, that the grounds for the Tribunal's findings on the merits in its Award had not been fully and amply argued by the Parties, both in writing and orally.\n\n134.\n\nAs to the second contention, namely that, by reason of the refusal to order disclosure of these documents, Venezuela had been denied a full opportunity to present its case, the Committee concludes that the answer lies in Venezuela's own written submissions. At paragraph 151 of its Memorial in the present annulment proceedings, Venezuela asserts that \"To the extent that the tribunal considered that it did not have sufficient evidence of the special conditions under which the Cerro Negro Project was authorized - although, as reviewed earlier, the record is quite clear on that point - those documents would have had a significant and material impact on the tribunal's determination as to the relevance of the price cap...\"160 And further on, that \"The record is replete with documents and testimony that prove the contrary and is devoid of any evidence to support the Mobil Parties' revisionist history, but if the tribunal had any doubt about that, which was not expressed in - and is even contradicted by - its recitation of the facts, clearly the presentations prepared by the Mobil Parties to explain the terms and conditions of the Cerro Negro Project to their own executive committee would have shed light on their understanding.\"161\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 157 (emphasis added).\n\n135.\n\nIn the light of those avowals by the Applicant itself, the Committee is clear that the contention that the Applicant was denied a full opportunity to present its case is without merit and the request for annulment on this ground cannot therefore be accepted.\n\n136.\n\nThe first and second of Venezuela's requests for annulment are accordingly rejected.\n\n*(v) \u2018The Price Cap'*162\n------------------------\n\nThe Committee has adopted this descriptor from the Applicant's submissions as a useful form of shorthand; the quotation marks signal, however, that the phrase is not regarded by the Committee as an entirely accurate reflection of the nature of the issue that had been placed before it in these proceedings.\n\n137.\n\nThe Committee proceeds then to consider the third request for annulment, the one which has given the Committee the greatest difficulty and has assumed the greatest importance in the case, namely Venezuela's challenge to what it considers to be the Tribunal's flawed approach to the assessment of compensation for expropriation. It should be recalled that this ground relates exclusively to the Cerro Negro Project, not the La Ceiba Project, and that the request is therefore, by definition, for an annulment of the Award in part only. That is expressly foreseen in Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee associates itself with the views of other *ad hoc* committees that a request for the partial annulment of an award can relate, in appropriate cases, to limited portions of an Award only. There was no dispute before it between the Parties on this point.\n\n138.\n\nThe Committee notes, by way of preliminary, that it is not in dispute, and never has been, that the Cerro Negro Project was expropriated by Venezuela in 2007. Nor has Venezuela ever denied that this expropriation carried with it an obligation to pay compensation. The essence of the dispute between the Parties is over the nature and magnitude of the compensation due.\n\n139.\n\nIt will be recalled that Venezuela asserts as Applicant that those parts of the Award dealing with Venezuela's liability to pay compensation in respect of the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project should be annulled because of the Tribunal's failure, in the Award, to give due effect to certain legal provisions applicable to the Project. The specific reference is, in the first instance, to \u2018the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization' (i.e. the formal decision by which the Venezuelan legislature approved the Project, as required by Venezuelan law), and, in the second instance, to \u2018the Cerro Negro Association Agreement' (i.e. the contractual agreement under which the Mobil Parties and the Venezuelan State entity Lagoven entered into and undertook the Project). More specifically still, the Cerro Negro Association Agreement required the parties to that Agreement to carry out the Project \"under the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the requirements set forth in [the Venezuelan nationalization law of 1975] and the Conditions\"; and the Conditions are defined in terms as those set forth in the decision of 2 October 1997 by which the Venezuelan Congress approved the Agreement and authorized Lagoven to enter into it (\u2018the Cerro Negro Congressional Authorization').\n\n140.\n\nOne particular consequence of this general scheme was that the terms of the Association Agreement reflected specifically what are known as the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Congressional Authorization. The Eighteenth Condition was to the effect that neither the Association Agreement nor activities and operations conducted under it was to impose any obligation on the Republic of Venezuela nor restrict its sovereign powers. This was duly reflected in the Agreement, in the form of an additional paragraph appended to the clause which provides for the settlement of disputes by arbitration (Clause 18).163 This additional paragraph has figured largely in Venezuela's argument in these annulment proceedings, but the Committee has found it of only limited relevance to the essential issue, as will appear below. What the Twentieth Condition required, on the other hand, was that the Agreement should contain provisions for either the renegotiation of its terms or, failing that, for compensation, in the event of \"adverse and significant economic consequences\" arising out of what are described in neutral terms as \u2018discriminatory measures'; but this is made subject to the proviso that there should not be deemed to be an adverse and significant economic consequence of this kind at any time when the price of crude oil was higher than a specified threshold. This was in its turn reflected, in a somewhat elaborated form, in Clause 15 of the Agreement, under the title \u2018Consequences of Certain Governmental Actions'. The Tribunal, in paragraph 51(4) of its Award, refers to this as a \"limitation of liability.\" That is also the way in which Venezuela, as Respondent in the Arbitration, pleaded its case. Its case was that the expropriation of Cerro Negro was lawful under the BIT; that the compensation for it was to be calculated in accordance with the BIT and assessed as of June 2007; and that the compensation due was to be limited by \"the amount of compensation to be granted for adverse governmental action specifically negotiated and agreed at the outset of the Cerro Negro Project as an express condition of the Project's authorization by Congress.\"164\n\nThe provisions of the Association Agreement are referred to variously in the exhibits and memorials as \u2018Articles' and \u2018Clauses' and are numbered variously in Roman and Arabic numerals. The Committee will follow the usage in the Award of the terminology \u2018Clause' with Arabic numbering.\n\nSee paras. 144-145 of the Award.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal, for its part, upheld the Respondent's contention that the expropriation was lawful. It relied specifically on the facts that the expropriation took place as a result of laws enacted by the National Assembly and executive decisions, and that these latter allowed for negotiation, with nationalization following only if negotiation failed, a process which the Tribunal found to be \"compatible with the due process obligation of Article 6 of the BIT.\"165 Moreover, the failure to reach agreement on the quantum of compensation did not of itself, the Tribunal held, render the expropriation unlawful, so long as the offer of compensation made was not unreasonable.166 The compensation due to the foreign investors was accordingly, the Tribunal held, to be \"calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\"167 This is, in the *ad hoc* Committee's view, a key finding, to which it will therefore revert in several places in this Decision.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 297.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 301: \". the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself render an expropriation unlawful. An offer of compensation may have been made to the investor and, in such a case, the legality of the expropriation will depend on the terms of that offer.\"\n\n*Ibid*., para. 306: \"In light of the above, the claim that the expropriation was unlawful is rejected. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not need to consider the standard for compensation in case of unlawful expropriation or whether it would differ from the standard for compensation to be paid in case of lawful expropriation. The compensation must be calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\"\n\n142.\n\nIt should be noted that Article 6(c) calls for the payment of \"just compensation.\"168 Article 6(c) also provides that the compensation must represent \"the market value of the investments affected.\"169 The Parties were, so it seems from the Award, in agreement before the Tribunal that these parameters required the application of a discounted cash flow approach. Having considered the elements necessary for such an approach, i.e. production volume, future revenues, taxes, operational and investment costs, and having determined the appropriate discount rate to apply, the Tribunal then turned, in Section VIII.C.3 of its Award,170 to consider the effect of what it termed the \u2018Price Cap' under the Twentieth Condition of the Congressional Authorization and Clause 15 of the Association Agreement (see above), in the light of the Respondent's contention that compensation had to be limited in accordance with the Price Cap. The Claimants contested this, contending for their part that the Price Cap was not applicable to the case in hand, as their claims were treaty claims under the BIT not contractual claims under the Association Agreement, and Venezuela, the Respondent in the Arbitration, was not in any case itself party to the Agreement. Venezuela's answer was that it was not seeking contractual enforcement of the Association Agreement, but rather seeking to have respected the terms and conditions under which the Cerro Negro Project had been authorized in the first place. Venezuela submitted further that any prospective purchaser of Mobil Cerro Negro's investment would have taken the Price Cap into account in placing a value on it.171\n\n\u2018justa compensaci\u00f3n' in the authentic Spanish-language text. In its argument before the Committee Venezuela has used the form \u2018equitable compensation;' the Committee considers the two terms to be equivalent in their meaning, but prefers to use the terminology of the BIT itself.\n\nEither as at the moment immediately before the measures were taken or before they became known (whichever was the earlier).\n\nAt paras. 369 ff.\n\n*Ibid.*, at para. 370.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal deals with the matter quite briefly in paragraphs 371-374 of the Award. Paragraphs 371 and 372 recite the content of the Price Cap and place it alongside the provisions in Clause 15 of the Agreement that confer on the foreign investors a separate right to contractual arbitration against Lagoven, the Venezuelan party to the Association Agreement, coupled with an obligation to pursue whatever legal recourse may be available to mitigate any damages suffered by them as a result of the \u2018discriminatory measures' (see paragraph 140 above) and thereafter to bring into account in relation to Lagoven any net benefit received from legal action of that kind. Paragraph 373 of the Award then states -\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that the Twentieth condition of the Congressional Authorization does not impose a specific price cap, but provides for a price cap to be established in the Association Agreement. In the present case, Clause 15(1) of the Association Agreement makes a clear distinction between the action that the Foreign Party may initiate against Lagoven CN on the one hand, and the action that it may initiate against the Government on the other. The price cap contained in Clause 15(2)(a) is applicable only to the compensation payable by Lagoven CN. Since the Respondent in this proceeding is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, not Lagoven CN, the Tribunal concludes that it may not oppose this price cap to the Claimants.\"\n\nThe Tribunal finally draws from this the conclusion (paragraph 374) that the assessment it had arrived at of the compensation due remains unaffected by the Price Cap.\n\n144.\n\nThe findings in these two paragraphs, particularly paragraph 373, which represented in effect the acceptance of the Claimants' case and the rejection of that of the Respondent, have caused the Committee some considerable difficulty and will be considered in greater detail below.\n\n145.\n\nIt should however be noted at this stage that these findings led to a question as to the possibility of double recovery, in the light of the provision in Clause 15 referred to above under which the foreign investors were to bring into account in relation to Lagoven the benefits received out of pursuing their alternative remedy (sc. under the BIT) against the Government of Venezuela. The particular awkwardness lay in the fact that the parallel cause of action against Lagoven under the Association Agreement had already been pursued to its conclusion in an ICC arbitration, and had led to a very substantial award of compensation to one of the Mobil claimants in the present BIT arbitration, precisely in respect of the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project; and the award had indeed already been paid.172\n\nSee Award, para. 379.\n\n146.\n\nThe Mobil Parties have made much in these proceedings of this requirement to pursue independent remedies against adverse governmental measures, and of the fact that such remedies would seem, under Clause 15 of the Agreement, to have a priority of some kind.173 However that may be, it is not clear what bearing it might have on the proceedings for annulment. It appears to the Committee that Venezuela's arguments as to the effect of the Price Cap would have had just as much, or just as little, relevance to the question of the quantum of compensation under the BIT had there been no prior award in the ICC proceedings, or for that matter no ICC proceedings at all. The only connection between the two came about because the Tribunal found itself in a situation in which, whatever sequence of time might have been foreseen by those drafting Section 15, the actual sequence in time was that the ICC arbitration had been completed before the present Arbitration had been finally argued, and because the Respondent (Venezuela) thereupon submitted that the ICC award put an end to the entire dispute. These circumstances inevitably raised a question in the Tribunal's mind as to whether there might be a possibility of double recovery.\n\nCounsel referred to it, in the oral hearing, as a \u2018condition precedent' (Transcript, Day 2, pp.343-344).\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal deals with this matter (once again briefly) in Section VIII.C.5 of the Award, in which, having recalled the general principle of no *enrichissement sans cause* and recited the specific contractual provisions against it, the Tribunal notes an express statement made by the Claimants during the proceedings (which the Tribunal says it has no reason to doubt) that, in the event of an award in their favour in the ICSID proceedings, they were willing to make the required reimbursement to PDVSA (the parent body of Lagoven). The Tribunal concludes as follows, in paragraph 381: \"Effectively, the total compensation payable to the Claimants is the amount specified in paragraph 374 above, less the amount already received by the Claimants under the ICC Award for the same damage. Double recovery will thus be avoided.\" Linked to this is point (e) in the dispositive part of the Award, in which the Tribunal \"takes note... of the Claimants' representation that, in the event of favourable award, the Claimants are willing to make the required reimbursements to PDVSA. Double recovery will thus be avoided.\"\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee did its utmost to understand exactly what the Tribunal might have been intending to convey through these passages. Even after having sought the assistance of the Parties in this endeavour, the Committee remains in a state of some uncertainty. Fortunately, however, in view of what follows, the matter turns out to be immaterial to the Committee's decision on the request for annulment, and the Committee sees no need to pursue it further, on the basis that the avoidance of double recovery is, in its essence, an adjustment that might arise *ex post facto* (as the paragraphs cited above seem to imply), whereas the question raised in these annulment proceedings is one going to the basis for the assessment of the compensation due in the first place. The Committee notes simply that the conclusion is however irresistible that the Tribunal saw in its mind some sort of necessary connection, however unspecific, between the contractual liability (already met) and the compensation still to be assessed in the BIT Arbitration.\n\n149.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that, in a separate section of its Award,174 the Tribunal addresses directly what it calls \"Effects of the ICC Arbitration,\" and that (as paragraph 215 of the Award indicates) this was a question which the Tribunal had itself raised with the Parties. In crude terms, the Claimants' position was \u2018no effect at all,' and the Respondent's \u2018full effect' (i.e. that nothing remained over for decision in the BIT arbitration). The remaining paragraphs in this section of the Award are devoted to the Tribunal's reasons for rejecting the Respondent's contention. The Tribunal points out in particular that there was no identity of parties: the State was not party to the ICC arbitration, nor was Lagoven, the respondent in the ICC proceedings, party to the BIT Arbitration. The Tribunal does, however, go on to note (in paragraph 218) that the Association Agreement limits the compensation due from PDVSA, a limitation reflected in the amount awarded by the ICC tribunal, and then adds \"No such limitation applies, however, to the State's responsibility under the BIT;\" and it gives as the reasons for this that the Government of Venezuela was \"neither a party to the Association Agreement nor a third-party beneficiary,\" and that Venezuela had not \"advanced any relevant argument that the limitations on... contractual liability under Clause 15 should be transmuted into limitations of the State's responsibility under international law.\" The Section concludes with a forward reference to the Section of the Award dealing with quantum, to which the Committee will turn below.\n\nAward, paragraphs 215-219.\n\n150.\n\nBefore the quantum Section, however, a further relevant passage occurs at the conclusion of the Section of the Award dealing with the applicable law. Its relevance is that it, too, deals with the question of the applicability of the Price Cap, as a matter of law, to the assessment of liability and compensation. After stating its disagreement with Venezuela's argument that the Cerro Negro Conditions \"import the contractual limitations to PDVSA-CN's indemnity obligations under Clause 15 of the CNAA into the State's responsibility for breach of the Treaty,\" the Tribunal concludes as follows, in paragraph 225 -\n\n\"The Tribunal recalls that it is a fundamental principle of international law that \"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\" Under this principle, international obligations arising from a treaty cannot be discarded on the grounds of national law. Among the legal systems on which the Award \"shall be based\" pursuant to Article 9(5) of the Treaty, the Tribunal has no doubt in concluding that this issue must be governed by international law. Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty or under customary international law. Bearing this in mind, the Tribunal has considered the effect of the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions in the section on quantum below.\"\n\nAs can be seen from the final sentence, the Tribunal's conclusion on this point, too, is directly linked to its subsequent discussion of the quantum of compensation, and it is all these portions of the Award taken together that form the kernel of the question which the Committee has before it for decision.\n\n151.\n\nVenezuela has raised in the present proceedings various challenges to these linked portions of the Award. The Committee summarizes them as follows. Venezuela submits: (a) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by applying the wrong law to the assessment of the compensation due for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro investments; (b) that the Tribunal failed altogether to address itself to the prior question of the determination of the nature of the rights constituting the Cerro Negro investments, as a precondition to their evaluation, and thereby failed to support with adequate reasons a central element in its findings; (c) that the Tribunal gave no sufficient reasons, or alternatively contradictory reasons, for disregarding the compensation structure laid down by the Congressional Authorization and then in the Association Agreement; (d) that, in acting as above, the Tribunal failed to address at all some of the Respondent's central arguments.\n\n152.\n\nThe Committee will not follow in its entirety the way in which the material has been addressed by either Venezuela or the Mobil Parties in argument before it, but will make its own analysis of the material in the manner it finds most appropriate and most convenient, under the following headings: (1) the applicable law; (2) the relevant international law; (3) the relevant national law; (4) the implications of the above for the assessment of compensation; (5) the quality of the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\na) The applicable law\n---------------------\n\n153.\n\nAs is well known, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires a tribunal to decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the tribunal is to apply the law of the respondent State \"and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The latter dispensation extends, however, only to a case where the parties have not themselves settled the applicable law. Where the parties have done so, the provisions of the second sentence in Article 42(1) are displaced.\n\n154.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties have indeed agreed on the applicable law, via Article 9(5) of the BIT. The provisions of Article 9(5) bind Venezuela directly, as a Contracting Party to the BIT, and it is settled law that a foreign investor, when accepting a State's standing offer to arbitrate under a BIT, likewise accepts, as an element of that offer, such provisions as to applicable law as are contained in the BIT. Article 9(5) thus represents, for this Arbitration, \u2018the rules of law agreed by the parties.' This is made crystal-clear by the terms of the Article itself, which states that the arbitral award \"shall be based on\" and then goes on to provide as follows:\n\n\"i. the law of the Contracting Party concerned;\n\nii. the provisions of this Agreement and other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties;\n\niii. the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments;\n\niv. the general principles of international law; and\n\nv. such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties to the dispute.\"\n\nBeyond that, the Article gives no indication as to a hierarchy or order of priority between these various sources of law, except to the extent that the conjunctive \"and\" implies that several, or indeed all, of these sources of law may come into play in the circumstances of a particular dispute.\n\n155.\n\nThese factors are duly reflected by the Tribunal in Section VI (Applicable Law) of the Award, at paragraphs 220-225. In paragraph 223 (the terms of which are set out in full in the footnote below),175 the Tribunal determines that it will apply the BIT as well as the other agreed sources of law \"where appropriate.\"176 It observes that Article 9(5) does not itself allocate individual matters to particular sources of law, so that the determination remains one for the Tribunal itself to make. The Tribunal does so however in terms which are not altogether easy to understand, when it states that the determination it will make is \"whether an issue is subject to national or international law.\" The penumbra of uncertainty as to exactly what the Tribunal has in mind by the two categories - apparently mutually exclusive and exhaustive - of \u2018national law' and \u2018international law' is then further obscured by the next following sentence, in which the Tribunal says that it will be determined, issue by issue, \"whether the applicable international law should be limited to general principles of international law under Article 9(5) of the BIT or whether it includes customary international l aw.\"177\n\n\" Accordingly, the Tribunal will apply the BIT and the other agreed sources of law where appropriate. Article 9(5) of the Treaty does not allocate matters to any of those laws. Accordingly, it is for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or international law. Further, if and when an issue arises, the Tribunal will determine whether the applicable international law should be limited to general principles of international law under Article 9(5) of the BIT or whether it includes customary international law. Moreover, with respect to the interpretation of the BIT, the Tribunal will resort to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which both States have ratified, as a \"relevant Agreement between the Contracting Parties\".\" Award, para. 223.\n\nIt is not entirely clear from the grammar whether this qualifying phrase (with its necessary implication that a particular source might or might not be applied, according to circumstances) attaches itself only to the \u2018other agreed sources' or to the BIT as well. The Committee interprets it as applying primarily to the other sources, i.e. that the Tribunal's intention was that the provisions of the BIT should always be applied whenever they were in point.\n\nFurther potential confusion arises out of the use in this sentence of the Award in English of one verb in the conditional (\u2018should be limited') while the next is in the indicative (\u2018includes').\n\n156.\n\nThe main question is of course where this binary categorization leaves the BIT itself, and what implications that might have for the application of the provisions of the BIT to the merits of the dispute. The particular importance of this question, for the purposes of these annulment proceedings, is the finding by the Tribunal that comes a short while later on, in paragraph 225. Paragraphs 224 and 225 read as follows:\n\n224. Article 9(5) of the Dutch Treaty quoted above includes \"the law of the Contracting Party\" and \"the provisions of special agreements relating to the investments\" among the sources of applicable law. In reliance on these provisions, the Respondent appears to argue that the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions (i) relieve the Republic from its obligation to comply with the standards set forth in the Treaty, and/or (ii) import the contractual limitations to PDVSA-CN's indemnity obligations under Clause 15 of the CNAA into the State's responsibility for breach of the Treaty\".\n\n225. The Tribunal disagrees with this position. The Tribunal recalls that it is a fundamental principle of international law that \"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\" Under this principle, international obligations arising from a treaty cannot be discarded on the grounds of national law. Among the legal systems on which the Award \"shall be based\" pursuant to Article 9(5) of the Treaty, the Tribunal has no doubt in concluding that this issue must be governed by international law. Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty or under customary international law. Bearing this in mind, the Tribunal has considered the effect of the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions of the Cerro Negro Framework of Conditions in the section on quantum below.\"\n\n157.\n\nHere the Tribunal does make a specific determination of applicable law which, as the Committee reads matters, came to assume cardinal importance in the determination of the Cerro Negro dispute. The determination, however, like the passages cited above, is in itself less than entirely clear: \"Among the legal systems on which the Award \"shall be based\" pursuant to Article 9(5) of the Treaty, the Tribunal has no doubt in concluding that this issue must be governed by international law.\" Judging from the sentence that follows: \"Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty or under customary international law,\" and from the way in which the Tribunal describes the Respondent's argument in paragraph 224, what the Tribunal has in mind by \u2018this issue' would appear to be the effect of the Congressional Authorization and the terms of the Association Agreement on the assessment of the compensation due under the BIT. The Committee puts the matter in this contingent way because, despite the central importance of the point at issue, the Tribunal does not itself explain the point with any great clarity; moreover, as will be shown below, the two intrusive references to \"customary international law\" are the source of still further uncertainty.178\n\nSee further paragraph 159 below.\n\n158.\n\nWhat significance should be attached to the above will be discussed below. For the moment, it suffices to note that the only reasoning offered for this key finding is that in the two preceding sentences of paragraph 225 (see above). In these two sentences the Tribunal invokes, in two different wordings, the basic principle of international law that the state of a party's internal law cannot be advanced as valid justification for its failure to perform a treaty or, as in the second sentence, \u2018discarding on the grounds of national law international obligations arising from a treaty'. The Committee will also discuss further below how far this was in fact the issue in dispute between the Parties in the arbitral proceedings.\n\nb) The relevant international law\n---------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nAs will appear from the above, the exclusive sources of law for the determination of the dispute brought to arbitration are those listed in extenso in Article 9(5) of the BIT and are set out in paragraph 154 above. The listing contains two references to international law, one implicit, one explicit. The explicit reference, in sub-paragraph iv, is to \"the general principles of international law\" and is presumably to be understood as pointing in turn to one of the sources of law enumerated in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The implicit reference to international law is that in sub-paragraph ii to \"the provisions of this Agreement\" i.e. to the BIT itself which, as an inter-State treaty, must necessarily be taken to constitute international law.179 It is the Tribunal which makes its own addition to the Treaty list by adding in a mention of customary international law in paragraph 223 (\"if and when an issue arises, the Tribunal will determine whether the applicable international law should be limited to general principles of international law under Article 9(5) of the BIT or whether it includes customary international law\"), and reserving to itself the decision from case to case to \"determine whether the applicable international law should be limited to general principles of international law under Article 9(5) of the BIT or whether it includes customary international law.\" But the Tribunal gives no indication of where it derives the authority to make what looks like a modification - or indeed an expansion180 - of the source rules laid down in the Article, nor does the Tribunal state what criterion it has in mind to use in order to decide (when the case arises) whether or not to \u2018include customary international law.' The significance of this for the Tribunal's Award will also be considered further below.\n\nThe sub-paragraph refers also to \u2018other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties,' but it would seem that none such were advanced in argument in the arbitration.\n\nIn Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute, the sub-paragraph referring to \u2018international custom' stands separate and distinct from the sub-paragraph referring to \u2018general principles.'\n\n160.\n\nAn important and direct determination of applicable law does, however, appear somewhat later in the Award, at paragraph 306, in which the Tribunal rejects the Mobil Parties' claim that the expropriation was unlawful. It draws as the conclusion from this that \"The compensation must be calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\" As already indicated, the *ad hoc* Committee regards this as a key finding in the Award. There is no express reference to its being a choice of law determination under Article 9(5), or a determination in pursuit of what the Tribunal had already decided in this respect in the Section of the Award on \u2018Applicable Law' (paragraphs 153-155 above). But such an express reference was hardly necessary. The sentence appears immediately before Section VIII.C of the Award, in which the Tribunal deals with the \u2018Quantum of the Expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project,' and which opens with a description of the requirements in this regard laid down by Article 6 of the BIT: \u2018just compensation' and \u2018market value.' The manner in which the Tribunal followed through on this central determination of the applicable law will also be considered further below in the section entitled \"The implications for the assessment of compensation\".\n\nc) The relevant national law\n----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAs the Committee has already noted, perhaps the most troublesome finding of the Tribunal, for the purposes of these annulment proceedings, is its determination in paragraph 225 of the Award set out in paragraph 150 above. In crude terms, the Tribunal here decides that national (internal) law may not be invoked to avoid international obligations, whether arising under treaty or otherwise. The general principle is indeed a fundamental one, and its application in respect of treaties is universally accepted,181 as it is more generally.182 The examples commonly given are those of an attempt *ex post facto* to override an established treaty obligation or other international obligation, or the case in which a State had failed to ensure, at the time of entering into a treaty, that its internal law was adequate to enable the treaty to be given full effect. The copious authorities listed by the International Law Commission in 2001 are all of that kind.183 They typically involve the provisions of written legislation or the national Constitution. Less clear, however, is precisely what, in this specific context, the Tribunal had in mind as \u2018national law.' The treatment in the Award of the Congressional Conditions establishes that, in the judgement of the Tribunal, the approval given by the Venezuelan Congress was approval of the proposed terms of the Association Agreement, and the Agreement, in turn, incorporated the conditions for that approval that had been laid down by the Congress in advance. The Mobil Parties themselves made much, in their argument before the Committee in these proceedings, of the fact that the intervention of the Congress merely confirmed what had been negotiated at length and agreed between the investors and PDVSA. But the Committee is hard put to see how this helps their case; it establishes only that the Congressional action, far from being a unilateral imposition contrary to the intentions or expectations of the foreign investors, was in fact in harmony with their intentions and expectations and served the purpose of putting these into legal effect at the time the investment was entered into. It does not therefore serve to explain why the limited legislative intervention which took place ought to be regarded as equivalent in character or effect to an attempt to override international obligations by the invocation of national law.\n\nSee article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 (\"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty....\").\n\nSee Article 3 of the ILC's Draft article on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001.\n\nSee the Commentary to the ILC Draft Articles.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding on this point is not altogether easy to follow. That the Tribunal sets aside the terms of the Association Agreement (based as they were on the Congressional Conditions) as directly binding on Venezuela for the purposes of the arbitral proceedings is understandable enough if it should be taken as another way of saying that the governing law for the assessment of compensation was the BIT. The finding in paragraph 225, however, presupposes the existence of a conflict of some kind between Venezuela's internal law and its international obligations, and it is both the nature of that \u2018internal law' which the Tribunal had in mind and the nature of the supposed conflict which trouble the Committee. On the one hand, it appears to the Committee that at no stage has Venezuela sought to invoke any provision of its internal law as standing in the way of paying compensation for the expropriation as required by the BIT; as indicated above, the obligation to pay compensation has always been acknowledged, and the Tribunal finds expressly that the expropriation was not in itself unlawful or in breach of Venezuela's treaty obligations. By the same token, on the other hand, the Tribunal expressly finds that the offer of compensation did not in itself render the underlying expropriation a breach of the BIT - and this must carry with it the consequence that the Tribunal considered that the offer made, based as it was on the Congressional Conditions and Association Agreement, was not incompatible with the Treaty. The Tribunal says specifically that it \"finds that the evidence submitted does not demonstrate that the proposals made by Venezuela were incompatible with the requirement of \u2018just' compensation of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\"184 If that is so, however, it becomes very hard to see in what way the invocation of the Congressional Conditions and Association Agreement can have been thought to be equivalent to an attempt to make the provisions of Venezuelan law prevail over Venezuela's international obligations. For that reason alone, the Committee will approach with caution any suggestion that the exclusion of the Congressional Conditions and Association Agreement as in themselves determinative of the question of the quantum of compensation also made the Price Cap irrelevant to the determination of the quantum by other means, i.e. those provided for in the BIT.\n\nAward, paragraph 305.\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee notes also that a part of the Mobil Parties' case is based on the concept that the intention and effect of the contractual obligations under the Association Agreement was to provide for a partial (because price-capped) compensation from Lagoven or PDVSA, on top of the unrestricted compensation that would be due from the State, with the overlap being taken care of by the mechanism in Clause 15 for the avoidance of double recovery. The Committee has no need to decide the point, and observes merely that a structure of that kind is not readily reconcilable with the actual terms of Clause 15, which both foresees that action against the State would happen first in time and specifies that its aim would be \"mitigation\" of the liability of Lagoven/PDVSA, not vice versa. Much the same applies to the Mobil Parties' case - in large measure accepted by the Tribunal - that, even if Clause 15 should properly be viewed as a contractual \u2018limitation of liability,' this did not enure to the benefit of Venezuela, since the Association Agreement was *res inter alios acta*, or (in the terms in which the argument was put) Venezuela was not a \u2018third party beneficiary' of Clause 15. While the Committee can understand the point behind the argument, it does not find - for the reasons set out below -that the argument is germane to the real point at issue in the Arbitration, namely what exactly was the investment that had been expropriated and how was it to be valued for compensation purposes.\n\nd) The implications for the assessment of compensation\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nAs described above, a key finding by the Tribunal was that the compensation due to the Mobil Parties had to be assessed in accordance with Article 6(c) of the BIT which lays down as the applicable standard that of \u2018just compensation' (*justa compensaci\u00f3n* in the Spanish). The requirements of Article 6(c) (paragraph 142 above) are set out in full in paragraph 307 of the Award, and begin the Section on the Quantum of the Expropriation. No doubt partly as a result of the fact that there was no disagreement between the Parties that a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach was the right one to use (paragraph 308 of the Award), there is next to no analysis to be found in the Award of what else might be required by way of interpretation of Article 6(c) as the basis for its proper application. The overwhelming part of the discussion, as already indicated, is devoted to the detailed practical application of the DCF technique to the particular circumstances of the case. The analysis takes up nearly 60 paragraphs of the Award, and culminates in paragraph 368 with the determination of a net cash flow figure of US$ 1,411.7 million, which then becomes in due course the liability figure in (d) of the dispositive part of the Award at paragraph 404. There is no other discussion of a general kind as to what factors or elements might have to be taken into account in order to arrive at what Article 6(c) requires by way of \"the market value of the investments affected immediately before the measures were taken or the impending measure became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier.\" The sole exception is a brief discussion at paragraph 365 of the question of the timing of the evaluation, in which the Tribunal determines \"that the compensation must correspond to the amount that a willing buyer would have been ready to pay to a willing seller in order to acquire his interests but for the expropriation.\"185\n\nThe context was a difference of opinion between the experts on both sides as to whether a confiscation risk must be taken into account for the determination of the discount rate, and the Tribunal, having decided that it must, adjusts the discount rate accordingly.\n\n165.\n\nIn other words, the structure of the Award is such that, by the time the Tribunal comes to its promised consideration of the possible effect of the Price Cap (see paragraph 143 above), which it does in a separate Section,186 it has already determined a compensation figure. As paragraph 370 of the Award recites, the Claimants argued that the Price Cap was simply irrelevant and therefore inapplicable, and this is the view the Tribunal itself adopts in paragraph 373, with the consequence that its earlier compensation figure remains unaffected.\n\nAt paragraphs 369-374.\n\n166.\n\nThis represents another significant finding, and the Tribunal's reasons for it are given quite briefly, in paragraph 373 itself, as follows -\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that the Twentieth condition of the Congressional Authorization does not impose a specific price cap, but provides for a price cap to be established in the Association Agreement. In the present case, Clause 15(1) of the Association Agreement makes a clear distinction between the action that the Foreign Party may initiate against Lagoven CN on the one hand, and the action that it may initiate against the Government on the other. The price cap contained in Clause 15(2)(a) is applicable only to the compensation payable by Lagoven CN. Since the Respondent in this proceeding is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, not Lagoven CN, the Tribunal concludes that it may not oppose this price cap to the Claimants.\"\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion, in other words, is not necessarily one of substantive irrelevance or inapplicability in law, but of non-opposability, as *res inter alios acta*. The finding is thus qualitatively different from the Tribunal's earlier finding in paragraph 225 of the Award (see paragraphs 150 and 161 above). And the point made here by the Tribunal, while valid as a matter of contract law, has no bearing on the argument whether the existence of a price cap as such was a relevant factor for the assessment of the compensation due under the BIT.\n\ne) The Tribunal's reasoning\n---------------------------\n\n167.\n\nVenezuela now raises before this *ad hoc* Committee two basic objections to these various findings by the Tribunal.\n\n168.\n\nVenezuela says: first, that an investment is, of its very nature, an item of property, that the ascertainment of what that property consists of is a necessary and inescapable precondition to any assessment of its value, and specifically of its \u2018market value' under Article 6(c) of the BIT, so that this is an essential prior step which the reasoning of the Tribunal missed out entirely; second, that property is not a quantity that is, or can be, created by international law, and that the only role of international law is to recognize property created and defined by national law, and then to draw from that whatever consequences may flow on the international plane, so that the Tribunal failed altogether to bring the proper analysis to bear on the scope of the expropriation in question, or on the law applicable to its consequences by way of compensation.\n\n169.\n\nThe Mobil Parties counter187 that Venezuela never put this \u2018property' argument before the Tribunal in the arbitral proceedings, and assert, for their part, that \"the dispute did not concern \u2018property rights' governed by domestic law but pertained exclusively to rights and obligations under the Treaty, which are governed by international law\".188 The Committee does not, however, believe that this is correct, since it is clear that the character of the rights at issue (whether they be called \u2018property rights' or by some other description) is inherent in the very nature of an \u2018investment,' even before the point is reached at which the appropriate remedy has to be determined for an interference with the investment. The point at issue was therefore necessarily before the Tribunal. To say that an investment consists of rights created under national law is not the same as to claim that the only remedies available are those under the relevant national law.\n\nSee Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 226-242.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 242.\n\n170.\n\nHaving given the matter its anxious consideration, the Committee is of the view that Venezuela is right, in principle, in each of its two contentions set out in paragraph 168 above. The Committee will therefore have to consider whether the conclusions drawn by Venezuela are also correct, and in that case what effect it would have on the integrity of the relevant part of the Award, measured against the criteria in sub-paragraphs (b) and (e) of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n171.\n\nBefore coming to that point, the Committee must, however, give its reasons for agreeing in principle with the two Venezuelan propositions.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee takes as its starting point (as indicated above) that the classification of an investment as a form of property is indisputably correct. Even if the property is incorporeal or intangible, and consists merely of a collection of rights, the proposition remains unaffected. This is so intuitive a proposition that it is not stated in the books, but that does not affect its inherent character. For present purposes, though, the question is, in effect, answered by the definition of \"investments\" given in Article 1(a) of the BIT:\n\n\"For the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n(a) the term \u2018investments' shall comprise every kind of asset and more particularly though not exclusively:\n\ni. movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights in rem in respect of every kind of asset;\n\nii. rights derived from shares, bonds, and other kinds of interests in companies and jointventures;\n\niii. title to money, to other assets or to any performance having an economic value;\n\niv. rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\nv. rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract, and win natural resources.\"\n\n173.\n\nThe chapeau to the sub-paragraph \"every kind of asset,\" as well as the detailed examples that follow, bracket \u2018assets' together with tangible property and rights and titles of various kinds. In the present Arbitration, the \u2018investment' (so far as the Cerro Negro Project is concerned) englobes both rights over tangible physical assets and entitlements of an intangible kind. The Tribunal adopts a similar definition of it in paragraphs 57-58 of the Award. The Committee does not see that there can be any reasonable basis for contesting that the bundle of rights constituting the Cerro Negro investment was created by or under Venezuelan law and, having been so created, was then a type of property recognized and protected by international law in the form of the BIT. The Tribunal approaches the matter in exactly this manner in the paragraphs just cited. It is therefore not necessary for the Committee to resume the substantial body of writings mustered by Venezuela in these proceedings in support of their contention that this pattern is the universal norm; the Mobil Parties were not able to summon up any authority to the contrary, and the Committee regards the proposition as indisputable.\n\n174.\n\nMore important, though, is what follows from the above. Venezuela says that the property rights themselves that were acquired by the investors in making their investment were circumscribed by the provisions of the Congressional Conditions and their fulfilment in the Association Agreement, which together limited the compensation that would be due to them for future Government measures, and that the Tribunal simply omitted the necessary step of registering the real nature of the rights comprising the investment before proceeding to value them for the purposes of assessing compensation for their confiscation. The Mobil Parties appear to have no direct answer to this, but rest their argument on the well-known difference between contract claims and treaty claims.\n\n175.\n\nIt is plain to the Committee that, when it comes to the assessment of compensation for the Cerro Negro expropriation, the two critically essential elements in the Award's reasoning are the Tribunal's decision that the question is governed by the BIT, and the way in which the Tribunal put that decision into effect.\n\n176.\n\nAs already indicated, the Tribunal's decision that the question of compensation for the Cerro Negro expropriation is governed by the BIT and consequently that it must be assessed in accordance with, i.e. by applying, Article 6(c) of the BIT is both necessary and inevitable. If the Tribunal's decision that the question of compensation was to be governed by international law is properly to be understood as selecting the BIT, as a matter of applicable law, the decision is plainly right and not open to question. The difficulty in the reasoning underlying the Award is rather twofold: the way in which, once the choice had been made, Article 6(c) of the BIT was in fact applied; and the concept of \u2018international law' utilized by the Tribunal in reaching and implementing its decision that compensation was to be governed by international, not national, law. The two aspects are not entirely distinct from one another, but need to be approached separately.\n\n177.\n\nThe crucial issue - which became also the central issue in these annulment proceedings - was whether what the Tribunal refers to as the \u2018limitation on liability' in the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions, as incorporated into the Association Agreement, was relevant to the assessment of the compensation due, and if so how. In the event, the Tribunal simply set this \u2018limitation' aside as not relevant, and thus took no account of it. It did so at two places in the Award, and for two different sets of reasons. The two sets of reasons are not literally contradictory, but there is a question as to their compatibility with one another. Each of them has, however, to be appreciated in its particular context in the Award.\n\n178.\n\nThe first set of reasons is to be found at paragraphs 216 and 218 of the Award. Here the Tribunal decides that the ICC arbitration and the BIT Arbitration \"concern the liability of different parties under different normative regimes.\" It also decides that, while the Association Agreement does incorporate a limit on the compensation due from PDVSA, \"[n]o such limitation applies... to the State's responsibility under the BIT\", and gives as the reason that the Government \"was neither a party to the CNAA nor a third-party beneficiary.\" The context for these findings was (see above) the question the Tribunal had itself raised *ex officio* as to what impact (if any) the award that had in the meanwhile been issued by the ICC tribunal should have on the still pending dispute under the BIT. In this context, the decision by the Tribunal that the ICC arbitration was formally irrelevant to the issue before it is readily understandable. It is moreover a decision the Tribunal was competent to make and is not subject to appeal. What preoccupies the Committee, though, is whether a simple decision that the ICC award on the contract dispute did not in and of itself bring an end to the dispute under the BIT became transmogrified, whether consciously or not, into something much wider, and at a stage before the provisions of the BIT governing compensation had been addressed in the Award at all. Both in paragraph 216 and in paragraph 218, the Tribunal prays in aid a source of law that is not within the listing in Article 9(5), namely \u2018international law' *tout court* (see paragraph 155 above). That the use here of \u2018international law' is not merely an imprecise shorthand for the BIT appears unmistakably from the language of paragraph 216 which, as set out above, refers to responsibility for breach of the BIT \"and international law.\" The same appears, though rather less explicitly, in the reference in paragraph 218 to a contractual clause becoming \"transmuted into limitations of the State's responsibility under international law.\" No explanation is given of how or why a putative responsibility of the Respondent State under international law extraneous to the BIT might fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n179.\n\nThe second set of reasons given by the Tribunal for setting aside the relevance of the Price Cap can be found in the key passages at paragraph 225 of the Award; these are reflected in full at paragraphs 155-156 above and there is no need to repeat them here. Taking them once again, however, in their particular context, the Tribunal says (in paragraph 224) that what it is addressing is the argument that (i) the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions either relieve Venezuela from its obligation to comply with the standards under the BIT and/or (ii) import the corresponding limitation on liability into Venezuela's responsibility for breach of the BIT. In context, the answer given by the Tribunal in paragraph 225 is, once more, understandable -though it should be noticed that Venezuela has vehemently denied in these Annulment proceedings that it ever did advance these propositions in its defence in the Arbitration, and says that the Tribunal is repeating here the mis-description of its position put forward in argument by the Mobil Parties. The Committee's preoccupation is, however, once again that the rejection of two supposed propositions about \u2018overriding' treaty obligations, or setting them aside, became transmogrified into something much wider with potentially determinative effect for the interpretation and application of the BIT before the provisions of the BIT governing compensation had been addressed in the Award at all.\n\n180.\n\nTo summarize therefore, in the passages just analysed the Tribunal, in incidentally disposing of peripheral arguments supposed to have been directed at displacing the compensation provisions of the BIT, appears to have committed itself to general propositions about the relationship between \u2018national law' and \u2018international law' which appear in turn to have foreclosed in advance the proper application of the BIT to the case. In brief: to determine that the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions do not displace Venezuela's international obligations is not at all synonymous with determining that they have no relevance for the ascertainment of the content and consequences of those obligations.\n\n181.\n\nIt seems to the Committee to be obvious that in an appropriate case the resolution of a disputed issue under international law can itself entail the application of national law, simply because that is what the international rule requires. The ILC, in \u00a77 of its Commentary on draft Article 3 on State Responsibility says, \"Especially in the fields of injury to aliens and their property and of human rights, the content and application of internal law will often be relevant to the question of international responsibility. In every case it will be seen on analysis that either the provisions of internal law are relevant as facts in applying the applicable international standard, or else that they are actually incorporated in some form, conditionally or unconditionally, into that standard.\"189 That possibility is plainly allowed for in the choice of law regime of Article 9(5) of the BIT when it lists \u2018the law of the Contracting Party concerned' and \u2018the provisions of this Agreement' as the first two among the elements of law on which an arbitral award shall be based (paragraph 154 above). However that may be, it also appears from Venezuela's Memorial in these proceedings that this precise point had been put to the Tribunal by Venezuela when it argued, in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, that the Claimants were trying to \u2018read out of Article 9.5 [of the BIT] the first and third sources of law' and insisted that, under the BIT, Venezuelan law had to be taken into account. That is, of course, radically different from an attempt to use its internal law to evade its obligations under the BIT, and the Committee has not been able to find anywhere in the Award in which Venezuela's actual argument was addressed.\n\nSee also Crawford, *State Responsibility*, at p. 101 (\"National law will often be relevant, whether because it is incorporated by reference in the international law rule, or because it is part of the factual matrix of the dispute.\")\n\n182.\n\nAfter the passages discussed above, the Tribunal does not come to the assessment of the compensation due for the Cerro Negro expropriation until paragraphs 306 and following of the Award (see paragraph 162 above). As there indicated, the Tribunal lays down definitively -and in the Committee's view correctly - that the compensation \"must be calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\" In form and in effect this is a determination of law. What ought necessarily to follow is the ascertainment of what those requirements are under the BIT and then their application *in specie* to the particular case in hand, and the Committee will now examine the way in which that was done.\n\n183.\n\nThe process begins in paragraph 307 with a recital verbatim of the key requirements of Article 6(c), notably the standard of \u2018just compensation' and that its measure must be the market value \"of the investments affected\" immediately before the expropriating measures. It then transitions immediately (paragraph 308) to the DCF analysis said to have been agreed by the Parties as the basis for evaluation, and the next 60 paragraphs are given over to the detail of the DCF analysis, culminating (as indicated above) in the ultimate compensation figure announced in paragraph 368. At this point, the Award moves to the short excursus on the Price Cap discussed at paragraphs 142-143 above, leading to the conclusion that it may not be \u2018opposed to' the Claimants in the BIT Arbitration.\n\n184.\n\nOn the strength of the analysis above, the Committee is itself driven to the conclusion that, although the Tribunal devotes some attention to destroying two straw men (that the Price Cap is contractually binding in itself in the BIT Arbitration, or that the Price Cap can have the effect of displacing or overriding Venezuela's international obligations towards the investors), at no stage does the Tribunal give any consideration to what relevance the limitations on the investors' rights embodied in the Price Cap might actually have to the application of the mandatory criteria laid down in the BIT for compensation. At paragraph 306 the Tribunal makes the definitive determination for the purposes of the Award that the compensation due \"must be calculated in conformity with the requirements of Article 6(c) of the BIT.\" These requirements are then recalled verbatim in paragraph 307, which the Tribunal rounds off with its own conclusion that the compensation \"must correspond to the amount that a willing buyer would have been ready to pay to a willing seller at the time in order to acquire the expropriated interests.\" But the focus then shifts immediately to the detail of a discounted cash flow analysis, and there is no discussion at all of what should be understood, in the circumstances of the case, by the principal criterion of \u2018just compensation,'190 or of what, in the particular circumstances, should be understood by the market value \u2018of the investments affected.' Nor indeed is any further development to be found of the Tribunal's own determination that the measure of market value is what a willing buyer would have been prepared to pay to a willing seller. The only consideration given to the Price Cap is in connection with the two straw men described above; there is no discussion of any kind of what effect the Price Cap (as a limitation on the investor's rights) might have had on \u2018market value' of the investment or on the intentions and calculations of the hypothetical willing buyer.191 This is notwithstanding the fact that this would seem to be a necessary and inevitable element in any willing buyer/willing seller analysis, and the fact that (on the evidence of the Award itself: paragraph 370) that precise proposition had been put in argument by Venezuela. The only response to Venezuela's argument is the first of the two straw men, the one contained in paragraph 373 of the Award,192 and which was, so it seems, the argument being put forward to the Tribunal by the Claimants. The Award records in paragraph 370 Venezuela's contention that the Claimants' argument does not address the real issue, and the Committee can only respectfully agree.\n\nThe discussion of this principal criterion is to be found in the Section on the lawfulness of the expropriation, at paragraph 305; but it is not particularized, nor is it followed through.\n\nContrast the direct application of the willing buyer criterion to the quantum of compensation in respect of the La Ceiba Project at paragraph 385 of the Award.\n\nSee paragraph 184 above.\n\n185.\n\nThe Committee concludes this portion of its Decision by adverting to one related aspect of the Award.\n\n186.\n\nThe corresponding passages in the Award are the following (all emphases supplied) -\n\n\"These proceedings concern the responsibility of the State for breach of the Treaty **and** **international law**.\" (paragraph 216)\n\n\"Neither has the Respondent advanced any relevant argument that the limitations on PDVSA-CN's contractual liability under Clause 15 should be transmuted into limitations of **the State's responsibility under international law**.\" (paragraph 218)\n\n\"... the Tribunal has no doubt in concluding that **this issue must be governed by international law**. Consequently, the Eighteenth and Twentieth Conditions cannot exempt or excuse the Respondent from its obligations under the Treaty **or under customary international law**.\" (paragraph 225).\n\n187.\n\nTaking these passages in themselves and in their individual contexts it is hard to avoid seeing in them an implication that there exists notionally and *in spe* a given quantum of compensation for expropriation imposed \u2018by international law' from which it is not possible to detract by domestic legal means or by any other form of action other than on the international plane. If so, then the underlying concept remains unexplained; nothing can be found on the face of the Award to establish what the relationship is between the postulated liability \u2018under international law' and the compensation criterion expressly laid down in the BIT. Nor, even if there does exist some pre-existing notional obligation under \u2018international law' (which both paragraphs 216 and 225 treat as something different from the BIT), is there any reasoning to establish why that obligation should be justiciable in the arbitration at all, let alone why it should be taken to override the express provision to be found in the BIT. In other words, in its anxiety to dismiss any thought that national law can be invoked as a defence to the breach of an international obligation, the Tribunal ended up falling into an another version of exactly the same type of proposition, i.e. that some alternative source of international obligation can be invoked to displace particular rights and obligations established by treaty. Had the Tribunal set out to articulate the proposition directly, and to reason it through, it would immediately have realized that this proposition was as unsustainable, at the level of general principle, as the proposition which the Tribunal was setting out to reject.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n188.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee accordingly arrives at the following conclusions: -\n\na) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers to the extent that it held that general international law, and specifically customary international law, regulated the determination and assessment of the compensation due to the Mobil Parties for the expropriation of their investment in the Cerro Negro Project, in place of the application of the provisions of the BIT.\n\nb) Those parts of the Award that purport to be based on the existence, irrespective of the BIT, of a justiciable obligation on Venezuela towards the Mobil Parties in respect of the compensation due for the expropriation of their investment in the Cerro Negro Project, fail to state the reasons on which they are based.\n\nc) Those parts of the Award that purport to set aside altogether the potential relevance, for the purposes of applying the provisions of the BIT, of the compensation provisions forming part of the Mobil Parties' investment in the Cerro Negro Project are unsupported by analysis and based on contradictory reasoning, and thus fail to state the reasons on which they are based.\n\n189.\n\nThe Committee accordingly finds that the portions of the Award dealing with the compensation due for the admitted (and lawful) expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project are so seriously deficient both in their reasoning and in the choice and application of the appropriate sources of law under the governing Bilateral Investment Treaty as to give rise to grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee sees no need to enter further into the question whether either one of these deficiencies, taken on its own, would have justified the annulment of the relevant parts of the Award, since it is evident that the two deficiencies identified bear on exactly the same aspects of the Tribunal's decision and the reasoning behind it; and indeed, as indicated above, the two deficiencies can hardly be separated from one another. The consequence is that they reinforce one another, and in so doing they lead to a situation in which the relevant parts of the Award can be impugned both as a \u2018manifest excess of power' under Article 52(1)(b), and as a \u2018failure to state reasons' under Article 52(1)(e).193 The Tribunal exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law, and the \u2018manifest' nature of this failure is shown by the inadequacies in the Tribunal's reasoning for the choice of applicable law, in both its positive (the law chosen) and negative (the law rejected) aspects. Conversely, the failure to state adequate and non-contradictory reasons is of central significance inasmuch as it had decisive effect on the choice and application of applicable law and thus on the Tribunal's decision on the principal point at issue (the assessment of the compensation due).\n\nCf. *Lucchetti v. Peru*, Decision on Annulment of 5 September 2007, at para. 72.\n\n190.\n\nThe Committee should not be understood by this Decision to be determining in what way either the Price Cap or the outcome of the ICC arbitration should be brought to bear on the assessment of compensation in the present dispute. That would lie beyond its competence, and is in any event a decision which the Committee is in no position to make. The Committee's decision is directed simply at the *a priori* exclusion in the Award of certain essential elements from the process of arriving at the compensation due pursuant to the terms of Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n191.\n\nGiven the limited nature of the annulment to be pronounced, the Committee considers it both necessary and useful to indicate more precisely, in the dispositive section which will follow, which aspects of the Award are annulled (and therefore which parts of the Award are left untouched by the Decision). It will be up to the Parties to take the necessary steps thereafter to put the resulting situation into practical effect. No doubt they will choose whatever method is most convenient and most efficient towards that end.\n\n192.\n\nThe stay of enforcement laid down in Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 July 2015 will, according to its terms, cease to have effect on the date of issue of the present Decision. The Committee specifically recalls in this connection the letter of 27 August 2015 from the Minister of Petroleum and Minerals of Venezuela conveying a formal and binding commitment on behalf of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in the event that Venezuela's present Application for Annulment is unsuccessful in whole or in part, to comply promptly with any or all parts of the Award that have not been annulled.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n193.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which applies to annulment *mutatis mutandis* pursuant to Article 52(4), gives the Committee discretion to allocate the costs of the proceeding between the parties as it deems appropriate. As regards the allocation of the costs of these annulment proceedings, the Committee intends to follow the same approach as that of the Tribunal, and take into account the conduct of the Parties as well as the principle that costs should normally follow the event.\n\n194.\n\nBoth Parties, in their written submissions, have asked for the costs of these proceedings to be awarded in their favour, and each Party duly submitted a statement of costs in response to the Committee's request at the conclusion of the oral hearing. Venezuela, as Applicant, claimed a total of US$ 2,092,414 in costs and expenses, and the Mobil Parties, as Respondents, a total of US$ 701,617.30; in support of the amount claimed, Venezuela drew attention to its need to operate throughout in both the English and Spanish languages.\n\n195.\n\nApplying to the outcome of these proceedings the approach indicated in paragraph 193 above, the Committee notes that Venezuela has been plainly successful over the main and most substantial issue, i.e. that relating to compensation for the Cerro Negro expropriation, which has in turn occupied the major part of both the written and oral argument. Against that must however be set the dismissal of its two other requests for annulment (jurisdiction and document production) which the Committee has found to have little substantive merit. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that the only reasonable decision is to let the costs of the preparation and presentation of Parties' respective cases lie where they fall and to split the costs of the annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the costs of the Centre, between the Parties, with the result that each side will bear the costs of the preparation and presentation of its own case, and that the costs of the annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the costs of the Centre, will be shared equally between the Applicant and the Respondents. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n**VII. DISPOSITIF**\n-------------------\n\n196.\n\nOn the basis of the reasoning above, the Committee decides: -\n\n1) the request for the annulment of the Award on account of the Tribunal's assumption of jurisdiction is rejected;\n\n2) the request for the annulment of the Award on account of the Tribunal's refusal to order document production is rejected;\n\n3) the request for the annulment of the portion of the Award dealing with compensation for the expropriation of the Cerro Negro Project is upheld in part, as follows: paragraph 404(d) of the Award is annulled, together with certain paragraphs in Sections V, VI, and VIII of the Award bearing directly on the assessment of compensation and the basis therefor, that is to say paragraphs 216-218, paragraphs 223-225, and paragraphs 373-374;\n\n4) for the avoidance of doubt, the Committee specifies that the following parts of the Award are not affected by sub-paragraph 3) above, namely paragraphs 297-306, paragraphs 307367, the first sentence of paragraph 368, paragraphs 386-400, and paragraph 403, as well as paragraphs 184-213 and the Decision on Jurisdiction of 10 June 2010;\n\n5) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 10.a of Procedural Order No. 2 of 28 July 2015, the stay of enforcement laid down in that Order will cease to have effect on the date of issue of the present Decision;\n\n6) each Party shall bear the costs of the preparation and presentation of its own case. The costs of the annulment proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee and the costs of the Centre, shall be shared equally between the Applicant and the Respondents."}]}
