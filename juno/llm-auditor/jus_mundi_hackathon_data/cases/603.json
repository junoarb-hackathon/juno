OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**3.2. Overview of Claimants\u2019 Case**\n------------------------------------\n\n3.2.1.\n\nTo Claimants, this case is all about the unlawful mistreatment of Italian investors by the Georgian authorities. Having been sought out to invest in the R\u2026 Plant by President Shevardnadze and assured of the legality of their investment, Claimants then allegedly saw their treaty rights violated and their investment ultimately expropriated through \u201cgross breaches\u201d of procedural and substantive due process by the Georgian courts, \u201ccapricious and illegal activities\u201d of state appointed (or influenced) officials aimed at frustrating their investment and, ultimately, through the direct taking of the R\u2026 Plant in a process directly influenced by the new government that replaced the Shevardnadze administration following the Rose Revolution in late 2003.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nClaimants argue that the requisite jurisdictional elements of Article 25(1) of the Convention are met. First, the dispute is of a legal nature because it relates to breaches by Georgia of its international obligations, including under the BIT. Second, the dispute arises directly out of an investment because it relates to Claimants\u2019 acquisition of shares as part of the privatisation and rehabilitation of a state-owned industry. Third, Claimants are nationals of Italy, a Contracting State, and Respondent is another Contracting State. Finally, the BIT evidences Georgia\u2019s written consent to submit this type of investment dispute to ICSID.\n\n3.2.3.\n\nOn the merits, Claimants allege that Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions constituted:\n\n1. a direct or indirect expropriation;\n2. a violation of Respondent\u2019s duty to accord just and fair treatment; and\n3. a violation of Respondent\u2019s obligation of full protection and security.\n\n3.2.4.\n\nClaimants initially sought restitution in kind. However, in light of the transfer of the Plant to a third party, Claimants now seek monetary compensatory damages based on their \u201cNet Losses\u201d incurred in connection with their investment in Georgia \u2026 plus the \u201cNet Equity Value\u201d of the expropriated business ... together with interest and costs.\n\n**3.3. Overview of Respondent\u2019s Defenses**\n------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.1.\n\nFor Respondent, this case is solely about two claimants who are looking to blame someone other than themselves for their failed endeavour in Georgia. Their case is said to fail for six principal reasons.\n\n3.3.2.\n\nFirst, it is said the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants\u2019 so-called investment was made under an agreement that never came into existence, having been held by Georgia\u2019s highest legal authority to be illegal and void *ab* *initio*. Article 1(1) of the BIT protects only investments made in accordance with the laws of the host state and a contract that is void *ab initio* cannot qualify as such an investment.\n\n3.3.3.\n\nSecond, even if Claimants\u2019 investment had been made in accordance with Georgian law, Ares lacks standing because it sold its purported investment for [\u2026] to MetalGeo in December 2003 prior to any alleged breaches of the BIT.\n\n3.3.4.\n\nThird, again assuming the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Respondent\u2019s conduct did not amount to an expropriation because the Georgian courts determined that the agreement under which Claimants made their investment never came into existence. Thus, Claimants had no duly held rights which could have been expropriated.\n\n3.3.5.\n\nFourth, Respondent has simply applied its laws which were in force at the time. There can therefore be no suggestion of unjust or unfair treatment as Claimants have not demonstrated that Georgia made any specific and binding representations giving rise to a legitimate expectation that its laws would not apply or be applied to Claimants\u2019 investment. Moreover, Claimants have not demonstrated that the decisions of the Georgian courts \u201cshock the conscience\u201d or were a result of bias\u2014the standard for establishing a \u201cdenial of justice.\u201d\n\n3.3.6.\n\nFifth, Claimants seek to malign the Georgian authorities for undertaking legitimate investigations into wrongdoing that implicated the Claimants. No breach of a full protection and security standard can be found where such investigations were a lawful part of Respondent\u2019s due diligence and vigilance in protecting the Plant.\n\n3.3.7.\n\nFinally, even if a BIT violation were to be assumed, Respondent says that Claimants have failed to establish or substantiate any damages. In any event, Claimants\u2019 claim based on the market value of the alleged investment is untenable, being premised on the highly speculative proposition that Claimants could have made the Plant both productive and profitable.\n\n[...]\n\n**5. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.7.\n\nIn this case, given the broad definition of investment found in Article 1(1) of the BIT (*i.e.,* \u201c... any kind of property invested ... \u201d), Claimants\u2019 respective acquisitions of \u201cshares\u201d in RAMK (Art 1 (1) (b)), their \u201ceconomic rights accruing by law or by contract\u201d (Art. 1(1)(e) \u2013 the SPA for Ares, the MOA and the Cooperation Agreement for MetalGeo) and their \u201cactivities connected with\u201d their shares and/or economic rights (Protocol to the Treaty) qualify, *prima* *facie*, as investments under the Treaty.\n\n5.4.8.\n\nThe question of this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction therefore turns on the meaning and effect \u2026 of the qualification \u201c... made in accordance with the laws and regulations of ...\u201d Georgia, which applies to every form of investment covered by the BIT.\n\n5.4.9.\n\n\u2026The purpose of such a provision, as explained by the *Salini* Tribunal is, \u201cto prevent the Bilateral Treaty from protecting investments that should not be protected, particularly because they would be *illegal*\u201d152 (emphasis added).\n\n*Salini*, *supra*, at \u00b646. Hereafter in this Award we used the words \u201clegal,\u201d \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201clegality\u201d and \u201cillegality\u201d as short form expressions for the concept embodied in the words \u201c... in accordance with the laws, and regulations of the latter Contracting Party ....\u201d\n\n[...]\n\n*Who Determines \u201cLegality\u201d*\n---------------------------\n\n5.4.13.\n\nAs to how or by whom the determination of \u201cillegality\u201d is to be made, there is no dispute. This is a matter for the Tribunal. It is also clear that in coming to our conclusions, while we are free to take into consideration the Georgian courts\u2019 analyses of these issues \u2026, we are not bound by any other determination that may have been made as to the \u201clegality\u201d of Claimants\u2019 investments. \u2026\n\n5.4.14.\n\nAs was pointed out by the *Inceysa* Tribunal:\n\n*[t]he determination of the legality of the investment cannot be left up to the Courts of the Host State, because this would give the State the possibility to redefine the scope and content of its own consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre unilaterally and at its complete discretion*.157\n\n*Inceysa*, *supra*, at \u00b6213 ff [the holdings of municipal deal institutions cannot be binding with respect to matters properly within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal].\n\n*What Type of Illegality Vitiates Consent*\n------------------------------------------\n\n5.4.15.\n\nTurning to the type, scope or extent of the required illegality, the tribunal disagrees with Respondent\u2019s position that the qualification, \u201c... in accordance with laws and regulations ...\u201d necessitates *full compliance* of the investment with *all* domestic laws and regulations. Such a requirement would be inconsistent with the Contracting Parties\u2019 intent for the Treaty.\n\n5.4.16.\n\nThe \u201cobject and purpose\u201d of the Treaty may be discerned from its title and its preamble, as well as the title and provisions of Articles 2 and 2(1). These make clear the Contracting Parties\u2019 desire to stimulate and protect business ventures fostering prosperity in each state and to establish favourable conditions to attract investment from each others\u2019 investors. To exclude an investment from the protection of the Treaty on the basis of minor legal errors, irregularities or technical failings would be entirely inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty. To our minds, the qualification that an investment must be made \u201c... in accordance with laws and regulations ...\u201d of the Contracting Party in which it is made requires an appropriate showing (by the Contracting Party asserting such \u201cillegality\u201d) of substantial non-compliance with that Party\u2019s laws and regulations relating to the type of investment/transaction at issue.159\n\n*See also Tokios*, *supra*, at \u00b6\u00b684\u201386, to the same effect.\n\n*When is \u201cIllegality\u201d to be Assessed*\n-------------------------------------\n\n5.4.17.\n\nAs to the stage of an investment\u2019s life at which its \u201clegality\u201d is to be tested, subject, of course, to the specific wording of the BIT, this should generally be seen as the time the investment is made. Were it otherwise, a host country would be able unilaterally to change the terms of its consent by removing a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction based on a post-dispute enactment invalidating the investment of a putative claimant**.**\n\n5.4.18.\n\nHere, the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the introductory words of Article 1(1) of the BIT, is consistent with this approach. The proviso that the investment \u201c... *has been made* in accordance with ...\u201d (emphasis added) indicates that the Contracting Parties intended the \u201clegality\u201d requirements of the host state to apply only at the time the investment was made. Thus, an allegation by one of the Contracting Parties that an investment violated or ceased to comply with its laws subsequent to its making, but in the course of its life, might constitute a defence to a claimed substantive violation of the BIT, but it would not deprive a tribunal of jurisdiction based on the subsequent \u201cillegality\u201d of the investment.\n\n5.4.19.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*The \u201cLegality\u201d of Claimants\u2019 Investments*\n------------------------------------------\n\n5.4.20.\n\nWhen pared to the bone, Georgia\u2019s jurisdictional challenge rests on the proposition that the SPA (which underlies all of Claimants\u2019 investments) is, and has properly been found to be, invalid (void *ab initio*) under Georgian law. Thus, it is said, Claimants\u2019 investments were not made in accordance with Georgian law and do not qualify as protected investments under the BIT. In consequence, this Tribunal is without jurisdiction.\n\n5.4.21.\n\n\u2026\u201c[L]egality\u201d must be analysed under the law of Georgia. By defining the term \u201cinvestment\u201d to mean \u201c... any kind of property invested ...\u201d provided that the investment has been made in accordance with the laws and regulations of the relevant Contracting Party, the Contracting Parties have in this case specifically agreed that a tribunal shall have regard to the law of Georgia for the purposes of determining the \u201clegality\u201d of Claimants\u2019 investments.160\n\n*Fraport*, *supra*.\n\n5.4.22.\n\nArticle 42 (1) of the ICSID Convention is relevant, clear and prescriptive on this point:\n\n*[t]he* Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties*. In the absence of such agreement, the* *Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable* (emphasis added).\n\n5.4.23.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.24.\n\nIn the result, we turn to whether either of Ares\u2019 or MetalGeo\u2019s investments failed in some substantial way to comply with relevant Georgian law or regulation at the time they were made.\n\n5.4.25.\n\nAs to this, Respondent places great weight on the 29 January Decision of the R\u2026 City Court \u2026 that \u2026declared the SPA to be null and void and ordered the assets which had been contributed by RMK to RAMK at the time it was created to be returned to the ownership of RMK.\n\n5.4.26.\n\nAbsent good cause for disregarding them, we see no principled reason why this Tribunal ought not to look carefully at the conclusions of the Georgian courts which considered the validity of the SPA and the creation of RAMK to assist us in reaching our own conclusions.\n\n5.4.27.\n\nClaimants, however, say there is good reason for us to disregard the 29 January Decision. They say it is not to be relied upon, having been rendered in blatant violation of the Georgian Civil Procedure Code and having never been reviewed on the merits.\n\n5.4.28.\n\nAfter a careful review of that decision, as well as the proceedings giving rise to it, we do not agree with Claimants\u2019 negative assertions.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.32.\n\nHowever, the fact that the 29 January Decision is not to be faulted on the basis of Claimants\u2019 arguments does not mean that it provides the answer for us as to whether Claimants\u2019 investments failed in a substantial way to accord with Georgian law or regulation *at the time they were made*.\n\n5.4.33.\n\nA close reading of Judge M\u2026\u2019s reasons and the relevant provisions of the Georgian bankruptcy law, shows that the fundamental concern with the creation and capitalisation of RAMK by RMK and the execution of the SPA was the then Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s failure to obtain the approval of either of these steps by a properly formed Creditors\u2019 Committee of RMK or by creditors holding more than 50% of RMK\u2019s debts.\n\n5.4.34.\n\nHowever, this failure was analysed *as at January 2004* (almost a year after the creation of RAMK, and some 10 months after the execution of the SPA), when it was apparent that no effort had been, or was being, made by the Rehabilitation Commissioner to seek the necessary approval. We are not satisfied as to the applicability (or correctness) of Judge M\u2026\u2019s analysis or conclusions to the time RAMK was created on 27 February 2003, or the date on which the SPA was executed on 11 April 2003.167\n\nThis conclusion does not give us reason to disagree with Judge M\u2026\u2019s holding, on 29 January 2004 that, as at that date, the Rehabilitation Commissioner having failed to obtain requisite approvals from a duly elected Creditors\u2019 Committee, the creation and capitalization of RAMK and the execution of the SPA were not in accordance with Georgian bankruptcy law and were in fact null and void. The fact that we do not have reason to disagree with the 29 January Decision does not bear on the question of \u201clegality\u201d at the time the \u201cinvestment has been made\u201d although it does have relevance to Claimants\u2019 substantive case for breach of the BIT.\n\n5.4.35.\n\nThe principal reason for this is that, when they were entered into, each of these transactions had the prior approval of the court created Interim Creditors\u2019 Committee of RMK (a body provided for in Article 22.2.1 of the Bankruptcy Law), which had been given the specific mandate to act for RMK\u2019s creditors prior to the election of a permanent Creditors\u2019 Committee.\n\n5.4.36.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.37.\n\n\u2026 [H]aving provisionally been approved by the Interim Creditors\u2019 Committee, the transactions were, and would remain, valid until either (i) the permanent Creditors\u2019 Committee refused to ratify the earlier interim approval, or (ii) in the absence of such a ratification, until they were declared to be invalid by a court having jurisdiction. To conclude otherwise would be to give no purpose to Article 22.2.1 of the Bankruptcy Law.\n\n5.4.38.\n\nWe therefore find that RAMK was created (and Ares acquired its shareholding therein on 11 April 2003) in substantial accord with the laws and regulations of Georgia. Such a conclusion can happily co-exist with the R\u2026 City Court\u2019s conclusion in January 2004 that, no Creditors\u2019 Committee *by then* having been elected (and thus no ratification of the approval by the Interim Creditors\u2019 Committee having been obtained), the transactions were not in accordance with Georgian law or regulation at that time.\n\n5.4.39.\n\n\u2026 This Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over Ares\u2019 Treaty claims. However, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction does not depend on the correctness of our view on the \u201clegality\u201d of the Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s creation of, and Ares share holding in, RAMK. This is because it is uncontested that Ares expended more than $... towards the resumption of pipe manufacturing at the Plant prior to the date it entered into the SPA (SPA \u2013 Article 6.5). These expenditures alone (described above at 4.3 and 4.9) qualify as an investment as defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT \u2013 *i.e.*, as \u201c... any kind of property invested ...\u201d and Respondent has never suggested that they were not made \u201c... in accordance with laws and regulations ...\u201d of Georgia.\n\n5.4.40.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.41.\n\nWe turn next to MetalGeo\u2019s 15 December 2003 purchase of Ares\u2019 98% shareholding in RAMK. \u2026\n\n5.4.42.\n\nEven if MetalGeo\u2019s shareholding in RAMK had been its only investment in Georgia, we would also conclude that it qualified as a protected investment under the BIT for the same reason Ares\u2019 earlier acquisition of the same shares also qualified.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n5.4.45.\n\nHowever, as in the case of Ares, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this case does not depend on the correctness of our conclusion on the \u201clegality\u201d of MetalGeo\u2019s shareholding in RAMK. This is because it is apparent on the record before us that MetalGeo engaged in activities in Georgia in 2004, after the 29 January Decision, which also qualify as investments for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**6. STANDING**\n---------------\n\n[...]\n\n6.4.3.\n\nHaving concluded that each of Ares\u2019 and MetalGeo\u2019s acquisition of shares in RAMK qualify as investments for the purposes of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the question becomes whether Ares\u2019 sale of its shares in RAMK precludes it from advancing its claims (whatever be their merits) in these proceedings.\n\n6.4.4.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n6.4.5.\n\nHere, however, there is no question of Ares not having an investment at the time of Respondent\u2019s alleged Treaty breaches or when it instituted these proceedings. This is because, when Ares sold its shares in RAMK to MetalGeo, Claimants separately agreed that Ares would continue to have \u201c... a common interest on the income deriving from the management and the development of the metallurgical production of the \u2026 Plant.\u201d172\n\nThis contractual benefit falls directly within the provisions of Article 1(1)(c) which defines an investment to include a claim to money or any performance having an economic value connected with an investment. \u2026\n\n*Ibid* at \u00b62.\n\n6.4.6.\n\nAres was also required to cooperate with MetalGeo at the request of the latter, to help resolve \u201c... any problem arising in connection with RAMK\u2019s personnel, its creditors, the Institution of the Republic of Georgia, including the management of any legal dispute related to the change in ownership of the capital share or that will involve the name of Ares or related to MetalGeo\u2019s registration in Georgia.\u201d This ongoing obligation assumed by Ares also falls within the meaning of \u201cactivities connected with the investment\u201d which, under the Protocol to the Treaty, are specifically made subject to the protections of the BIT.\n\n6.4.7.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction in respect of Ares\u2019 claims as an ongoing investor subsequent to its sale of its shares of RAMK to MetalGeo in December 2003.\n\n**7. TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPROACH TO THE CASE ON THE MERITS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nClaimants assert three separate violations of the BIT under general international law. They contend that Georgia\u2019s conduct amounted to: (i) an expropriation without compensation of Claimants\u2019 investment; (ii) a breach of Georgia\u2019s obligation to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment; and (iii) a violation of Georgia\u2019s obligation to ensure full protection and security for Claimants\u2019 investments. \u2026\n\n**8. EXPROPRIATION OF CLAIMANTS\u2019 INVESTMENTS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n8.3.1.\n\nArticle 5 of the BIT contains the Treaty\u2019s protection against expropriation.\n\n8.3.2.\n\nAccording to the ordinary meaning of the language of these provisions, it is clear that Ares\u2019 contractual rights under the SPA, its ongoing interests in the profits of RAMK and MetalGeo\u2019s shareholding interest in RAMK were each subject to the protection afforded by Article 5.\n\n8.3.3.\n\nIn a case of *de facto*, \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201ccreeping\u201d expropriation, as is alleged here, it is well established under international law that, even if a single act or omission by a government may not constitute a violation of an international obligation, several acts, taken together, can warrant a finding that such obligation has been breached. This concept is reflected in Article 15(1) of the International Law Commissions\u2019 Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2002) (\u201cILC Articles\u201d).\n\n8.3.4.\n\nILC Article 15(1) also defines the time at which a composite act occurs \u201cto be the time at which the last act or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.\u201d Claimants point to the R\u2026 City Court\u2019s June 2005 registration of RAMK\u2019s assets in the name of RMK as that last act.\n\n8.3.5.\n\nIt is unclear why Claimants changed their position as to the role of the decisions of the Georgian courts in the alleged expropriation of Claimants\u2019 rights and their title to the Plant. Indeed, having regard to the holdings of the 29 January Decision (that the SPA and Ares\u2019 shareholding in RAMK were null and void,) a possible finding by this Tribunal that the 29 January Decision had been based on a substantive or procedural denial of justice to Claimants would have been highly relevant to any claim based on Article 5.\n\n8.3.6.\n\nPut another way, because the effect of the 29 January Decision was to extinguish completely Claimants\u2019 contractual rights arising from the SPA as well as their shareholdings in RAMK, any finding by this Tribunal that Claimants had not been afforded fair treatment, or otherwise faced a denial of justice by, or at the hands of, the R\u2026 City Court would almost certainly have meant the success of their case for unlawful expropriation.\n\n8.3.7.\n\nBecause of this, and given the multiple complaints about the propriety of the 29 January Decision and the subsequent appeals, it is important that we state here our conclusion (dealt with more fully below in Section 9), that the evidentiary record before us does not bear out Claimants\u2019 many allegations concerning the decisions of the Georgian Courts.[\u2026] Accordingly, had it been necessary, we would have concluded that Claimants\u2019 investments were not expropriated by reason of any decision of the Georgian courts. We agree with the tribunal\u2019s holding in *Middle East Cement*, that, in normal circumstances, \u201c... a seizure and auction ordered by the national courts do not qualify as a taking ...\u201d and could only constitute a measure \u201c\u2018tantamount to expropriation\u2019\u201d where the court decision itself was \u201c... not taken \u2018under due process of law.\u2019\u201d 196\n\n*Middle East Cement*, *supra*, at \u00b6139.\n\n8.3.8.\n\nAs for the \u201c... acts of other entities acting for the State ...,\u201d now relied upon by Claimants as constituting the alleged expropriation, we have concluded that none, taken individually or collectively, may be said to be expropriatory.\n\n8.3.9.\n\nThis is because Ares\u2019 and MetalGeo\u2019s contractual and shareholder rights had been brought to an end, *not by reason of any legislative, administrative, police* *or other action*, whether proper or improper, but by a series of decisions of the Georgian Courts, which decisions we find cannot properly be faulted under international law. Thus, Ares had no contractual rights under the SPA to be expropriated and MetalGeo had no shares in RAMK which could have been expropriated by \u201c\u2026 other entities acting for the State \u2026\u201d subsequent to the 29 January Decision.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**9. JUST AND FAIR TREATMENT OF CLAIMANTS\u2019 INVESTMENTS**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Meaning of the Standard*\n-------------------------\n\n9.3.1.\n\nThe just and fair treatment standard which concerns us is found in Article 2(2) of the BIT. However, Article 2 as a whole, which bears the title \u201cPromotion and Protection of Investments,\u201d creates obligations additional to the provision of just and fair treatment. Articles 2(1), (3) and (4) are of particular importance here:\n\nArticle 2 \u2013 Promotion and Protection of Investments\n\n1. *Both Contracting Parties shall encourage investors of the other Contacting Party to invest in their territory according to their laws and regulations.* \u2026\n\n3. *Both contracting parties shall at all times ensure just and fair treatment of the investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Both Contracting Parties shall ensure that the management, maintenance, use, transformation, enjoyment or assignment of the investments effected in their territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, as well as the legal persons, in particular but not exclusively, companies and enterprises, in which these investments have been effected, shall in no way be subject to unjustified or discriminatory measures.*\n\n4. *Each Contracting Party shall create and maintain in its territory favourable economic and legal conditions in order to permit the compliance, in good faith, of all undertakings assumed with regard to each specific investment.*\n\n9.3.2.\n\nThe parties agree that the legal meaning of the \u201cjust and fair treatment\u201d standard is to be determined by the Tribunal, having regard to the international law rules of interpretation reflected in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention and in the light of all of the relevant circumstances that have been put before us. This accords with the *Mondev* Tribunal\u2019s view that:\n\n*[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case*.232\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002, \u00b6118; *See also* *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3), Award of 30 April 2004, *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of* *Chile*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of 25 May 2004.\n\n9.3.3.\n\nTurning first to Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the protections provided by Article 2 of the BIT are limited to the customary minimum standard, we do not agree. Bilateral investment treaties, in general, are designed to promote foreign direct investment between the contracting parties to those treaties, whereas the customary minimum standard provides a minimum guarantee of protection to foreign investors where no such treaties exists. It applies even in states that may not welcome foreign investment.\n\n9.3.4.\n\nIn these circumstances, as was pointed by the *Saluka* Tribunal, where a bilateral investment treaty provides for fair and equitable treatment, or its equivalent, to show a violation of the standard, it may be sufficient that a state\u2019s conduct displays a somewhat lower degree of inappropriateness than would be required for a breach of the customary minimum standard.233\n\n*Saluka, supra*, at \u00b6\u00b6292\u201393.\n\n9.3.5.\n\nIt is also relevant that the provisions of Article 2(3) make no reference to a minimum standard, customary or otherwise. Indeed, the expansive language of the second sentence in Article 2(3), which obligates the contracting parties to \u201c... ensure that the management, maintenance, use, transformation, enjoyment or assignment of the investments effected in their territory by investors of the other contracting party ... shall *in no way* be subject to unjustified or discriminatory measures\u201d (emphasis added), points to the unique and free-standing nature of the Treaty\u2019s \u201cjust and fair treatment\u201d standard, and to the fact that the Contracting Parties had something different in mind than the customary minimum standard.\n\n9.3.6.\n\nTo the extent that the Treaty\u2019s just and fair treatment standard can be equated with the fair and equitable treatment standard (which the parties accept), we agree with Dr. F.A. Mann who wrote in 1981:\n\n*[t]he terms \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 envisage conduct that goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and applied independently and autonomously*.234\n\nA. Mann, *British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments*, 52 BRIT YB Int\u2019l. Law 241, 244 (1981).\n\n9.3.7.\n\nTurning next to the ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cjust\u201d and \u201cfair,\u201d these are, of necessity, defined by words of similar vagueness, such as \u201ceven-handed,\u201d \u201cfree from bias, fraud or injustice,\u201d \u201clegitimate,\u201d \u201cequitable\u201d and \u201creasonable.\u201d Even so, it is possible to discern from them a number of component principles of a just and fair standard, including:\n\ni) refraining from arbitrary or discriminatory conduct;\n\nii) providing transparency and due process;\n\niii) acting in good faith; and\n\niv) providing security for legitimate (*e.,* reasonable), investment-backed expectations.\n\n9.3.8.\n\nNumerous tribunals have concluded that the protection of legitimate expectations is at the heart of such a standard and that investor states that assume the standard are under an obligation to treat foreign investors so as not to frustrate their legitimate and reasonable expectations held at the time the investment was made. In *TecMed*, the tribunal found that the fair and equitable standard requires an investment state: \u201cto provide international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\u201d The *CME* Tribunal reached a similar conclusion that the Czech Republic had \u201c... breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment by evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest.235\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL (Netherlands/Czech BIT), Partial Award of 13 September 2001, \u00b6611.\n\n9.3.9.\n\nProfessor W\u00e4lde has pointed out that the principle of the protection of legitimate investment-backed expectation is often combined with the principle of transparency: governments must make clear what they want from the investor and cannot hide behind ambiguity.236\n\nM. W\u00e4lde, *Energy Charter Treaty-Based Investment Arbitration*, 5 J.W.I.T. 3, June 2004, p. 387.\n\n9.3.10.\n\nOf course, the protection of legitimate expectations is not absolute and does not amount to a requirement for the host state to freeze its legal system for the investor\u2019s benefit. Professor Schreuer rightly points out that a reasonable evolution of the host state\u2019s law is part of the environment with which investors must contend. For instance, an adjustment of environmental regulations to internationally accepted standards or general improvements in labour law for the benefit of the host state\u2019s work force would not lead to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, if applied in good faith and without discrimination.237\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice*, J. World Inv., Trade 357, (June 2005), 357, at 374.\n\n[...]\n\n*Claimants\u2019 Expectation as to the Legality of their Investments*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.13.\n\nClaimants\u2019 allegation of breach of the just and fair standard, based on the frustration of their legitimate expectations, rests on two propositions:\n\ni) the SPA was a state contract, the legality of which was warranted by Georgia; and\n\nii) Georgia\u2019s reliance on the 29 January Decision to renege on its warranty is impermissible under that standard.\n\n9.3.14.\n\nTo succeed here, Claimants must establish the validity of both propositions. However, we have concluded they cannot do so. We hold that Claimants must fail on this point because the evidentiary record does not support the contention that the SPA was a state contract, or that Respondent ever warranted the legality of Ares\u2019 investment.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.19.\n\nThe fact that RMK was a state owned company, or that the state may have encouraged the Rehabilitation Commissioner to look favourably upon Ares as a potential investor, does not convert the SPA into a state contract or the Rehabilitation Commissioner into a \u201cstate organ.\u201d\n\n9.3.20.\n\nThe ILC Articles define a state organ to include any entity that has that status \u201c... *in accordance with the internal law of the state*.\u201d238\n\nILC Articles, Article 4.\n\n9.3.21.\n\nHere, however, RMK was a private company with its own legal personality,239 and Article 25.4 of the Bankruptcy Law makes it clear that the Rehabilitation Commissioner is a legally and financially separate juridical person, who is hired at the will of the debtors and creditors. Moreover, the Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s remuneration is paid from the debtor\u2019s property, not the state budget. And on the facts, there was simply no evidence that Mr. Ko\u2026 was doing the bidding of the state. In these circumstances, Claimants cannot establish the SPA to be a state contract.\n\nCivil Code of Georgia, Articles 24(2) and 24(4); Excerpt from the Entrepreneurial Registry on JSC Metalurgivili Kombinati (RMK) (Exhibit R-4).\n\n9.3.22.\n\nClaimants\u2019 allegations that Respondent represented and warranted the legality of the SPA rest largely on the provisions of Clauses 2.2, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5 of the SPA. However, given our finding that the SPA is not a state contract, such representations as it may contain are not state representations.\n\n9.3.23.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.24.\n\nFinally, there is no other credible evidence of such a commitment being made on behalf of the state. \u2026\n\n9.3.25.\n\nAccordingly, since the SPA was not a state contract and Georgia never represented nor warranted the legality of the SPA, Claimants must fail in their contention that Respondent violated its obligation to provide just and fair treatment by reneging on these obligations.\n\n*Court Proceedings Concerning the SPA*\n--------------------------------------\n\n9.3.26.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case for breach of the just and fair treatment standard as it relates to the court proceedings concerning the SPA is, in sum, that, in the face of a wholly spurious and oppressive lawsuit, they were denied due process which constituted a denial of justice.\n\n9.3.27.\n\n\u2026 [W]e have no reason to disagree with the substance of the 29 January Decision and we have earlier concluded that the evidentiary record makes it clear that due process was observed.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.33.\n\nClaimants\u2019 allegations that due process violations continued on appeal\u2014specifically that \u201c[i]n blatant violation of [The Code of Civil Procedure] and the elementary principles of due process, the R\u2026 City Court\u2019s judgement of 29 January 2004 ... was never notified to Ares\u201d\u2014are also without merit.\n\n9.3.34.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 assertion that they were never properly served with notice of the 29 January Decision, it is clear that Mr. S\u2026, the senior representative of both Ares and MetalGeo in Georgia, had received a copy of the formal Decision by 14 February 2004. This is evident from the letter he sent on that date to the Prime Minister expressing concern about the outcome of the case in which he enclosed a copy of the formal decision.\n\n9.3.35.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if the court\u2019s decision to send copies of its 29 January Decision to RMK\u2019s office in R\u2026 may not have complied strictly with the technical requirements of Article 71 of the Code of Civil Procedure, there can be no suggestion that Ares or RAMK were thereby prejudiced.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.39.\n\nOn [the] facts we do not consider the \u2026 District Court\u2019s decision to hold Ares\u2019 late-filed appeal to be inadmissible to constitute an offence to judicial propriety. Nor do we see any legitimate basis for complaint against the proceedings on appeal to the Georgian Supreme Court.\n\n9.3.40.\n\nOverall, there is no question that the procedures that governed the court proceedings were readily discernible and available to Claimants\u2014indeed Claimants repeatedly availed themselves of the Georgian judicial process. To the extent that the courts may have failed to follow these procedures to the letter, we are confident that Claimants were in no way prejudiced by any such failure.\n\n9.3.41.\n\nAs previously indicated, the substantive questions before the courts were considered by no fewer than six judges at the various levels of the judiciary including Georgia\u2019s highest court. Further, each of these courts issued thoughtful, reasoned and reasonable decisions that expressly incorporated references to each of the parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n9.3.42.\n\nAgainst these findings, Claimants have pointed to nothing about these proceedings that would offend judicial propriety. Accordingly Claimants\u2019 case that Respondent breached its just and fair treatment obligations based on its failure to accord Claimants due process must also fail.\n\n*Georgia\u2019s Duty to Resuscitate the SPA*\n---------------------------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.45.\n\nAccepting, for the moment, that it might have been possible for Georgia, as RMK\u2019s principal creditor, to have been able, in a post 29 January Decision world, to engineer the requisite approval by RMK\u2019s creditors of a newly minted SPA, together with appropriate amendments to the original Rehabilitation Plan, the question is whether it had any duty to do so.\n\n9.3.46.\n\nThe possibility of there being such a duty by reason of a contractual commitment arising under the SPA has been answered above by our conclusion that the SPA was not a state contract. Thus, any such duty that might have existed would not have been a duty of the state.\n\n9.3.47.\n\nTo find such a duty under the BIT would require us first to conclude that provisions of Article 2(3) or perhaps 2(4) could properly be construed so as to require the state to behave proactively with a view to rectifying the Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s earlier omission. In the event we did so, we would also be required to find that the state had conducted itself in such a way in its dealing with Ares that it would be unjust or unfair if it failed to seek to rectify the Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s omission.\n\n9.3.48.\n\nOn each of these points we are of the view that Claimants are unable to sustain such a case.\n\n9.3.49.\n\nAs to the first proposition, it would take a much more precisely worded obligation than is now contained anywhere in the BIT to create such a duty. In dealing with a treaty not dissimilar to that before us, the *Saluka* tribunal pointed out:\n\n*The protection of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a necessary element alongside the overall aim of encouraging foreign investment and extending and intensifying the parties\u2019 economic relations. That in turn calls for a balanced approach to the interpretation of the Treaty\u2019s substantive provisions for the protection of investments, since an interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of extending and intensifying the parties\u2019 mutual economic relations*.245\n\n*Saluka*, *supra*, at \u00b6300.\n\n9.3.50.\n\nDespite the fact that the *Saluka* tribunal was dealing with a different BIT, its words are apposite here. To read into the provisions of the Treaty a duty to rectify an omission made by an individual for whose acts the state is not responsible would require an unbalanced approach to its interpretation. It would also be patently unreasonable.\n\n9.3.51.\n\nAs to the second proposition, it is simply beyond the reach of the evidence before us to suggest that the Shevardnadze government conducted itself in its dealings with Ares so as to provide it with a legitimate expectation that it had been given an insurance policy covering the legal validity of the SPA. \u2026 As to MetalGeo, it had no dealings at all with Respondent at the time it acquired Ares\u2019 shares in RAMK. It thus had no basis for assuming the government had assured it of anything.\n\n9.3.52.\n\nBased on these conclusions, Respondents\u2019 failure to resuscitate the SPA cannot be said to constitute a breach of the BIT\u2019s just and fair treatment standard.\n\n*Rehabilitation Commissioner\u2019s Ka\u2026\u2019s Conduct*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.53.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent failed to provide just and fair treatment when it forced the resignation of Rehabilitation Commissioner Ko\u2026 and replaced him with its man, \u2026.Ka\u2026, who lacked any qualification for the job and, acting as a tool of the state, immediately set out to frustrate Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n9.3.54.\n\nHaving regard to our earlier conclusion that, under Georgian law, and absent a factual basis for concluding otherwise, the Rehabilitation Commissioner is not a state organ within the meaning of the ILC Articles, Claimants\u2019 case on this point must fail, unless the factual record can sustain a finding that Mr. Ka\u2026 had become a tool of the state.\n\n9.3.55.\n\nAs to this question, on the evidence before us, we conclude that Mr. Ka\u2026 cannot be said to have been acting as a tool of the state.\n\n9.3.56.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.57.\n\nClaimants\u2019 allegation that Mr. Ka\u2026 \u201c... had close connections to the new government and his appointment was therefore clearly imposed by the state authorities ...\u201d was not borne out by the evidence. \u2026\n\n9.3.58.\n\nAs regards the various allegedly \u201canti-investor\u201d actions taken by Mr. Ka\u2026 (*e.g.*, the withdrawal of the 29 January Decision appeal, his application to seize RMK\u2019s assets and his dealings with the Georgian state railway) no evidence was tendered to tie his behaviour to the state.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.62.\n\n\u2026 MR. Ka\u2026\u2019s actions were entirely consistent with what he, not unreasonably, considered to be his duties, and in the absence of cogent evidence that he was acting as a tool of the state with a view to frustrating Claimants\u2019 interest, their contentions that his behaviour supports a finding of a breach of the just and fair standard are unsupportable. The allegation that Mr. Ka\u2026 was the state\u2019s man is also inconsistent with his uncontradicted testimony that he was reprimanded by the Ministry of the Economy for failing to \u201c... agree to compromises with the Italian party\u201d and to convene a creditors\u2019 meeting: failings which led to him being dismissed by the court shortly thereafter on the application of the tax authorities, based on his unsatisfactory performance.\n\n*Georgia\u2019s Post 29 January Dealings with MetalGeo*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n9.3.63.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n9.3.64.\n\n\u2026 Claimants say that they were unfairly led to believe that the new government would work with MetalGeo, and indeed was working with it, to find a way to permit MetalGeo to take over Ares\u2019 role (including the rights and obligations it had acquired under the SPA) in the rehabilitation of RMK. Based on this understanding, both MetalGeo and Ares continued to make expenditures, which were subsequently lost, to support the continued operation of the Plant.\n\n9.3.65.\n\nEventually, MetalGeo entered into agreements with the government (the MOA and the Cooperation Agreement) which were designed to accomplish what Claimants believed to be the shared objective that MetalGeo would replace Ares as the principal investor in the Plant and would, with the support of the state, carry on with its rehabilitation. However, they contend that their legitimately held expectations in this regard were unlawfully frustrated by the new government which, in retrospect, can be seen to have had a different and hidden agenda, which was the ouster of the Italian investors and the sale of RMK to the highest bidder.\n\n9.3.66.\n\nAs to this aspect of their case, that Georgia\u2019s conduct violated the BIT\u2019s just and fair treatment standard, we are of the view that Claimants are on solid ground.\n\n[...]\n\n9.3.72.\n\nIn [the] circumstances, it was both reasonable and legitimate for MetalGeo to believe that the new government had been working with it, with the utmost transparency and in good faith, with a view to solving the problems that had been brought about by the Georgian Court\u2019s nullification of the SPA and the creation of RAMK.\n\n9.3.73.\n\nHowever, we have been forced to conclude that this was not the case. We have reached this view because the new government must have known at this time that it was utterly unrealistic, politically, for Ares or MetalGeo to play any further role in the future of RMK, having regard to the intensely negative views then surrounding both the rehabilitation and the Italian investor, a good deal of which it had helped to create. In these circumstances, it was wrong for Respondent to suggest otherwise and in doing so to request ongoing investment from MetalGeo.\n\n9.3.74.\n\n[...]\n\n9.3.75.\n\nIt is also evident from the record that the new government was prospecting for the sale of the Plant to third parties at the same time as it was purporting to negotiate with MetalGeo for the sale of its State Credits.\n\n9.3.76.\n\n[...]\n\n9.3.77.\n\nBased on these conclusions, we find that Respondent knowingly misled Claimants in its dealings with MetalGeo following the 29 January Decision and thereby violated its just and fair treatment obligation to them.\n\n**10. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY OF CLAIMANTS\u2019 INVESTMENTS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n10.3.4.\n\n\u2026 [T]he Tribunal notes that the [imported] text of Article 2.2 [of the Georgia-UK BIT] does not limit the obligation to providing reasonable protection and security from \u201cphysical interferences.\u201d If the parties to the Georgia-UK BIT had intended to limit the obligation to \u201cphysical interferences,\u201d they could have done so by including words to that effect in the section. In the absence of such words of limitation, the scope of Article 2.2 should be interpreted to apply to reach any act or measure which deprives an investor\u2019s investment of protection and full security, providing*, in accordance with the* *Georgia-UK BIT\u2019s specific wording*, the act or measure also constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment. Such actions or measures need not threaten physical safety of persons and installations.257\n\nSuch an interpretation is consistent with the decisions of recent international tribunals *see* *CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands)*  *The Czech Republic*, Partial Award of 13 September 2001 (UNCITRAL) (the Netherlands/Czech Republic BIT), \u00b6613; *eskoslovensk obchodn\u00ed banka a.s. v. Slovak* *Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Award of 29 December 2004, \u00b6170; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas de Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of 20 August 2007, \u00b67.4.15 *et seq*.\n\n10.3.5.\n\nAs regards the threats, intimidations and robberies and the lack of protection by the Georgian authorities identified in paragraphs 77\u201386 of Claimants\u2019 Memorial, we are not satisfied that Claimants have made out a case.\n\n10.3.6.\n\nFirst, there is no credible evidence that Georgia instigated or in any way authorised the strikes or alleged thefts of Claimants\u2019 property. Moreover, the evidence is more supportive of the view that the protests (mostly hunger-strikes) were peaceful and in accordance with the general norms.\n\n10.3.7.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the police undertook investigations when informed of possible theft and tax fraud. Indeed, the police brought a criminal charge against one individual and, at the time this case was pleaded, had an ongoing investigation concerning an alleged robbery of one of the workers of the Plant.\n\n10.3.8.\n\nIn these circumstances, we conclude that Respondent committed no treaty breach by reason of any failure to provide full protection and security to Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n**11. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n[...]\n\n11.1.9.\n\nHaving regard to our conclusions on Claimants\u2019 expropriation case, that Ares had no contractual rights under the SPA to be expropriated, that MetalGeo had no shares in RAMK which could have been expropriated, and, accordingly, that Respondent was not in breach of its obligations to Claimants under Article 5 of the BIT, it is unnecessary to summarise further Claimants\u2019 arguments in support of their *lucrum cessans* claim, based, as it was, on the expropriated value of their investments.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n11.3.3.\n\nHaving concluded that Georgia breached the just and equitable standard contained in Article 2, when it knowingly misled Claimants in its dealings with MetalGeo following the 29 January Decision, it is only under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby.\n\n11.3.4.\n\nAs previously noted, we have concluded that Claimants were unfairly led to believe that the new government would work with MetalGeo, and indeed was working with it, to find a way to permit MetalGeo to take over Ares\u2019 role in the rehabilitation of RMK. Based on this understanding, both MetalGeo and Ares continued to make expenditures, which were subsequently lost, to support the operation of the Plant.\n\n11.3.5.\n\nOn these facts, the most appropriate application of the principle in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case*\u2014\u201c... that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\u201d265\u2014is to fix Claimants\u2019 respective damages in the net amount each invested, and lost, in the Plant subsequent to the 29 January Decision as a result of Georgia\u2019s wrongful behaviour.\n\n*Case concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, *Judgment No. 13*, 13 September 1928, Merits, 1928, C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, at p. 47.\n\n[...]\n\n11.3.9.\n\nHowever, in order \u201cto wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the act had not been committed,\u201d it is necessary for any award of damages in this case to bear interest.\n\n**12. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n[\u2026]\n\n12.3.1.\n\nAbsent treaty terms or provisions in the governing law to the contrary, it is generally accepted that international tribunals may award interest to an injured claimant; indeed, the liability to pay interest is now an accepted legal principle.\n\n12.3.2.\n\nIt is also uncontroversial that the object of an award of interest is to compensate for the damage resulting from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum he was supposed to receive.268\n\n*Evaluation of Damages in International Arbitrations*, Derains & Kreindler, Dossiers, ICC Publication No. 668 (2006) at 167.\n\n12.3.3.\n\nTo the extent that there has been a tendency in the past for international tribunals to award only simple interest, this is changing and the award of compound interest is no longer the exception to the rule. Indeed, a number of international tribunals have recently expressed the view that compound interest should be available as a matter of course, if economic reality requires such an award to place a Claimant in the position it would have been in, had it never been injured (*i.e.*, had the wrongful act not taken place).269\n\nThe Tribunal made a non-exhaustive review of previous investment arbitration cases and found fourteen awards granting compound interest and three granting simple interest. The awards granting compound interest include *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award of 30 August 2000, 40 I.L.M. 36 (2001); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena,* *A. v.

In a recent article published on the TDM (Transnational Dispute Management) website in 2006, Wilson, Cain and Gray, surveying ICSID arbitrator awards and costs, found that of the 14 decisions they reviewed, eight granted compound interest, two did not disclose the calculation method used and one did not grant interest: James Gray, Jason Cain, Wayne Wilson, (Alvarez & Marsal), \u201cICSID Arbitration Awards and Cost\u201d, *Transnational Dispute Management*, Vol. III(5) (December 2006), *available at* http://www.transnational-dispute-management.com.\n\n12.3.4.\n\nThis development is not surprising, once it is recognised that compound interest is *not punitive* in nature. As the *Santa Elena* Tribunal pointed out, \u201cit is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances.\u201d270\n\nThe Tribunal also noted that where the owner of the property has lost the value of his asset but not been timely compensated, the amount of the compensation that is later awarded \u201c... should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.\u201d271\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 15 *ICISD Rev.*\u2013*FILJ* 169 (2000), \u00b6104.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n12.3.5.\n\nClaimants suggest that interest be compounded semi-annually and awarded at the rate of LIBOR, being the rate provided in the case of a lawful expropriation under Article 5.1 of the BIT.\n\n12.3.6.\n\nThe difficulty with this proposition is that the LIBOR provided for in Article 5 has to do with losses arising from expropriation, and the Contracting Parties did not specify a particular rate to compensate for the loss of use of funds to investors arising from the breach of other provisions of the BIT. In such circumstances, we do not believe that the LIBOR should be presumed to apply.\n\n12.3.7.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s difficulty as to the determination of the appropriate rate was not helped by the fact that Claimants led no evidence as to their normal respective rates of return on capital employed in their businesses. However, it is well settled that the fact that damages (including any interest component thereof) cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact science.272\n\nAs to the tendency and appropriateness of international tribunals to approximate damages, *see* *American International Group, Inc. et al. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran and Central Insurance of Iran (Bimeh Markazi Iran) (Case No. 2)* (Award No. 93-2-3), Award of 19 December 1983, at 109; *Payne v. Iran (Case No. 335*) (Award No. 245-335-2), Award of 8 August 1986, 12 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 3, \u00b6\u00b635\u201337.\n\n12.3.8.\n\nAccordingly, in the limited circumstances known to the Tribunal about Claimants\u2019 respective businesses, and having regard to the prevailing rates of interest in Europe since 2004, the Tribunal concludes that a 5% interest rate represents a reasonable proxy for the return that Claimants could otherwise have earned on the amounts they invested in the Plant (and lost) following the 29 January Decision.\n\n12.3.9.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied on the factual record that it is appropriate in this case to provide for compounding of such interest in order adequately to compensate Claimants for the loss of use of their lost investments since 2004.\n\n**13. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n[...]\n\n13.2.1.\n\nIn approaching the allocation of costs as between the parties in this arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the parties\u2019 comparative successes on their claims and defences are, to a degree, balanced.\n\n13.2.2.\n\nIt is, of course, true that Claimants have prevailed on their claim that Georgia did not live up to the just and equitable standard as required by Article 2 of the BIT, and have been awarded damages for their losses. On the other hand, Respondent has defeated Claimants\u2019 most substantial case\u2014their expropriation claim. It has also shown the majority of Claimants\u2019 allegations of state impropriety to be groundless. Moreover, having regard to the fact that Claimants collectively sought to recover damages in the sum of approximately $... the damages proven (just over $...) are comparatively modest. The Tribunal also notes that Claimants\u2019 position on both liability and damages evolved significantly in the course of the proceeding.\n\n13.2.3.\n\nHaving regard to these facts, as well as all of the other circumstances of the case, the Tribunal decides that the disputing parties shall bear their own costs and counsel fees.\n\n13.2.4.\n\nSubject to our separate order below as to the costs relating to the transcription and translation of Mr. A\u2026\u2019s testimony, the Tribunal further decides that the disputing parties shall bear equally the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat, together with any related costs or charges regarding the use of the ICSID facilities.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**14.
