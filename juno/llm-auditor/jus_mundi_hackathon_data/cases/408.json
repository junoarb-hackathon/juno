AES Solar Espa\u00f1a Finance S.L., AES Solar Espa\u00f1a I B.V. y CIA S.C. and La Solana S.L. 1 to La Solana S.L. 60 (60 entities),\" namely the 62 of the 88 Claimants that are incorporated in Spain but controlled by nationals of other Contracting Parties to the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\").\n\nAward \u00b6 375(b).\n\n2.\n\nIt must be remembered that Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\") requires primary attention, not just to \"the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty,\" as the Award does in concentrating on the wording of Articles 1(7)(a)(ii), 26(1) and 26(7), but, more broadly, to such \"terms... in their context and in light of its [the treaty's] object and purpose.\"2 Unusually, the ECT states its purpose in Article 2, entitled \"PURPOSE OF THE TREATY\":\n\nThis Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.3\n\nThe ECT's Preamble, which, as noted below, the VCLT expressly includes as \"context,\" is perhaps more illuminating. Thus this second recital in the Preamble to the ECT is to be noted: \"Having regard to the European Energy Charter adopted in the Concluding Document of the Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter signed at The Hague on 17 December 1991,\"4 which was three years to the day before the actual signing of the ECT itself, which Concluding Document, under \"TITLE II IMPLEMENTATION,\" included among its bullet points \"promotion and protection of investments.\"5 Hence it is fair to conclude that one of the purposes and objects of the ECT was to provide legal protection for foreign investments.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Art. 31(1), opened for signature May 23, 1969 (entered into force Jan. 27, 1980) 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (emphasis added).\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Art. II, Lisbon, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95.\n\nId. (Preamble).\n\nConcluding Document of the Hague Conference on the Energy Charter Treaty dated 17 Dec. 1991, Title II (emphasis added).\n\n3.\n\n\"Context\" is defined in VCLT Article 31(2) as follows:\n\nThe context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.6\n\nVienna Convention, Art. 31(2).\n\n4.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the Tribunal was not presented by either of the Parties with, and doubtless for that reason the Award does not address, any of the context that exists outside the Treaty itself with respect to the ECT. I believe that it is particularly incumbent upon any tribunal to ensure that it neither exceeds its jurisdiction nor fails to assert a jurisdiction that it by rights should accept. Therefore I undertake to spell out here the publicly available context of the ECT. The definition of \"context\" in VCLT Article 31(2)(a) clearly includes the entire \"Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference,\" which in its Part III \"adopted the text of\" the ECT (as Annex 1) and \"Decisions with respect thereto\" (as Annex 2), and in its Part IV \"agreed to adopt [22] Understandings with respect to the Treaty.\"7 Understanding 3, made \"with respect to Article 1(6)\" of the Treaty, concerns the meaning of \"Investment\" and is therefore especially relevant to Article 26(7) of the ECT.8 It reads:\n\nFor greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of any other Contracting Party, control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be considered, including the Investor's\n\n(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment;\n\n(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment; and\n\n(c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or any other managing body.\n\nWhere there is doubt as to whether an Investor controls, directly or indirectly, an Investment, an Investor claiming such control has the burden of proof that such control exists.\n\nFinal Act of the European Energy Charter Conference dated 17 Dec. 1994, Parts III, IV. Commentators are in agreement that the Understandings \"are relevant for the proper interpretation of the ECT's provisions.\" Crina Baltag, The Energy Charter Treaty: The Notion of Investor, International Arbitration Law Library, Vol. 25, at 20, fn. 94 (2012) (also citing W\u00e4lde who wrote \"[a]n application of the ECT's investment disciplines is not complete without consideration of the... \u2018Understandings.'\").\n\nArticle 1(6) provides the definition of \"Investment\" under the Treaty.\n\n5.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Understanding 3 nowhere mentions or even alludes to Article 26(7). Rather, it is of general application to the ECT. Surely it would have referenced Article 26(7) had this latter been understood as excluding foreign-controlled investors who are nationals of the host State from UNCITRAL and SCC arbitration. Its unrestricted, broad language is consistent only with such foreign-controlled investors having equal access to UNCITRAL, SCC and ICSID arbitration. Why else would there be an Understanding 3 of the widest possible scope if Article 26 did not contemplate jurisdiction over claims of companies incorporated in the host State but controlled by foreign nationals irrespective of whether arbitration was instituted under ICSID, UNCITRAL Rules or the SCC? Considering Understanding 3 as context for paragraph (7) of Article 26 confirms that the 62 foreign-controlled Claimants come within the Treaty's meaning of \"Investor.\"\n\n6.\n\nIndeed, this is consistent with how the late Professor Thomas W\u00e4lde, a specialist in the Energy Charter Treaty and author of several articles and books on the ECT,9 has explained Understanding 3:\n\na Treaty investor is either a natural person having nationality or permanent residence in a contracting party, or a company incorporated in a contracting party... [t]he investor needs to \"control\" the investment; [Understanding 3] recommends that all relevant factors should be considered, including equity, substantial influence and appointment powers.10\n\nA summary of Professor W\u00e4lde's CV and expertise in international investment and energy disputes is available at http://www.transnational-dispute-management.com/about-author-a-z-profile.asp?key=6.\n\nThomas W\u00e4lde, International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty: Legal, Negotiating and Policy Implications for International Investors Within Western and Commonwealth of Independent States/Eastern European Countries, in THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: AN EAST-WEST GATEWAY FOR INVESTMENT AND TRADE 251, 274 (Thomas W\u00e4lde ed., 1996).\n\n7.\n\nI cannot help but think that the interpretation of Article 26(7) by the Award produces a result which is indeed absurd.11 My view has long been that proper application of Article 31 should endeavor to achieve a result that is not absurd, that the unreasonability of an interpretation potentially achieved in application of this Article alone should, if at all possible, be rejected in favor or one that is not absurd. That is a standard distinct from Article 32's standard of \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"12 In my opinion there is nothing whatsoever reasonable about a dispute settlement provision such as in the ECT discriminating among claimants as regards their access to arbitration under different sets of rules. It is of course a commonplace to say that each of the four sets of rules offered in the ECT has differences from the others. Each aspiring claimant must take the rules it chooses as they are. There is nothing in either the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, however, in either version, or in those of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce that determines jurisdiction ratione personae. That instead is determined by bilateral or multilateral investment promotion and protection treaties such as the ECT. It defies common sense to think that the ECT, by expressly ensuring that the Article 25(2)(b) requirement of the ICSID Convention was met, implicitly intended to exclude from the same benefits those claimants who choose UNCITRAL or SCC Rules, thereby requiring them potentially to bring separate, parallel arbitrations, or abandon these proceedings and restart the process elsewhere. If it makes no sense, can it really have been intended? I think not.13 Curiously, what the Award says about the \"Svalbard exception\" would seem to dictate a contrary result:\n\nIt would be extraordinary that an essential component of the Treaty, such as investor-state arbitration, would not apply among a significant number of Contracting Parties without the Treaty drafters addressing this exception. In the Tribunal's view, it is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty to read into it an implicit intra-EU disconnection clause.14\n\nBy the same token, how can it possibly be reconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty to disenfranchise wholly-owned Spanish subsidiaries of other Contracting State nationals if they choose the UNCITRAL Rules or the SCC Rules rather than the ICSID Convention and Rules?15,16\n\nThe most readily available dictionary source, www.dictionary.com, defines \"absurd\" as \"utterly or obviously senseless, illogical, or untrue; contrary to reason or common sense; laughably foolish or false.\" It lists the origin of the word as \"1550-60 Latin absurdus out of tune, uncouth, ridiculous\".\n\nBelow, in paragraph 10 of this opinion, however, I ultimately do take the position that the Award's conclusion following application of VCLT Article 31 is indeed \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\nThe Award underscores in connection with its treatment of the Respondent's \"aggregate proceedings\" objection that the provision in ECT Article 26(3) that \"each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration\" (subject to two exceptions not applicable here) is \"significant\" in the application of VCLT Article 31. Award \u00b6 98 (emphasis added). It would seem to have no less significance for the interpretation of Article 26(7).\n\nAward \u00b6 183.\n\nThe Award at paragraph 280 disagrees with this point on the ground that whereas the Respondent here had argued for an \"implicit intra-EU disconnection clause,\" the Article 26(7) issue is \"precisely the opposite, as the Tribunal is faced with an explicit provision\" and must determine the interpretive effect of it, if any, on the ECT, looking at the ECT as a whole. Just as the Award, in which I concur in this respect, cannot conclude from the \"Svalbard exception\" that the treaty drafters intended thereby to imply such a significant term as an intra-EU disconnection clause, so too, I cannot conclude that by insertion of paragraph (7) in Article 26 the drafters intended to compel all foreign-controlled claimants legally established in respondent States to proceed solely at ICSID and bar them from any access to both the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and those of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.\n\nCorrect application of the VCLT has frequently been the object of my attention.

Lautenschlager eds. 2012).\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties \u2013 actually only one, the Respondent \u2013 has offered but a single excerpt from the ECT's travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, which I believe the Award has misconstrued. For the avoidance of doubt, let me be clear: I believe that the proper interpretation of Article 26(7) of the ECT, applying only Article 31, gives us jurisdiction of the 62 Claimants excluded by the Award. The Award itself rests on Article 31 alone, and would not have entered into any analysis under Article 32 of the VCLT but for the fact that Respondent did so and the Claimant responded. Since the Award has ventured there, I, too, must address the point since here, too, I think the Award is mistaken. To facilitate consideration of this point I insert here the entirety of the text set forth in Paragraph 272 of the Award:\n\nThis report responds to questions from the Japanese Delegation concerning Article [26]. The questions are set out separately below, followed by our answers.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n1. Why are only the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules referred to in this paragraph?\n\n2. Interpretation and application of ICSID Convention, which is independent from the Treaty, cannot be decided unilaterally by the Treaty. Therefore, even if this paragraph (7) provides for definition of \"National of another Contracting State\", the content of which is slightly different from that of Article 25(2) of ICSID Convention, it does not make sense legally.\n\n3. However, we consider that the content of this provision is important for the protection and promotion of investment. Therefore, we would like to propose the following text:\n\n\"In case an Investor other than natural person which has made Investment in a Contracting Party is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party on the date on which the former Investor makes a request to the former Contracting Party to submit the dispute to the conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article, the former Investor shall be treated for the purpose of the provisions of this Article as an Investor of another Contracting Party.\"\n\nComments:\n\nAs recognized, the issue pertains only to the ICSID and Additional Facility (AF) rules. Articles 25(2) of ICSID and 1(6) of the AF rules are special cases and paragraph (7) is specific to those Articles only. Paragraph (7) does not differ in any substantive way from the wording of either Article 25(2) of ICSID or Article 1(6) of the AF. We do not believe that the proposed language is needed.\n\nFrankly, the thrust of the Japanese inquiry is not entirely clear. It is apparent from its Paragraph 2 that there was concern that \"the content of [Article 26(7)] is slightly different from that of Article 25(2) of [the] ICSID Convention,\" and that is what the \"Comment\" of the Legal Sub-Group of the treaty conference was dealing with when it recorded that \"Paragraph (7) [of ECT Article 26] does not differ in any substantive way from the wording of either Article 25(2) of [the] ICSID [Convention] or Article 1(6) of the [Additional Facility of ICSID].\" Beyond that, the cited exchange obscures more than it reveals. It is a very weak reed, if any, with which to support the conclusion to which the Award has come regarding the proper interpretation of ECT Article 26(7).\n\n9.\n\nActually, the Tribunal had before it the entirety of the Legal Sub-Group Report of 2 May 1994 addressing a total of six questions (A.-F.) posed by the Japanese Delegation regarding what became Article 27 of the ECT.17 It is evident that the Japanese effort was designed to plug perceived loopholes which the Delegation feared might result in unequal treatment of ECT Contracting States if not eliminated. Thus as a result of its Question A., directed to Article 27(5)(a), it succeeded in securing from the Legal Sub-Group what is now Article 27(5)(a)(iii), ensuring that the \"written agreement\" requirement of the UNCITRAL Rules is met, but was dissuaded from pursuing the same issue in respect of the SCC Rules, being advised that those Rules had no such requirement. With its Question B. the Japanese Delegation sought and received assurance that Article 26(5)(b)'s reference to the New York Convention, taken together with Article 26(8), should result in universal enforcement. Question C. posed by the Delegation clearly sought assurance that Article 26(6) of the ECT did not authorize arbitral tribunals to tinker unduly with the proper application of whichever of the four authorized sets of arbitral rules might be chosen by a claimant. The Delegation's Question E. veered somewhat from the path of its earlier Questions (A.-D.), seeking confirmation that Article 26(8) would not require an ECT Contracting State with an already well-functioning, effective system for enforcing arbitral awards to \"reinvent the wheel.\" With its Question F. the Delegation sought, and received from the Legal Sub-Group, confirmation that the process of implementing the ECT was up to each Contracting State's particular constitutional system, always respecting the rule of pacta sunt servanda. Seen in this context, one is justified in concluding that the Japanese Delegation's inquiry regarding Article 26(7) was designed to ensure that correct language was being used to effect compliance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (and the related provision of its Additional Facility). It was assured by the Legal Sub-Group that the language of Article 26(7) was adequate to that purpose, noting that ICSID and its Additional Facility are \"special cases,\" Paragraph (7) being \"specific to those [ICSID Convention and Additional Facility] Articles only.\" Therefore this lone fragment from the extensive travaux pr\u00e9paratoires falls far short, in my view, of establishing that the drafters of the ECT intended to legislate split access among the four arbitral alternatives.\n\nReport of the Legal Sub-Group of the Energy Charter Conference dated 2 May 1994 (RL-30) (attached to this opinion as Annex A).\n\n10.\n\nIf one indeed turns to VCLT Article 32, it provides as follows:\n\nArticle 32: Supplementary means of interpretation\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.18\n\nThus \"supplementary means\" is rather open-ended, providing a non-exclusive list \"including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion.\" The one fragment of the ECT's \"preparatory work\" to which our attention has been drawn has been dealt with above. The open-ended character of \"supplementary means,\" as well as the specific reference to \"the circumstances of [the ECT's] conclusion,\" appear to open the debate to consideration of the writings of those most intimately involved with the birth and the administration of the ECT. This is so whether one seeks, as I do, either to \"confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31\" as I see it, or, as I see it alternatively, \"to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31... leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"19\n\nVienna Convention, Art. 32.\n\nThis follows as well should one deem that the \"determination according to article 31... leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure,\" a result I also would find a tenable alternative to the Award's negative ruling.\n\n11.\n\nThere is unanimity among the experts closest to the ECT that the interpretation given to ECT Article 26(7) is untenable. A survey of over 20 articles and chapters20 demonstrates a universal understanding that paragraph (7) was included to ensure all investors have access to all arbitration options under the ECT. This interpretation is advanced in the work of leading scholars and experts in the field, including: Professor Thomas W\u00e4lde, who was a specialist in international investment law, an adviser to institutions in the oil and gas field, and editor of several publications on energy law; Graham Coop, one of the world's leading experts on the Energy Charter Treaty, having been for seven years the General Counsel to the Energy Charter Secretariat (the organization responsible for the Energy Charter Treaty);21 Craig Bamberger, former General Counsel of the International Energy Agency in Paris, who served as Chair of the Legal Advisory Committee to the Energy Charter Treaty negotiations;22 and Professor Adnan Amkhan, who served for four years as Head of the Legal Affairs Department of the Energy Charter Secretariat.23\n\nThe following sources of commentary on Article 26 and arbitration under the ECT were consulted in preparation of this dissenting opinion: CRINA BALTAG, THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: THE NOTION OF INVESTOR, International Arbitration Law Library, Vol. 25 (2012); THOMAS ROE & MATTHEW HAPPOLD, SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES UNDER THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY (James Dingemans QC, consultant ed., 2011); Stanimir A.

More information about his background and qualifications is available at http://www.menachambers.com/people/adnan-amkhan-bayno/.\n\n12.\n\nThe most detailed consideration of paragraph (7) is Professor Amkhan's article Consent to Submit Investment Disputes to Arbitration Under Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which provides a paragraph-by-paragraph summary and analysis of Article 26.24 He writes the following as regards paragraph (7):\n\nThe main aim of this paragraph is to fulfil the conditions required by Art.25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Art.1(6) of the Additional Facility Rule. These two articles provide that a juridical person (investor), who is a national of the respondent contracting party controlled by a foreign entity national of another contracting party has locus standi to bring arbitration or a conciliation claim under ICSID. In the ICSID Convention, this entitlement is conditional in that both states must agree to it. Paragraph (7) explicitly provides for such an agreement by all ECT contracting parties. However, even though this paragraph has been drafted in connection with ICSID and its Additional Facility, there are indications in the negotiation history that the main objective of this paragraph was:\n\n\"... to allow an Investor to have recourse to dispute settlement on behalf of a company that it owns or controls but that is established under the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party with which dispute settlement is sought.\"\n\nIt follows that the principle set out in para. (7) is applicable to all arbitration venues.\n\nIt is to be noted however that para. (7) applies only to investors who are juridical persons as defined in Art.1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT. Natural persons, to whom the concept of control is not applicable, are excluded.\n\nWhether the juridical person who is a national of the respondent contracting party is controlled by an investor of another contracting party is an objective condition is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine [sic].48\n\n48 Understanding 3 with respect to ECT Art.1(6) lists some of the factors which should be taken into consideration in determining whether an investment is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor.25\n\nAdnan Amkhan, Consent to Submit Investment Disputes to Arbitration Under Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty, INVESTMENT DISPUTES TO ARBITRATION Int. A.L.R. 65, 70 (2007). This appears to be the only paragraph-by-paragraph commentary on Article 26.\n\nId.\n\n13.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Professor Amkhan, after having consulted the ECT's negotiating history, has concluded that, \"the principle set out in para. (7) is applicable to all arbitration venues.\" Importantly, citing to Understanding 3, he notes \"[w]hether the juridical person who is a national of the respondent contracting party is controlled by an investor of another contracting party is an objective condition is a matter for the arbitral tribunal to determine [sic].\"26 Therefore, according to Professor Amkhan, paragraph (7) does not limit certain investors' access to arbitration institutions, but, quite to the contrary, ensures that all investors, within the meaning of Understanding 3, have access to all four ECT-approved arbitral options.\n\nId. All of the signatories to the Final Act adopted the Understandings with respect to the treaty and they \"should be given considerable weight\" as they \"reflect the contemporaneous views of all the signatories at the time of the adoption of the Treaty text.\" THOMAS ROE & MATTHEW HAPPOLD, SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES UNDER THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY 21 (James Dingemans QC, consultant ed., 2011).\n\n14.\n\nOther articles and books on the Treaty support this conclusion. In describing the kinds of investments and investors covered by the ECT, Professor Emmanuel Gaillard writes:\n\nIt is worthy of note that the ECT has envisaged the situation where a legal entity that defines as an \"investor\" under Article l(7) is in fact a national of the host State. In the event that such entity decides to bring a claim under the Washington Convention [ICSID], it needs [to] meet the requirement of Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention that it be considered as a national of another Contracting State. This situation is resolved under the ECT by Article 26(7), which provides that a legal entity that is incorporated in the host State will be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention if it is controlled by investors of another Contracting State.27\n\nEmmanuel Gaillard, Investments and Investors Covered by the Energy Charter Treaty, in INVESTMENT ARBITRATION AND THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY 54, 69 (Clarisse Ribeiro ed., 2006) (emphasis added).\n\n15.\n\nAccording to Gaillard, the \"situation\" paragraph (7) resolves is the potential problem of some investors not having access to ICSID arbitration; he rightly notes that paragraph (7) provides the necessary reference to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention so those investors are not excluded from ICSID. In resolving the \"situation\" there is no mention of limiting an investor's choice to ICSID Rules only, but instead acceptance that paragraph (7) was included to \"establish[] \u2018diversity' jurisdiction for an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Rules or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.\"28 Similarly, in Crina Baltag's The Energy Charter Treaty: The Notion of Investor, Chapter 3 includes a section entitled \"Investors of a Contracting Party Controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party,\" which examines paragraph (7). Baltag begins the section by noting that \"Investors are frequently required to carry out their investments through locally incorporated companies\" and explains the role Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention plays in ensuring access to ICSID arbitration for foreign-controlled juridical persons.29 After providing examples of how various arbitral Tribunals have interpreted Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Baltag explains:\n\nArticle 26(7) of the ECT contains the agreement of the Contracting Parties to treat a legal entity, \u2018which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing... and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party', as a national of another Contracting State, for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. This provision allows the control test to be applied in determining the nationality of a legal entity in the context of an arbitration submitted under the ICSID Convention, in addition to the incorporation test in Article 1(7) of the ECT. Consequently, legal entities that would normally be treated as nationals of the host Contracting Party and, thus, barred from bringing a dispute against this Contracting Party under Article 26 of the ECT, are allowed to do so if they are controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party.30\n\nAccording to Baltag, the purpose of paragraph (7) is to ensure that, for those arbitrations that have been brought under ICSID, the control test may be applied. In no way does she suggest that paragraph (7) was included to limit certain kinds of investors to arbitration under ICSID Rules only.31\n\nKaj Hob\u00e9r, Investment Arbitration and the Energy Charter Treaty, 1(1) J INT. DISP. SETTLEMENT 153, 154 (2010) (emphasis added).\n\nCRINA BALTAG, THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: THE NOTION OF INVESTOR, International Arbitration Law Library, Vol. 25, 112 (2012) (emphasis added).\n\nId. at 109.\n\nId. at 115, fn. 209. Admittedly, Baltag evidences some confusion when she suggests that: \"As to the relevance of Article 26(7) of the ECT when Investors opt for arbitration under the SCC or UNCITRAL Rules, this provision appears to be inapplicable\" and that \"[s]ome authors consider that there might be some room for SCC or UNCITRAL tribunals to apply the provision under Art. 26(7) of the ECT.\" Baltag suggests that a more cautious route for foreign-controlled investors would be for \"owners or shareholders of a locally incorporated company might consider submitting the dispute in their own name, relying instead on the provisions of Article 1(6) of the ECT on the definition of \u2018Investment.'\" However, as numerous individuals hold the 62 foreign-controlled investments, making it impractical to follow this approach, Claimants have not followed this option.\n\n16.\n\nAdditionally, commentary on Article 26 and arbitration under the ECT further confirms that paragraph (7) was included to accommodate the particular requirements of the ICSID Rules. Leading experts on the ECT are in agreement that Article 26 \"gives an investor the choice to submit an unresolved dispute, following a failure to resolve the dispute by negotiation\" to ICSID, UNCITRAL, the SCC, or other fora32 as it is \"the policy of the ECT to favour investors.\"33 Never do these experts suggest that paragraph (7) might limit some investors' choice to ICSID Rules.\n\nCraig Bamberger, Jan Linehan & Thomas W\u00e4lde, The Energy Charter Treaty, in ENERGY LAW IN EUROPE: NATIONAL, EU AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND INSTITUTIONS, 171, 184 (Martha M. Roggenkamp ed., 2001). In another publication, the same authors have also written that \"[p]erhaps the most important aspect of the ECT's investment regime is the Treaty's provision for compulsory arbitration against governments at the option of foreign investors, for alleged breaches of the Treaty's investment protections, without the need for a specific arbitral \u2018compromis'. Article 26 provides for the resolution of disputes... [and] gives an investor the choice\" of the fora to which it will submit the dispute. Craig Bamberger, Jan Linehan & Thomas W\u00e4lde, Energy Charter Treaty in 2000: in a New Phase, 18 J. ENERGY & NAT. RESOURCES L. 331, 334-35 (2000); see also Lucy Reed & Lucy Martinez, The Energy Charter Treaty: An Overview, 14 ILSA J. INT'L & COMP. L. 405, 427-28 (2007-2008) (noting, in their overview of ECT arbitration, that \"[t]he investor commences a claim under the ECT by filing a Request for Arbitration. The investor has the choice of arbitral institutions, and can choose among ICSID (or the Additional Facility if the respondent state has ratified the ECT but not the ICSID Convention, which is true, for example, for Poland), UNCITRAL ad hoc arbitration, or the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.\") (emphasis added).\n\nPhilippe Pinsolle, The Dispute Resolution Provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty, INVESTMENT DISPUTES TO ARBITRATION Int. A.L.R. 82, 83 (2007).\n\n17.\n\nInstead, all commentary on Article 26 of the ECT emphasizes the investor's choice. Craig Bamberger, who chaired the Legal Advisory Committee to the Energy Charter negotiations, writes:\n\nThe important Article 26 provides for the resolution of disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of a different Contracting Party \"relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III....\" [footnote omitted] It gives an investor the choice to submit an unresolved dispute, following a failure to resolve the dispute by negotiation: to the fora of the host state; in accordance with some other previously agreed procedure; or, for binding arbitration, to the investor's preference among the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), a forum established under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade (UNCITRAL), or a proceeding of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.34\n\nCraig Bamberger, An Overview of the Energy Charter Treaty, in THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: AN EAST-WEST GATEWAY FOR INVESTMENT AND TRADE 1, 15 (Thomas W\u00e4lde ed., 1996) (emphasis in original).\n\n18.\n\nBamberger also wrote The Energy Charter Treaty: a description of its provisions, published by the Legal Counsel of the International Energy Agency. Similar to the excerpt above, the publication includes no commentary on paragraph (7) specifically, but its summary of Article 26 emphasizes a choice of \"the investor's preference among\" the various arbitral institutions and Rules. The only exceptions to \"unconditional consent to ICSID, UNCITRAL or Stockholm arbitration\" discussed by Bamberger is 26(3)(b), which concerns a lack of consent to arbitration where the dispute has previously been submitted to other courts or tribunals.35\n\nLegal Counsel of the Int'l Energy Agency, The Energy Charter Treaty: A Description of its Provisions (1995).\n\n19.\n\nOther experts have reached the same conclusion, and like Bamberger none mentions paragraph (7) when discussing exceptions to the investor's choice in Article 26 arbitration. For example, Thomas W\u00e4lde wrote that \"[i]nvestors, and only investors, may choose national courts, a previously agreed dispute settlement procedure, or arbitration under ICSID, UNCITRAL or Stockholm Chamber of Commerce arbitration rules.\"36 Importantly, W\u00e4lde qualifies this statement with a footnote acknowledging that \"[t]here are some limitations,\" but then discusses only Articles 26(3)(c) and 26(4).37 Absent from his discussion of \"limitations\" is any reference to Article 26(7). Surely, if W\u00e4lde perceived that paragraph (7) restricted an investor's choice to certain arbitration rules or institutions then he would have included this when discussing the other limitations.38\n\nThomas W\u00e4lde, International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty: Legal, Negotiating and Policy Implications for International Investors within Western and Commonwealth of Independent States/Eastern European Countries, in THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: AN EAST-WEST GATEWAY FOR INVESTMENT AND TRADE 251, 305 (Thomas W\u00e4lde ed., 1996). In his writings, W\u00e4lde consistently emphasized the point of the investor's choice. For example, in another publication he wrote that whether or not to go to arbitration was \"the choice of the investor (only)\" and that \"[e]ach contracting party (i.e. states and the EC) give \u2018unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration' and this consent, given by signature of the Treaty is considered to satisfy the requirements of these four arbitral options.\" Thomas W\u00e4lde, Investment Arbitration Under the Energy Charter Treaty: From Dispute Settlement to Treaty Implementation, 12 ARBITRATION INT'L, Issue 4, 429, 449 (Kluwer Law Int'l 1996).\n\nThomas W\u00e4lde, International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty: Legal, Negotiating and Policy Implications for International Investors within Western and Commonwealth of Independent States/Eastern European Countries, in THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY: AN EAST-WEST GATEWAY FOR INVESTMENT AND TRADE 251, fn. 202 (Thomas W\u00e4lde ed., 1996). W\u00e4lde continues: \"There are some limitations: under Article 26(3)(c), countries can opt out of the mandatory investment arbitration for \u2018sanctity of contract' disputes-presumably mainly mineral concessions. It is not surprising that Norway, Canada and Australia have exercised this opt-out as listed in Annex IA. Annex ID countries \u2013 seventeen are named in the Annex \u2013 will not allow an investor having embarked on contractually provided arbitration or litigation with national courts to switch to Article 26(4) investment arbitration.\" Id.\n\nId.\n\n20.\n\nIn conclusion, the Award's finding as regards ECT Article 26(7) in my view is simply wrong, whether interpreted according only to VCLT Article 31, or instead by reaching to VCLT Article 32, and is in conflict with the interpretive process applied in relation to the \"Svalbard exception.\"39\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, my concurrence extends to the Award\u2019s rejection of the Claimants\u2019 MFN argument."}], "Content": "Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction\n---------------------------------\n\n**ABBREVIATIONS**\n-----------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Abaclat* | *Abaclat et al. v.

Overview of the Dispute**\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe present dispute arises from a series of measures enacted by Spain in the solar photovoltaic (\"PV\") electricity generation sector. According to the Claimants, these measures have altered the regulatory regime which was in place when they carried out their investments and have resulted in substantial losses for the Claimants. The latter argue that Spain has thereby breached several of its obligations under the ECT.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants contend that in 2007, in order to attract investments in the PV sector, Spain issued Royal Decree No. 661 of 25 May 2007 (\"RD 661/2007\"), which provided certain investment incentives to qualifying PV installations. In particular, according to the Claimants, RD 661/2007 provided that qualifying PV installations would receive a fixed, lifetime \"feed-in-tariff\" (\"FIT\") for all electricity generated. A FIT is essentially a fixed tariff which is set at a rate above normal electricity market rates.2 According to the Claimants, RD 661/2007 also provided that any future changes to the FIT would not affect existing investors.3 The Claimants submit that they made their investments relying on these incentives and that they would not have made their investments without them.\n\nSoC, para. 6.\n\nNoA, para. 43; SoC, paras. 10, 155-157.\n\n8.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, once the investment was made and Spain was receiving the benefits of that investment, it withdrew the incentives.4 In particular, they contend that, between late 2008 and early 2011, Spain took a series of actions which fundamentally altered the legal framework of the Claimants\u2019 investment and, therefore, violated the ECT. First, on 19 November 2010, Spain passed Royal Decree No. 1565/2010 (\"RD 1565/2010\"), which limited the right of PV installations to receive the FIT to the first 25 years of the installations\u2019 existence. Subsequently, on 23 December 2010, Spain passed Royal Decree Law No. 14/2010 (\"RDL 14/2010\"), which cut the FIT by limiting the number of operating hours in which the FIT was available to installations registered under RD 661/2007.5\n\nNoA, para. 10.\n\nNoA, paras. 69-77.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Spain, through these measures, has violated obligations that it owed to the Claimants as foreign investors under the ECT. In particular, the Claimants contend that Spain has breached the obligations set out in Article 10 of the ECT, including the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment;6 the obligation not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoinment or disposal of the Claimants\u2019 investments;7 and the obligation to provide constant protection and security.8\n\nSoC, paras. 358-396.\n\nSoC, paras. 397-403.\n\nSoC, paras. 404-408.\n\n10.\n\nBeginning in March 2011, each of the Claimants notified Spain of their intention to commence arbitration proceedings in accordance with the requirements of Article 26(2) of the ECT, if the dispute could not be resolved.9 An unsuccessful meeting between the Claimants and Government officials was held on 15 June 2011.10\n\nNoA, para. 96. Annex A to the NoA sets out the dates on which each Claimant made their respective requests for amicable settlement of the dispute pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT.\n\nNoA, para. 97.\n\n11.\n\nOn 16 November 2011, the Claimants submitted a Notice of Arbitration, accompanied by an Annex A describing the Claimants.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 1 May 2012. It is composed of The Honorable Charles N. Brower, appointed by the Claimants; of Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, appointed by the Respondent; and of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Presiding Arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators, with the consent of the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn 4 July 2012, in compliance with the agenda set out in the Presiding Arbitrator\u2019s letter of 13 June 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties held an initial procedural hearing in Geneva to discuss various procedural matters. In particular, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed, agreed and executed the Terms of Appointment in English and Spanish versions (the \"Terms of Appointment\"). The Parties submitted their respective powers of attorney authorizing the signature of the Terms of Appointment and confirmed that they had no objections to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and to the appointment of the Arbitrators.11 Mr. Gustavo Laborde was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal with the consent of the Parties.12 The Tribunal and the Parties also discussed and agreed on the Procedural Rules of the arbitration,13 and discussed the calendar for the arbitration.14 The Parties and the Tribunal agreed that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") would act as Registry in the arbitration proceedings.15\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 2.3.\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 2.4.\n\nA final and signed copy of the Procedural Rules was transmitted to the Parties on 20 July 2012.\n\nThe calendar of this arbitration was attached as Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 of 31 July 2012 (\"PO1\").\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 8.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the initial procedural hearing of 4 July 2012, the Tribunal also decided that the arbitration would be conducted in both English and Spanish.16\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 5.1.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 July 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\") addressing certain procedural matters and the provisional calendar as discussed during the initial procedural hearing on 4 July 2012. Among other things, the Tribunal established a timeframe within which the Parties should present their submissions on the legal seat of the arbitration and report on the practicalities relating to the bilingual nature of the arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nThe Parties filed initial submissions on the implementation of a bilingual arbitration on 1 August 2012 and reply submissions on 13 August 2012. On 23 August 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO2\") setting forth the details for the implementation of the bilingual arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nThe Parties filed their initial submissions on the seat of the arbitration on 19 July 2012, with reply submissions following on 27 July 2012. On 16 November 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO3\"), in which it determined the place of arbitration within the meaning of Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Rules to be Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n18.\n\nOn 28 September 2012, the Claimants filed their Statement of Claim (\"SoC\"), accompanied by 14 witness statements, one expert report and 279 exhibits.\n\n19.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar, on 11 January 2013, the Respondent made an application for the bifurcation of the proceedings into a jurisdictional phase and a liability phase (the \"Application for Bifurcation\" or \"Jurisdictional Objections\").17 Together with the Application for Bifurcation, Spain submitted five objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and a further separate Jurisdictional Objection to the Consolidation of Multiple Arbitral Claims (the \"Aggregation Objection\").18 The Respondent contended that the issue of the aggregation of claims had to be addressed not only before the merits but also before the five other jurisdictional objections. On 1 February 2013, the Claimants filed an Answer to the Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation. The Claimants requested that Spain\u2019s Application for Bifurcation be denied, including Spain's request that the Objection to Aggregation be decided as a preliminary question. On 28 February 2013, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO4\"), in which it granted the Respondent's request to bifurcate the arbitration proceedings into a jurisdictional phase and a liability phase, and denied the Respondent's request that the Aggregation Objection be dealt with before the other five objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation and Jurisdictional Objections of 11 January 2013 is referred to either as \"Application for Bifurcation\" or as \"Jurisdictional Objections\" depending on the context.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO4\"), the Tribunal noted that the term \"aggregation\" was more appropriate than \"consolidation\", since consolidation generally implies that pending parallel proceedings are joined into a single proceeding, a situation not present in this arbitration. See PO4, p. 2, fn. 1. See also *infra,* para. 93 (explaining in what sense the Tribunal will use the terms \"aggregate proceedings\" and \"consolidation\" for the purpose of this Award).\n\n20.\n\nOn 7 March 2013, the Claimants made an application for document disclosure and, in the alternative, for a time extension to file their Answer on Jurisdiction. The Respondent answered to the Claimants' application by electronic communication on 12 March 2013, objecting to the Claimants' disclosure request. On that same date, each party sent an additional electronic communication in reply to the other party's communication. In its Procedural Order No. 5 of 14 March 2013 (\"PO5\"), the Arbitral Tribunal denied the Claimants' request for document disclosure and granted the Claimants' request for a time extension to file their Answer on Jurisdiction until 30 April 2013.\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 April 2013, the Claimants submitted their Answer to Spain's Objection to Consolidation and Jurisdictional Objections (\"Answer on Jurisdiction\" or \"C-Answer\").\n\n22.\n\nOn 8 May 2013, the Tribunal and the Parties held a conference call for the purpose of discussing the next procedural steps of the jurisdictional phase. During the telephone conference, among other subjects addressed, Spain objected to the admissibility of the additional evidence submitted by the Claimants with the Answer on Jurisdiction of 30 April 2013 (the \"Admissibility Objection\"). In particular, Spain made an oral application for leave to file written submissions on the Admissibility Objection. The Claimants, in turn, pointed out that the issue had already been briefed. On 10 May 2013, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file written submissions on the Admissibility Objection, setting out a timetable for that purpose. Spain filed its submission on 24 May 2013 and the Claimants replied on 7 June 2013. On 1 July 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (\"PO6\"), whereby it denied Spain's Admissibility Objection and admitted the additional evidence submitted by the Claimants with their Answer on Jurisdiction into the record.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 19 July 2013, the Tribunal set out the calendar for the remaining portion of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration.\n\n24.\n\nOn 25 September 2013, Dr. Michele Potest\u00e0 was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal, with the consent of the Parties, in replacement of Mr. Laborde.\n\n25.\n\nOn 30 September 2013, the Respondent submitted its Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Answer to the Objection to the Consolidation of Multiple Claims and Jurisdictional Objections (\"Reply\" or \"R-Reply\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 16 December 2013, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"Rejoinder\" or \"C-Rejoinder\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 7 January 2014, the Parties and the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference to discuss the organization of the upcoming hearing on jurisdiction. On 10 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\"PO7\") on the organization of the hearing.\n\n28.\n\nOn 31 January 2014, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the PCA at the Peace Palace in The Hague (\"Hearing\"). The following persons participated in the Hearing:\n\n**Arbitral Tribunal:**  \nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (President)  \nThe Hon. Charles N. Brower  \nJudge Bernardo Sep\u00falveda-Amor\n\n**Secretary of the Tribunal:**  \nDr. Michele Potest\u00e0\n\n**For the Claimants:**  \nMs. Judith Gill QC  \nMr. Jeffrey Sullivan  \nMr. Ignacio Madalena  \nMr. \u00cd\u00f1igo Gort\u00e1zar  \nMr. Rafael Cruz  \nMs. Rebeca Quiroga  \nMr. Enrique Collado  \nMr. Luis Quiroga  \nMr. Tom Murley  \nMr. Andrew Jessop  \nMr. Roger Scherer  \nMr. J\u00fcrgen Voss  \nMr. Ra\u00fal Barrueco\n\n**For the Respondent:**  \nMr. Christian Leathley  \nMr. Eduardo Soler Tappa  \nMr. Miguel Ria\u00f1o  \nMs. Pilar Colomes  \nMr. Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mara  \nMr. Diego Santacruz  \nMs. Maria Florencia Villaggi\n\n**Registry - PCA:**  \nDr. Aloysius P.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia* (PCA Case No. 2011-17) (hereinafter \"*Rurelec*\"),19 which discusses, among other issues, an objection to jurisdiction based on aggregation of multiple claims. By letter of 7 February 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the *Rurelec* tribunal\u2019s decision in respect of the aggregation of multiple claims. On 28 February 2014, the Parties submitted their comments. The Respondent\u2019s submission on *Rurelec* prompted an objection from the Claimants, which is dealt by the Tribunal *infra* in this Award.20\n\n*Guaracachi America, Inc. and Rurelec Plc. v. The Plurinational State of Bolivia,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2011-17, Award, 31 January 2014, available at http://www.pca-cpa.org.\n\nSee *infra,* paras. 57-59.\n\n31.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, the Parties submitted their respective cost statements. On 26 February 2014, in view of the Claimants\u2019 more extensive \"submissions on costs\" filed on 21 February 2014, the Tribunal gave an opportunity to the Respondent to comment on such submissions. The Respondent provided its comments on 7 March 2014.\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide an overview of the Parties' positions. The Parties' detailed positions with respect to each objection are described in Section IV below (Analysis).\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position and Request for Relief**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Respondent has put forward one objection to the aggregation of multiple arbitral claims and five further jurisdictional objections.\n\n34.\n\n*First,* the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with multiple claims in one single proceeding, because it has not consented to the aggregation of multiple claims. Article 26 of the ECT only provides for consent to arbitrate, but not for consent to arbitrate in multi-party proceedings. The silence in the ECT as to this latter aspect cannot be interpreted as acquiescence. For Spain, in the same way as consent of both Parties would be needed for *ex post* consolidation of separate ongoing arbitration, so too consent is needed when the aggregation of claims has been pursued from the outset as a result of the Claimants' joint notice of arbitration. In addition, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear multiple claims, the Respondent contends that it would not be suitable to hear such claims for reasons of procedural due process. The heterogeneity of the claims would make the proceedings unmanageable and potentially unfair for the Respondent.\n\n35.\n\n*Second,* Spain initially requested the Tribunal to decide whether it is satisfied that sufficient evidence has been provided to prove that each of the Claimants has the requisite standing, and to determine whether each of the Claimants is an \"investor\" with qualifying \"investments\" under the ECT. For the Respondent, the Claimants must establish at the jurisdictional stage that the jurisdictional requirements of the treaty which they invoke are met, which includes providing the facts necessary to meet these requirements. At the Hearing, the Respondent stated that it was not further pursuing this jurisdictional objection.21\n\nSee Hearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 148: 19-25; and 149: 1-9.\n\n36.\n\n*Third,* the Respondent argues that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with an intra-EU dispute. Under the ECT, the Respondent contends, intra-EU investment disputes fall within the sphere of the EU internal market and therefore cannot be resolved under the dispute resolution mechanisms envisaged under the ECT. The proper interpretation of ECT Article 26(1) is that a tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT only if there is a diversity of \"Areas\" (as defined in the ECT) between the Contracting Party from which the claimants are and the respondent state. In this case, all of the Claimants come from EU member states (Germany, Spain, The Netherlands and Luxembourg), the Respondent is an EU member state and all of the alleged investments have taken place within the EU. As such, there is no diversity of Areas in an intra-EU dispute of this kind. The fact that all of the states involved were already members of the EU (then, the European Community) when the ECT was ratified reinforces, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, the conclusion that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the claims advanced in these proceedings.\n\n37.\n\n*Fourth,* according to Spain, the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants have failed to make a *prima facie* showing that they have suffered financial harm as a result of the measures of which they complain. Spain contends that a claimant must establish at a jurisdictional stage that the facts relied upon, when tested on a *prima facie* basis, could amount to a breach of a Treaty obligation. Spain also contends that an allegation of a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT (fair and equitable treatment) requires a showing of financial harm. Spain argues that even if all the facts alleged in the Claimants\u2019 Statement of Claim were established, no loss would be proven and no breach of either FET or legitimate expectations would have been alleged. The Respondent submits that because the Claimants have failed to establish that there is a dispute concerning \"an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part III\" of the ECT (Article 26(1) of the ECT), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n38.\n\n*Fifth,* Spain contends that 62 of the 88 Claimants are companies incorporated in Spain. As such, they are not entitled to bring an ECT claim under the UNCITRAL Rules against Spain. According to the Respondent, Article 26 of the ECT on investor-state arbitration provides, as a general rule, a diversity of nationality requirement. The only exception to such requirement is set out in Article 26(7) of the ECT which allows locally incorporated companies under foreign control to bring claims against the host state. Yet, this provision is, by its own terms, only applicable with respect to ICSID arbitrations, and does not apply to arbitrations commenced under the UNCITRAL Rules. Therefore, Spain states that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the 62 entities incorporated in Spain.\n\n39.\n\n*Sixth,* Spain argues that Ceconat Energy GmbH (\"Ceconat Germany\") has no standing to bring an ECT claim, because it has already pursued dispute resolution in the Spanish courts, thus triggering the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT. Ceconat Germany allegedly triggered the fork-in-the-road clause when Roger Scherer, who owns 50% of Ceconat Germany, and 34 Spanish Special Purpose Vehicles (\"SPVs\"), who are indirectly owned and controlled by Ceconat Germany, filed a petition before the Supreme Court of Spain seeking the reinstatement of benefits abrogated by RD 1565/2010. While the 34 SPVs have withdrawn their domestic court claims, such withdrawal occurred after the NoA had been filed, and thus the fork-in-the-road clause had already been triggered.\n\n40.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Respondent requests the following relief:\n\n330. [...] to dismiss the Claimants\u2019 claims on the basis of lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that:\n\na) In relation to the numerous parties involved and the claims commenced in this arbitration, the Respondent has never provided its consent to being subjected to a unilateral decision of the Claimants to consolidate 88 claimants in one proceeding;\n\nb) The dispute resolution provisions of the ECT do not apply to this arbitration given that this is an intra-EU dispute;\n\nc) The Claimants have failed to establish a *prima facie* case that financial harm has been suffered and, therefore, no claim or dispute has been made out pursuant to Article 26(1);\n\nd) In relation to the 62 Spanish claimants identified in paragraph 252 of the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, Article 26(7) does not permit their respective claims to be brought in an UNCITRAL arbitration; and\n\ne) Spain has not provided the requisite consent under Article 26(3)(b)(i) to permit Ceconat Energy GmbH's claims to be brought in this arbitration.\n\n331. In relation to the Respondent's objection to the standing of the Claimants, the Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal decides whether it is satisfied that sufficient evidence has been provided to prove that each of the 88 Claimants has the requisite standing, and specifically determines whether each of the Claimants is an \"investor\" with qualifying \"investments\" under the ECT.\n\n332. The Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to bear all of the costs of this arbitration and to reimburse the Respondent in respect of all legal and other costs and expenses in connection with this arbitration. In addition, and without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, the Respondent requests that the Claimants are ordered to pay all of the Respondent\u2019s costs in relation to the preparation of its objection to the Claimant\u2019s [sic] *ius standi.*22\n\nR-Reply, paras. 330-332. As mentioned in fn. 21 above, the Respondent decided not to further pursue the objection set out in para. 331 of the R-Reply.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position and Request for Relief**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions, the Claimants have replied to the Respondent\u2019s objections with the following arguments:\n\n42.\n\n*First,* the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear all of the Claimants\u2019 claims in one arbitration. Article 26 of the ECT does not provide that a respondent state must specifically consent to aggregate proceedings. If there exists mutual consent to arbitrate the particular dispute submitted to an arbitral tribunal, the tribunal has jurisdiction and it does not lose this jurisdiction simply because there are multiple claimants. The Claimants submit that to uphold jurisdiction over multiple claimants would be in line with the over 120 multi-party investor-state cases in which the tribunals took no issue of the multiple number of claimants. The Claimants further deny that aggregate proceedings would result in procedural unfairness towards the Respondent. To the contrary, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that aggregate proceedings would promote cost-efficiency, avoidance of unnecessary delay and consistency of outcome.\n\n43.\n\n*Second,* the Claimants argue that the \"sufficiency of evidence\" objection presented by Spain has been abandoned and therefore is no longer an issue before the Tribunal. The Tribunal in PO6 accepted into evidence the Claimants\u2019 additional documents filed to support their nationality and ownership of the investments. Because the Respondent has not identified any shortcomings in the evidence produced nor queried the veracity or probative value of any of such evidence, the Respondent accepts that the Claimants have established that they are \"investors\" with qualifying \"investments\" under the ECT.\n\n44.\n\n*Third,* the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over an intra-EU dispute. The Claimants submit that the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT in its context, taking into account the object and purpose of the treaty, is clear: investors from one Contracting Party may bring an arbitral claim against another Contracting Party concerning a dispute arising out of an investment in the territory of that Contracting Party. In the absence of a disconnection clause, the Claimants argue, the ECT applies also in relations among EU member states. The Claimants note that to date every tribunal and court which has addressed an intra-EU objection has accepted jurisdiction. Contrary to what the Respondent submits, this conclusion applies *a fortiori* where the states involved were all part of the EU at the time the ECT was signed, as in the present dispute.\n\n45.\n\n*Fourth,* the Claimants submit that Spain\u2019s objection relating to the Claimants\u2019 alleged failure to make a *prima facie* showing that they have suffered financial harm must be rejected. The Claimants do not dispute that in order to invoke the ECT\u2019s dispute resolution provision, the investor must show \"an alleged breach of an obligation\" under Part III of the Treaty. However, they contend that, at the jurisdictional stage, a tribunal simply needs to be satisfied that the facts relied upon by the Claimants may *prima facie* amount to a breach of an obligation. Such *prima facie* demonstration does not require a showing of damages. In any event, the Claimants submit that assuming *arguendo* that they must make a *prima facie* showing of financial harm, they have met this requirement.\n\n46.\n\n*Fifth,* the Claimants submit that entities incorporated in Spain which are under foreign control have standing to bring an UNCITRAL arbitration claim against Spain pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT. For the Claimants, locally incorporated entities under foreign control are entitled to bring an ECT claim under any of the arbitration rules listed in Article 26 (i.e., ICSID, ICSID Additional Facility, UNCITRAL, and SCC Rules). The fact that Article 26(7) of the ECT only mentions ICSID arbitration is due to the fact that the ICSID Convention contains separate jurisdictional requirements that must be met in addition to the ECT jurisdictional requirements. Because the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain such separate jurisdictional requirements, there was no reason for the ECT to provide an explicit carve-out with respect to these latter rules. Therefore, the Spanish entities which are subject to foreign control have standing to bring an UNCITRAL arbitration claim against the Respondent. Finally, if the limitation in Article 26(7) of the ECT were found to apply in respect of the Spanish entities, the Claimants would - through the most-favored-nation (\"MFN\") clause in the ECT - invoke the more favorable treatment in a third party BIT which allows Spanish entities to sue under the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n47.\n\n*Sixth,* the Claimants contend that the fork-in-the-road clause does not bar Ceconat Germany's treaty claims. The Claimants argue that the fork-in-the-road clause was never triggered because the petition filed by the 34 Spanish SPVs was withdrawn before the Supreme Court issued a decision, in compliance with Spain's statement made in relation to the fork-in-the-road-clause in the ECT. Furthermore, for the fork-in-the-road to apply, the so-called \"triple identity test\" must be met, which is not the case here, since the parties in the two proceedings, the subject matter in the two disputes as well as the causes of action are different. Finally, if the fork-in-the-road were to apply, the Claimants would - through the MFN clause in the ECT - be able to invoke the dispute settlement provision in a third party BIT which does not contain the fork-in-the-road clause, and is thus more favorable to them.\n\n48.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Claimants request that:\n\n[...] the Tribunal enter an award on jurisdiction in their favour against Spain as follows:\n\n(i) dismissing Spain's objections;\n\n(ii) declaring that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear multiple arbitral claims in one proceeding;\n\n(iii) declaring that the Claimants have produced sufficient evidence proving that they are investors with qualifying investments, within the meaning of the ECT, in the area of Spain;\n\n(iv) declaring that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to deal with a dispute where the Claimants are nationals of EU States and that Spain is an EU State;\n\n(v) declaring that, to the extent necessary, the Claimants have presented a *prima facie* case of financial harm;\n\n(vi) declaring that the KGAL entities La Solana 1 S.L. to La Solana 60 S.L. have standing to bring their claims against Spain under the ECT;\n\n(vii) declaring that AES Solar Espa\u00f1a Finance S.L. and AES Solar Espa\u00f1a B.V. y CIA S.C. have standing to bring their claims against Spain under the ECT; and\n\n(viii) declaring that Ceconat Energy GmbH's claims are not precluded by Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT.23\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 162.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, the Claimants request that the Tribunal direct Spain \"to bear all of the Claimants\u2019 legal fees and costs associated with its jurisdictional objections as well as all of the Tribunal\u2019s costs and related administrative expenses\".24\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 163.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n50.\n\nPrior to considering the merits of the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal will address the scope of this Award (1); the relevance of previous decisions or awards (2); and the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (3). It will also address an outstanding request by the Claimants in relation to the Respondent\u2019s submission on *Rurelec* (4).\n\n**1. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction and liability in PO4. The Tribunal decided that it would deal with both the Aggregation Objection and the further five jurisdictional objections at the same time.25 The present Award thus addresses both the Aggregation Objection and the five further objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nSee *supra,* para. 19.\n\n**2. The relevance of previous decisions or awards**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to the specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law.\n\n**3. Law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is governed by the ECT, the relevant provisions of which are reproduced below when dealing with each jurisdictional objection.26\n\nTo the extent relevant to determine issues of jurisdiction where jurisdiction is founded, as in this case, upon an investment treaty, Article 178(2) of the Swiss Private International Law Act (\"PILA\"), which is the *lex arbitri,* refers in relation to the substantive validity of the arbitration agreement to the ECT (and international law) as the \"law governing the subject-matter of the dispute\". As to the formal validity, Article 178(1) of the PILA requires an agreement in writing, which requirement is met here.\n\n55.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the interpretation of the ECT is governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\"VCLT\").27\n\nSpain, The Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg (the Respondent state as well as the home states of the Claimants) are all contracting parties to the VCLT.\n\n56.\n\nIt is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.28\n\nArt. 23(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules; Art. 186(1) of the PILA.\n\n**4. The question concerning the Respondent\u2019s submission on** ***Rurelec***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nBefore delving into the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal has to rule upon a request made by the Claimants in respect of the Respondent\u2019s submission dated 28 February 2014 on *Rurelec* (see *supra,* para. 30).\n\n58.\n\nBy letter of 4 March 2014, the Claimants argued that sections 3 and 4 of the Respondent\u2019s submission on *Rurelec* were not responsive to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 7 February 2014, but rather to arguments made by the Claimants during the Hearing. The Claimants therefore requested that the Tribunal strike from the record those sections of Spain\u2019s submission on *Rurelec* and direct Spain to submit a revised submission containing sections 1 and 2 only. By letter of 11 March 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent\u2019s comments on the Claimants\u2019 request, and held that it would thereafter either render a decision on this issue or keep it for determination within the context of its decision on jurisdiction. By letter of 21 March 2014, the Respondent provided its views as to why the entire submission in relation to *Rurelec* should remain in the record.\n\n59.\n\nIt is undisputed that sections 1 and 2 of the Respondent\u2019s submission directly address the *Rurelec* award, and clearly conform to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of 7 February 2014. Sections 3 and 4 address issues relating to the Aggregation Objection more generally and are not strictly confined to the *Rurelec* award. In its invitation of 4 February 2014, the Tribunal essentially aimed at seeking the Parties\u2019 views on the issue of aggregation of claims as reflected in *Rurelec* and it was not absolutely clear what would be within or without the scope of the invitation. Although the Respondent\u2019s submission is broadly framed, the Tribunal does not find its sections 3 and 4 outside the scope of its invitation. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s submission on *Rurelec* shall remain on record in its entirety.\n\n**B. Objection to the Aggregation of Multiple Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nFirst of all, Spain objects to the Tribunal dealing with multiple claims in aggregate proceedings. When first presenting this objection, Spain noted that \"[w]hether the Respondent\u2019s objection to consolidated proceedings is an issue of jurisdiction, admissibility or procedure/case management, is not the primary concern\".29 Yet, both Spain\u2019s Aggregation Objection and its Reply evinced that such objection has two different facets. First, Spain objects to the Tribunal hearing multiple claims in aggregate proceedings because the requisite consent to such aggregation is lacking.30 Such objection, being framed as a matter of consent, thus clearly goes to jurisdiction. Spain\u2019s second concern with respect to the aggregation of multiple claims is one of case management and/or due process.31 The two grounds will be analyzed in turn.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 4.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 7-26.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 28-47.\n\n**a. Consent to the aggregation of multiple claims**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nFirst, Spain argues that, where several investors together commence one arbitration against a host state, specific consent of the respondent host state is required and no such consent was given in this case.\n\n62.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is no language in the ECT to evidence \"clear and unconditional consent\" to aggregate proceedings.32 Consent to *aggregate* claims is independent of consent to *arbitrate* claims. Arbitration with multiple parties includes \"two instances of consent\"33 and \"is subject to a dual test\".34 First, there must be consent to arbitration and, second, there must be consent to arbitrate in multi-party proceedings.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 17.\n\nR-Reply, para. 17.\n\nR-Reply, para. 25\n\n63.\n\nFor the Respondent, Article 26 of the ECT does not contain such second-level consent. Because consent in international arbitration (especially where a state is involved) must be \"clear\" and \"unambiguous\",35 the ECT's silence cannot be interpreted to support the existence of jurisdiction. If the parties decided not to address consent in respect of arbitrations with multiple parties, it is because they did not want to provide for such type of arbitration.36 It would be contrary to the VCLT, Spain contends, to interpret the ECT's silence on the aggregation of multiple claims as acquiescence.37 The Respondent also points to the fact that Article 26 of the ECT does not refer to \"investors\" as a collective, but speaks of \"[i]nvestor\" in the singular.38\n\nR-Reply, para. 19.\n\nR-Reply, para. 19.\n\nR-Reply, para. 7.\n\nR-Reply, para. 24.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that no consent to aggregate proceedings may be found in the UNCITRAL Rules. The fact that, pursuant to Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has the power to \"conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate\" does not evidence consent to aggregate proceedings.39\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 23.\n\n65.\n\nFinally, the present situation is no different from the one where claims are brought in separate proceedings and then consolidated as both instances require the consent of the respondent for the \"consolidation\".40\n\nR-Reply, para. 22.\n\n66.\n\nIn contradistinction, the Claimants contend that Article 26 of the ECT does not provide that a respondent host state must specifically consent to aggregate proceedings. Article 26(3) sets forth that the Contracting Parties provide \"unconditional consent\" which is \"subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c)\". Those subparagraphs in turn refer to limitations posed by certain Contracting Parties in respect of disputes previously submitted to another forum and with respect to the umbrella clause contained in Article 10(1).41 Because the consent is expressly said to be \"unconditional\", the imposition by a tribunal of any additional jurisdictional requirements, such as a requirement for specific consent to aggregate proceedings, would be inconsistent with the basic rules of treaty interpretation laid down in the VCLT.42\n\nC-Answer, para. 32.\n\nC-Answer, para. 33.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute that the Tribunal must satisfy itself that the conditions for jurisdiction are met in respect of each claimant.43 However, the inquiry is not different from any other claim under the ECT, whether it involves one or multiple claimants. If there exists mutual consent to arbitrate a particular dispute, the tribunal has jurisdiction and it does not lose it because there are multiple claimants.44\n\nSoC, para. 347. See also C-Rejoinder, para. 60 (\"It is common ground that each Claimant must satisfy the conditions for jurisdiction\").\n\nSoC, para. 347.\n\n68.\n\nNeither do the UNCITRAL Rules contain a requirement for specific consent to aggregate proceedings, which is not surprising because their sole function is to provide the procedural framework for the management of the arbitration.45 If anything, the 2010 revisions of the Rules show that numerous amendments were made to the 1976 text in order to facilitate multi-party arbitration to the extent necessary.46\n\nC-Answer, para. 88.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 91-93.\n\n69.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants take issue with Spain's use of the term \"consolidation\". Consolidation has a settled meaning in arbitration, namely the joinder of two or more pending arbitrations into one.47 While the Claimants concede that \"consent is necessary to the consolidation of separate proceedings\",48 they contend that the situation is different when, as in the present case, there is an original submission of a claim by a plurality of claimants in one proceeding. In this latter scenario, there is no need for specific consent.49\n\nC-Answer, para. 94.\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 29.\n\nC-Answer, para. 96; C-Rejoinder, para. 29.\n\n70.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants submit that commercial and investment arbitration must be distinguished. While consent in commercial arbitration arises from a direct contractual agreement between specific and identifiable parties, the nature of consent in investment treaty arbitration is entirely different. A state makes a unilateral offer to arbitrate which can be accepted by any investor meeting the conditions of the treaty.50\n\nC-Answer, paras. 98-99.\n\n71.\n\nThe Parties have discussed a number of investor-state cases which involved multiple claimants and have drawn opposite conclusions. In Spain's view, investor-state cases involving more than one claimant are irrelevant here, as in those cases the respondent did not object to jurisdiction on such ground and thus consented to multi-party arbitration.51 With specific regard to ICSID cases with multiple claimants, the Respondent contends that they lack relevance for present purposes because they arose in a different legal framework.52\n\nAggregation Objection, paras. 18, 22.\n\nR-Reply, para. 13.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants, on the contrary, submit that there have been over 120 multi-party investor-state arbitration cases and that aggregate proceedings are a common feature of investor-state arbitration. The fact that no respondent raised an objection on this ground only shows that such objection is without merit. Furthermore, the Claimants underscore that a tribunal presiding over an international arbitration would always be able to review its jurisdiction *sua sponte.53* It is thus indicative that in none of those cases the tribunal saw the number of claimants as a bar to jurisdiction.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 36-38.\n\n73.\n\nAmong others, the Parties have discussed *Abaclat et al. v. Argentina;54 Ambiente Ufficio et al. v. Argentina;55 Funnekotter et al. v. Zimbabwe;56* and *Noble Energy and MachalaPower v. Ecuador57* arguing either for or against the relevance of these decisions. Following the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Parties also submitted comments on the recent award in *Rurelec.*\n\n*Abaclat et al. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 4 August 2011 (\"*Abaclat*\") (**Exh. CLA-39**).\n\n*Ambiente Ufficio S.p.A. et al. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 8 February 2013 (\"*Ambiente*\") (**Exh. CLA-121**).\n\n*Bernardus Henricus Funnekotter et al. v. Republic of Zimbabwe,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/6, Award, 22 April 2009 *(\"Funnekotter\")* (**Exh. CLA-98**).\n\n*Noble Energy, Inc. and MachalaPower Cia. Ltda. v. the Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 5 March 2008 *(\"\u2018Noble Energy\")* (**Exh. CLA-33**).\n\n74.\n\n*Abaclat* concerns a dispute between some 60,000 bondholders and Argentina which is currently pending before an ICSID tribunal. It is Spain\u2019s submission that the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility issued by the majority in *Abaclat,* which found *inter alia* that Argentina\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID covered claims by multiple claimants in one arbitration, does not support the Claimants in these proceedings for the following reasons.\n\n75.\n\nFirst, *Abaclat* is not relevant because, unlike here, the phase of the proceedings with which the decision dealt was \"limited to general issues and [did] not include \u2018issues touching specifically upon each individual claimant\u2019\".58 Further, *Abaclat* involved over 60,000 Italian holders of Argentine bonds, the relevant terms of which were identical (or assumed to be so). Hence, the fact that these claims could be standardized and the verification of the evidence simplified was instrumental to the decision of the majority in *Abaclat59* Finally, the legal framework under which the *Abaclat* arbitration took place, i.e., the Argentina-Italy BIT and the ICSID Convention, differs from the present one.60\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 26, citing to *Abaclat,* para. 226.\n\nAggregation Objection, paras. 26-28.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 29.\n\n76.\n\nSecond, according to Spain, *Abaclat* was wrongly decided for a number of reasons, including the fact that the tribunal viewed aggregation as a matter of admissibility rather than one of jurisdiction;61 that it failed to apply the standards of interpretation under international law, in particular with regard to the meaning of \"silence\" in the BIT and the ICSID Convention;62 and that it did not examine each claim in sufficient depth.63 Spain also stresses that *Abaclat* was not a unanimous decision, was the subject of a strong dissent, and was criticized by the international arbitration community generally.64\n\nAggregation Objection, paras. 30-37.\n\nAggregation Objection, paras. 38-47.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 48.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 49; R-Reply, para. 9.\n\n77.\n\nIn any event, for Spain, the present dispute does not show the same homogeneity of claims as in *Abaclat,* where the standard bond documentation shows the value of the bond.65 In the present proceedings, each of the 88 Claimants claims to have different and separate interests in one or more PV installations; and each of them claims to have channeled its investment through different corporate structures which involve at least 1,000 SPVs. The corporate forms are distinct for each claimant as the companies are incorporated in different states. The date when each claimant made its investment is also likely to be different, as is the amount invested and the nature of each underlying PV installation that is ultimately the object of each claimant\u2019s investment. Spain submits that these variables will impact the laws and regulations to which each PV installation or SPV is subject.66 Each claimant will have gained different views and information that will influence its legitimate expectations.67 In short, \"no two claimants, their investments, or their histories are necessarily the same\".68\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 51.\n\nR-Reply, para. 37.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 13.\n\nAggregation Objection, para. 11; R-Reply, para. 37. These differences between the Claimants would, in Spain's view, also raise problems as to the workability of the proceedings (see *infra,* para. 89).\n\n78.\n\nIn Spain\u2019s view, *Ambiente,* which concerned 90 Italian bondholders, is similarly irrelevant because multi-party arbitration was addressed under the ICSID Convention, which does not govern here.69 Moreover, like *Abaclat, Ambiente* was not a unanimous decision.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 12-13.\n\n79.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants submit that the reasoning in *Abaclat* and *Ambiente* is compelling and applies *a fortiori* to the present circumstances. Both tribunals found that jurisdiction was not vitiated when multiple claimants commenced a single proceeding, and that there was no reason why the number of claimants would deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction.70 For the Claimants, such reasoning should apply *a fortiori* in the present arbitration for the following reasons.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 46-49, citing to *Abaclat,* para. 409, and *Ambiente,* para. 150.\n\n80.\n\nFirst, as already noted, Article 26(3) of the ECT provides that the host state\u2019s \"unconditional\" consent to arbitration is subject only to certain explicit exceptions, and thus lends itself more favorably than the Italy-Argentina BIT (the treaty which provided the basis for the jurisdiction of the tribunals in *Abaclat* and *Ambiente*) to the conclusion that there is no separate condition for a state to give specific consent to aggregate proceedings.71 Second, in this arbitration, the Claimants do not face the \"additional hurdle\" of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which applied in the two Argentine proceedings.72 Third, the number of investors bringing a claim in *Abaclat* (180,000 later reduced to 60,000) far exceeds the number in the present dispute. Like in *Ambiente,* the Claimants in this case represent a mere one thousandth of those in *Abaclat73*\n\nC-Answer, para. 61.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 63-64.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 65-66.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimants also refute the further reasons adduced by Spain to consider *Abaclat* and *Ambiente* irrelevant to this dispute. They note that the parties in *Abaclat* did not agree that the Tribunal would avoid a full determination of whether it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute. Rather, the Tribunal decided that it would first consider the jurisdictional requirements that must be fulfilled for it to hear the claimants\u2019 claims.74\n\nC-Answer, para. 72.\n\n82.\n\nFurther, the Claimants posit that a sufficient connection exists among the Claimants in the present case. All of the claims are brought under the same treaty and arbitration rules. They concern very similar investments in a particular sub-sector of the Spanish economy under the same legislative framework. Most importantly, the Claimants bring complaints with respect to the same measures adopted by Spain.75\n\nSoC, para. 351.\n\n83.\n\nThus, the Claimants conclude, the reasoning in *Abaclat* and *Ambiente* is relevant to this dispute and this Tribunal should give it due consideration.\n\n84.\n\nThe Parties also diverge on the relevance of ICSID case *Funnekotter,* in which the arbitral tribunal accepted jurisdiction over claims brought jointly by 13 Dutch owners of different large commercial farms against Zimbabwe, alleging that the latter\u2019s land acquisition program breached its obligations under the Netherlands-Zimbabwe BIT. Spain contends that this case is irrelevant for the present discussion, because there the parties agreed that the Tribunal had jurisdiction, and the respondent state did not object to jurisdiction on the ground of the number of claimants.76 The Claimants, by contrast, note that the *Funnekotter* tribunal considered whether it had jurisdiction *sua sponte,* irrespective of any agreement between the parties, and it took no issue with the multiple number of claimants.77\n\nR-Reply, para. 11.\n\nC-Answer, para. 38; C-Rejoinder, para. 22.\n\n85.\n\nFurther, the Respondent has invoked the ICSID case *Noble Energy,* where the tribunal accepted to hear three disputes (the first arising under the BIT, the second under an investment agreement and the third under a concession contract) in one arbitration. For Spain, the tribunal in that case reached its conclusion because the three claims arose out of the same economic transaction, which is not the case in these proceedings.78 The Claimants, on the contrary, argue that *Noble Energy* fully supports their position, because the tribunal accepted jurisdiction and held that there was no need for express consent to multi-party arbitration.79\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 54-60.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 80-81.\n\n86.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that *Rurelec* is in no way comparable to the present case and thus of no relevance.80*Rurelec* concerned one claim arising from one relevant event, made by *either* Guaracachi under the U.S.-Bolivia BIT *or* its 100% indirect owner Rurelec under the UK-Bolivia BIT.81 In Spain's view, the present proceedings, to the contrary, involve an attempt to aggregate a series of separate claims arising from 88 different investments with 88 different alleged losses.82 The Claimants, on the other hand, find *Rurelec* relevant to the issue of whether multiple investors can jointly bring claims against a state in a single arbitration. The Claimants draw analogies between Spain's Aggregation Objection and the \"similar, if not identical\" objection raised by Bolivia in *Rurelec,* which also hinged on the alleged \"dual consent\" requirement.83 Because the *Rurelec* tribunal rejected Bolivia's objection and held that there was no requirement for express additional consent of a respondent state to aggregate proceedings, the Claimants posit that the *Rurelec* award fully supports the Claimants' submissions. Further, the Claimants contend that the reasoning of the *Rurelec* tribunal applies *a fortiori* to the PV Investors' claims as their claims have all been brought under the ECT and not under separate treaties.84\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission dated 28 February 2014 in relation to the award in *Rurelec,* paras. 3-25.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission dated 28 February 2014 in relation to the award in *Rurelec,* para. 8.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission dated 28 February 2014 in relation to the award in *Rurelec,* paras. 17-23.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission dated 28 February 2014 in relation to the award in *Rurelec,* p. 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission dated 28 February 2014 in relation to the award in *Rurelec,* p. 4.\n\n**b. Integrity, workability and fairness of any aggregate arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIt is Spain's further argument that, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear multiple claims, it would not be suitable to hear such claims together for reasons of due process. In this respect, Spain maintains \"profound reservations as to the integrity, workability and fairness\" of these aggregate proceedings.85\n\nR-Reply, section 2.2.\n\n88.\n\nThese concerns have been compounded, according to Spain, by the way in which the Claimants have sought to have the proceedings conducted to date. Spain points to the fact that the Claimants continue to insist that there are at most 14 Claimants (and not 88);86 that one claimant seems to have withdrawn its claim without the Claimants stating so, with the result that the actual number of claimants is unclear;87 and that the evidence initially relied upon by the Claimants was insufficient.88\n\nR-Reply, para. 32.\n\nR-Reply, para. 33. In this respect, the Claimants have explained that the omission of Eoxis Holding S.A., one of the Claimants, from the SoC was inadvertent. Eoxis Holding S.A. was included as a Claimant in Annex A to the NoA. See C-Answer, paras. 218-220.\n\nR-Reply, para. 34.\n\n89.\n\nAs already noted, Spain argues that the claims in these proceedings are not homogenous and thus make the case \"extremely complex\".89 For these reasons, in the event that no specific consent was required for the aggregation of multiple claims, Spain urges the Tribunal to scrutinize each and every claimant in connection with jurisdiction and merits, so that its right of due process is not infringed. The Respondent requests the Tribunal to grant \"appropriate safeguards\"90 and in particular to follow the following principles:\n\n47. [...] a) The status and position of each of the Claimants must be individually determined;\n\nb) The Tribunal should determine whether it has jurisdiction individually in respect of each of the claims advanced by each of the Claimants;\n\nc) Each Claimant must produce specific evidence in respect of the facts that [it] intends to establish; and\n\nd) The procedural schedule of these proceedings should take into account the extreme complexity of this case particularly with a view to according the Tribunal sufficient time appropriately to resolve this case and any issue thereof.\n\n[48.] In summary, fairness would require that each claim advanced by each Claimant be dealt with and resolved in an appropriate manner. S91pain expects that the same degree of procedural fairness be accorded to it.91\n\nR-Reply, para. 44. As to the alleged non-homogeneity of the claims, see *supra,* para. 77.\n\nR-Reply, para. 44.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 47-48.\n\n90.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants highlight the considerable benefits, which would result from the claims being heard together. Aggregate proceedings would promote cost-efficiency, avoidance of unnecessary delay, and consistency of outcome.92\n\nSoC, para. 351; C-Answer, paras. 107-111.\n\n91.\n\nIf any due process concerns were to arise (which is unlikely in the Claimants\u2019 view), the Tribunal could address them using its wide-ranging management powers.93 The Claimants submit that there can be no doubt that the Tribunal has the power it needs to ensure that Spain is afforded due process and equal treatment to the extent that any special considerations arise. The Claimants do not oppose procedural safeguards being built into this arbitration such that there is adequate time for consideration of all relevant issues, including those that Spain chooses to raise.94\n\nC-Answer, para. 103, referring to Art. 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nC-Answer, para. 120.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimants finally submit that aggregate proceedings work also in the interest of Spain. Should the present arbitration not continue in its current form, Spain would have to defend 14 (or 88) separate arbitral proceedings. The cost would far exceed any burden that Spain may now face in the present arbitration.95\n\nC-Answer, para. 117.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. Consent to aggregate proceedings?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nBefore proceeding to the interpretation of the Treaty in order to rule on this objection, the Tribunal wishes to make a terminological remark. The Parties have resorted to different terms to describe the present situation, in which one arbitration is brought collectively by multiple claimants. The Respondent has referred to the \"consolidation\" of claims, whereas the Claimants have spoken of \"collective proceedings\". The Tribunal notes that these terms have no generally agreed meaning, especially in the investment treaty arbitration field, and may have different connotations depending on the legal system in which they are used (whether domestic or international). For the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal will use \"aggregate proceedings\", a term it had used in PO4,96 to describe a situation in which multiple, individual claimants bring claims in their own name *ab initio* in one single arbitration. By contrast, it will use \"consolidation\" to refer to the situation in which pending parallel proceedings are joined into a single one.\n\nPO4, p. 2, fn. 1.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal views the objection to aggregate proceedings as one which must be dealt with when ascertaining jurisdiction. The purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is to establish whether a claim involving multiple claimants, such as the one advanced in these proceedings, may be deemed to be covered by the Respondent\u2019s consent as expressed in the ECT and thus be within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n95.\n\nIn examining the Aggregation Objection, the Tribunal will start by recalling the principles that govern treaty interpretation. According to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". No special rule applies to the interpretation of a dispute settlement provision. Hence, such treaty provisions must be construed like any other, neither restrictively nor broadly. Or in the words of the tribunal in *Mondev v. USA,*\n\nthere is no principle either of extensive or restrictive interpretation of jurisdictional provisions in treaties. In the end the question is what the relevant provisions mean, interpreted in accordance with the applicable rules of interpretation of treaties. These are set out in Articles 31-33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which for this purpose can be taken to reflect the position under customary international law.97\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002 (**Exh. CLA-14**), para. 43 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n96.\n\nThe Parties concur, and rightly so, that the starting point of the interpretation is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text.98 The latter must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty\u2019s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.99\n\nR-Reply, para. 20; C-Answer, para. 32.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT.\n\n97.\n\nThe jurisdiction of this Tribunal derives from Article 26 of the ECT, which reads as follows:\n\n(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article. [...]\n\n98.\n\nArticle 26 of the ECT establishes the Contracting Parties' consent, more precisely the offer of consent to arbitrate with investors of other Contracting Parties, which qualifying investors may then elect to accept. It is significant that the Contracting Parties' consent is expressly characterized as \"unconditional\" (Article 26(3)) and \"[s]ubject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c)\" of Article 26(3) of the ECT. These two exceptions refer to states having made a declaration in respect of disputes submitted to another forum and to states having opted out from the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT. None of these exceptions is relevant for the present purposes.100 The ECT provides no further exception to the Contracting Parties' consent. Thus, a good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of Article 26 suggests that no \"special\" or \"dual\" consent is required for the institution of arbitral proceeding in aggregate form, beyond the express jurisdictional requirements contained in Article 26. Neither does the context in which the offer of consent is placed nor the object and purpose of the Treaty suggest a different conclusion. Nor has the Tribunal been referred to any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the Treaty and any other relevant rules of international law applicable between the Contracting Parties, which would change the Tribunal's understanding.\n\nThe first of these two conditions is relevant for the sixth jurisdictional objection, on which see *infra,* Section IV.C.5.\n\n99.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal does not see how the reference in Article 26 to \"an Investor\" in the singular would bar jurisdiction over a multiplicity of claimants. Quite apart from the fact that elsewhere in Part III the Treaty uses \"Investors\" in the plural (see, *e.g.,* Article 10 of the ECT), the Tribunal does not believe that the use of the singular in the dispute settlement clause means that the individual disputes have to be heard separately. What matters is that disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor be adjudged in their individual dimension, i.e., in the same way as they would be in an ECT arbitration with a single claimant. This means in particular that, at the present jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must satisfy itself that the jurisdictional requirements are satisfied in relation to each claimant. Insofar as there may be differences between the Claimants, in terms for instance of alleged legitimate expectations or losses, these differences will be examined at the merits stage of the procedure.\n\n100.\n\nThe fact that claims are brought in one arbitration by multiple claimants without the need for a respondent\u2019s \"specific\" or \"additional\" consent is rather the natural consequence of the peculiar nature of consent in investment treaty arbitration. In the context of \"arbitration without privity\",101 a standing offer to arbitrate is extended by the host state in a treaty to an indefinite number of previously unidentified investors falling within the jurisdictional requirements of the treaty. What is essential, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is to establish that there is consent to arbitration (through a valid offer in the treaty and a valid acceptance meeting the possible conditions of such offer). The fact that the offer is then accepted by one single claimant rather than a multiple number of claimants jointly is immaterial in this respect. As rightly noted in *Abaclat* and *Ambiente,* a joint acceptance of the state\u2019s offer by a multitude of claimants cannot result in the tribunal losing jurisdiction that it would have if the claimants had commenced separate arbitrations.102\n\nJan Paulsson, \"Arbitration Without Privity\", 10 *ICSID Review - Foreign Investment Law Journal* 232-257 (1995) (**Exh. RLA-32**).\n\n*Abaclat,* para. 490, first indent; *Ambiente,* para. 150.\n\n101.\n\nThis characteristic of consent in investment treaty arbitration further implies that analogies with multi-party arbitrations based on contract are only of limited significance. In this latter context, jurisdiction will arise from the consent given to multi-party proceedings in the contract. By contrast, in investment treaty arbitration, jurisdiction will depend on the offer of consent in the treaty, which by its very nature is directed to a multiplicity of potential claimants. Because in investment treaty arbitration a pre-existing, direct contractual relationship between the host state and the concerned investors is not needed to establish the arbitration agreement, parallels with contractual settings and commercial arbitration are unhelpful.\n\n102.\n\nFurthermore, as already mentioned, the present situation of *ab initio* aggregate proceedings should be distinguished from \"consolidation\", defined above as a situation where pending parallel proceedings are joined into a single one.103 Both sides agree that in the latter scenario, all the parties must consent to consolidation. Spain posits that there are no reasons for making a distinction between the two situations when it comes to the requirement of consent. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. No valid analogy can be made between *ab initio* aggregate proceedings and *ex post* consolidation. In the former case, the offer is taken up jointly by the claimants, whereas in the latter, there are several separately concluded arbitration agreements leading to separate proceedings which are then sought to be joined. That joinder requires a specific consent.104\n\nSee *supra,* para. 93.\n\nAs held by the *Rurelec* tribunal, \"in cases of consolidation of proceedings, the matching of consents with respect to each of the arbitrations has already occurred\", which is what would require consent of all Parties to the consolidation of the separate arbitrations into one. *Rurelec,* para. 338. See also *Ambiente,* paras 123-125 (distinguishing \"*ex post* joinder or consolidation of proceedings\" from \"the original submission of a claim by a plurality of Claimants in one single ICSID proceeding\").\n\n103.\n\nThe conclusion that the Tribunal reaches, i.e., that under the ECT there is no requirement for additional consent to aggregate proceedings, is confirmed by investment treaty jurisprudence. Indeed, the Tribunal has not been referred to, nor is it aware of, a single case where a tribunal has declined jurisdiction based on the fact that there was more than one claimant. To the contrary, investment treaty arbitration practice is replete with examples of proceedings which have involved more than one claimant. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that examples from both the ICSID and non-ICSID framework are relevant because an objection based on multiple claimants would present no meaningful difference in one or the other context.\n\n104.\n\nThe analysis of the investment treaty cases involving multiple claimants (more than 120, according to the PV Investors) clearly evinces that the multiple number of claimants has never been an issue. The fact that respondents may have omitted to raise an aggregation objection does not change that observation. Both within the ICSID framework and in non-ICSID investment treaty arbitration, a tribunal has the power to deal with jurisdictional questions of its own motion.105 If the multiplicity of claimants required a special consent from the respondent, this would mean that numerous investment treaty tribunals have failed to consider this issue and to inquire from the respondent whether it had granted such additional consent. The Tribunal appreciates that the reasons why until recently this objection was almost never raised by respondents,106 nor ever considered *proprio motu* by a tribunal, may lie in the fact that those cases often concerned, on the one hand, a limited number of claimants, and, on the other, companies belonging to the same corporate group, or individuals sharing a family relation. However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, an equally reasonable explanation may be that multi-party proceedings of this kind were not regarded as raising a jurisdictional issue.\n\nSee Art. 41(2) ICSID (Arbitration) Rules (\"The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence\"); Art. 45(3) ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules (\"The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute before it is within its competence\"). For non-ICSID treaty arbitrations, see Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge, 2009), p. 141, para. 292.\n\nIn addition to the cases discussed later by the Tribunal, it would seem that in *Kl\u00f6ckner et al. v. Cameroon* the respondent initially objected to multi-party proceedings, but later abandoned this objection. See Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Antony Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary* (Cambridge, 2009), p. 163 (\"The argument that the use of the singular for \"national\" in Art. 25(1) [of the ICSID Convention] barred multipartite arbitration was raised in *Klockner v. Cameroon* but was not taken up by the Tribunal and was apparently dropped subsequently by the Government\").\n\n105.\n\nAs aptly noted by the tribunal in *Ambiente* after reviewing the many arbitrations (under the ICSID Convention and beyond) involving more than one claimant,\n\nit is evident that multi-party arbitration is a generally accepted practice in ICSID arbitration, and in the arbitral practice beyond that, and that the institution of multi-party proceedings therefore does not require any consent on the part of the respondent Government beyond the general requirements of consent to arbitration.107\n\n*Ambiente,* para. 141.\n\n106.\n\nWithout prejudice to all the cases to which the Parties have referred and which the Tribunal has considered, the Tribunal now turns to the discussion of those which it has found most helpful to reach its conclusion that no additional consent is required from a respondent in respect of aggregate proceedings under the ECT.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the *Funnekotter* case to be of valuable importance. The case was brought before an ICSID tribunal by 13 claimants who owned different commercial farms in Zimbabwe. The claimants alleged that they had been deprived of their property through measures taken as part of the state\u2019s land acquisition program. The claimants thus complained of the same state measures which affected their individual investments. The respondent at first objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction based on the alleged lack of Dutch nationality of the claimants.108 In the subsequent course of the proceedings, however, it abandoned this objection and confirmed that it did not object to the jurisdiction of the Centre.109 Nonetheless, the tribunal considered jurisdiction of its own motion.110 It reviewed whether it possessed jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* and *ratione temporis,* and affirmed jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.111 If there had been an additional consent requirement relating to the number of claimants, the *Funnekotter* tribunal would likely have considered it, even in the absence of an objection by Zimbabwe.112 As rightly observed in *Ambiente,* \"[t]he silence of the Tribunal [in *Funnekotter]* carries more weight, in this case, than that of the respondent State\".113\n\n*Funnekotter,* para. 59.\n\n*Funnekotter,* paras. 82, 93.\n\n*Funnekotter*, para. 94.\n\n*Funnekotter*, paras. 94-95.\n\nSee also *Ambiente,* para. 139.\n\n*Ambiente,* para. 158.\n\n108.\n\nObjections to the multi-party nature of the arbitration were more recently considered and denied in two ICSID arbitrations arising under the Argentina-Italy BIT. In *Abaclat,* an ICSID tribunal upheld jurisdiction over claims by some 60,000 bondholders, rejecting an objection by Argentina that its consent under the ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT did not cover this sort of \"mass proceedings\" (as the *Abaclat* tribunal called them). The present Tribunal notes that the number of claimants in the present case represents a fraction of merely a thousandth of the number of the claimants in *Abaclat.* The conclusion in *Abaclat* on the multiplicity of claimants would thus apply *a fortiori* when a tribunal, such as the present one, is faced with a much smaller number of claimants.\n\n109.\n\n*Ambiente,* to the contrary, dealt with a comparable number of claimants (90). Faced with a jurisdictional objection similar to the Aggregation Objection in this arbitration, the Tribunal characterized the situation before it as \"the original submission of a claim by a plurality of Claimants in one single ICSID proceeding\", and distinguished it from the scenario of \"the initial submission of a certain number of separate individual arbitrations which are subsequently consolidated and joined with each other\".114 Only with regard to the latter, but not the former, did the tribunal find that a \"specific consent of the Parties\" was needed.115 The tribunal thus went on to reject Argentina\u2019s aggregation objection.\n\n*Ambiente,* paras. 123-124.\n\n*Ambiente*, para. 123.\n\n110.\n\nOf note, in *Funnekotter* (arising under the Zimbabwe-Netherlands BIT), *Abaclat* and *Ambiente* (the latter two arising under the Argentina-Italy BIT), the applicable BIT dispute resolution clauses all referred to disputes between the host state and \"a national\"116 or \"an investor\"117 in the singular. In none of the three cases did this wording prevent the tribunal from asserting jurisdiction over multiple claimants.\n\nSee *Funnekotter,* para. 91 (referring to Art. 9(1) of the Netherlands-Zimbabwe BIT).\n\nSee *Abaclat,* paras. 268-270 (referring to Art. 8 of the Argentina-Italy BIT).\n\n111.\n\nThe most recent example of denial of an aggregation objection is found in *Rurelec,* an UNCITRAL case brought under two different BITs. The tribunal characterized Bolivia\u2019s argument that there had to be a specific consent in each of the BITs to aggregating claims in one arbitration as \"ultimately go[ing] too far\".118 It noted that \"were such specific consent necessary, it would be impossible to accept, as the Respondent has argued, that all prior multi-party arbitrations that were allowed to proceed were based on implicit consent by the respondent States through their failure to raise any jurisdictional objection in this regard\".119 The present Tribunal finds the conclusions drawn in *Rurelec* to apply *a fortiori* in the present scenario, because all of the PV Investors have initiated this arbitration under the same treaty, the ECT, whereas in *Rurelec* the claimants had invoked two different BITs providing for two non-identical dispute settlement clauses.\n\n*Rurelec,* para. 342.\n\n*Rurelec,* para. 342.\n\n112.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that the reference to *Noble Energy* is unhelpful. The latter case concerned the aggregation of claims brought before an ICSID tribunal under three different legal instruments (the applicable investment treaty, an investment agreement, and a concession contract). The scenario was thus different from the present one, where all claims are brought under the same investment treaty. In any event, in that case the tribunal rejected the two Respondents\u2019 objection that the three disputes could not be resolved in one single arbitration.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds support in investment treaty jurisprudence to date for its conclusion that there is no requirement for a respondent state under the ECT to provide an additional consent to a dispute involving a multiple number of claimants.\n\n114.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to hear multiple arbitral claims in one proceeding. Spain\u2019s Aggregation Objection is therefore rejected.\n\n**b. Due process and case management**\n--------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nHaving found that no specific consent is required for the aggregation of multiple claims, the Tribunal now addresses the other objections raised by Spain, notably those relating to due process and the \"workability\" of these proceedings.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see how any issue of due process can arise from the sole fact that these proceedings are conducted in aggregate form. It goes without saying that the arbitration will be conducted in such a fashion as to safeguard the due process rights of every Party, and in particular of the Respondent in respect of each individual claim.\n\n117.\n\nWith regard to the submission that the proceedings would be unworkable due to the diversity between the Claimants, the Tribunal is satisfied that a sufficient connection exists between them to justify hearing the Claimants\u2019 claims in one single arbitration. The Claimants complain of the same measures taken by Spain in relation to the PV sector, which they allege have negatively affected their investments. In addition, they invoke the same Treaty provisions and claim the same type of relief. Thus, the Tribunal does not believe that any diversities in the Claimants\u2019 situations would make the proceedings unmanageable or unworkable.\n\n118.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal agrees in principle with the \"appropriate safeguards\" invoked by Spain for the event that these proceedings are continued in aggregate form.\n\n119.\n\n*First,* with regard to the concerns that \"[t]he status and position of each of the Claimants must be individually determined\" and that \"[t]he Tribunal should determine whether it has jurisdiction individually in respect of each of the claims advanced by each of the Claimants\", it is clear that the aggregate nature of the proceedings does not dispense the Tribunal from establishing the jurisdictional requirements with regard to each and every claimant, a proposition that the Claimants do not dispute, and righty so. The same principle applies to the merits stage: The Tribunal will carry out any individual examination required to resolve this dispute.\n\n120.\n\n*Second,* with regard to the Respondent\u2019s concern that each Claimant \"produce specific evidence in respect of the facts that [it] intends to establish\", the Tribunal is of the view that this is certainly the case with regard to the facts which are specific to its claim, as opposed to those common to all of the Claimants.\n\n121.\n\n*Third,* the Tribunal takes note of Spain\u2019s concerns about the calendar for the further course of these proceedings. It also notes that the Claimants have not objected to procedural arrangements allowing for appropriate time to brief all the relevant issues. Pursuant to Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has the necessary powers to ensure that the proceedings are managed both efficiently and fairly. The Tribunal further appreciates the Respondent\u2019s readiness \"to be pragmatic in terms of how any proceedings should be managed\".120\n\nAggregation Objection, paras. 3, 65.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that, as a result of the conclusion which it will reach later in respect of the fifth jurisdictional objection, the proceedings will continue only with 26 out of the original 88 Claimants. As a result, it will be easier to deal with any concerns which Spain may have harbored about the complexity of the proceedings.\n\n123.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal does not consider that its aggregate nature makes this arbitration unworkable or results in a violation of due process or in unfairness towards the Respondent, be it in the present jurisdictional phase or in the subsequent merits phase.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal finally wishes to make a last remark. In advocating in favor or against aggregate proceedings, the Parties have discussed issues such as procedural efficiency, costs and time of the proceedings, the potential to avoid contradictory decisions and a waste of resources. Whatever the merit of these considerations, they could not justify the admission of aggregate proceedings if it were not permitted under the framework of the ECT as a matter of law.121 The paramount question for a tribunal of limited and consensual jurisdiction is whether the Respondent\u2019s consent is affected by the number of potential claimants. Once the answer is given that under the ECT the Respondent\u2019s consent is not limited by the multiplicity of claimants, those policy considerations add nothing to the answer.\n\nSee, for a similar consideration, *Ambiente,* para. 172.\n\n**C. The Other Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Second objection: Claimants have not proven that they are \"Investors\" with \"Investments\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIn its Jurisdictional Objections, Spain submitted that the Claimants failed to prove that they are \"Investors\" pursuant to Article 1(7) of the ECT with qualifying \"Investments\" pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT.122 According to Spain, the existence of an \"Investor\" with an \"Investment\" needs to be demonstrated by documentary evidence. To that purpose, the Claimants should, in the Respondent\u2019s view, have produced certificates of incorporation, relevant certificates issued by the Spanish Commercial Registry, copies of the registrations of the relevant PV installations with the Administrative Registry for Production Installations under the Special Regime *(Registro Administrativo de Instalaciones de Producci\u00f3n en R\u00e9gimen Especial,* \"RAIPRE\") and copies of the resolutions of the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism granting a PV installation a specific FIT.123 Instead, according to the Respondent, the Claimants have relied upon the testimony of individuals who are personally interested in the outcome of these proceedings124 or on a number of \"organograms\" prepared for these proceedings and thus without probative value.125\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 12-129.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 68.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 40, 118-119.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 67-68.\n\n126.\n\nIn their Answer on Jurisdiction, the Claimants submitted some 6,000 additional documents (about 3,920 documents and approximately 2,000 translations collated in Annexes A to O, referred to as the \"Evidentiary Annexes\"), in order to prove that they are \"Investors\" with \"Investments\" under the ECT.\n\n127.\n\nThe additional evidence submitted by the Claimants with the Answer on Jurisdiction prompted the Admissibility Objection by Spain, which is recounted in paragraph 22 above. The positions of the Parties concerning the admissibility of such evidence are described in detail in PO6.126 In PO6, the Tribunal admitted the Evidentiary Annexes.\n\nPO6, paras. 4-25.\n\n128.\n\nIn its Reply and in light of PO6 admitting the Claimants\u2019 new evidence, the Respondent requested that \"the Tribunal decide whether it is satisfied that sufficient evidence has been provided to prove that each of the Claimants has the requisite standing, and specifically determines [sic] whether each of the Claimants is an \"Investor\" with \"Investments\" under the ECT\".127\n\nR-Reply, para. 54.\n\n129.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimants noted that Spain did not identify any shortcomings in the evidence they submitted, nor query the veracity or probative value of any of its content.128 Therefore, according to the Claimants, the Respondent has accepted that the Claimants have established that they are \"Investors\" with \"Investments\" under the ECT. As a result, this objection by Spain \"has been dropped\" and it is therefore no longer an issue before the Tribunal.129\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 63.\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 6, 64.\n\n130.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent clarified that, after having reviewed the approximately 6,000 documents, it did not intend to pursue this jurisdictional objection further.130 It stressed, however, that \"it ha[d] taken quite some effort to get to that point\" and that such result was achieved thanks to \"Spain\u2019s efforts to police precisely this process\" which led to the introduction of the 6,000 documents into the record.131\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 148: 19-25; 149: 1-9 (\"it is now the case, after the submission of about 6,000 documents, that we have now seen an establishment of a prima facie case of standing by the Claimants, and we do not intend to pursue this as a jurisdictional issue at any further point in the proceedings today. [...] But as an issue in and of itself of \u2018Is there an investment and are there investors?'\", we would now withdraw that jurisdictional challenge\").\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 149: 1-6.\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal thus takes note that the Respondent has abandoned the objection that the Claimants (other than the Spanish entities, for which the Respondent has maintained its objection) are not \"Investors\" with qualifying \"Investments\". It will thus not discuss this objection further, except when dealing with the allocation of costs.\n\n**2. Third objection: The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with an intra-EU dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nSpain submits that, because all Claimants are nationals of states that were members of the EU when the ECT was signed in 1994 (Spain, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and Germany), because Spain has been an EU member since 1986, and because all of the alleged investments have taken place within the EU, this is an intra-EU dispute which can not be resolved within the framework of the ECT. For the Respondent, at the time of conclusion of the ECT, intra-EU investment disputes fell within the preserve of the EU internal dispute resolution mechanisms. Hence, the dispute resolution provisions of the ECT do not apply to intra-EU investment disputes.132\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 130-133.\n\n133.\n\nFor Spain, the existence of EU law, as a specific, fully-developed legal system, binding on the investors, who are nationals of an EU member state, and on Spain prohibits recourse to arbitration under the ECT.133 Member states and EU citizens or businesses cannot opt out of EU law, which includes the control by national judges and, as required and appropriate, the intervention of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\").134 According to the Respondent, the protection of investors\u2019 rights in this case is governed by EU law and disputes relating to this protection must be resolved within the judicial system of the EU and not by an international arbitral tribunal founded on the ECT.135 An international treaty to which the EU is a party cannot be construed as preventing the application of the EU judicial system (CJEU and national courts).136\n\nR-Reply, para. 60.\n\nR-Reply, para. 74.\n\nR-Reply, para. 79.\n\nR-Reply, para. 81.\n\n134.\n\nFurthermore, the application of the ECT at the intra-EU level would result in severe discrimination in the internal market in breach of EU law. This would be so, the Respondent contends, if an investor from one member state could bring an action against a member state before an arbitral tribunal rather than before the ordinary courts in accordance with EU law.137 The discrimination would arise from the fact that arbitral tribunals do not necessarily apply EU law in a uniform manner.138\n\nR-Reply, para. 109.\n\nR-Reply, para. 109.\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, previous arbitral decisions dealing with intra-EU investment treaties are irrelevant, because they addressed situations where the respondent states (the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Romania and Poland) were not EU member states at the time when the relevant investment treaty was concluded. The issue there was thus the effect of the *accession* to the EU of states which had investment treaties with members of the EU.139\n\nR-Reply, paras. 62-65, 100.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants object, and affirm that this intra-EU defense is without merit. According to them, there is no reason to distinguish the present situation from the other arbitrations in which the intra-EU issue was addressed on the ground that Spain was already part of the EU when it ratified the ECT. The ECT applies *a fortiori* between an investor from an EU member state and an EU member state where both states were part of the EU at the time the ECT was signed. Spain was fully aware of both its EU law obligations and its ECT obligations at the time it acceded to the ECT, yet made no reservations or exclusions to its unconditional consent.140 The Claimants finally posit that Spain's argument, if accepted, would create two classes of investors or two classes of Contracting Parties, depending upon the date when they became part of the EU, which would amount to discrimination under both the ECT and EU law.141\n\nC-Answer, para. 235.\n\nC-Answer, para. 238; C-Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\n137.\n\nTherefore, according to the Claimants, previous investment arbitration (and court) decisions regarding intra-EU investment disputes are highly relevant to the issues before this Tribunal. In every single one of these cases, tribunals and courts have decided that a BIT or ECT-based tribunal does have jurisdiction over an intra-EU dispute.142\n\nC-Answer, paras. 234-236.\n\n138.\n\nThe Parties have made a number of arguments relating to the interpretation of the ECT by reference to the VCLT, deriving different conclusions therefrom.\n\n**i. Ordinary meaning of the terms of the ECT, in their context and in light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose (Article 31(1) VCLT)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nFor Spain, interpreting the ECT according to the rules of interpretation contained in the VCLT leads unequivocally to the conclusion that the ECT's dispute resolution provisions were never intended to apply to intra-EU disputes.\n\n140.\n\nIn particular, Spain notes that the ECT is a \"mixed agreement\", i.e., a treaty to which both the EU and its member states are parties. Article 1(2) of the ECT defines \"Contracting Party\" as \"a state or Regional Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force\" and Article 1(3) defines \"Regional Economic Integration Organization\" (\"REIO\") as\n\nan organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.\n\n141.\n\nFor the Respondent, the ECT not only recognizes a REIO as a Contracting Party but also accepts that the REIO is the holder of part of the sovereign competence of its member states including the authority to take decisions binding on them. The fact that both the EU and its member states signed the ECT including its Article 1(3) means that the system of transfer of competences between the EU and its member states became part of the framework of the ECT. It was thus not necessary that the ECT set out explicitly the division of competences between the EU and its member states, as the ECT itself recognizes the supremacy of EU law over the law of the member states within the areas of its competence.143\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 142-151.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent further emphasizes the fundamental role played by the EU in the formation of the ECT and cites to a passage in *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary144* and to writings of late Professor Thomas W\u00e4lde. The object and purpose of the ECT was to create a new regime under public international law that filled a gap in the protection of investments in the energy sector in the countries of the former Communist bloc and not to change the rules for cross-border investments within the EU.145\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 152-155, quoting *Electrabel S.A. (Belgium) v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 30 November 2011 (\"*Electrabel*\") (**Exh. RLA-78**), para. 4,131.\n\nR-Reply, para. 90.\n\n143.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent invokes a number of principles of EU law opposing the conclusion that the ECT's dispute resolution provisions apply in intra-EU arbitrations. First, EU law prevents arbitration between EU member states, as confirmed in the European Court of Justice (\"ECJ\") *Mox Plant* decision between the United Kingdom and Ireland.146 Thus, the inter-state dispute settlement provision in Article 27 of the ECT cannot provide the basis for an intra-EU state-to-state arbitration.147 For reasons of consistency, Article 26 of the ECT must be interpreted in the same fashion. Second, to allow nationals of member states to bring arbitration proceedings against each other rather than seek redress in court would be contrary to the principle of mutual trust in the judicial system of the EU member states.148\n\nCase No. 459/03, *Commission v. Ireland,* Judgement of the ECJ, 30 May 2006 *(\"Mox Plant\u2019)* (**Exh. RLA-91**).\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 157-158.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 159-160.\n\n144.\n\nThis is the context, Spain contends, in which Article 26 of the ECT should be interpreted. Article 26(1) of the ECT reads as follows:\n\nDisputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.\n\n145.\n\nThe term \"Investor\" is defined in Article 1(7) of the ECT as follows:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state\", a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party.\n\n146.\n\nThe term \"Area\" is defined by Article 1(10) of the ECT as follows:\n\n\"Area\" means with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party:\n\n(a) the territory under its sovereignty, it being understood that territory includes land, internal waters and the territorial sea; and\n\n(b) subject to and in accordance with the international law of the sea: the sea, sea-bed and its subsoil with regard to which that Contracting Party exercises sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\n\nWith respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organization which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member states of such Organization, under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organization.\n\n147.\n\nSpain submits that, within the internal market, the Areas of each member state are amalgamated into a single Area for the purposes of the ECT.149 When an investor from an EU member state is involved in a dispute with another EU member state, the dispute relates to an investment in the EU Area. In that case, no diversity is recognized by the ECT, because the investor and the host state are deemed to be from the same Area. Article 1(7)(a) on the definition of \"Investor\" should be construed so that the investors of an EU member state are investors of both the EU and the relevant EU member states. In this manner, Article 26 on investor-state arbitration would be consistent with Article 27 on state-to-state arbitration, which due to overriding considerations of EU law cannot be construed to include arbitration between EU states.150\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 168.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 169.\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants rebut Spain's intra-EU objection with a number of arguments. First, they argue that what matters in treaty interpretation is the intention of the parties as *expressed in the text.151* The ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT in its context, taking into account the object and purpose of the treaty, is clear: investors from one Contracting Party may bring arbitration against another Contracting Party concerning a dispute arising out of an investment in the territory of that Contracting Party. The ECT contains no text that deprives investors from certain Contracting Parties of the right to bring claims against certain other Contracting Parties.152\n\nC-Answer, para. 241.\n\nC-Answer, para. 240; C-Rejoinder, para. 73.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with what they call Spain's \"convoluted interpretation\" of the definition of \"Area\" in Art. 1(10) of the ECT in relation to a REIO. The purpose of this definition is simply to identify the area of a REIO. The clarity provided by this definition ensures that a claim can be brought against a REIO regarding a dispute arising out of an investment made in that defined area. It also ensures that a REIO cannot be sued in respect of an investment made outside that area. It does not deprive certain investors of the right to bring claims against certain Contracting Parties.153\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 75.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants also insist that resort to supplementary means of interpretation should be limited to cases where the general rule of interpretation leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.154 Spain has failed to point to ambiguous provisions of the ECT which would justify resort to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT. Therefore, recourse to such means is unnecessary and irrelevant.155\n\nC-Answer. para. 244.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 244-246.\n\n151.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that the ECT was not solely, or even primarily, a European initiative, because Russia, Canada and, most of all, the United States, were each heavily involved in its inception.156 As such, the supposed importance of EU law to the history of the ECT has no basis in fact. The ECT is a multilateral treaty with 53 signatories, 29 of whom are not members of the EU, including countries that could not be further away geographically (Australia) or culturally (Japan) from Europe.157\n\nC-Answer, paras. 247-251 citing, *inter alia,* to writings by Thomas W\u00e4lde.\n\nC-Answer, para. 252.\n\n152.\n\nFurthermore, as a matter of public international law, the simple reference in a multilateral treaty to the existence of a REIO that is a party to that treaty is not sufficient to establish that the treaty does not apply within the regional organization. According to the Claimants, unless there is a disconnection clause (or a declaration of competences), a multilateral treaty cannot be interpreted differently depending on the parties to the dispute.158\n\nC-Answer, paras. 263-266.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants also take issue with the \"principles of EU law\" invoked by Spain allegedly militating against the application of the ECT in intra-EU disputes. First, the analogy between Article 26 and Article 27 of the ECT is inapposite, as is the reference to *Mox Plant,* which concerns inter-state arbitration and does not prevent investor-state arbitration.159 Second, arbitral tribunals have dismissed the argument that the principle of mutual trust in the judicial system prevents investor-state arbitration in an intra-EU context.160\n\nC-Answer, paras. 270-275.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 276-282.\n\n**ii. Instruments made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty (Article 31(2)(b) VCLT)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nAccording to Article 31(2)(b) of the VCLT,\n\n[t]he context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n[...] any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent points to the 9 March 1998 Statement submitted by the European Communities (\"EC\") to the Secretariat of the Energy Charter \"concerning the policies, practices and conditions with regard to disputes between an investor and a Contracting Parties [sic] and their submission to international arbitration or conciliation\" (\"EC Statement\").161 The EC Statement contains a declaration that:\n\nThe European Communities and their Member States have both concluded the Energy Charter Treaty and are thus internationally responsible for the fulfilment of the obligations contained therein, in accordance with their respective competences.162\n\nStatement submitted by the European Communities to the Secretariat of the Energy Charter pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the Energy Charter Treaty, 9 March 1998, L69/115 (**Exh. RLA-37**).\n\nEC Statement, third paragraph.\n\n156.\n\nSince the EC Statement contains no reference to intra-EU disputes, so says Spain, the EU and their member states could not have contemplated Article 26 of the ECT applying to intra-EU disputes.163\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 176-179.\n\n157.\n\nNeither does the Council and Commission Decision of 23 September 1997, approving the ECT (\"Council and Commission Decision\"),164 make any reference to intra-EU disputes. Again, this silence constitutes evidence that the ECT was not intended to apply to intra-EU disputes.165\n\n98/181/EC, ECSC, Euratom: Council and Commission Decision of 23 September 1997 on the conclusion, by the European Communities, of the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects, Official Journal, 9 March 1998, L69/1 (**Exh. RLA-35**).\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 180-182.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, consider that neither the EC Statement nor the Council and Commission Decision support the conclusion that intra-EU disputes are excluded from the scope of the ECT. The EC Statement was made in connection with the fork-in-the-road clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) and intended to address situations where an investor tried to resubmit the same dispute to international arbitration at a later stage under Article 26. It confirms that a case submitted to the CJEU by an investor of another Contracting Party in application of the forms of action provided by the constituent treaties of the Communities falls within Article 26(2)(a) of the ECT.166 The Council and Commission Decision is equally unavailing because it is silent about the alleged inapplicability of the ECT in intra-EU disputes.167\n\nC-Answer, paras. 284-286.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 287-288.\n\n**iii. Subsequent agreements between the parties regarding the application of the treaty\u2019s provisions (Article 31(3)(a) VCLT)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nSpain argues that in interpreting the ECT, the Tribunal should have regard to subsequent agreements between the EU and/or its member states \"which cover the same ground as the ECT\".168 It relies on Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, which reads as follows:\n\nThere shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 183.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to Spain, one subsequent treaty is the Lisbon Treaty which entered into force in 2009 and under which the EU has acquired exclusive competence in respect of \"foreign direct investment\" (Article 207 TFUE). It would follow that \"all that is not foreign direct investment, i.e., investments that take place within the EU internal market by EU investors, do not fall within the scope of the common commercial policy\".169 The same conclusion would be evidenced by the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council which provides a framework to deal with the financial responsibility regarding investment disputes arising from investment treaties to which the EU is a party (\"EU draft Regulation on financial responsibility\"),170 and by EU Regulation No. 1219/2012 of 12 December 2012 which contains interim provisions in respect of BITs between EU member states and non-EU countries (\"EU Regulation No. 1219/2012\").171\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 184.\n\nCOM (2012) 335 Final, Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for managing financial responsibility linked to investor-state dispute settlement tribunals established by international agreements to which the European Union is party, 21 June 2012 (**Exh. RLA-75**). The Tribunal notes that \"Regulation (EU) No. 912/2014 establishing a framework for managing financial responsibility linked to investor-to-state dispute settlement tribunals established by international agreements to which the European Union is party\" was adopted on 23 July 2014 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 August 2014. By that time, the Tribunal had already finalized the Award. Neither Party has requested leave to submit comments on such Regulation, as a result of which it is not discussed in the Award.\n\nRegulation (EU) No. 1219/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries, 12 December 2012 (**Exh. RLA-79**).\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the instruments invoked by Spain under Article 31(3)(a) of the ECT are unavailing because this provision requires that a subsequent agreement be \"between the parties\"to the original agreement and \"regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\". Neither the Lisbon Treaty, nor the 2012 Proposal for a Regulation, nor the EU Regulation No 1219/2012 meet these criteria. None of them is an agreement between all the parties to the ECT, and none of them purports to interpret the ECT. These instruments are *res inter alios acta* for the non-EU Contracting Parties, and thus have no bearing on the ECT, including with respect to the EU member states' *inter se* relationships.172\n\nC-Answer, paras. 290-291.\n\n**iv. Subsequent practice in the application of the treaty (Article 31(3)(b) VCLT)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe VCLT also requires treaty interpreters to take into account, together with the context, \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" (Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT).\n\n163.\n\nSpain submits that, in the event that the Lisbon Treaty and the subsequent EU Regulations previously referred to are not considered as \"subsequent agreements between the parties\", they should be considered subsequent practice.173\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 187-188; R-Reply, paras. 103-104.\n\n164.\n\nIn this context, Spain also cites to the European Commission's submissions in *Electrabel* as evidence of the EU's approach to dispute resolution under the ECT. The European Commission argued that in circumstances where the EU is the respondent, an EU claimant could not sue the EU under the ECT. According to the Commission, this flows from the application of the notion of Area as defined in the ECT, which ousts the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal under the ECT in respect of intra-EU disputes.174 Although the tribunal in *Electrabel* dismissed the Commission's reasoning, Spain contends that it did not address the question whether a measure taken by an EU member state without being directed to do so by EU bodies would preclude a tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of an EU investor. Spain has also noted the European Commission's submission in *Eureko (now Achmea) v. Slovak Republic175* (the latter being a dispute not under the ECT, but under an intra-EU BIT) as reinforcing the thesis that in a dispute involving nationals of EU member states, investor-state arbitration is incompatible with EU law.176\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 189.\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2008-13 (\"*Eureko\")*.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 105-106.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, under Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, subsequent practice may be that of one party alone, but the agreement that it establishes needs to be that of all the parties. The Commission\u2019s position is simply the Commission\u2019s position; it does not represent the position of the EU member states. In any event, the Claimants note that the Commission\u2019s position with respect to the fate of both intra-EU BITs and the applicability of mixed agreements in the member states\u2019 *inter se* relationship does not reflect the view of the majority of its member states.177\n\nC-Answer, paras. 295-297, esp. 297 (\"For example, the Commission\u2019s *\"invitation\"* that Member States terminate their intra-EU BITs has been largely ignored\").\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants further stress that the Commission in *Electrabel* did not object to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the claims which were not based on measures taken by Hungary with reference to EU law or a Commission decision. Thus, the practice of the Commission supports the Claimants\u2019 position regarding the unrestricted application of the ECT in this case, which includes no allegations that the measures complained of were taken to comply with EU law.178\n\nC-Answer, para. 299.\n\n**v. The preparatory work of the treaty as a supplementary means of interpretation (Article 32 VCLT)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nArticle 32 of the VCLT permits the Tribunal to consider the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the treaty *inter alia* in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31. Spain invokes drafts of the ECT. While in the final text the term \"competence\" is only contained in the definition of REIO and not in that of Area, the *travaux* nonetheless evince that the notions of \"competences\" and \"Area\" (referred to as \"Territory\" at a previous drafting stage) are linked and thus \"support the contention that the term \u2018Area\u2019 was the way in which the notion of internal market is channelled into the language of the ECT\".179\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 193-203, esp. 203.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain\u2019s reliance on the *travaux* is misplaced. In any event, the preparatory works submitted by Spain are anything but clear. There is little to gain from the observation that the term competences at one point appeared in what would become the definition of Area, and was then introduced in the definition of REIO. The conclusions that Spain derives from those preparatory works are thus unavailing.180\n\nC-Answer, paras. 300-306.\n\n**vi. The need for a \"disconnection clause\" in the ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the consequences to be drawn from the fact that the ECT does not contain a \"disconnection clause\". Disconnection clauses ensure that between parties to a multilateral treaty which are also parties to a regional organization, the rules of the regional organization prevail over the treaty.\n\n170.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, there is no disconnection clause or declaration of competences in the ECT (or in any later instrument) allowing the Tribunal to disregard the ECT in an intra-EU dispute. The Claimants contend that disconnection clauses have been widely used by the EU, including at the time when the ECT was negotiated.181 In the absence of such a clause, the ECT also applies to intra-EU disputes.182 Nor does the ECT contain any declaration regarding the precise allocation of internal competences between the EU and its member states.183\n\nC-Answer, para. 254.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 258-259.\n\nC-Answer, para. 263.\n\n171.\n\nFor the Respondent, on the contrary, it would have been unnecessary to insert a disconnection clause into the ECT in favor of the preferential application of EU law between member states. Such disconnection clause would have been \"superfluous\" as the constitutive instruments of the EU exclude the application of the ECT among EU member states184 and such intention would result from the EC Statement and the Council and Commission Decision referenced above.185 Furthermore, the question of the allocation of competences between the EU and its member states is determined under EU law.186\n\nR-Reply, para. 119.\n\nR-Reply, para. 122.\n\nR-Reply, para. 123.\n\n**vii. Are the substantive protections of the ECT and EU law in conflict?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nFinally, Spain contends that it does not seek to set up a conflict between the ECT and EU law which it then asks the Tribunal to resolve by assigning supremacy of one over the other. The ECT and EU law must be reconciled as it is not possible to imagine that the EU and its member states intended to derogate from fundamental principles of EU law when entering into the ECT.187\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 204. See also the remarks made at the Hearing by Spain: Hearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 152: 1-4 (\"I'd like to answer the President\u2019s question, which is: is there any incompatibility between EU law and the ECT? In this respect we believe there is no incompatibility\").\n\n173.\n\nThe Claimants on their part do not consider that there is a conflict between the provisions of the ECT and EU law whether with respect to procedural provisions or substantive provisions. However, if the ECT was considered to overlap with EU law, then Article 16 of the ECT would apply. Article 16 provides that, if a Contracting Party to the ECT has entered into an agreement prior to the ECT concerning the same subject matter, the provisions of the prior agreement cannot derogate from the provisions of the ECT where a provision of the ECT is more favorable to the investor. For the Claimants, Article 26 of the ECT is more favorable to them than the provisions of the EC Treaty.188 With regard to possible conflicts between the substantive provisions of the ECT and EU law, these could only affect the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claim, not the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.189\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 95-96. For the Respondent, on the contrary, \"Article 16 of the ECT, to which the Claimants refer, is irrelevant for the simple reason that, similar to the other ECT rules, it was not designed to be applied to Member States in their relations within the internal market\" (R-Reply, para. 64, internal footnote omitted).\n\nC-Answer, paras. 307-310.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. Interpretation of the treaty, its terms, and their ordinary meaning in context**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because this dispute is entirely intra-EU, i.e., the Claimants are all EU nationals, the Respondent is an EU member state, and the investments have been carried out in the territory of the EU. The Respondent contends that it has not consented to such intra-EU disputes being resolved by means of international arbitration within the framework of the ECT.\n\n175.\n\nThe main question before the Tribunal is thus whether the ECT framework allows the present intra-EU dispute to be heard by the Tribunal. The starting point for the jurisdictional analysis is, once more, Article 26 of the ECT, which sets out the parameters of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.190\n\nSee also Hearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 17: 8-9 (\"Article 26(1) is the jurisdictional entry point to the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism in the ECT\").\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal has already recalled the rules that apply to treaty interpretation.191 For the purposes of this objection, it need only be added that the primacy of the text of the Treaty viewed in its context, and bearing in mind the Treaty's object and purpose (Article 31 of the VCLT), implies that recourse to supplementary means (including both the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and the circumstances of the Treaty's conclusion) is only allowed in limited circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32, one may resort to supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\", or (iii) \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".\n\nSee *supra,* paras. 95-96.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with elucidating the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26, in their context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose. The Tribunal's jurisdiction is limited to \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter *in the Area of the former\"* (emphasis added). The Respondent points to the fact that the Treaty's dispute settlement clause requires a diversity of areas between the territory from which the investor originates and the territory of the Respondent party to the dispute. Because \"Area\" is defined with respect to a REIO (in this case, the EU) as \"the Areas of the member states of such Organization\", and because, in Spain's view, the investors and Spain are from the same Area (the EU Area), the diversity of Area requirement is not met.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to follow this view. While it is true that the second sentence of Article 1(10) of the ECT defines Area *with respect to a REIO* as \"the Areas of the member states of such Organization\", the first sentence of Article 1(10) of the ECT defines Area *with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party* as the territory under the state's sovereignty. In the Tribunal's view, the two components of the definition must be clearly distinguished and correctly related to the notion of Area that is referred to in Article 26.\n\n179.\n\nThe phrase \"in the Area of the former [Contracting Party]\" in Article 26(1) of the ECT refers to the particular dispute initiated by the investor. If the investor commences arbitration against a member state of the EU (rather than against the EU itself), then \"Area\" means \"with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party\" the territory of that particular member state, in accordance with the first sentence of Article 1(10). In other words, the relevant area is that of the Contracting Party *that is party to the dispute.* In this case, the relevant Area is the territory of Spain (not of the EU), and thus the diversity of area requirement is complied with where the investors are of a Contracting Party other than Spain and the investment has been carried out in the territory of Spain.\n\n180.\n\nThe situation may be different where the EU itself is a Respondent. In that case, \"with respect to a [REIO]\" (Article 1(10), second sentence), the relevant Area would be the entire EU Area and the diversity of area requirement would have to be satisfied with respect to that territory. This is, however, not the scenario before the Tribunal.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that there is no indication in the text of the Treaty that the Contracting Parties have limited their consent to arbitration on the basis that some of the Contracting Parties belong to the same REIO. In this respect, the consent of EU member states (as of all ECT Contracting Parties) is \"unconditional\" and subject only to two clearly defined exceptions set forth in Article 26(3) of the Treaty, neither of which is relevant for the present purposes.192\n\nThe first of these two exceptions (Article 26(3)(b)) is relevant for the sixth jurisdictional objection, on which see *infra,* Section IV.C.5.\n\n182.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the ECT contains no disconnection clause in respect of intra-EU disputes. When discussing disconnection clauses in multilateral treaties to which EU member states (and in some cases, also the EU) are parties, the International Law Commission stated in its Report on Fragmentation that \"[t]he purpose of the [disconnection] clause is, according to the European Commission, to ensure the continuing application of Community rules between EC member States without any intent to affect the obligations between member States and other parties to treaties\".193 By the time the ECT was concluded, the EU and its member states already had prior experience of disconnection clauses inserted in treaties to which they were parties. For example, the 1988 Council of Europe / OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters provides that:\n\nNotwithstanding the rules of the present Convention, those Parties which are members of the European Economic Community shall \u00abapply in their mutual relations the common rules in force in that Community.194\n\n*Fragmentation of International Law: difficulties arising from the diversification and expansion of international law,* Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, finalised by Martti Koskenniemi, International Law Commission, fifty-eighth session, Geneva, 1 May-9 June and 3 July-11 August 2006, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682, 13 April 2006 (**Exh. CLA-72**), para. 289.\n\n1988 Council of Europe/OECD Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, Article 27, quoted in *Fragmentation of International Law: difficulties arising from the diversification and expansion of international law*, Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, finalised by M. Koskenniemi, International Law Commission, fifty-eighth session, Geneva, 1 May-9 June and 3 July-11 August 2006, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/L.682, 13 April 2006 (**Exh. CLA-72**), para. 289.\n\n183.\n\nNo similar clause is contained in the ECT. To the contrary, the ECT shows that where the Contracting Parties deemed it necessary to address the relationship with other treaty regimes, they did so expressly. One example is contained in Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference which provides that in the event of a conflict between the Svalbard Treaty and the ECT, the former shall prevail.195 It would seem striking that the Contracting Parties made an express exception for the Svalbard Treaty, which concerns an archipelago in the Arctic, but somehow omitted to specify that the ECT's dispute settlement system did not apply in all of the EU member states' relations. Compared to the Svalbard Treaty exception, an exception with regard to the intra-EU relations would be of much greater significance. It would be extraordinary that an essential component of the Treaty, such as investor-state arbitration, would not apply among a significant number of Contracting Parties without the Treaty drafters addressing this exception. In the Tribunal's view, it is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty to read into it an implicit intra-EU disconnection clause.\n\n*Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference,* in The Energy Charter Secretariat, *The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents* (2004) (**Exh. CLA-18**), p. 135 (\"In the event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsbergen of 9 February 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty) and the Energy Charter Treaty, the treaty concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the conflict, without prejudice to the positions of the Contracting Parties in respect of the Svalbard Treaty\").\n\n184.\n\nFurthermore, the EU itself, as a Contracting Party to the Treaty, has accepted the possibility of investor-state arbitration, without any distinction or reservation. In this respect, the Tribunal is unable to see how the Council and Commission Decision or the EC Statement could be read as evincing an intention that the ECT or its investor-state dispute settlement mechanism do not apply in the relations among EU member states. The Council and Commission Decision approving the ECT on behalf of the then European Communities is silent about any special rule applicable in the intra-EU context. The EC Statement, on its part, was submitted by the then European Communities to the ECT Secretariat \"pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the Energy Charter Treaty\", as the title of the EC Statement makes clear. It thus relates to the possibility for a Contracting Party to provide a \"statement of its policies, practices and conditions\" in respect of the application of the fork-in-the-road clause. The EC Statement also provides for a procedure to determine who, among the EU or its member states, should be the respondent to a particular dispute. It clarifies that there may be instances in which both the EU and one or more member states may be respondents in investment arbitrations initiated pursuant to the ECT. The EC Statement, however, in no way lends itself to an interpretation whereby intra-EU disputes would be carved out from the ECT dispute settlement framework.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal is further unconvinced by the Respondent\u2019s argument about the harmonious reading of the investor-state and state-to-state arbitration provisions in the Treaty. Spain invokes *Mox Plant* for the proposition that no intra-EU dispute between EU member states can be resolved by an *ad hoc* tribunal under Article 27. For Spain, such a dispute must be left to the CJEU, which has exclusive jurisdiction under Article 344 of the TFEU.196 The investor-state provision in Article 26 should then be understood in conformity with this interpretation of Article 27.\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 21: 21-25; 22: 1-7 (referring to Article 292 of the EC Treaty (now Article 344 of the TFEU)).\n\n186.\n\nArticle 344 of the TFEU (ex Article 292 of the EC Treaty) provides as follows:\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.197\n\nConsolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (**Exh. RLA-63**), Art. 344.\n\n187.\n\nIn *Mox Plant,* the ECJ held the following:\n\nan international agreement such as the [United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea] cannot affect the exclusive jurisdiction of the [CJEU] in regard to the resolution of disputes between Member States concerning the interpretation and application of Community law.198\n\n*Mox Plant,* para. 132.\n\n188.\n\nAs a first matter, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is doubtful whether Article 344 TFEU, as interpreted by the ECJ in *Mox Plant,* would bar an inter-state arbitration between EU member states under all circumstances. At least for questions falling within the scope of the ECT that do not concern \"the interpretation and application of [EU] law\",199 there may still be room for the Treaty\u2019s inter-state dispute settlement clause. This first observation would be sufficient to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s reasoning based on the allegedly harmonious reading of the state-to-state and investor-state clauses as a consequence of *Mox Plant*.\n\n*Mox Plant,* para. 132.\n\n189.\n\nIn any event, whatever the implications of Article 344 TFEU and of the *Mox Plant* ruling might be for inter-state arbitration under Article 27 of the ECT, that TFEU provision and that ECJ ruling are not applicable to disputes under Article 26. Upon a plain reading of Article 344 TFEU, it is clear that such provision applies only to disputes involving two or more EU member states but does not prohibit the submission of disputes between other actors to a different method of settlement not contemplated in the EU Treaties. Because there is no provision in the EU Treaties dealing with investor-state arbitration, the principle set out in Article 344 TFEU is not applicable to that mechanism.200 Thus, whatever interpretation of Article 27 of the ECT results from *Mox Plant,* it cannot affect the operation of Article 26 of the ECT.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for this finding in previous arbitral rulings, in particular in: *Electrabel,* para. 4,151 (\"as regards an international or national arbitration tribunal in a dispute not involving two or more EU Member States as parties, there is no provision equivalent to Article 292 EC [Treaty] (now Article 344 TFEU) dealing with arbitration between two or more private parties, nationals of Member States, or with mixed disputes settlement mechanisms such as investor-state arbitration between individuals, nationals of EU Member States and an EU Member State under the ICSID Convention or other international instruments. Article 292 EC [Treaty] is not applicable to these arbitration tribunals\"); *Eureko,* Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010 (**Exh. RLA-69**) *(\"Eureko* Award\"), para. 276 (\"Reference was made to the ruling of the ECJ in the *MOX Plant* case, that by virtue of Article 344 TFEU (ex Article 292 TEC) and the principle of loyalty the ECJ had exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between two Member States. Whatever the implications of that ruling might be for Article 10 of the BIT, which is concerned with disputes between the BIT Contracting Parties, the ruling is not applicable to disputes under Article 8, which are not disputes between Contracting Parties but investor-State disputes. There is no suggestion here that every dispute that arises between a Member State and an individual must be put before the ECJ; nor would the ECJ have the jurisdiction (let alone the capacity) to decide all such cases\"). The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court also came to the same conclusion. See *Slovak Republic v. Eureko B.V.,* Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main, Judgment, 10 May 2012, (**Exh. CLA-46** [English translation]) *(\"Eureko* Oberlandesgericht\"), paras. 80, 90 (\"The prevailing view in scholarly commentary and literature interprets this to mean that Art. 344 TFEU only covers disputes between the Member States [...], for which reason the underlying set-up in this case (investor-state level) is already not covered in principle by Art. 344 TFEU.\" \"The judicature of the ECJ does not contain any indications [...] that Art. 344 TFEU applies directly to disputes between a Member State and an investor of another Member State or that the general competence of investment arbitral tribunals is in doubt\").\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that in an intra-EU context, \"it would be incompatible with EU law to implement an \u2018investor-State\u2019 arbitration mechanism for its resolution\".201 Spain contends that if intra-EU investor-state arbitration were allowed, \"the uniform application of EU law would be jeopardised\", because arbitral tribunals do not have the possibility to seek a preliminary ruling on the interpretation of EU law from the CJEU.202\n\nR-Reply, para. 106.\n\nR-Reply, para. 109.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with these arguments. It is clear that the EU Treaties do not provide for an absolute monopoly of the CJEU over the interpretation and application of EU law.203 There are numerous instances where EU law is applied outside of the judicial framework of the EU. A non-EU court may, for instance, have to apply EU law, when the law of an EU member state applies under the relevant conflict of law rule, without the possibility to seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. The same applies in commercial arbitrations between private parties. Furthermore, Spain does not deny that investor-state arbitration under the ECT would at least be possible between an EU member state and a non-EU investor. However, even in the latter case a question of EU law could arise which could potentially escape an interpretation by the CJEU. It follows that there is no incompatibility between investor-state arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT and the role of the CJEU in interpreting and applying EU law.204 Also the principle of mutual trust in the court system of the EU member states is unable to override the investor-state mechanism explicitly agreed to by the EU member states and the EU itself. The principle of mutual trust does not prohibit private parties, wishing to settle their disputes outside of the court system, from choosing arbitration. There is no reason for holding otherwise when one disputing party is a state. The same argument has been previously rejected by arbitral tribunals and domestic courts dealing with similar objections.205\n\nSee *Electrabel,* para. 4,147; *Eureko* Award, para. 282.\n\nSee also *Electrabel,* para. 4,146.\n\n*Eastern Sugar v.

RLA-55**), para. 171; *Eureko* Oberlandesgericht, paras. 117-124 (holding that the principle of mutual trust is not violated because arbitration is a widely recognized mechanism for dispute resolution and therefore implies no disrespect for state courts).\n\n**ii. Subsequent agreements and subsequent practice**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the arguments made by the Respondent by reference to other instruments under Article 31(3)(a) or Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT. These provisions allow the interpreter to take account of \"any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\" (a) and \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" (b).\n\n193.\n\nThe subsequent agreement referred to in Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT must \"regard\" the interpretation of the treaty under examination. Through such agreement, the parties must have purported to clarify the meaning of the treaty.206 Furthermore, the subsequent agreement must be made between \"the parties\", that is between all the parties to the treaty.207\n\nSee Georg Nolte, *First report on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to treaty interpretation,* International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session, 6 May-7 June and 8 July-9 August 2013, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/660, para. 76.\n\nGeorg Nolte, *First report on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to treaty interpretation,* International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session, 6 May-7 June and 8 July-9 August 2013, U.N. Doc. A/CN.4/660, para. 79. See also recently, in relation to both Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the VCLT, International Court of Justice, *Whaling in the Antarctic* (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening), Judgment, 31 March 2014, para. 83: \"many IWC resolutions were adopted *without the support of all States parties to the Convention* and, in particular, without the concurrence of Japan. Thus, such instruments cannot be regarded as subsequent agreement to an interpretation of Article VIII, nor as subsequent practice establishing an agreement of the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty within the meaning of subparagraphs (a) and (b), respectively, of paragraph (3) of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\" (emphasis added).\n\n194.\n\nSimilarly, according to Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, the practice of the parties is only relevant if it occurs \"in the application\" of the treaty. In addition, while not every party must have individually engaged in the relevant practice, Article 31(3)(b) requires the practice \"to establish the agreement of the parties\", again meaning all the parties.208 If only some parties participated in the practice, all of them must have at least acquiesced in the respective interpretation of the treaty.209\n\nSee the commentary of the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") to Draft Art. 27(3)(b), which later became Art. 31(3)(b) of the VCLT:  \nThe text provisionally adopted in 1964 spoke of a practice which \u2018establishes the understanding of all the parties'. By omitting the word \u2018all' the Commission did not intend to change the rule. It considered that the phrase \u2018the understanding of the parties' necessarily means \u2018the parties as a whole'. It omitted the word \u2018all' merely to avoid any possible misconception that every party must individually have engaged in the practice where it suffices that it should have accepted the practice.  \n*Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with commentaries,* International Law Commission, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1966, vol. II, *sub* Art. 27, p. 222, para. 15.\n\nSee *Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with commentaries,* International Law Commission, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1966, vol. II, *sub* Art. 27, p. 222, para. 15. See also Oliver D\u00f6rr, Kirsten Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A Commentary* (Springer, 2012), p. 559, para. 86 (\"if not every party has participated in the practice, there must be at least good evidence that the other, inactive parties have endorsed it\"); Georg Nolte, *Subsequent Agreements and Subsequent Practice of States Outside of Judicial or Quasi-judicial Proceedings. Third Report for the ILC Study Group on Treaties over Time*, in *Treaties and Subsequent Practice* (ed. Georg Nolte, 2013, Oxford University Press), p. 310 (\"[Article 31(3)(b) does not require that the practice must originate from all parties, but rather that all parties must have at least acquiesced in the respective interpretation of the treaty\").\n\n195.\n\nFor the purposes of the interpretation of the ECT, it is clear that none of the instruments invoked by the Respondent qualifies as subsequent agreement (Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT) or subsequent practice (Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT).\n\n196.\n\nFirst, the Lisbon Treaty cannot be considered as a relevant instrument under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, as it is plainly not an agreement regarding the interpretation of the ECT or the application of its provisions. Likewise, it cannot serve as subsequent practice under Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT: it is no practice \"in the application\" of the ECT, nor does it establish the consent of all of the ECT contracting states regarding the ECT's interpretation.\n\n197.\n\nThe EU draft Regulation on financial responsibility and EU Regulation No. 1219/2012 are equally unavailing when it comes to the interpretation of the ECT. Neither qualifies as a subsequent agreement or subsequent practice under the VCLT. The first instrument is a proposal for a Regulation which addresses the financial consequences arising from investor-state disputes and sets out the \"central organising principle\" that \"financial responsibility flowing from investor-state dispute settlement cases should be attributed to the actor [EU or member state] which afforded the treatment in dispute\".210 The proposal also determines who amongst the EU and its member states must act as respondent in investment disputes. While the ECT is mentioned once in the preamble,211 the draft Regulation is not sufficiently related to the interpretation or application of the ECT to be taken into account under Article 31(3)(a) or (b). The second instrument, EU Regulation No. 1219/2012, confirms the validity of existing extra-EU BITs until the EU decides to replace them.212 It never refers to the ECT or to multilateral investment agreements more generally.213 On its face, it is thus not related to the interpretation or the application of the ECT. In addition, both EU draft Regulation on financial responsibility and EU Regulation No. 1219/2012 fail to meet the requirement involving all the parties to the treaty under interpretation, as does the Lisbon Treaty.\n\nEU draft Regulation on financial responsibility, Explanatory Memorandum, p. 2.\n\nSee EU draft Regulation on financial responsibility, Whereas No. 1. See also the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum, p. 2.\n\nSee Regulation No. 1219/2012, Art. 3.\n\nRegulation No. 1219/2012 always refers to \"bilateral\" investment agreements (and makes no mention to multilateral investment agreements). It also provides that \"[i]nvestment agreements between Member States should not be covered by this Regulation\", *ibid.,* Whereas no. 15.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent has further relied on the European Commission\u2019s position on intra-EU investment treaties,214 and especially on the European Commission\u2019s *amicus* brief in *Electrabel,* a dispute under the ECT. The Commission\u2019s position in that case, howsoever important, cannot constitute subsequent practice evidencing an agreement of all the Contracting Parties on the interpretation of the ECT. As an organ of the EU, the Commission may represent the position of the EU, which is only one of the Parties to the ECT. It also bears noting that, while the Commission objected to the jurisdiction of the *Electrabel* tribunal in respect of certain claims (those which, in the Commission\u2019s words, \"the Respondent \u2018brought about in compliance with\u2019 the Commission\u2019s Final Decision of 4 June 2008\"215), it took no issue with the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over claims based on measures taken by Hungary without reference to EU law or a Commission decision.216 That submission is thus ultimately of no help to the Respondent in the present circumstances, as this case, as pleaded by the Claimants, concerns domestic measures adopted by Spain in the energy sector. The Claimants have argued that Spain is not suggesting that it bears no responsibility for its actions because it was directed to take those actions by the EU,217 and the Respondent has not contradicted the Claimants on this point.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the European Commission has not sought leave to submit an *amicus curiae* brief in this case, and neither Party has requested the Tribunal to invite such submission from the Commission.\n\n*Electrabel,* para. 5.9.\n\n*Electrabel,* paras. 5.10-5.11.\n\nC-Answer, para. 231; Hearing Tr. [English version] (Sullivan), pp. 96-97.\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent has also invoked the Commission\u2019s *amicus* brief in *Eureko.* This was not a dispute under the ECT, but under the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT. It is difficult to see how a position on the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT could establish a practice in the interpretation of the ECT. Such position cannot qualify as practice \"in the application\" of the ECT. What is more, the views expressed by the European Commission are not shared by the majority of EU member states, who in fact have expressed different views on this matter. Suffice it to cite the stance taken by the Dutch Government in the same *Eureko* case, in which the Dutch Government, taking a diametrically opposed position as the one held by the Commission, supported the jurisdiction of the tribunal.218 If anything, there would rather appear to be divergent practices, which by definition cannot reflect an agreement between the parties on the interpretation of a treaty.\n\n*Eureko* Award, paras. 154-166, esp. 161.\n\n**iii. Supplementary means of interpretation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal addresses arguments raised by Spain which may be viewed as relating to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the VCLT. In support of its intra-EU objection, the Respondent has relied on the allegedly pivotal role of the EU in conceiving and negotiating the ECT. While the Tribunal has no difficulty in noting that the EU played an important role in achieving the conclusion of the ECT, this observation cannot change the interpretive result to which the Tribunal has arrived by resorting to the general rule of interpretation laid down in Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n201.\n\nThe same is true of the Respondent\u2019s argument that \"there have never been any BITs between EU Member States\"219 and that \"[a]ll intra-EU BITs are the result of circumstances of accession by former Eastern Bloc countries to the EU\"220. The Tribunal cannot see how this argument could assist in the interpretation of the ECT. The very existence of the ECT somehow defeats this argument, because the ECT is precisely a treaty to which \"old\" EU member states were parties from the beginning, and prior to the EU accession waves.\n\nR-Reply, para. 101. See also Hearing Tr. [English version] (Leathley), at 36-37 (referring to a \"chart\" on BITs concluded by \"old\" EU member states).\n\nR-Reply, p. 32, fn. 88.\n\n202.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* submitted by the Respondent in support of its objection cannot change the meaning at which the Tribunal has arrived by applying the general rules of interpretation. Nothing can in fact be drawn from the term \"competences\" appearing at one point in what would become the definition of \"Area\", and being introduced in the definition of \"REIO\" at a later stage of the negotiations. The Tribunal finds these elements of the *travaux* unclear and inconclusive.\n\n**iv. Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that intra-EU disputes are not excluded from the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal constituted under Article 26 of the ECT.\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached this conclusion by way of an independent analysis on the basis of the Treaty and the Parties' arguments. Having done so, it finds support for its conclusions in earlier decisions. It is true that the particular facets of the intra-EU objections in these earlier cases were not identical to the ones presented here. For example, some of the earlier intra-EU cases involved arguments of inapplicability or termination of the investment treaty under Articles 30 or 59 of the VCLT, which the Respondent did not advance in this case. Irrespective of these differences, the common conclusion reached by all the arbitral tribunals and courts having considered intra-EU objections, without exception, has been that EU law does not preclude jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal where an investor of an EU member state brings an investment treaty claim against another EU member state.221\n\nSee, in chronological order, *Eastern Sugar; Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 April 2010 (**Exh. RLA-74**); *Eureko* Award; *Eureko* Oberlandesgericht; and *Electrabel.*\n\n205.\n\nAs the Tribunal has explained above, the same conclusion applies in respect of the ECT, which is also an intra-EU treaty from the standpoint of the 27 EU member states in their relations *inter se.* In addition, the Tribunal fails to see why the outcome should be different because in this case \"all old\" EU member states are involved, as opposed to cases brought under BITs between an \"old\" member state and a state having acceded to the EU at a later stage. The analysis of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in an intra-EU dispute is the same whether it involves an old or new EU member state. States that were already members of the EU were aware of the obligations arising from their membership when they decided to enter into a treaty providing for a binding investor-state arbitration mechanism such as the ECT. The logic of the argument that investor-state arbitration is not an available remedy in their intra-EU relations is thus difficult to understand.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal finally takes note that neither Party has claimed that there is a conflict between the substantive provisions of the ECT and EU law.222 In any event, such a conflict would only affect the merits, not the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nSee *supra,* paras. 172-173.\n\n207.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Respondent\u2019s intra-EU objection is rejected.\n\n**3. Fourth objection: the Claimants have failed to make a** ***prima facie*** **showing that they have suffered financial harm**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nSpain contends that the Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants have failed to make a *prima facie* showing that there is a dispute and \"an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part III\" of the ECT.223\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 213.\n\n209.\n\nThe dispute resolution provision of Article 26(1) of the ECT refers to \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor [...] which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III [...]\". According to Spain, at the jurisdictional stage, a tribunal must be satisfied that the facts relied upon by the Claimants - when tested on a *prima facie* basis - could amount to a breach of a treaty obligation.224 Spain also contends that a *prima facie* showing of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT requires a showing of financial harm,225 as the sole metric for the evaluation of any \"treatment\" and legitimate expectations is financial. To establish jurisdiction, the Claimants must thus demonstrate that a particular piece of legislation has caused them a loss.226 Even if all the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim were established, Spain argues, no loss would be proven and no breach of either FET or legitimate expectations would be established.227\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 216.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 227.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 232, citing to *CMS v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003 (**Exh. RLA-44**), paras. 33-35.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 239.\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the need to make reference to financial harm in determining state responsibility for an internationally wrongful act depends on the content and interpretation of the obligation allegedly breached. Spain cites to the Commentary to Article 2 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001) (the \"ILC Articles\") for the proposition that it is unclear whether the two elements of breach of obligation and causation are sufficient to assess whether an internationally wrongful act has been committed. With reference to such Commentary, the Respondent contends that the need for harm as an additional element cannot be analyzed in the abstract as it depends on the content of the obligation at stake.228 For Spain, the FET standard includes the element of harm.229\n\nR-Reply, para. 146.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 148, 155.\n\n211.\n\nSpain further submits that the fact that the claims are aimed at restitution as well as compensation does not change the fact that both remedies are rooted in the existence of harm.230\n\nR-Reply, paras. 151-152.\n\n212.\n\nBecause the Claimants base their allegations of breach of the FET standard primarily on the financial harm suffered, Spain posits that they should have stated the amount of their loss.231 While it is true that at the first procedural hearing, the Tribunal ordered that proceedings be bifurcated between liability and quantum, the Presiding Arbitrator noted Spain's concern as to the need to quantify losses and allegedly stated that when presenting their Statement of Claim, the Claimants \"must show reference to the numbers\".232\n\nR-Reply, paras. 132-140.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 245; R-Reply, para. 140.\n\n213.\n\nAccording to Spain, none of the documents submitted by the Claimants to date contain even a mere indication of the amount of damage allegedly caused.233 The figures referring to the reductions in electricity production contained in the Statement of Claim do not meet the *prima facie* test, as they do not convey the degree of harm the Claimants would have suffered.234 The witness statements provided by the Claimants only reflect percentages of reductions in energy generation, but give no estimate of the reduction in profits.235 Similarly, the expert report submitted by the Claimants offers no valuation of damage.236\n\nR-Reply, para. 182.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 185-190.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 191-192.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 193-199.\n\n214.\n\nSpain cites to *Telenor v. Hungary* as a relevant precedent. In that case, the tribunal declared that it had no jurisdiction over a claim of expropriation where the claimant had failed to show the impact of the alleged expropriatory act.237 Spain concludes that in the absence of any allegation or evidence of loss, the dispute is hypothetical: \"If there is no loss, there is no dispute\".238\n\nJurisdiction Objections, para. 240.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 250.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the failure to specify the harm caused represents a breach of the procedural obligations to \"set forth all the allegations of facts and law and legal arguments on which they intend to rely\"239 and to \"submit their allegations of facts and law in a detailed, specified and comprehensive manner\".240 The Respondent also relies on Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules which obliges the Tribunal to conduct the proceedings \"so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense\", which according to Spain is intended to confer upon arbitral tribunals the flexibility required to deal with \"unfounded\" or \"frivolous\" cases.241\n\nPO1, para. 9.\n\nProcedural Rules, para. 3.3.\n\nR-Reply, para. 209.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimants submit that this objection is entirely without merit for several reasons. First, this objection should be considered against the backdrop of the present stage of the arbitration, in which the Tribunal has bifurcated the proceedings on liability and quantum. For the Claimants, the very purpose of bifurcating liability and quantum is to avoid lengthy submissions on quantum in the event that there is no liability. The Claimants should thus not be required to prove their loss, unless and until the Tribunal holds that Spain is liable.242\n\nC-Answer, para. 314.\n\n217.\n\nSecond, nothing in the ECT requires that, for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction, \"the Claimants were required to allege that they have suffered financial harm\".243 Citing to *Plama v. Bulgaria244* and the test proposed by Judge Higgins in *Oil Platforms,245* the Claimants agree with the Respondent that \"in order to invoke the ECT's dispute resolution provision, the investor must show \u2018an alleged breach of an obligation'\", and that \"a tribunal...must be satisfied that the facts relied upon by the Claimants when tested on a *prima facie* basis could amount to a breach of an obligation\".246 Yet, \"the demonstration of a breach of a treaty obligation does not also require the demonstration of the resulting damages\".247\n\nC-Answer, para. 317.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 (\"*Plama*\") (**Exh. RLA-47**).\n\n*Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, ICJ Report 1996, pp. 847-861, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins (\"*Oil Platforms* -Judge Higgins' Opinion\") (**Exh. RLA-98**).\n\nC-Answer, para. 318.\n\nC-Answer, para. 320.\n\n218.\n\nThird, there is no requirement in the ECT or under general international law that a state must cause financial harm in order to breach the FET obligation. As a matter of general international law, according to the Claimants, breach of an international obligation, causation, and damages are distinct issues.248 This is clear from the ILC Articles, which provide that an internationally wrongful act engages the responsibility of a state if the two elements of breach and attribution are present.249 Furthermore, a claimant could bring a claim for breach of FET seeking satisfaction pursuant to ILC Article 34 or cessation, but not necessarily damages.250 Thus, the Claimants conclude that they are \"only required to establish, *prima facie,* that the allegations (which must be taken as true for purposes of jurisdiction) give rise to a claim which falls within the ECT\".251\n\nC-Answer, para. 324.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 325-326, referring to Articles 1 and 2 of the ILC Articles.\n\nC-Answer, para. 328.\n\nC-Answer, para. 354.\n\n219.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that \"[e]ven assuming, *arguendo,* that the Claimants must make a *prima facie* showing of financial harm, the allegations that are currently on the record with respect to the harm suffered by the Claimants are extensive\".252 In their view, the SoC, witness statements and the expert report all demonstrate the harm suffered by each Claimant as a result of Spain's measures. For example, the SoC provides figures representing the approximate reduction in electricity production eligible for the RD 661/2007 FIT (which equates to a corresponding reduction in revenues).253 The same type of harm is also evidenced in the 14 witness statements submitted by the Claimants.254 Similarly, the expert report provides a comprehensive statistically based analysis of the impact of Spain's measures on the value of the Claimants' investment.255\n\nC-Answer, para. 355.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 367-374.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 375-380.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 381-386.\n\n**c. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by recalling that under Article 26(1) of the ECT, its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is limited to \"[d]isputes [...] which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the [Respondent] under Part III [...]\".\n\n221.\n\nThe first condition requires that there be a \"dispute\". According to the oft-quoted definition given by the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\"), a dispute is a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons\".256 In this case, there is clearly a disagreement on points of fact and law between the Parties, which originates from the Respondent\u2019s measures in the PV sector.\n\n*The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions* (Greece v. Great Britain), PCIJ, Series A, No. 2, Judgment, 30 August 1924 *(\"Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions\"),* p. 11.\n\n222.\n\nSecond, the dispute must concern an alleged breach of an obligation under Part III of the ECT. Entitled \"Investment Promotion and Protection\", Part III of the ECT contains the substantive standards of protection of investments, including, *inter alia,* \"Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments\" (Article 10); \"Compensation for Losses\" (Article 12); \"Expropriation\" (Article 13). It is clear from the Statement of Claim that the Claimants allege breaches of its obligations by the Respondent under Part III of the ECT, in particular FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT;257 non-impairment of the investments by \"unreasonable and discriminatory measures\" under Article 10(1) of the ECT;258 and full protection and security under Article 10(1) of the ECT.259\n\nSoC, paras. 358-396.\n\nSoC, paras. 397-403.\n\nSoC, paras. 404-408.\n\n223.\n\nHowever, it is equally clear that the mere labeling of breaches is not enough for the purposes of the analysis under Article 26. The dispute settlement clause mandates the Tribunal to satisfy itself that there is a dispute \"which concerns\" an alleged breach. Thus, as part of its assessment of its jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the Tribunal must satisfy itself that it is in presence of a dispute which *objectively* concerns such alleged breaches.\n\n224.\n\nIn this respect, the Parties disagree on what precisely the Claimants must show at this stage of the arbitration. While both Parties accept the application of the so-called *prima facie* test in principle,260 they disagree on its exact scope.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 215-218; C-Answer, para. 320.\n\n225.\n\nThe *prima facie* test has its origin in decisions of the PCIJ and the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\"). In *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* the PCIJ held that, prior to reviewing the merits of the case, it had to ascertain whether the claim was capable of coming within the reach of the provision of the Mandate of Palestine of 1922:\n\nThe Court, before giving judgment on the merits of the case, will satisfy itself that the suit before it, in the form in which it has been submitted and on the basis of the facts hitherto established, falls to be decided by application of the clauses of the Mandate.261\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* p. 16.\n\n226.\n\nThe Court also noted that:\n\nAt the present stage of the proceedings the question whether there really has been a breach of these obligations can clearly not be gone into; to do so would involve a decision as to the responsibility of the respondent, a thing which the two Governments concerned do not at the moment ask the Court to do. But, in accordance with the principles set out above, the Court is constrained at once to ascertain whether the international obligations mentioned in Article II affect the merits of the case and whether any breach of them would involve a breach of the provisions of this article.262\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* p. 23.\n\n227.\n\nIn *Ambatielos,* the ICJ held that:\n\nThe Court must determine, however, whether the arguments advanced by the Hellenic Government in respect of the treaty provisions on which the Ambatielos claim is said to be based, are of a sufficiently plausible character to warrant a conclusion that the claim is based on the Treaty. It is not enough for the claimant Government to establish a remote connection between the facts of the claim and the Treaty of 1886.263\n\n*Ambatielos case (merits: obligation to arbitrate)* (Greece v. United Kingdom), Judgment, 19 May 1953, I.C.J. Reports 1953, p. 18.\n\n228.\n\nIn *Oil Platforms,* the Court had to examine whether the dispute between Iran and the United States with respect to the actions carried out by the United States against the Iranian oil platforms was a dispute \"as to the interpretation or application\" of the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Rights of 1955. The Court defined its task at the jurisdictional level in the following terms:\n\nIn order to answer that question, the Court cannot limit itself to noting that one of the Parties maintains that such a dispute exists, and the other denies it. It must ascertain whether the violations of the Treaty of 1955 pleaded by Iran do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain, pursuant to Article XXI, paragraph 2.264\n\n*Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996, para. 16.\n\n229.\n\nIn her Separate Opinion in this case, Judge Rosalyn Higgins further spelled out the test for determining whether a particular claim falls within the compromissory clause of a given treaty. In a well-known passage of her Opinion, she explained that:\n\nThe only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims of Iran are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by Iran to be true and in that light to interpret Articles 1, IV and X for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran's claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.265\n\n*Oil Platforms* - Judge Higgins' Opinion, para. 32.\n\n230.\n\nThe \"Higgins test\" has often been referred to, with approval, by investment treaty tribunals.266 In this context, arbitral tribunals have sought to establish at the jurisdictional stage whether the \"facts alleged [by the claimant] may be capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of the [investment treaty]\".267 Other tribunals have used similar formulations.268 The test as circumscribed by Judge Higgins appears uncontroversial between the Parties.269\n\nAmongst many, see, *e.g., Plama,* an ICSID case under the ECT, in which the tribunal referred to Judge Higgins' approach as \"in [no] sense controversial, either at large or as between the parties to these proceedings\". See *Plama,* para. 119.\n\n*Noble Energy,* para. 153.\n\nSee, *e.g.*, *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, para. 110 (\"Claimant's allegations of fact are subject to a *prima facie* standard according to which the alleged facts should be susceptible of constituting a breach of the Treaty if they were ultimately proven\"); *Canfor Corporation v. United States,* NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Decision on Preliminary Question, 6 June 2006, para. 117 (\"the tribunal must determine whether the facts as alleged by the claimant, if eventually proven, are *prima facie* capable of constituting a violation of the relevant substantive obligations of the respondent State Party under the NAFTA\"); *Micula et al. v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 24 September 2008, para. 66 (\"a tribunal will only make a *prima facie* determination as to whether the facts are capable of constituting violations of the provisions that are invoked\"); *Saipem SpA v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, para. 86 (\"the Tribunal should be satisfied that, if the facts alleged by Saipem ultimately prove true, they would be capable of constituting a violation of Article 5 of the BIT\"); *Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC BV v. Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9, Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction, 29 May 2009, para. 112 (\"Our task is limited to an assessment of whether [claimant] has pleaded a factual and legal case which, if established, would be capable of giving rise to a violation of the relevant BIT provision\"); *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 February 2006, para. 63 (\"the Tribunal must evaluate whether those facts, when established, could possibly give rise to the Treaty breaches that the Claimant alleges, and which the Tribunal is competent to pass upon\").\n\nThe Respondent agrees that \"[a]t the jurisdiction stage, a tribunal does not have to be satisfied that there has been a breach of an obligation, but it must be satisfied that the facts relied upon by the Claimants when tested on a *prima facie* basis could amount to a breach of an obligation\" (Jurisdictional Objections, para. 216).\n\n231.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree on whether the test extends to financial harm and, if so, whether it is met in this respect. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, at the present jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must be satisfied that the facts alleged by the Claimants if later proven could amount to a breach of an obligation of Part III of the ECT, without need to identify precisely any financial harm suffered. The Tribunal notes that as a general matter damages are not considered as a pre-requisite for state responsibility, except if the obligation not to cause damage is part of the content of the primary obligation breached. This is made clear in the ILC Articles and its commentaries.270 In this particular instance, the Respondent has directed its *prima facie* objection at FET and legitimate expectations (which, in turn, are generally understood to be a component of FET).271 The Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent has not offered sufficient elements to establish that the primary obligation to provide FET requires financial harm as a constituent element. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that no such showing is required from the Claimants at this stage.\n\nSee ILC Articles, with Commentaries, *sub* Art. 2, para. 9; Art. 31, para. 6.\n\nThe Respondent has not taken issue with an alleged lack of showing of financial harm in respect of the other standards invoked by the Claimants, such as non-impairment of the investments by unreasonable and discriminatory measures and full protection and security.\n\n232.\n\nIn light of the foregoing principles, the Tribunal has reviewed the Claimants\u2019 Statement of Claim, and is satisfied that the facts as alleged by the Claimants and taken as true for jurisdictional purposes could, if established, constitute breaches of the FET standard.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants have contended that RD 661/2007 provided certain investment incentives to qualifying PV installations and, in particular, a fixed, lifetime FIT for all electricity generated. According to the Claimants, RD 661/2007 also provided that any future changes to the FIT would not affect existing investors.272 The Claimants submit that they made their investments relying on these incentives and that they would not have made their investments without them.\n\nNoA, para. 43; SoC, paras. 10, 155-157.\n\n234.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, once the investment was made and Spain was receiving the benefits of that investment, it withdrew the incentives.273 In particular, they contend that, between late 2008 and early 2011, Spain took a series of actions which fundamentally altered the legal framework of the Claimants\u2019 investment. RD 1565/2010 allegedly first limited the right of PV installations to receive the FIT to the first 25 years of the installations\u2019 existence. The subsequent RDL 14/2010 allegedly cut the FIT by limiting the number of operating hours in which the FIT was available to installations registered under RD 661/2007.274 The Claimants argue that the Spanish authorities have subjected the Claimants to a \"rollercoaster ride\" of changes to the framework of their investment, thereby frustrating their legitimate expectations.275\n\nNoA, para. 10.\n\nNoA, paras. 69-77.\n\nSoC, para. 382.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, taking the facts as alleged by the Claimants as *pro tem* true for the purposes of the present jurisdictional analysis, Spain's measures *could,* if proven, constitute breaches of the FET pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n236.\n\nIt goes without saying that it is only at the merits stage that the Tribunal will assess whether the facts alleged are established and whether the claims are well-founded in law, i.e., whether Spain's acts constitute breaches of the ECT.276 At this stage, the Tribunal does not make - nor is in the position to make - any findings in this respect.\n\nTo quote again Judge Higgins' Separate Opinion, \"[w]hat is for the merits - and which remains pristine and untouched by this approach to the jurisdictional issue - is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the relevant treaty provision] [...]. In short, it is at the merits that one sees \u2018whether there really has been a breach'\" (citing to *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* p. 23). See *Oil Platforms* - Judge Higgins Opinion, para. 34.\n\n237.\n\nEven if, contrary to what the Tribunal has held, the Respondent had proven that financial harm is a constituent element of the FET standard, the Tribunal is of the view that at this stage the Claimants would merely be required to make an *allegation* of harm, without having to set out comprehensively, let alone prove, their entire case on damages. In the Tribunal's view, this burden of allegation would have been met by the Claimants which, in both their pleadings and the accompanying expert report, have made sufficient allegations of harm. The indication of a precise numerical figure is immaterial in this respect.\n\n238.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's fourth jurisdictional objection.\n\n**4. Fifth objection: entities organized under the laws of Spain have no standing to bring ECT claims under the UNCITRAL Rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nSpain contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in respect of 62 of the 88 Claimants on the ground that those Claimants are entities incorporated in Spain and, as such, have no standing to bring claims in an UNCITRAL arbitration under Article 26 of the ECT. These 62 Claimants are the following:\n\n(i) AES Solar Espa\u00f1a Finance S.L. (belonging to the AES Solar corporate group) (one entity);\n\n(ii) AES Solar Espa\u00f1a I B.V. y CIA S.C. (also belonging to the AES Solar corporate group) (one entity);\n\n(iii) La Solana S.L. 1 to La Solana S.L. 60 (belonging to the KGAL corporate group) (60 entities).\n\n240.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a combined reading of Articles 26(1) and Article 1(7)(a) of the ECT requires that, as a general rule, only a non-national of the host state may commence proceedings under the ECT against that state.277 Article 26(1) of the ECT provides for investor-state arbitration in relation to disputes \"between a Contracting Party and an Investor of *another* Contracting Party\".278 In turn, Article 1(7)(a) defines \"Investor\" as:\n\n[...] (a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n[....] a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party; [...].\n\nR-Reply, paras. 218-219.\n\nR-Reply, para. 218 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n241.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the only exception to the general rule requiring diversity of nationality is set out in Article 26(7) of the ECT, which reads as follows:\n\nAn Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State\".\n\n242.\n\nSpain submits that the exception in Article 26(7), allowing locally incorporated companies under foreign control to bring an arbitral claim against the host state, applies only in respect of arbitrations brought under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. Conversely, Article 26(7) does not apply to arbitrations brought under the UNCITRAL Rules or the Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (\"SCC\"), which are the other two options available to qualifying investors under Article 26(4) of the ECT.279 According to Spain, the ordinary meaning of Article 26(7), which only refers to ICSID arbitration and does not refer to UNCITRAL arbitration, confines that provision to ICSID arbitrations.280\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 256.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, paras. 257-258.\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent adds that this interpretation is confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT. The Report by the Legal Sub-Group of the Energy Charter conference refers to the following question asked by the Japanese delegation with regard to an early draft of Article 26: \"Why are only the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules referred to in [Article 26(7)]?\", to which the Legal Sub-Group gave the following answer:\n\nAs recognised, the issue pertains only to the ICSID and Additional Facility (AF) rules. Articles 25(2) of the ICSID and 1(6) of the AF rules are special cases and paragraph (7) is specific to those Articles only. Paragraph (7) does not differ in any substantive way from the wording of either Article 25(2) of ICSID or 1 (6) of the AF.281\n\nReport of the Legal Sub-Group of the Energy Charter Conference, 2 May 1994 (**Exh. RLA-30**), pp. 3-4.\n\n244.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, if a dispute arising from the ECT gives rise to an arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, jurisdiction is determined *solely* on the basis of the ECT. Thus, the fact that the UNCITRAL Rules contain no specific jurisdictional requirements in respect of investment arbitration cannot be read as meaning that the diversity of nationality requirement under the ECT is dispensed with when the investor chooses UNCITRAL arbitration.282\n\nR-Reply, para. 224.\n\n245.\n\nFinally, Spain submits that interpreting Article 26(7) of the ECT as confined to ICSID arbitrations would not create different classes of investors. Article 26 of the ECT gives investors various procedural options, some of which may be more and others less attractive depending on the specific case. The 62 Spanish Claimants could have commenced an ICSID arbitration, but chose not to do so and must thus assume the consequences of such choice.283\n\nR-Reply, paras. 232-235.\n\n246.\n\nIn contradistinction, the Claimants argue that Article 26 does not prohibit entities organized under the laws of the host Contracting Party (in this case, Spain) from bringing claims under the UNCITRAL Rules against that host Contracting Party where those entities are controlled by separate entities organized in *other* Contracting Parties (in this case, Germany and The Netherlands).284\n\nC-Answer, paras. 390-391.\n\n247.\n\nWhile Article 26(7) only mentions ICSID arbitration, it is to be \"intuited\" from this provision that the drafters of the ECT envisaged more generally the need of entities organized in this manner to serve as claimants in an ECT arbitration using all sets of rules provided in Article 26 of the ECT.285 The silence of Article 26 on the ability of locally incorporated companies subject to foreign control to submit claims through the SCC or UNCITRAL Rules is due to the fact that there are no additional jurisdictional requirements in those rules. Article 26(7) is thus not an exception but an \"inclusionary provision\", which is necessary because the ICSID Convention contains its own jurisdictional provisions that must be met in addition to the ECT jurisdictional requirements.286 Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires an \"agreement\" between the parties to treat a locally incorporated company as foreign because of foreign control.287 Article 26(7) of the ECT supplies precisely that agreement.288 It is tailored to deal with the hurdles presented by a particular set of arbitration rules, hurdles that do not exist in the UNCITRAL and SCC Rules. That is why, the Claimants submit, there is no need for a similar provision relating to the UNCITRAL or SCC arbitration rules in the ECT.289\n\nC-Answer, para. 399.\n\nC-Answer, para. 404; C-Rejoinder, paras. 118-119.\n\nArt. 25(2)(b) reads:  \n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means: [...] (b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 405-406.\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 122.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their argument is supported by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* upon which Spain relies. With regard to the response given by the Legal Sub-Group to the Japanese delegate,290 the Claimants point to the use of the word \"issue\", which must be understood as the issue created by the special case of the additional jurisdictional \"agreement\" requirement of Article 25(2)(b), which is not raised by the other arbitration rules listed in Article 26.291 The Claimants refer to further examples from the *travaux* which would show that the ECT drafters chose not to explicitly carve out the UNCITRAL Rules also on other matters where it was not necessary.292\n\nSee *supra,* para. 243.\n\nC-Answer, para. 409.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 411-413.\n\n249.\n\nFinally, only the reading of Article 26(7) as propounded by the Claimants would ensure internal consistency and be in accordance with the object and purpose of the ECT.293 Otherwise the ECT would create different classes of investors, dependent on the arbitration rules chosen, some with stronger jurisdictional rights than others. This would amount to discrimination and cannot reflect the drafters' intent.294 In addition, Spain\u2019s interpretation would encourage parallel proceedings, because the foreign controlled Spanish entities could only have recourse to ICSID proceedings which would run parallel to the arbitration under different rules which the foreign entities within the investor\u2019s corporate unit may have started.295\n\nC-Answer, paras. 419-428; C-Rejoinder, paras. 123-125.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 400, 415, 419-428.\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 114, 123.\n\n250.\n\nGiven today\u2019s business reality, where companies are often required to do business in the host state through a locally incorporated entity,296 and given the frequent need for such entities to serve as the claimant in an investment treaty arbitration, Spain\u2019s reading of Article 26 would completely marginalize the UNCITRAL and SCC arbitration options, if not render them useless.297\n\nC-Answer, para. 402.\n\nC-Answer, para. 417.\n\n251.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Claimants made a final alternative argument for the event that the Tribunal were to consider that Article 26 does not allow foreign controlled local entities to start arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. The Claimants argue that the MFN clause in the ECT allows them to invoke the more favorable treatment contained in the Spain-Colombia BIT, which contains no restriction on foreign controlled local companies bringing claims under ICSID or UNCITRAL Rules.298 Therefore, the Claimants would be entitled to bring an ECT claim against Spain under the UNCITRAL Rules.299\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 126-128, referring to the Agreement for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments between Spain and Colombia, made in Bogota on 31 March 2005 (**Exh. CLA-135**).\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 128.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**i. The interpretation of Article 26(7) of the ECT**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal has already recalled the principles that govern treaty interpretation.300 For the purposes of this objection, it again notes that the starting point of treaty interpretation is the text of the Treaty.301 The primacy of the text viewed in its context and bearing in mind the treaty\u2019s object and purpose implies that recourse to other means of interpretation is only allowed in limited circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, one may resort to supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the VCLT, or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\", or (iii) \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".\n\nSee *supra,* paras. 95-96.\n\nAs the ICJ stated in *Libya v. Chad,* \"[i]interpretation must be based above all upon the text of the treaty\" *(Territorial Dispute* (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya v. Chad), Judgment, ICJ Reports 1994, p. 6, para. 41).\n\n253.\n\nBearing these principles in mind, the Tribunal first observes that, pursuant to Article 26(1), the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to \"[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an *Investor of another Contracting Party* relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III of the ECT\" (emphasis added).\n\n254.\n\nThe capitalized term \"Investor\", which appears in Article 26(1) as well as in the subsequent paragraphs of the same Article, is defined in Article 1(7) of the ECT as follows:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;\n\n(ii) a *company* or other organization *organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party;*\n\n(b) with respect to a \"third state\", a natural person, company or other organization which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a Contracting Party. (emphasis added)\n\n255.\n\nThe words used in subparagraph (a)(ii) of Article 1(7) of the ECT clearly show that the place of incorporation is the relevant criterion for the definition of \"Investor\" with regard to juridical persons. While definitions of \"investors\" or \"nationals\" in other investment treaties may take into consideration additional criteria, such as control, this is not the case of the ECT\u2019s definition of \"Investor\".\n\n256.\n\nIt is equally beyond peradventure that, according to the ordinary meaning of the word, the term \"another\" employed in Article 26(1) requires diversity of nationality, citizenship, or permanent residence between a putative claimant and the respondent state.\n\n257.\n\nThus, the plain meaning of Article 26(1) read in combination with Article 1(7)(a)(ii) requires that a putative corporate claimant be incorporated in a Contracting Party other than the respondent state. This is indeed the general rule under the overwhelming majority of investment treaties, where nationals of the host state are normally not allowed to bring investment treaty claims against their home state.\n\n258.\n\nThe following provisions in Article 26 set out a range of possible dispute settlement *fora* which are available to a qualifying investor. These include (i) the domestic courts of the host state; (ii) \"any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure\"; and (iii) international arbitration (Article 26 (2)-(4)). If an investor elects to resort to international arbitration, the ECT provides four possible avenues: (i) arbitration under the ICSID Convention (if both the Contracting Party of the investor and the Contracting Party party to the dispute are parties to the ICSID Convention); (ii) arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules (if either the Contracting Party of the investor or the State party to the dispute, but not both, are a party to the ICSID Convention); (iii) arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules; (iv) arbitration under the SCC Rules (Article 26(4)).\n\n259.\n\nAt the core of the dispute between the Parties lies a further provision of Article 26, i.e., subparagraph 7, which reads as follows:\n\nAn Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting Party party to the dispute on the date of the consent in writing referred to in paragraph (4) and which, before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party, shall for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules be treated as a \"national of another State\".\n\n260.\n\nFor the Respondent, Article 26(7) of the ECT constitutes an exception - made only for arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the Additional Facility Rules - to the requirement of diversity of nationality between a claimant and a respondent state. By contrast, the Claimants understand Article 26(7) as an \"inclusionary rule\" meant to cater for the peculiarity of the ICSID setting, which requires an \"agreement\" for a foreign controlled, locally incorporated company to be treated as a \"national of another Contracting State\" (ICSID Convention) or as a \"national of another State\" (ICSID Additional Facility Rules).\n\n261.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal starts from the ordinary meaning of the treaty provision. It notes that Article 26(7) provides that a locally incorporated company, controlled by investors of another Contracting Party, shall *\"for the purpose of* *article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention* be treated as a \u2018national of another Contracting State' and shall *for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional Facility Rules* be treated as a \u2018national of another State'\" (emphasis added). No mention is made in this article of the UNCITRAL Rules or the SCC Rules. A good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26(7) leads the Tribunal to conclude that this provision grants a foreign controlled, locally incorporated company the possibility to resort only to ICSID arbitration or ICSID Additional Facility arbitration (as applicable), but not to arbitration under the UNCITRAL or SCC Rules.\n\n262.\n\nThe review of the Treaty's object and purpose does not lead to a different result. In this respect, the Claimants have argued that it would be incompatible with the Treaty's object and purpose (which they say includes the creation of a level-playing field for investments and the pursuit of non-discrimination) to interpret Article 26(7) so as to create \"different classes of investors\", each with different \"jurisdictional rights\". The Tribunal is not convinced by this line of reasoning.\n\n263.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the ECT leaves a putative claimant, falling within the definition of \"Investor\" set out in Article 1(7), a range of choices between several arbitration mechanisms. These mechanisms vary in many respects. For example, unlike the others, the ICSID Convention system is not subject to the *lex arbitri* at the seat nor to the supervision of the courts at the seat and has a special regime for the annulment and enforcement of awards. In contrast, an ECT investment arbitration under the other rules (ICSID Additional Facility, UNCITRAL and SCC) is akin to an \"ordinary\" commercial arbitration with regard to its legal regime, i.e., it is subject to the international arbitration law of the seat and to the jurisdiction of the courts at the seat in aid and control of the arbitration (including annulment of awards), and the recognition and enforcement of awards is governed by the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. Each system may have its advantages and disadvantages. The Tribunal agrees with Spain that \"[t]o select a specific option is to lose some of the potential advantages that another may offer\".302\n\nR-Reply, para. 234.\n\n264.\n\nThe four available arbitral systems are also different in terms of jurisdictional requirements. The ICSID Convention and ICSID Additional Facility Rules require respectively that either both or one of the investor's home state or the respondent state be party to the ICSID Convention. In addition, the ICSID Convention requires that there be a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention); it also provides for particular rules on jurisdiction *ratione personae,* including certain critical dates that have to be met by a claimant in order to qualify as national of an ICSID Contracting State (see Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention). The other arbitration rules offered in Article 26 of the ECT contain no similar requirements.\n\n265.\n\nIt is for a prospective claimant to evaluate which of the available arbitration systems best suits its needs, taking into account the possible jurisdictional hurdles that one system may present. The Tribunal does not consider it \"discriminatory\" that a claimant can avail itself of a certain arbitral system and not of others. This difference is not contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty. To the contrary, the ECT itself allows for different \"jurisdictional rights\" (to use the expression adopted by the Claimants) in relation to the different sets of arbitral rules which it offers.\n\n266.\n\nThis is evident if one looks at the ECT's definition of \"Investor\" which includes \"a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law\".303 Because the ICSID Convention limits the Centre's jurisdiction to \"nationals\",304 \"nationals\" of ICSID Convention Contracting States who are also nationals of ECT Contracting Parties would have access to all sets of rules provided in Article 26. By contrast, a permanent resident, despite fulfilling the ECT's *ratione personae* definition, would only be able to claim under UNCITRAL or SCC, but not under ICSID. It is thus the ECT itself that creates investors with different \"jurisdictional rights\" in relation to the arbitration options it offers.\n\nArt. 1(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.\n\nSee Christoph Schreuer, Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch and Antony Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention. A Commentary* (Cambridge, 2009), p. 270, para. 659 (\"An extension of treaty rights to permanent residents cannot extend ICSID's jurisdiction beyond nationals of Contracting States to the ICSID Convention\", citing to ECT Article 1(7)(a)(i) as an example).\n\n267.\n\nIn reverse, a foreign controlled, locally incorporated company would be able to pursue arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, due to the express provision in Article 26(7), but would not be able to bring an arbitration under the UNCITRAL or SCC Rules. In other words, the ICSID requirements may sometimes play to the disadvantage of certain claimants (e.g., permanent residents) and sometimes to their advantage (e.g., locally incorporated companies under foreign control). It is precisely the interplay between the jurisdictional requirements in the ECT and the instruments governing the arbitration proceedings which determines the \"jurisdictional rights\" to which a prospective claimant is entitled under the ECT regime.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, to the extent that the foreign companies or individuals owning or controlling the Spanish entities fulfill the definition of \"Investor\" pursuant to Article 1(7), they could have brought UNCITRAL proceedings in their own name, relying on the provision of Article 1(6) on the definition of \"Investment\" (which includes \"a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise\"). At the Hearing, the Claimants have explained the reason why they have not thus proceeded. With respect to the 60 KGAL Spanish entities, the Claimants have explained that:\n\n[t]he alternative to those Spanish Claimants would be claims by hundreds of individual German investors, German nationals. So the rationale, if you will, for the corporate entities I think is clear: there would be that way rather fewer Claimants that are forming part of the group.305\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Gill), at 180: 16-22.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that reasons of practical efficiency (such as a reduction in the number of claimants, or the avoidance of parallel proceedings, as argued elsewhere by the Claimants306) can justify a departure from the Treaty terms.\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 114, 123.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that the only reading of Article 26(7) of the ECT viewed in its context which comports with Article 31 of the VCLT is the one that limits Article 26(7) to the arbitration mechanisms explicitly mentioned therein, i.e., arbitration under the ICSID Convention and under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.307\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is struck by the fact that Judge Brower's Concurring and Dissenting Opinion (the \"Dissent\") merely pays lip service to the ordinary meaning of the terms of Articles 1(7)(a)(ii), 26(1) and 26(7) of the ECT. Indeed, the first two provisions are not discussed at all. Instead, the Dissent places great emphasis on Understanding No. 3 of the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference as part of the \"context\" of the ECT. The Parties have not referred to such Understanding and, in the majority's opinion, rightly so. As its title shows, Understanding No. 3 was made \"[w]ith respect to Article 1(6)\" of the ECT. Such provision deals with the notion of \"Investment\", defined as \"every kind of *asset,* owned or *controlled* directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes [list follows]\" (emphasis added). Understanding No. 3 clarifies the meaning of \"control\" of an asset by an \"Investor\" as defined in Article 1(7) of the ECT and identifies factors to be considered when examining whether such control exists. Understanding No. 3 does not address the definition of \"Investor\" under Article 1(7)(a)(ii); it is not concerned with the particular rule provided under Article 26(7) of the ECT; and it contains no language that makes it \"of general application to the ECT\" (Dissent, para. 5). In the majority's view, Understanding No. 3 is not intended to, nor could it, modify the clear text of Articles 1(7), 26(1) and 26(7) of the ECT.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find it necessary to refer to supplementary means of interpretation and in particular to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty to elucidate the meaning of Article 26(7) of the ECT. The meaning that arises from the application of Article 31 of the VCLT is neither ambiguous nor obscure, nor is the result absurd or unreasonable, let alone manifestly so. However, because the Parties have both referred to the *travaux* in their written and oral submissions, the Tribunal will nonetheless address them.\n\n272.\n\nThe Parties have referred to the following excerpts from the drafting history of the ECT, which records an exchange between the Japanese Delegation and the Legal Sub-Group. It is useful to quote the exchange relating to what then became Article 26(7) in full:\n\nThis report responds to questions from the Japanese Delegation concerning Article [26]. The questions are set out separately below, followed by our answers.\n\n[...]\n\n1. Why are only the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules referred to in this paragraph?\n\n2. Interpretation and application of ICSID Convention, which is independent from the Treaty, cannot be decided unilaterally by the Treaty. Therefore, even if this paragraph (7) provides for definition of \"National of another Contracting State\", the content of which is slightly different from that of Article 25(2) of ICSID Convention, it does not make sense legally.\n\n3. However, we consider that the content of this provision is important for the protection and promotion of investment. Therefore, we would like to propose the following text:\n\n\"In case an Investor other than natural person which has made Investment in a Contracting Party is controlled by Investors of another Contracting Party on the date on which the former Investor makes a request to the former Contracting Party to submit the dispute to the conciliation or arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article, the former Investor shall be treated for the purpose of the provisions of this Article as an Investor of another Contracting Party.\"\n\n*Comments:*\n\nAs recognized, the issue pertains only to the ICSID and Additional Facility (AF) rules. Articles 25(2) of ICSID and 1(6) of the AF rules are special cases and paragraph (7) is specific to those Articles only. Paragraph (7) does not differ in any substantive way from the wording of either Article 25(2) of ICSID or Article 1(6) of the AF. We do not believe that the proposed language is needed.\n\n273.\n\nThe Japanese Delegation was raising the question why Article 26(7) was confined to the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and proposing broader language. The Legal Sub-Group answered in no uncertain terms that Article 26(7) was \"specific to [Articles 25(2) of ICSID and 1(6) of the Additional Facility rules] only\" and rejected the Japanese proposal.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal does not view the reference to \"the issue\" and to \"special cases\" in the Legal Sub-Group\u2019s response to imply that the provision was meant to be \"inclusionary\". To the contrary, the *travaux* \"confirm the meaning resulting from the application of [A]rticle 31\" of the VCLT, namely, that Article 26(7) was meant to only address the ICSID context. To this effect, it would be sufficient to compare the language finally found in Article 26(7) (\"for the purpose of article 25(2)(b) [...] for the purpose of article 1(6)\") with the text of the *travaux* (\"paragraph (7) is specific to those Articles only\").308\n\nThe Tribunal has examined the other questions posed by the Japanese delegation *on different provisions of the ECT.* See Report of the Legal Sub-Group of the Energy Charter Conference, 2 May 1994 (**Exh. RLA-30**). See also C-Answer, paras. 411-413; Dissent, para. 9. The Tribunal majority has arrived at the conclusion that the meaning of Article 26(7) of the ECT is clear as interpreted under Article 31 of the VCLT and that the *travaux* relating to that specific ECT provision, with which it was presented, confirm such meaning. It is thus unable to see how it could reach a different interpretive result based on the *travaux* concerning *different Treaty provisions.* In any event, in the majority\u2019s view, such other preparatory works are, on their merits, incapable of proving that *Article 26(7)* was meant to be an inclusionary provision applicable beyond the arbitral rules referred to therein.\n\n275.\n\nIn any event, one should not lose sight of the fact that, even if Article 26(7) was only intended to accommodate the \"ICSID restrictions\", the general rule resulting from the combined reading of Articles 26(1) and 1(7) would remain unaffected. In other words, if Article 26(7) was lacking, foreign controlled, locally incorporated companies would *not* be able to bring claims against their home state under any of the arbitration systems, due to the diversity of nationality required in Article 26(1).\n\n276.\n\nIf the drafters had wished to provide that locally incorporated companies under foreign control be able to bring arbitration proceedings under any of the four arbitral *fora,* they could easily have done so. They have not and the Tribunal is faced with the clear wording of Articles 26(1) (requiring diversity of nationality), 1(7) (making incorporation the sole test for corporate nationality) and 26(7) (expressly limited to the ICSID context). The Tribunal is bound to interpret the Treaty terms as they are written, and not as they might have been written.\n\n277.\n\nBefore closing the analysis of this objection, the members of the Tribunal who form the majority stress that they have studied the Dissent carefully with all the respect and collegial feelings they have for Judge Brower. As a result, they wish to make the following observations in addition to the comments set out in footnote 307.\n\n278.\n\nWhile it does not discuss the ordinary meaning of the Treaty terms in their context, the Dissent invokes scholarly writings as part of \"supplementary means\" under Article 32 of the VCLT309 and claims that \"[t]here is unanimity among the experts closest to the ECT that the interpretation given to ECT Article 26(7) is untenable\".310 Yet, none of the writings referred to, save for one, contradicts the majority\u2019s interpretation of Article 26(7) of the ECT. These writings either do not deal with Article 26(7)311 or suggest or explicitly state that the possibility granted to locally incorporated companies pursuant to Article 26(7) only concerns the ICSID context.312 The Dissent further refers to scholarly opinions (amongst others by Thomas W\u00e4lde and Craig Bamberger) who emphasize that Article 26 of the ECT grants investors a \"choice\" among different dispute settlement mechanisms.313 As was noted above,314 Article 26(4) of the ECT does indeed grant a choice of *fora,* but only to \"Investors\" which qualify under the definition set out in Article 1(7) of the ECT. In the majority\u2019s view, this is not the case of foreign controlled Spanish companies resorting to arbitration other than under the ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules.\n\nSee Dissent, paras. 10-18.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 11.\n\nSee *e.g.* the two publications by Craig Bamberger (Dissent, paras. 17-18), which, in the Dissent\u2019s own words, \"include[] no commentary on paragraph (7) [of Article 26] specifically\".\n\nSee *e.g.* Emmanuel Gaillard in the excerpt quoted in the Dissent, para. 14 *(\u2018In the event that such entity decides to bring a claim under the Washington Convention [ICSID],* it needs [to] meet the requirement of Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention that it be considered as a national of another Contracting State. This situation is resolved under the ECT by Article 26(7), which provides that a legal entity that is incorporated in the host State will be treated as a national of another Contracting State *for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention* if it is controlled by investors of another Contracting State\", emphasis added) (Emmanuel Gaillard, \"Investments and Investors Covered by the Energy Charter Treaty\", in *Investment Arbitration and the Energy Charter Treaty* (Clarisse Ribeiro ed., 2006), pp. 54, 69). See *e.g.* further Kaj Hob\u00e9r (Dissent, para. 15), who states that the significance of Article 26(7) lies in the fact that a locally incorporated company under foreign control will be \"viewed as an investor of another contracting party for purposes of establishing \u2018diversity\u2019 jurisdiction *for an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Rules or the ICSID Additional Facility Rules\"* (emphasis added) (Kaj Hob\u00e9r, \"Investment Arbitration and the Energy Charter Treaty\", 1(l) *Journal of International Dispute Settlement* (2010), pp. 153, 164). See also Crina Baltag (Dissent, para. 15), who discusses Article 26(7) of the ECT solely in relation to the ICSID framework and adds that \"[a]s to the relevance of Article 26(7) of the ECT when Investors opt for arbitrations under the SCC or UNCITRAL Rules, this provision appears to be inapplicable\" (Crina Baltag, *The Energy Charter Treaty: The Notion of Investor* (Kluwer, 2012), p. 116, also pp. 108-115).\n\nSee Dissent, paras. 16-19.\n\nSee *supra*, paras. 263-267.\n\n279.\n\nThe one author in support of the Dissent,315 Adnan Amkhan, was not invoked by either Party and, more importantly, gives no reasons for his opinion other than \"indications in the negotiation history\", without providing a source. In any event, reliance on a scholarly opinion cannot lead the Tribunal to disregard the ordinary meaning of the Treaty terms in their context and in light of the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose.\n\nSee Dissent, paras. 12-13, discussing Adnan Amkhan, \"Consent to Submit Investment Disputes to Arbitration Under Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty\", 10 *International Arbitration Law Review* (2007), pp. 65, 70.\n\n280.\n\nLastly, the majority does not consider that its conclusions are \"in conflict with the interpretive process applied in relation to the \u2018Svalbard exception\u2019\".316 In connection with the intra-EU objection, the Tribunal noted that, in light of the Treaty\u2019s silence about an intra-EU exception, it would be \"irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty to read into it an implicit intra-EU disconnection clause\".317 The situation at issue here is, however, precisely the opposite, as the Tribunal is faced with an explicit provision which by its own terms is restricted to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism.\n\nDissent, para. 20. See also *ibid*., para. 7.\n\nSee *supra*, para. 183.\n\n**ii. The Claimants\u2019 reliance on the MFN clause**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nAs an alternative position on jurisdiction, the Claimants have invoked the MFN clause in the ECT to allow them to benefit from the Spain-Colombia BIT, and in particular from the second sentence of its Article 1(2), which reads as follows in its original Spanish version:\n\nLas inversiones realizadas en el territorio de una Parte Contratante por una sociedad de esa misma Parte Contratante que sea propiedad o est\u00e9 efectivamente controlada, de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de la Parte que recibe la inversi\u00f3n, por inversionistas de la otra Parte Contratante, se considerar\u00e1n igualmente inversiones realizadas por estos \u00faltimos inversionistas siempre que se hayan efectuado conforme a las disposiciones legales de la primera Parte Contratante.318\n\nAgreement for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments between Spain and Colombia, made in Bogota on 31 March 2005 (**Exh. CLA-135**).\n\n282.\n\nThe English translation provided by the Claimants reads as follows:\n\nInvestments made in the territory of one Contracting Party by any company of the same Contracting Party that is the property or effectively controlled, in accordance with the laws of the Party that receives the investment, by investors of the other Contracting Party, investment undertaken by these latter investors will also be considered provided that it has been made in accordance with the legal provisions of the first Contracting Party.319\n\nAgreement for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments between Spain and Colombia, made in Bogota on 31 March 2005 (**Exh. CLA-135** [English Translation]).\n\n283.\n\nFurther, the Claimants have invoked Article 10 of the Spain-Colombia BIT, which provides both UNCITRAL and ICSID arbitration as possible *fora* for the settlement of disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party. The Claimants argue that because Colombian-controlled Spanish entities would be able to bring claims under both UNCITRAL and ICSID arbitration under the Spain-Colombia BIT,320 the Claimants in this arbitration are entitled to be treated no less favorably than those Colombian-controlled Spanish entities.321 At the Hearing, the Claimants have taken the view that the Spain-Colombia BIT\n\nincludes a definition of \"protected investor\" which would cover entities incorporated in the contracting party state but controlled by nationals of the other contracting party.322\n\nSee R-Rejoinder, para. 126 (\"The Spain-Colombia BIT contains no restriction on foreign controlled, locally incorporated companies bringing claims under either the ICSID or UNCITRAL Rules\") and para. 127 (\"a locally incorporated entity, controlled by Colombian investors, would have an unrestricted choice to commence proceedings under either the ICSID Convention or the UNCITRAL Rules\"); Hearing Tr. [English version] (Gill), at 131: 2-12 (\"we have referred in our submissions to the Spain-Colombia BIT, *which includes a definition of \"protected investor\"* which would cover entities incorporated in the contracting party state but controlled by nationals of the other contracting party. We say *that the effect of this provision*, particularly when you combine it with the BIT's dispute resolution provisions, *permits claims under either UNCITRAL or ICSID arbitration by Colombian-controlled Spanish entities*\", emphasis added).\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Gill), at 131: 8-16.\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Gill), at 131: 3-7.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 1(2), last sentence, of the Spain-Colombia BIT is included in the provision dealing with the definition of \"investments\", although the provision then closely links the notions of \"investments\" and \"investors\". The purpose of this particular provision (on which the Parties have only provided brief comments) would seem to extend BIT protection to *\"investments\"* made by a locally incorporated company controlled by investors of the other BIT Contracting Party.\n\n285.\n\nEven if the Claimants\u2019 reading of Article 1(2) were correct, the Tribunal is unable to accept that the MFN clause in the ECT can be used to import provisions from a third treaty, here the Spain-Colombia BIT, to re-define the *ratione personae* requirements in the basic treaty, here the ECT. The MFN clause in Article 10(7) of the ECT reads as follows:\n\n(7) Each Contracting Party shall accord to Investments in its Area of Investors of other Contracting Parties, and their related activities including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal, treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to Investments of its own Investors or of the Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state and their related activities including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal, whichever is the most favourable.\n\n286.\n\nA plain reading of the text of this provision evinces that, under the ECT, MFN treatment is accorded to \"Investments... of Investors of other Contracting Parties\". Because the Spanish entities are not \"Investors of other Contracting Parties\" in respect to Spain (for the reasons explained above), they cannot benefit from the MFN treatment in the first place. In other words, the application of the MFN clause in the ECT is predicated upon a requirement of diversity of nationality (\"of *other* Contracting Parties\").323\n\nThe Claimants have also invoked Articles 10(2) and 10(3) in support of their MFN argument. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Article 10(2) is a best efforts clause (\"shall endeavour\"), which concerns the pre-establishment phase (\"as regards the Making of Investments\"), and is explicitly made subject to a future treaty in Article 10(4) of the ECT. In any event, the MFN treatment in that clause is also accorded to \"Investors of other Contracting Parties\", and is thus equally inapplicable to the Spanish entities for the same reasons as Article 10(7).\n\n287.\n\nThis conclusion is in line with arbitral jurisprudence, which has refused to extend the definition of \"investor\" or \"investment\" by means of the basic treaty's MFN clause. As stated in *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan,*\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal notes that, ordinarily, an MFN clause cannot be used to import a more favorable definition of investment contained in another BIT. The reason is that the defined terms \"investments\" and \"investors\" are used in the MFN clause itself, so that the treatment assured to investments and investors by Article 3 necessarily refers to investments and investors as defined in Article 1 of the BIT. In other words, one must fall within the scope of the treaty, which is in particular circumscribed by the definition of investment and investors, to be entitled to invoke the treaty protections, of which MFN treatment forms part. Or, in fewer words, one must be *under* the treaty to claim *through* the treaty.324\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 145 (emphasis in the original). See also *HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 23 May 2011, para. 149 (\"[The MFN clause] cannot legitimately be used to broaden the definition of the investors or the investments themselves\"); *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, SA v. Dominican Republic,* LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, paras. 40-41 (\"Each treaty defines what it considers a protected investment and who is entitled to that protection, and definitions can change from treaty to treaty. In this situation, resort to the specific text of the MFN Clause is unnecessary because it applies only to the treatment accorded to such defined investment, but not to the definition of \u2018investment\u2019 itself\u2019). See also *Berschader et al. v. Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. 080/2004, Award, 21 April 2006, para. 188; and, with regard to the definition of \"investment\", *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, para. 133.\n\n288.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Spanish Claimants cannot rely on the MFN clause in Article 10 of the ECT, in order to import a different definition of \"investor\" or \"investment\" from a third party treaty.\n\n289.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the following entities:\n\n\u2022 AES Solar Espa\u00f1a Finance S.L.;\n\n\u2022 AES Solar Espa\u00f1a I B.V. y CIA S.C.;\n\n\u2022 La Solana S.L. 1 to La Solana S.L. 60 (60 entities).\n\n**5. Sixth objection: Ceconat Germany has no standing to bring an ECT claim since it has triggered the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The positions of the Parties**\n-----------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nSpain finally argues that one of the Claimants, Ceconat Germany, has no standing to bring an ECT claim, because it has already pursued dispute resolution in the Spanish courts, thus triggering the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT.\n\n291.\n\nArticle 26 in relevant parts reads:\n\n(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the dispute;\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.\n\n(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n292.\n\nSpain is listed in Annex ID of the ECT and has thus opted into the fork-in-the-road provision of Article 26(3)(b)(i). It has provided the following statement pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT, which is contained in the so-called \"Transparency Document\" kept by the Energy Charter Secretariat (\"Spain's Transparency Document\"):\n\nEl consentimiento otorgado por Espa\u00f1a al sometimiento de la controversia a un procedimiento de arbitraje internacional se aplica con la condici\u00f3n de que el inversor renuncie a sus derechos a iniciar cualquier otro procedimiento de resoluci\u00f3n de diferencias en relaci\u00f3n con la misma disputa o controversia y desista de cualquier otro procedimiento iniciado antes de que el \u00f3rgano competente dicte sentencia.325\n\nSee Energy Charter Secretariat, Transparency Document. Policies, Practices and Conditions of Contracting Parties Listed in Annex ID, not Allowing an Investor to Resubmit the Same Dispute to International Arbitration at a Later Stage as Provided by Contracting Parties (in accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the Energy Charter Treaty), Section 23 \"Spain\" (**Exh. CLA-99**).\n\n293.\n\nSpain's Transparency Document is accompanied by an \"[u]nofficial translation provided by the Ministry\" into English, which reads:\n\nSpain gives its consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration if the following condition is satisfied:\n\nThe concerned investor renounces to submit the same dispute to any other procedure of dispute settlement, and withdraws from any other previous procedure, before the responsible Authority issues a decision.326\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n294.\n\nIn the English version of its Reply, the Respondent provided a free translation, which reads somewhat differently and which the Claimants accepted as \"more accurate\":327\n\nThe consent given by Spain to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration is applied with the condition that the investor waives its right to initiate any other dispute resolution procedure in relation to the same dispute and withdraws from any other procedure commenced prior to the issue of a judgment by the competent authority.328\n\nSee Hearing Tr. [English version] (Sullivan) at 183: 20-25 and 184: 1-4 (\"the ECT transparency document itself contains its own unofficial translation in addition to the Spanish original. The Respondent has included at paragraph 242 of its reply a different translation. I think we can all agree [...] that the Respondent\u2019s translation at 242 is more accurate. We accept that. Our point of view on that, though, is it makes no difference\").\n\nR-Reply, para. 242 (emphasis omitted).\n\n295.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Ceconat Germany triggered the fork-in-the-road clause when Roger Scherer, the owner of 50% of Ceconat Germany, and 34 Spanish SPVs which are indirectly owned and controlled by Ceconat Germany,329 filed a petition before the Supreme Court of Spain seeking the reinstatement of benefits abrogated by RD 1565/2010. The petition expressly referred to the ECT.330\n\nIn his witness statement (Claimants\u2019 Witness Statement (\"CWS\") No. 12), Roger Scherer alleges that the ownership structure of Ceconat Germany\u2019s investment in Spain is as follows:  \n a) Roger Scherer and Luis Delclaux each own 50% of Ceconat Germany (see CWS No. 12, para. 23);  \nb) Ceconat Germany owns 95%, and Roger Scherer and Luis Delclaux own 5%, of each of Ceconat Point S.L and Ceconat Gesti\u00f3n S.L. (together \"Ceconat Espa\u00f1a\") (see CWS No. 12, paras. 9, 26);  \nc) Ceconat Espa\u00f1a owns 34 Spanish SPVs (see CWS No. 12, para. 19);  \nd) Each SPV individually owns one independent PV installation in Spain (see CWS No. 12, para. 26). See also Jurisdictional Objections, para. 263.\n\nSee Petitum filed by Ceconat entities before the Spanish Supreme Court (\"Contentious-Administrative\" Chamber, 3rd Section), Petitum No. 19/2011, 29 September 2011 (**Exh. R-1**), pp. 18-20.\n\n296.\n\nFor the Respondent, although the proceedings in the Spanish courts were instituted by the 34 SPVs and Mr. Scherer, the latter acted in accordance with the primary and independent interests of Ceconat Germany, and thus all of the Ceconat Germany claimants have lost the right to pursue ECT arbitration.331 Because the object and purpose of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT is precisely to avoid the duplication of proceedings, Ceconat Germany cannot have \"two bites of the apple\".332\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 271.\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 275; R-Reply, paras. 262-265.\n\n297.\n\nBy contrast, it is the Claimants\u2019 contention that the fork-in-the-road clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT does not bar Ceconat Germany\u2019s treaty claims. The Claimants argue that Ceconat Germany did not bring any claims (let alone an ECT claim) in the Spanish courts, that the petition was withdrawn by the 34 SPVs, and that the present arbitration proceedings do not primarily relate to RD 1565/2010 (which was at issue in the Spanish proceedings) but rather to RDL 14/2010.\n\n298.\n\nThe Parties have further addressed the following issues when discussing why Ceconat Germany should or should not be precluded from pursuing these arbitration proceedings on the grounds of the fork-in-the-road clause.\n\n**i. The timing of the withdrawal of the Spanish courts claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nA first issue is the effect of the withdrawal of the claims filed in the Spanish Courts on the fork-in-the-road clause. Mr. Scherer and the 34 Ceconat SPVs filed their petition seeking the annulment of RD 1565/2010 before the Supreme Court of Spain on 14 January 2011.333 The PV Investors (including Ceconat Germany) commenced the present arbitration on 16 November 2011. The 34 Ceconat SPVs (but not Mr. Scherer) withdrew their claims in the Spanish Supreme Court on 19 December 2011.334 The Supreme Court confirmed the withdrawal on 24 January 2012335 and issued a decision on the merits in respect of Roger Scherer\u2019s claims on 18 July 2012.336\n\nAppeal filed on 14 January 2011 by Mr. Scherer and the Spanish petitioners before the Supreme Court of Spain, seeking the annulment of RD 1565/2010 of 19 November (**Exh. C-293**).\n\nC-Answer, para. 432; Decision of the Spanish Supreme Court (Administrative Division), Appeal No. 1/19/2011, 24 January 2012 (confirming the petitioners\u2019 withdrawal from the Supreme Court proceedings) (**Exh. C-295**).\n\nDecision of the Spanish Supreme Court (Administrative Division), Appeal No. 1/19/2011, 24 January 2012 (confirming the petitioners\u2019 withdrawal from the Supreme Court proceedings) (**Exh. C-295**).\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 134.\n\n300.\n\nFor the Claimants, the fork-in-the-road clause does not apply where previous attempts to resolve the dispute have been withdrawn, as is the case here. The Claimants refer to Spain\u2019s Transparency Document, according to which the fork-in-the-road provision does not apply when the previous dispute resolution procedure is withdrawn *before the responsible authority issues a decision.* As there is no doubt that the dispute has been withdrawn from the Spanish courts before the time specified in Spain\u2019s Transparency Document, the Spanish companies owned by Ceconat Germany complied with the condition upon which Spain's ECT consent is contingent.337\n\nC-Answer, paras. 432-438.\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimants agree with Spain that the fork-in-the-road seeks to avoid duplication of proceedings and recovery when the party starting the arbitration has previously brought the same dispute in the national courts or another forum. Yet, the Claimants submit that this is not the case here because the Spanish entities discontinued their petition on 19 December 2011 in relation to all PV installation to which the treaty claim refers.338\n\nC-Answer, para. 439.\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent has a different view on the timing element which underlies this objection. For Spain, the Spanish Supreme Court proceedings and the present arbitration proceedings remained open and ran in parallel for more than one month.339 Thus, with reference to Spain's Transparency Document which contains the condition to its consent and which makes reference to the withdrawal from local proceedings, Spain contends that the Ceconat SPVs withdrew from the local proceedings too late. Because a party must have withdrawn its judicial action as a condition precedent to the commencement of arbitration (i.e., by the date of the notice of arbitration), Spain's consent never became effective with regard to such claims.340 In this respect, Spain draws a parallel with *Waste Management v. Mexico,* where the tribunal analyzed the withdrawal of certain domestic litigations for the purpose of the waiver provision contained in Article 1121 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\").341\n\nR-Reply, para. 247.\n\nR-Reply, para. 252.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 244-246.\n\n303.\n\nIn addition, Spain contends, the withdrawal by the 34 Ceconat SPVs of their claim before the Spanish courts does not \"deactivate\" the fork-in-the-road clause because the claim before the Spanish Supreme Court continued with Roger Scherer who sought to obtain a declaration that would be binding on the parties and third parties (i.e., *erga omnes).* Spain notes that Roger Scherer did not withdraw his claim before the Spanish courts and continued the proceedings aimed at obtaining the annulment of various provisions of RD 1565/2010 (which was the same relief claimed by the Ceconat SPVs). The Supreme Court eventually dismissed the claim. Yet, if the annulment sought by Mr. Scherer had been granted, it would have had *erga omnes* and *ex tunc* effects, which would have directly benefited the Ceconat SPVs. According to Spain, the Ceconat SPVs' claims would thus have been upheld as well, although indirectly, despite their withdrawal from the proceedings.342\n\nR-Reply, paras. 254-262.\n\n304.\n\nWith regard to the continuation of the claim in respect of Mr. Scherer, the Claimants submit that the latter is not a party to these proceedings and his conduct should not deprive Ceconat of his rights under the ECT. Furthermore, the Spanish court proceedings continued by Mr. Scherer relate to his ownership of a private PV installation and not to Ceconat's installations.343 With regard to the *erga omnes* effect of a favorable court decision, the Claimants submit that it is obvious that any annulment proceeding that overturns a law unfavorable to a class of persons may benefit persons within that class who were not parties to the proceeding. Yet, this does not mean that these persons would be deprived of their rights under the ECT as a result of those proceedings.344\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 141.\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 142.\n\n**ii. The triple identity test**\n--------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe Parties agree that the so-called \"triple identity test\" must be met for the fork-in-the-road to apply. The dispute submitted in the local courts and in this arbitration must be the same by reference to (i) the parties, (ii) the dispute's \"object\" and (iii) its \"cause of action\". The Parties, however, disagree as to the precise content of the triple identity test.\n\n306.\n\nFor Spain, the triple identity test should not be applied in a strict and rigid manner, which would deprive the fork-in-the-road clause of any possible application. Such an application cannot have been the intention of the drafters of the ECT, nor would such an interpretation be in accordance with the international principles on treaty interpretation.345 More specifically, Spain has adopted the following position on the triple identity.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 318-329 (discussing esp. *Pantechniki S.A Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v. The Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009 (**Exh. RLA-112**)).\n\n307.\n\nFirst, with respect to the identity of the parties, the Ceconat SPVs, Ceconat Germany and Roger Scherer all belong to the same group of companies.346 In particular, the 34 Spanish SPVs that initiated proceedings before the Spanish courts are merely investment vehicles of Ceconat Germany, as Ceconat Germany holds a 95% indirect shareholding in the 34 Ceconat SPVs. Roger Scherer has a 50% shareholding in Ceconat Germany. Thus, it was Ceconat Germany which effectively litigated in the Spanish courts. One of the parties to the Spanish Supreme Court proceedings (the SPVs) withdrew from the proceedings while the other (Mr. Scherer) continued the action. Given the *erga omnes* effect of the judgment, both parties would have been bound by the judgment. As the judgment was ultimately not favorable to the plaintiffs, the latter sought a \"second bite of the apple\" at the international level. This, for Spain, is impermissible.347\n\nR-Reply, para. 271.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 270-272.\n\n308.\n\nSecond, it is Spain's submission that the \"object\" of the claims raised by Ceconat in the national and international proceedings is the same. Absolute identity is not necessary. What matters is that \"in essence\" the relief sought is the same.348 Spain argues that the first relief sought by the Claimants in these proceedings is a declaration that Spain has violated the ECT. Likewise, the relief sought by the Ceconat SPVs and Roger Scherer in the Spanish Supreme Court consisted of a finding that Spain was in breach of the ECT, as evidenced by a section of the claim submitted before the courts which deals with such alleged breaches.349 Furthermore, in the Spanish court proceedings the plaintiffs also sought to adduce evidence of the economic damages allegedly suffered. Thus, the relief sought in the two *fora* is in essence identical. Spain also points to the Claimants' request for relief in this arbitration seeking \"the reinstat[ement] [of] the legal framework in place at the time the Claimants made their investments in [Spain's] territory\".350 For the Respondent, such request is in essence the same as the one made before the Spanish Supreme Court, i.e., that RD 1565/2010 be declared null under Spanish law.\n\nR-Reply, para. 273.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 274-275.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 279-280.\n\n309.\n\nThird, with regard to the identity of cause of action, Spain first argues that in both proceedings the \"legal basis\" for the claim is the same, i.e., the ECT.351 Spain points to the Ceconat SPVs' and Roger Scherer's request in the Spanish Supreme Court, that a certain provision of RD 1565/2010 \"should be annulled as it is contrary to article 10.1 of the Energy Charter Treaty\".352 A further passage from the submissions explicitly refers to Article 26(2)(a) of the ECT (allowing resorting to domestic courts in case of disputes arising out of the ECT).353 The fact that the claim before the Spanish courts included causes of actions beyond the ECT is immaterial.354 In the alternative, Spain argues that even if the legal bases in the two *fora* were deemed different, the cause of action would nonetheless be the same, because it consists in Spain's enactment of RD 1565/2010.355\n\nR-Reply, paras. 283-296.\n\nR-Reply, para. 287.\n\nR-Reply, para. 288, referring to the Petitum filed by Ceconat entities before the Spanish Supreme Court (\"Contentious-Administrative\" Chamber, 3rd Section), Petitum No. 19/2011, 29 September 2011 (**Exh. R-1**), p. 20.\n\nR-Reply, para. 289.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 293-296, esp. 293 (\"Given that for the Claimants the claims regarding Spain's alleged breach of its own law and the claims regarding Spain's alleged breach of the ECT have their cause in the \"conduct\" of Spain (that is, RD 1565/2010) it is clear that the requisite of identity of cause of action is fulfilled in the present case. [...] Taking into account that \"the conduct of Spain\" consists of the passing of RD 1565/2010, the cause of action in the two proceedings is the same.\").\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimants have taken a different view on the fulfillment of the triple identity test. First, they underline that the parties in the Spanish court proceedings and in this arbitration are distinct. Ceconat Germany has filed no claim in the Spanish courts, and neither Mr. Scherer nor the 34 Ceconat SPVs are parties to this arbitration. For the Claimants, there is no support for Spain's argument that what matters is the \"real party in interest\". According to well-established arbitral jurisprudence, a parent company bringing investment treaty claims is not the same party as its subsidiary that started proceedings in national courts. The Claimants cite to *Genin v. Estonia, Lauder v. The Czech Republic* and *Azurix Corp. Argentina* in support of their contention that the action of a subsidiary or an affiliated entity cannot preclude a suit by a parent or a related claimant.356\n\nC-Answer, paras. 445-455; C-Rejoinder, paras. 144-146.\n\n311.\n\nSecond, with respect to the object, the Claimants submit that the condition is met when the claimant seeks the same relief in two *fora* in respect of the same \"investment dispute\". Two disputes are not considered identical merely because they arise from facts that affect both sets of claimants. There must be the \"same claim for relief\" in both settings. In this case, the relief sought before the Spanish courts was the \"annulment\" of RD 1565/2010 under Spanish law. This Tribunal, in contrast, does not have the authority to annul RD 1565/2010. In this arbitration, the Claimants seek restitution and compensation for Spain's alleged breach of international law. Thus, even if certain facts that gave rise to the present dispute were also before the Spanish courts, the investment dispute itself was not.357\n\nC-Answer, paras. 456-465; C-Rejoinder, paras. 147-149.\n\n312.\n\nThird, there is no identity of cause of action. The cause of action in the domestic court proceedings is the breach of Spanish law caused by RD 1565/2010, whereas Ceconat Germany's cause of action in this arbitration is the breach of international law. Further, the breaches of which Ceconat Germany complains here are substantively different from those in the Supreme Court proceedings, which were exclusively based on the Government\u2019s misapplication of Spanish law on the ground that RD 1565/2010 had not been passed in accordance with national law requirements. For the Claimants, the present treaty claims are not based exclusively, or even primarily, on the effects of RD 1565/2010. In the present context, \"the basis [...] is Spain\u2019s multiple attacks on the PV energy sector that frustrated the Claimants\u2019 reasonable and legitimate expectations\", which included *inter alia,* \"RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010\".358 The latter RDL was not at all at issue in the Supreme Court proceedings.359\n\nC-Answer, para. 471.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 466-471; C-Rejoinder, paras. 151-155.\n\n313.\n\nTherefore, according to the Claimants, even if the fork-in-the-road clause were to apply, it would not be triggered in this instance, because the triple identity test is not met.\n\n**iii. Use of the MFN clause to avoid the fork-in-the-road**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, in the event that the Tribunal were to consider that the fork-in-the-road clause applies with respect to Ceconat Germany, the MFN clause in Articles 10(2), 10(3) and 10(7) of the ECT would allow Ceconat Germany to circumvent the fork-in-the-road provision.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the majority of tribunals having considered MFN clauses have determined that they apply to dispute settlement. While the Claimants concede that arbitral practice in this respect is \"not entirely consistent\",360 they submit that the decisions opposed to the application of an MFN clause for the purpose of dispute settlement overwhelmingly deal with such clauses as a means to expand the jurisdiction of a tribunal. In this context, arbitral practice demonstrates \"a broad consensus\" accepting the application of an MFN clause to procedural obstacles in dispute settlement.361\n\nC-Answer, para. 480; R-Rejoinder, para. 159.\n\nC-Answer, para. 481.\n\n316.\n\nThe Claimants see the fork-in-the-road hurdle as a matter of admissibility rather than jurisdiction.362 Hence, the MFN clause at Articles 10(2), 10(3) and 10(7) of the ECT may operate within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as set by the ECT to modify the procedures applicable to seize the Tribunal.363 Consequently, through the MFN clause, the Claimants are entitled to invoke the BIT between Spain and Albania, which contains no fork-in-the-road clause and is thus more favorable than the ECT.364\n\nC-Answer, para. 483-484.\n\nC-Answer, para. 484.\n\nC-Answer, para. 479, referring to Art. 11 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Albania on the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments, 5 June 2003 (**Exh. CLA-1**).\n\n317.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that the MFN clause in the ECT cannot be used to circumvent the application of the fork-in-the-road clause. First, the MFN clause in the ECT refers to \"treatment\", a term which does not extend to dispute settlement. For Spain, it is clear that the intention of the contracting parties to the ECT was not to extend the MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions. Otherwise, they would have needed to include clear wording in this respect (as for example was done in the United Kingdom Model BIT).365 The Respondent asserts that state consent to submit a dispute to arbitration must be interpreted restrictively,366 and cites to *Plama* and *Wintershall v. Argentina* for the proposition that an MFN clause cannot be applied to jurisdiction.367\n\nR-Reply, para. 307.\n\nR-Reply, para. 302.\n\nR-Reply, paras. 304-306.\n\n318.\n\nSecond, according to Spain, the MFN clause cannot be used to \"pervert\" provisions of a treaty that have been carefully drafted by agreement of the parties. The ECT and the Spain-Albania BIT (the third-party treaty invoked by the Claimants) are fundamentally different in that the former precisely contains a fork-in-the-road clause and the latter does not.368 The fact that, in Spain's Transparency Document, the Respondent made an express statement with respect to the fork-in-the-road clause imposing a condition to its consent to arbitration should offer sufficient proof that such clause was carefully drafted and not meant to be circumvented by the MFN clause.369\n\nR-Reply, para. 312.\n\nR-Reply, para. 313.\n\n319.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that, because the Claimants have insisted on being treated as a collective for the purposes of these aggregate proceedings, the fact that Ceconat Germany falls foul of Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT must apply to all others. According to the Respondent, this would be an application of the \"much-cited maxim\" \"the benefit must be accompanied by the burden\".370 In its Reply, Spain stated that it \"did not allege that in the event the [fork-in-the-road] clause is deemed to have been triggered by Ceconat Germany that all of the other claimants be precluded from bringing the ECT claim\".371 Yet, in the same Reply it concluded that \"if the Claimants are indeed to be treated as a collective group as they so request, [...] such request should have consequences\".372 At the Hearing, the Respondent repeated that, if the fork-in-the-road clause were considered to apply in respect of Ceconat Germany, its effect should be extended to the other Claimants.373\n\nJurisdictional Objections, para. 276.\n\nR-Reply, para. 317.\n\nR-Reply, para. 317.\n\nHearing Tr. [Spanish version] (Soler Tappa), at 31: 21-14; 76: 1-2.\n\n320.\n\nFor the Claimants, the argument that the fork-in-the-road objection affects all the Claimants in the present arbitration is baseless and should consequently be dismissed.374\n\nC-Answer, paras. 472-475.\n\n**b. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n321.\n\nThis objection revolves around the interpretation of Article 26(3) of the ECT and of Spain's Transparency Document, i.e., the statement submitted by Spain pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(ii). The Tribunal will start by analyzing the relevant terms of the Treaty according to the rules of interpretation laid down by the VCLT to which it has already referred to several times in this Award.375\n\nSee *supra,* paras. 95-96, 252.\n\n322.\n\nArticle 26(3) of the ECT provides each Contracting Party's \"unconditional consent\" to the submission of disputes to international arbitration. Such unconditional consent is made \"subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c)\" of Article 26(3). For the purposes of this objection, it is relevant to set out subparagraph (b) in full:\n\n(i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).\n\n(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that Article 26(3)(b)(i) refers to \"the Investor\" in capitalized terms, which is consistent with the other paragraphs in Article 26 where the term is also used in capitalized terms. It is important to read Article 26(3)(b)(i) in the context of the whole of Article 26 and in particular of its first two paragraphs. Article 26(1)-(3) may be broken down as follows:\n\n\u2022 The fork-in-road clause of Article 26(3)(b)(i) is triggered \"where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b)\";\n\n\u2022 Subparagraph (2) of Article 26, in turn, offers a choice of *fora* to a qualifying investor. The text of this provision sets forth that *\"the Investor party to the dispute* may choose to submit\" the dispute to one of the dispute settlement options, including domestic courts (a) and any previously agreed dispute settlement procedure (b).\n\n\u2022 The dispute that \"the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit\" to either option is a dispute pursuant to Article 26(1) of the ECT, i.e., a dispute \"which concern[s] an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part III\" of the ECT.376\n\nThis is made clear by Article 26(2) which in its *incipit* speaks of \"such disputes\", thus referring to disputes under Article 26(1) of the ECT.\n\n324.\n\nFrom the combined reading of the first three paragraphs of Article 26 it is clear that for the fork-in-the-road clause in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT to apply:\n\n\u2022 The investor having previously submitted the dispute to domestic courts (or other previously agreed dispute settlement procedure) must be \"the Investor party to the dispute\";\n\n\u2022 The dispute brought to arbitration and to one of the two options under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b), must concern an alleged breach of Part III the ECT.\n\n325.\n\nAccordingly, the ordinary meaning of the provision mandates that the investor be the same in the two proceedings for the fork-in-the-road to apply. In other words, for purposes of the fork-in-the-road clause, the claimant in the arbitration must have previously submitted the dispute to a domestic court or a previously agreed dispute settlement procedure.377 The rule does not apply to non-parties to the arbitration. The fact that a non-party is a shareholder or a subsidiary of the investor does not change this conclusion.\n\nSee also Emmanuel Gaillard, \"How Does the So-Called \"Fork-In-The-Road\" Provision in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the Energy Charter Treaty work? Why Did the United States Decline to Sign the Energy Charter Treaty?\", in *Investment Protection and the Energy Charter Treaty* (G. Coop and C. Ribeiro, eds., 2008) p. 219, at 222-223 (noting that \"[the ECT's fork-in-the-road] has no effect on an arbitral claim, for instance, where the prior dispute was submitted by a locally incorporated subsidiary of the Investor, but not the Investor itself\u2019).\n\n326.\n\nThe fork-in-the-road clause of the ECT may be distinguished from \"waiver clauses\" in other treaties, such as NAFTA or the Central America Free Trade Agreement (\"CAFTA\"), which provide that a waiver to initiate or continue domestic proceedings must in certain circumstances be given by both the investor and the enterprise that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly.378\n\nSee Article 1121 of the NAFTA (\"1. A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if: [...] (b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116 [...]\"). See also Article 10(18)(2)(b)(ii) of the CAFTA. In light of the differences between the ECT fork-in-the-road and these so-called \"waiver clauses\", the Tribunal finds that the decision in *Waste Management,* invoked by the Respondent, which deals with NAFTA Article 1121, is not a helpful precedent for the present purposes.\n\n327.\n\nIn the present ECT proceedings, it is undisputed that neither Mr. Scherer nor the 34 SPVs are claimants in this arbitration and conversely that Ceconat Germany was not a petitioner before the Spanish courts. For this reason, the application of the fork-in-the-road in Article 26(3)(b) is not triggered. As a consequence, Spain's consent is not conditional and in no way limited by the domestic proceedings initiated by Mr. Schrerer and the 34 SPVs.\n\n328.\n\nThe conclusion just reached is confirmed if one analyzes Spain's Transparency Document, which purports to set out the \"policies, practices and conditions\" in respect of Spain's application of the fork-in-the-road clause.\n\n329.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Parties debated how Spain's Transparency Document should be characterized and what rules of interpretation should govern. According to the Claimants:\n\nOur view is that [Spain's Transparency Document] is part of the treaty. It was a requirement of the treaty, it was submitted with the instrument of ratification, and it is best considered in that respect. It could, of course, also be considered an unilateral act; I don't actually think, again, it makes much of a difference. The real point is it is binding upon Spain [...].379\n\nHearing Tr. [English version] (Sullivan) at 185: 14-20.\n\n330.\n\nIn contradistinction, the Respondent contends that Spain's Transparency Document should be interpreted as a unilateral declaration, which, it submits, would require the relevant words to be interpreted in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the state.380\n\nHearing Tr. [Spanish version] (Soler Tappa) at 75: 18-26 (referring to the Decisions on Jurisdiction in *Mobil v. Venezuela* and *Cemex v. Venezuela).*\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Spain that the statements made by the ECT Contracting Parties under Article 26(3)(b)(ii), including Spain's Transparency Document, must be deemed unilateral acts. The tribunal in *Tidewater v. Venezuela* differentiated between different types of unilateral declarations:\n\ndifferent kinds of unilateral acts have to be distinguished, i.e. purely unilateral acts, called in the work of the ILC unilateral acts *stricto sensu,* to which the [ILC] Guiding Principles [applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations] apply; unilateral acts which are a cause or a consequence of a treaty - like acts implicated in the formation or the execution of the treaty - to which apply the rules of interpretation of the VCLT; and finally unilateral acts which are adopted freely but in the framework of a treaty which recognizes this freedom of action, to which apply some specific rules [...].381\n\n*Tidewater Inc. et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013 *(\"Tidewater\"),* para. 92.\n\n332.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, statements made by ECT Contracting Parties under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) are unilateral acts of the third kind. That is to say, Spain\u2019s Transparency Document is a unilateral statement, which is formulated in the framework of a treaty by an organ of the state (here, the executive acting through the Ministry of Industry and Energy), and which, according to its interpretation, produces legal effects on the international plane *vis-\u00e0-vis* the other ECT Contracting Parties and their investors.\n\n333.\n\nThe rules of interpretation applicable to unilateral acts formulated in the framework of a treaty have been recalled by a number of investment tribunals, including the tribunals in *Mobil v. Venezuela, Cemex v. Venezuela, Tidewater* and *Pac Rim v. El Salvador382* Drawing largely from analogies with the ICJ\u2019s interpretation of unilateral declarations of states accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court under Article 36(2) of the ICJ Statute,383 these ICSID tribunals clarified that a unilateral declaration made in the framework of a treaty must be interpreted according to the following rules:\n\n\u2022 A unilateral declaration must be interpreted in good faith \"as it stands, having regard to the words actually used\";384\n\n\u2022 The relevant words must be interpreted \"in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned\";385\n\n\u2022 That intention can be deduced from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served;386\n\n\u2022 No rule of restrictive interpretation applies;387\n\n\u2022 The regime applying to these unilateral acts is \"not identical with that established for the interpretation of treaties by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\"; however, the rules of the VCLT may \"apply analogously to the extent compatible with the *sui generis* character\" of unilateral acts.388\n\nSee *Mobil Corporation et al. v.

In other words, it is the text of the statement that is the primary indicator of the state's intention. This is particularly so where the Tribunal has not been provided with any evidence of the state's \"intention\" other than the text of the statement, as in the present case.\n\nSee *Fisheries Jurisdiction*, p. 432, para. 46, cited in *Mobil*, para. 93; *Cemex*, para. 86.\n\n335.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal now turns to the wording of Spain's Transparency Document, which provides that Spain's consent pursuant to Article 26(3) of the ECT is subject to \"the condition that the investor [...] withdraws from any other procedure commenced prior to the issue of a judgment by the competent authority\".\n\n336.\n\nBecause the statement is made \"in application of\" (\"*en aplicaci\u00f3n del\")* Article 26(3)(b)(ii) (as the title of the statement indicates), the term \"investor\", even if not capitalized, must be understood to have the same meaning as elsewhere in Article 26.390 In this sense, the treaty is the \"context\" that must be taken into account when interpreting Spain's Transparency Document. Thus, for Spain's Transparency Document to be consistent with the Treaty in the framework of which it is formulated, it is \"the Investor party to the dispute\" who must withdraw from any other procedure. Because Ceconat Germany was not a party to the domestic dispute, Spain's Transparency Document does not come into play as a limitation to the Respondent's consent.\n\nIn perhaps even clearer terms, the \"unofficial translation\" of Spain's Transparency Document (on which see *supra,* para. 293) speaks of \"the concerned investor\".\n\n337.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the conditions for the application of the Treaty's fork-in-the-road clause and of Spain's Transparency Document have not been fulfilled, because the entity who has initiated the court proceedings is not the investor party to the present dispute.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that its analysis could end here. For the sake of completeness, it notes that to accept the identity of parties based on \"the real party in interest\" or like theories would be difficult to square with the plain meaning of the Treaty and of Spain's Transparency Document which the Tribunal is bound to apply. In particular, the Tribunal cannot follow the argument that Mr. Scherer and Ceconat Germany must be considered as one and the same investor pursuant to the Treaty and Spain's Transparency Document. 50% of the capital of Ceconat Germany is held by Mr. Scherer and the rest by Mr. Delclaux. The latter is neither a party to these proceedings nor a party to the domestic proceedings. If Mr. Scherer and Ceconat Germany were deemed to be one and the same investor, the rights of Mr. Delclaux as a shareholder of Ceconat Germany would be seriously curtailed as a result of Mr. Schrerer's conduct in the domestic proceedings. Thus, the fact that Mr. Scherer decided to continue the proceedings in his own name cannot have an impact on Ceconat Germany's jurisdictional fate in these arbitral proceedings.\n\n339.\n\nThe question is somewhat different for the 34 Spanish SPVs, which are situated below Ceconat Germany in the corporate chain and are indirectly controlled to 95% by the latter. However, even if, for the sake of argument, the Spanish SPVs and Ceconat Germany were considered to be the same investor under the Treaty and Spain's Transparency Document, the fork-in-the-road argument would still fail because the conditions to the Respondent's consent in Spain's Transparency Document are met. Indeed, the only temporal limitation imposed by Spain in its Transparency Document is that the investor withdraws from court proceedings \"prior to the issue of a judgment by the competent authority\" *(\"el inversor [...] desista de cualquier otro procedimiento iniciado antes de que el \u00f3rgano competente dicte sentencia\").* No other condition, such as for example that the withdrawal occur before the request for arbitration is filed, is set in Spain's Transparency Document.\n\n340.\n\nIn this case, it is undisputed that the 34 Spanish SPVs have withdrawn from the Spanish court proceedings before the Supreme Court issued its decision. Thus, even if Ceconat Germany and the 34 SPVs were to be considered one and the same \"Investor\" (which the Tribunal finds hard to reconcile with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty, as explained above), the condition to consent as expressed in Spain's Transparency Document would be fulfilled.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the foregoing conclusions strictly based on the text of the ECT's fork-in-the-road clause and of Spain's Transparency Document. It does not purport to make any findings on fork-in-the-road clauses in other investment treaties or on the so-called \"triple identity test\" generally. As a result of these conclusions, the Tribunal can dispense with entering into the Parties' further arguments, such as the alleged *erga omnes* effect of the domestic court proceedings or whether the fork-in-the-road clause extends to one or to all Claimants. There is also no need to analyze the Claimant's alternative argument based on the MFN clause.\n\n342.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that Ceconat Germany's claims are not precluded by Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT or by Spain's Transparency Document. The Tribunal thus rejects the Respondent's sixth jurisdictional objection.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants request that the costs they have incurred in this jurisdictional phase be borne by the Respondent. They point to the amendments made to the last version of the UNCITRAL Rules with the purpose of accommodating the apportionment of costs in decisions separate from the final award.391 For the Claimants, to the extent that the Tribunal decides that Spain's objections should be dismissed, the Claimants should be entitled to recover the costs that they incurred in order to address those objections pursuant to the \"loser pays\" principle enshrined in the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nC-Answer, paras. 487-492, referring to UNCITRAL Rules, Arts 40(1) and 42(2); C-Rejoinder, para. 164; Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, 21 February 2014 (\"Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs\"), paras. 4-11.\n\n344.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Spain should bear all costs because it has raised a number of jurisdictional objections that are unsupported by any relevant authority and have no merits, only in order to delay proceedings and substantially increase the Parties' costs.392 In particular, the Claimants refer to Spain's objection that they were not \"investors\" with \"investments\" under the ECT, which obliged them to file extensive additional evidence at substantial costs. In the Claimants' view, this was primarily a dilatory tactic, as is evidenced by the fact that Spain did not refer to such evidence393 and formally withdrew the objection at the Hearing.394 Furthermore, so the Claimants argue, \"certain of Spain's other Jurisdictional Objections are entirely without merit\".395 The Claimants take particular issue with the intra-EU objection, the *prima facie* objection, and the fork-in-the-road objection.396\n\nC-Rejoinder, para. 164.\n\nC-Rejoinder, paras. 167-168.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, paras. 13-28.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, para. 29.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, paras. 29-34.\n\n345.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants request \"that the Tribunal renders an award pursuant to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules: (i) ordering that Spain bear the costs of the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, as well as the PV Investors' costs for legal representation and assistance in the amount of \u00a31,552,129.23 [...]; and (ii) ordering Spain to pay interest thereon at such reasonable commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, compounded monthly\".397\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, para. 38. The Claimants have set out their costs in three schedules setting out the various categories of costs incurred from the date on which Spain raised the objections to jurisdiction (11 January 2013).\n\n**B. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the full costs and expenses of the proceedings should be awarded against the Claimants.398 More specifically, if the Tribunal declines jurisdiction, then it would be appropriate and indeed necessary for the Tribunal to award costs against the Claimants at this stage.399 However, if the Tribunal were to accept jurisdiction, then it should not rule on costs at this stage for a number of reasons. First, the decision as to whether the loser should pay is something that pertains more appropriately to the determination of the merits than the jurisdictional phase.400 Second, the Spanish State Legal Service has an obligation to exercise such actions as it considers necessary to protect the interests of the State, which includes raising jurisdictional objections.401 Third, the \"circumstances of the case\" to be taken into account in the allocation of costs pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules include the fact that it would be disproportionate and unreasonable that the Respondent bear the Claimants' costs for the jurisdictional phase in the event that the underlying claim is ultimately dismissed.402\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Costs Submission, 7 March 2014 (\"Respondent\u2019s Costs Submission\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 7.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 11.\n\n347.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' suggestion that by raising its jurisdictional objections Spain was seeking to delay the proceedings.403 With particular regard to the objection that the Claimants were not investors with qualifying investments under the ECT, the Respondent recalls that it is for a claimant to prove its case.404 Thus, to require the Claimants to produce documents that were vital to proving their investments was not intended to delay the proceedings, but rather a basic requirement for the proceedings to continue.405 Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 contention that certain jurisdictional objections were unfounded,406 and notes that in their costs submission the Claimants have been silent on the fifth jurisdictional objection (the one concerning the Spanish entities), which shows that this objection has merit.407\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, paras. 4-15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 34.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submissions, paras. 59-67 (discussing the intra-EU, the *prima facie,* and the fork-in-the-road objections).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, paras. 68-69.\n\n348.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent requests that all the costs of the jurisdictional phase, including all the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal and the PCA, and all the costs incurred by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office and legal counsel fees, equivalent to \u20ac1,260,660.81, be awarded against the Claimants.408\n\nRespondent\u2019s Costs Submission, para. 70, and Annex I.\n\n**C. The costs of the proceedings**\n-----------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nAt the beginning of the arbitration, the Parties paid a first advance of EUR 100,000 each, i.e., a total of EUR 200,000, in accordance with paragraph 7.1 of the Terms of Appointment. Subsequently, the Parties paid a second advance of EUR 200,000 each, i.e., a total of EUR 400,000. Thus, the total of the advance paid by the Parties amounts to EUR 600,000 (EUR 300,000 each).\n\n**1. Costs of the proceedings up to 11 January 2013**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nFrom the beginning of the case until 11 January 2013, i.e., the date on which the Respondent raised its Jurisdictional Objections, the members of the Tribunal collectively spent a total of 243.1 hours as follows: The Hon. Charles N. Brower, 55.8 hours; Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, 65 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 122.3 hours. It was agreed that the Tribunal\u2019s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 500 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n351.\n\nIn the same period of time, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 75.2 hours. It was agreed that the Secretary would be compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 280 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n352.\n\nThe total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT) amount to EUR 142,606.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Secretary incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 7,706.17.\n\n354.\n\nThe PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 1,820 for the administration of the case and its registry services. Other costs, in particular those relating to the first procedural hearing, amount to EUR 5,641.19.\n\n355.\n\nThe total costs of the proceedings up to 11 January 2013 are thus EUR 157,773.36.\n\n**2. Costs of the proceedings from 11 January 2013 until completion of the jurisdictional phase**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nFrom 11 January 2013 until the completion of the jurisdictional phase (the \"Jurisdictional Phase\"), the members of the Tribunal collectively spent a total of 613.6 hours as follows: The Hon. Charles N. Brower, 167.4 hours; Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, 103 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 343.2 hours.\n\n357.\n\nThe Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 277.8 hours.\n\n358.\n\nThe total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT) amount to EUR 384,584.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Secretary incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 4,034.69\n\n360.\n\nThe PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 18,180 for the administration of the case and its registry services.\n\n361.\n\nOther costs, relating in particular to the Hearing (including interpretation, court reporters, IT/AV support, catering, etc.), as well as to the translation of the Award, were incurred in the amount of EUR 35,353.53.\n\n362.\n\nThe total costs of the proceedings of the Jurisdictional Phase are thus EUR 442,152.22 detailed as follows:\n\nTribunal and Secretary fees EUR 384,584.00\n\nTribunal and Secretary expenses EUR 4,034.69\n\nAdministrative costs EUR 53,533.53\n\nTotal EUR 442,152.22\n\n**D. The allocation of costs**\n------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision. [...]\n\n364.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal deems it appropriate to proceed with the allocation of the costs relating to the Jurisdictional Phase in this Award, rather than in the final Award, a possibility that is indeed envisaged in Articles 40(1) and 42(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Because the proceedings will continue with a different number of Claimants, an apportionment of costs relating to the Jurisdictional Phase is preferable and, indeed, necessary at this stage.\n\n366.\n\nWith regard to the manner in which the costs relating to the Jurisdictional Phase should be allocated between the Parties, the Tribunal notes that while the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\"409 bear all of the arbitration costs, its second sentence grants the Arbitral Tribunal authority to apportion any such costs among the Parties if, in light of the \"circumstances of the case\", it decides that apportionment is \"reasonable\".\n\nSee the English version of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides: \"[t]he costs of the arbitration shall *in principle* be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties\" (emphasis added), while the Spanish version reads: \"[l]as costas del arbitraje ser\u00e1n a cargo de la parte vencida o las partes vencidas\", without including the equivalent of the words \"in principle\".\n\n367.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent initially presented six jurisdictional objections, one of which it then abandoned at the Hearing. Out of the five remaining jurisdictional objections, the Claimants were successful in four (the Aggregation Objection, the intra-EU objection, the *prima facie* objection, and the fork-in-the-road objection). Spain, in turn, prevailed with the objection concerning the Spanish entities.\n\n368.\n\nWhile the Claimants have succeeded in a higher number of objections than the Respondent, the Tribunal considers nonetheless that it is reasonable that the arbitration costs be divided equally between the Parties, and that each Party shall bear its own costs. The reason for this is that the four objections raised by Spain, while the Tribunal rejected them, were nonetheless serious. Furthermore, the objection on which Spain succeeded results in the Tribunal declining jurisdiction over more than two thirds of the Claimants (62 out of 88).\n\n369.\n\nWith regard to Spain's objection that the Claimants were not investors with qualifying investments under the ECT, the Tribunal does not consider that the withdrawal of such objection justifies reversing its conclusion that the arbitration costs should be equally borne by the Parties. The Tribunal recalls that it was the Claimants' burden to prove that they were investors with qualifying investments. The fact that they had to produce 6,000 documents to discharge that burden cannot be held against the Respondent. In addition, the fact that, after the production of the 6,000 documents, Spain decided to withdraw the objection may well suggest that those documents were necessary to the Claimants' fulfillment of the Treaty's jurisdictional requirements.\n\n370.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal thus believes that each Party should bear its own costs, and the Parties should share, in equal amounts, the costs of the proceedings (including the Tribunal and PCA costs) of the Jurisdictional Phase described in Section V.C.2. *supra.*\n\n371.\n\nIn light of its determination on allocation of costs, the Tribunal need not further specify which of the Claimants should bear which costs. As may be understood from Schedule 1 of the Claimants' Submission on Costs, the Claimants may have internal arrangements as to how these costs are divided. However, the Tribunal notes that the payment percentages set out in Schedule 1 only concern counsel fees.410 The advances paid by the Claimants to the PCA are set out in Schedule 2, which however does not specify the amount which each of the Claimants has contributed for such advances. In any event, as the Claimants have brought the case in aggregate form, and in light of its determination that each Party (i.e., the Claimants and the Respondent) bear their own costs, the Tribunal believes that it should leave it to the Claimants' internal arrangements to decide the extent to which each of them should bear their own counsel fees and their shares of the costs of the proceedings for the Jurisdictional Phase (described in Section V.C.2. *supra*).\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, Schedule 1 (\"Legal fees of Allen & Overy LLP\").\n\n372.\n\nWith respect to the costs of the first phase of the proceedings (up to 11 January 2013), described in Section V.C.1. *supra,* the Tribunal reserves the decision on such costs for subsequent decision.411\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have not submitted cost statements other than those in respect of the Jurisdictional Phase. With regard to the Tribunal and PCA costs relating to the first phase up to 11 January 2013, the Tribunal notes that - as far as the Claimants are concerned - some of the Claimants\u2019 costs may have been borne by the 62 entities on which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.  \nThe Tribunal however has no element to determine the extent of the contributions made by the 62 entities to such advances, if any. As already explained, because the Claimants have brought the case in aggregate form, it will be up to them to effect any internal allocation in respect of these costs, should such issue arise at all.\n\n373.\n\nThe total of the costs of the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretary and the PCA, counting both the first phase of the arbitration and the Jurisdictional Phase, being EUR 599,925.58 (EUR 157,773.36 plus EUR 442,152.22), and the advances deposited by the Parties being equal to EUR 600,000 in total, there is a total of EUR 74.42 remaining, which will be credited to the subsequent phase of the arbitration.412\n\nWith regard to the advances paid by the Claimants, part of these remaining advances credited to the subsequent phase may have been paid by the 62 entities on which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, and, if so, they should thus be returned to them. As already explained, because the Tribunal has no element to determine the internal allocation between the Claimants with regard to those advances and because the Claimants have brought the case in aggregate form, the Tribunal believes that it should leave such matter to the Claimants\u2019 internal allocation.\n\n**VI.

Brower\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI concur with my esteemed colleagues in finding that Respondent has breached the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\"). Where I part company with them, however, is on their acceptance of Claimants' Alternative Claim, based on an expected Reasonable Rate of Return (\"RRR\"), whereas I see no reason whatsoever to deprive Claimants of their Primary Claim, assessing their damages according to RD 661/2007, which every one of the eleven renewable energy awards against Spain issued by other arbitral tribunals to date, arising out of the same controversy and facts not credibly distinguishable from those of the present case, has done. The difference in the present case, as will be shown below, would appear to be possibly as high as approximately \u20ac540.9 million.\n\n2.\n\nI am of the view that no tribunal should accept an Alternative Claim over a Primary Claim without justifiable reasons for dismissing the Primary Claim, and in the present case I discern no justifiable reason whatsoever for departing from those eleven other tribunals' acceptance of the Primary Claim in like circumstances. In fact, the interpretation that my colleagues give to the language of the Old Regulatory Regime (\"ORR\"), allegedly providing such reasons, is inconsistent with the line of jurisprudence established by the tribunals that considered these very same issues before us. Unlike the position taken by my colleagues at paragraphs 638-639 of the Award, no other Tribunal has found that the RRR was \"*a key element of the regime established by RD 661/2007,*\" or that it served \"*as the limit of ECT-compliant regulatory changes,*\" let alone that \"*the Claimants are only entitled to compensation under Article 10(1) of the ECT if they establish that the new regime violates the guarantee of reasonable rate of return*.\" In this respect I recall well this statement in our Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, also cited at paragraph 521 of the Award:\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, *it believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases*. It further believes that, subject always to the specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law, with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law.1 (Emphasis added.)\n\nPreliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 53.\n\n3.\n\nOf the now eighteen known awards2 involving the same treaty, the same Respondent State, and the same measures as are at issue in the present arbitration, fifteen have found for the Claimants.3 In all but four of those fifteen cases (all four being factually distinguishable from the present one)4 the tribunals have ruled that Claimants were entitled to full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act represented by the displacement of the ORR by RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order (the \"New Regulatory Regime\" or \"NRR\"). Thus, all eleven tribunals have issued awards effectively granting the present Claimants' Primary Claim. The Award's rather cursory dismissal of those cases is factually misleading. In paragraph 554 of the Award, for example, after conceding in paragraph 553 that \"*[a] number of tribunals... have upheld claims that in substance were broadly similar to the Primary Claim in this arbitration*,\" the Award argues that \"[*i*]*n particular, in several cases* ..., *the tribunal appears to have been presented with no claim equivalent to the Alternative Claim,*\" citing *Novenergia* and other cases. As demonstrated below, however, and effectively conceded in that same paragraph 554 of the Award, in every single one of the eleven cases on which my analysis relies, the Alternative Claim was either (1) pleaded by the Claimants (in five cases), (2) pleaded by the Respondent as a defense (in four cases, including the cited *Novenergia*) or (3) placed before the tribunal by the Claimants' damages expert (in two cases). Thus, each of the eleven Tribunals involved confronted and rejected the Alternative Claim, irrespective of whether it was first asserted by the Claimants, by their experts, or by the Respondent. Despite my colleagues' valiant efforts, their stance is clearly incongruent with the statistics, as in seven out of the eleven cases in which the Primary Claim has prevailed, the Claimants had indeed put before the Tribunal an alternative calculation of damages based on an RRR, and in the remaining four the Respondent undeniably had pleaded the Alternative Claim as a defense. The Award's distinction in paragraph 554 among \"an *actual*\" Alternative Claim pled by Claimants themselves (group (1)), the Alternative Claim pled as \"merely a defense from the Respondent\" (group (2)) and one in the form of \"alternative damages calculations from the [Claimants'] experts\" (group (3)) is a classic \"distinction without a difference.\" The reality is that each and every one of the tribunals on whose awards I rely, and on which the Award should have relied in accordance with this Tribunal's views recorded in paragraph 2 above, confronted and dealt with the Alternative Claim. Moreover, it is with some consternation that I note my colleagues do not seem to have made up their mind as to whether the *PV Investors* case belongs to group (1) or (3), as at paragraph 665 of the Award \"[*f*]*inally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have formulated the relief sought not by reference to the Primary/Alternative Claim, but more generally for compensation as a result of Spain's alleged breaches*,\" before venturing to \"*understand[] that the request for restitution has been abandoned*,\" then deciding that its \"*understanding*\" is of no consequence whatsoever as \"*the Tribunal would in any event not grant such relief in light of its conclusion that the Primary Claim... is ill-founded*.\"\n\n*Charanne and Construction Investments v.

First, I address in paragraph 5., *infra*, the eleven awards that upheld the investors' entitlement to the projected returns on their investment on the basis of the regime in place at the time of the investment (Primary Claim), namely: (i) *Eiser*, (ii) *Novenergia*, (iii) *Masdar*, (iv) *Antin*, (v) *Greentech*, (vi) *SolES*, (vii) *9REN*, (viii) *Cube*, (ix) *OperaFund*, (x) *Infrared* and (xi) *Watkins*. Second, in paragraph 6., *infra*, I address the four cases that awarded damages on the basis of the RRR theory (Alternative Claim): (xii) *RREEF*, (xiii) *NextEra*, (xiv) *BayWa* and (xv) *RWE Innogy*. Third, in paragraph 7., *infra*, I discuss the three cases which dismissed the Claimants' claims entirely: (xvi) *Charanne*, (xvii) *Isolux* and (xviii) *Statdwerke*. Lastly, in paragraph 8., *infra*, I take stock of the awards, in light of the present case, and conclude that since like cases should be treated alike, the Claimants' Primary Claim rightly should prevail.\n\n5.\n\n**Cases in which the Primary Claim has prevailed** :\n\n(i) In *Eiser,* Claimants invested in three concentrated solar plants (\"CSP\") beginning in October 2007. All three plants were registered in the Administrative Register (\"RAIPRE\") on 8 June 2012. Claimants sought restitution of the legal and regulatory regime (RD 661/2007),5 or, should restitution not be possible, damages which, pursuant to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard,6 should be calculated on the basis of the reduction of the fair market value of their investment as measured by the (then) present value of past and future cash flows calculated on the basis of the feed-in-tariff (\"FiT\") to which they were entitled pursuant to RD 661/2007.7 Claimants also developed an Alternative Claim based on Respondent's theory of an RRR.8 The Tribunal, however, determined the RRR theory to be \"*unpersuasive\"* because *\"ECT Article 10(1) does not entitle Claimants to a 'reasonable return' at any given level, but to fair and equitable treatment.*\"9 While the *Eiser* Tribunal did state that \"[a]*bsent explicit undertakings directly extended to investors and guaranteeing that States will not change their laws or regulations, investment treaties do not eliminate States' right to modify their regulatory regimes to meet evolving circumstances and public needs*,\"10 it concluded that under the circumstances, not credibly distinguishable from those of *PV Investors*, the NRR \"*was profoundly unfair and inequitable as applied to Claimants' existing investment, stripping Claimants of virtually all of the value of their investment.*\"11 Accordingly, after rejecting the RRR Alternative Claim, the Tribunal \"*agree*[*d*] *that the Claimants' approach for determining its [sic] damages \u2013 assessing the reduction of the fair market value of its investment by calculating the present value of cash flows said to have been lost on account of the disputed measures \u2013 offers an appropriate means to determine the amount of reparation due in the circumstances of this case*,\"12 and then awarded damages accordingly.\n\n(ii) In *Novenergia,* Claimant pleaded a number of breaches of Article 10(1) ECT (FET and stable/equitable/favorable/transparent investment conditions), as well as Article 13 ECT (expropriation). On damages, Claimant submitted that the Kingdom of Spain must place the Claimant in the situation in which it would have been had the Respondent not breached its international obligations by abolishing the ORR, quantified as the difference between the fair market value of its investment immediately before the expropriation occurred, using the DCF method, and its fair market value once the NRR had destroyed the ORR.13 Claimant invested on 13 September 2007 and registered its PV plants with the RAIPRE by September 2008.14 This chronology describes also the *PV Investors*' Primary Claim. The Respondent contended that the language of RD 54/1997 provided that investors could only expect to receive an RRR (effectively identical to the Alternative Claim pleaded by *PV Investors* and others), and the Tribunal found that contention to be \"*unconvincing, since these principles were still generally vague and insufficiently defined at the time of the Claimant's investment*\" and thus \"*they cannot be considered apposite for the assessment of the reasonability of the Claimant's expectations at the time of the investment.*\"15 The Tribunal then clarified that neither the pre-2013 laws nor the Supreme Court decisions \"*could have given the Claimant the expectation that a reasonable rate of return would be limited to 7%*\"16 and ultimately concluded that:\n\n[\u2026] the Claimant has convincingly established that its initial expectations were legitimate since there was nothing to contradict the guaranteed FiT in RD 661/2007 and the surrounding statements made by the Kingdom of Spain in e.g. \"The Sun Can Be All Yours\". [\u2026]17\n\nAccordingly, *Novenergia* is thoroughly comparable to the present case, particularly as regards the timing and type of investment, the measures challenged, the treaty provisions invoked, and the Tribunal's rejection of the Respondent's defense identical to *PV Investors*' Alternative Claim.\n\n(iii) In *Masdar,* Claimant, citing Article 35 of the ILC Articles,18 requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to restore the RD 661/2007 regime19 or, in the alternative, award damages based on the FiT expected under that regime. Claimant also developed an Alternative Claim based on an RRR. The Tribunal noted that Article 10(1) of the ECT protected investors' legitimate expectations that *\"the legal framework will not be subject to modification in a manner contrary to specific commitments made to the investor.\"20* In particular, the Tribunal found that Spain gave investors \"*a very specific unilateral offer,* \"21 concretized vis-a-vis the RAIPRE registrations, that the qualifying installations would receive the RD 661/2007 FiT, as Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 constituted a stabilisation commitment.22 The implication in paragraph 554 of the present Award that the aforesaid result was due \"*to the investors* [*having*] *received specific individual confirmations from the State that their plants would receive the FiT payments across their life span*\" is inaccurate. As highlighted in two other recent awards, the letters obtained by the *Masdar* investors \"*simply confirmed what was already in RD 661/2007 and were issued **after** not before the claimant in that case made its investment,*\"23 and the *Masdar* Tribunal \"*expressly left open the possibility that Article 44(3)'s stabilization promise could constitute a 'specific commitment' by Spain*\", but \"*did not need to decide whether the legislative commitment alone could give rise to legitimate expectations, because there were other commitments*.\"24 In respect of the RRR theory the *Masdar* Tribunal (relying on *Eiser*) considered that Article 10(1) entitled investors not to a mere RRR, but instead to fair and equitable treatment.25 In this case the Claimants invested in three CSPs which began in May 2008 and for which RAIPRE registration was secured by December 2011.\n\n(iv) In *Antin,* Claimants sought restitution of the legal and regulatory regime under which they made their investments in two CSPs (RD 661/2007 as modified by RD 1614/2010 and RDL 14/2010 as the CSP thermosolar installations were acquired and developed in June 2011, with RAIPRE registration for both plants by 22 December 2009) or, in the alternative, damages for loss in the fair market value of their investments, comprised of lost historical and future cash flows.26 The Tribunal observed that Spain breached Claimants' legitimate expectations in light of the \"*precision and detail exhibited in the royal decrees, particularly the contemplation that treatment would be accorded for a defined period of time\".*27 With respect to the RRR theory (which formed both Claimant's Alternative Claim and one of Respondent's defenses) the Tribunal observed that:\n\n[\u2026] what Spain labels a \"reasonable rate of return\" seemingly depends on governmental discretion. This is in plain contrast with the relative precision of the Original Regime \u2014in force when the Claimants made their investment\u2014 which provided for objective and identifiable criteria for determining the remuneration due to CSP plants, which were expressly specified in the regulation and were dependent on the market.28\n\n(v) In *Greentech,* Claimants submitted that Respondent breached the ECT by modifying the FiT regime resulting from the RD 661/2007,29 or, in the alternative, by abrogating the ORR regime and thereby making a \"*fundamental change*\" in a manner that had not taken into account the circumstances of existing investments made in reliance on the prior regime.30 On quantum, Claimants sought damages for the diminution in the market value of their investments.31 In addition, their experts (FTI) placed before the Tribunal an alternative calculation of damages paralleling the Alternative Claim, i.e., based on an RRR.32 Consequently the *Greentech* Tribunal confronted four options for assessing damages:\n\na. as a projection of the FiTs that the plants would receive under the RD 661/2007 under Claimants' Expert's primary calculation;33\n\nb. as a projection of the FiTs that the plants would receive under the RD 661/2007 under Respondent's Expert's alternative calculation;34\n\nc. as an RRR under Respondent's Expert's primary calculation;35\n\nd. as an RRR under Claimants' Expert's alternative calculation.36\n\nThe Tribunal found only options a. and b. to be consistent with its finding on liability that the Respondent had abrogated the RD 661/2007 scheme when it introduced the NRR in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT, and, accordingly, dismissed c. and d., which had reflected Claimants' expert's as well as Respondent's calculations of an RRR Alternative Claim. Claimants, in this case, had invested in two PV plants and one PV project (comprised of 18 100-KW plants) during the period May 2009 through May 2010. The plants were registered with the RAIPRE, respectively, on 28 August 2008 (Madridejos),37 25 September 2008 (La Castilleja),38 and 20 May 2008 (Fotocampillos).39 The *Greentech* Tribunal found \"*that the Claimants had the legitimate expectation that the legal and regulatory framework would not be fundamentally and abruptly altered, thereby depriving investors of a significant part of their projected revenues,*\" while at the same time opining that \"*the Claimants did not have legitimate expectations that they would receive the precise FiT specified in RD 661/2007 for the entire lifetime of their PV plants*.\"40 Contrary to *9Ren* and *OperaFund* (as noted below), the Respondent's \"*specific clarification... that [Masdar's] facilities would receive the RD 661/2007 FiTs throughout their operating lives*,\"41 added to the *Greentech* Tribunal \"*not* [being] *persuaded*\" by the Claimants' view that \"*Article 44.3 RD 661/2007 is a specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate expectation that the Claimants would receive fixed FiTs for the lifetime of their PV plants.*\"42 The *Greentech* Tribunal then *\"[c]onclude[d] that the Respondent's enactment of the New Regulatory Regime constituted a fundamental change to the legal and regulatory framework that crossed the line from a non-compensatory regulatory measure to a compensable breach of the FET standard in the ECT*\"43 and awarded damages accordingly.\n\n(vi) In *SolEs,* Claimant asserted that it was entitled to damages based on the reduction in the value of net profit flows to equity investors that had resulted from Spain's implementation of the disputed measures,44 on the basis of the FiTs. As to Claimant's legitimate expectations, the Tribunal cited *Antin* to reconfirm that \"*an investor's legitimate expectations can also arise from provisions of law and regulations and from statements made by or on behalf of the State for the purpose of inducing investment by a class of investors*.\"45 The plants were registered with the RAIPRE, respectively, on 10 December 2009 (Badajoz I) and February 2010 (Badajoz II),46 and Claimant acquired control of them in March 2010. Given that the investment in Spain effectively was made in March 2010 (when Claimant acquired its interest in the plants), the Tribunal reasoned that \"*there were no developments between March 2010 and May 2010 that could have altered in a material way the legitimate expectations of a PV investor*\".47 Respondent asserted that the investor was entitled to an RRR only and that that was guaranteed by the new measures. Claimant developed its Alternative Claim on this theory. The Tribunal determined that it was not necessary to discuss the Alternative Claim in that it did not find that Article 10(1) of the ECT entitles Claimant to a particular return.48 Instead, the Tribunal accepted Claimants' proposal for damages based on a \"*but for*\" scenario with a 25-year duration of the feed-in tariffs set in 2010 under the Special Regime.49\n\n(vii) In *9Ren,* Claimants sought damages using two different models: (i) as diminution in the fair market value of their investments in the five *Solaica* plants (given they had been sold in June 2015); and (ii) as lost profits on their investments in the three *Espa\u00f1a* Plants on the revenues estimated on the basis of the applicable tariff rates under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.50 Claim (ii) is substantially similar to the *PV Investors*' Primary Claim. Regarding the RRR, the Tribunal concluded that Claimants reasonably relied on a legitimate expectation that the FiT benefits of RD 661/2007 would continue for the useful life of seven of its eight facilities,51 having registered seven of the eight facilities with the RAIPRE before 29 September 2008,52 and thus that Spain's decision to abolish the regime of RD 661/2007 was \"*inconsistent with the clear terms of RD 661/2007 that granted tariffs for the entire operating life of a facility*.\"53 Accordingly, the Tribunal ruled out Respondent's proposal for compensation based on an RRR54 and accepted Claimant's proposal for damages based on historical performance (under the RD 661/2007 regime).55 Claimant's date of investment, 23 April 2008, and its efforts to ensure that its projects complied with the FiT requirements (including timely registration under RAIPRE), were significant to the Tribunal in establishing that Claimant would receive the benefits set out in RD 661/2007.56\n\n(viii) In *Cube,* Claimants claimed for loss of expected cash flows, on the basis of RD 661/2007, to flow from fixed tariffs and market premiums. Claimants invested in the PV sector (three PV facilities) in April-June 2008 and in the hydroelectric sector (sixteen facilities) in 2011-2012. The Claimants' PV investments in the Puente G\u00e9nave, San Mart\u00edn de Pusa and \u00c9cija plants were duly registered under RD 661/2007 and the investment in the Rambla plant had been registered under RD 1578/2008.57 In respect of the commitment expressed by the Spanish Government to the FiT regime, the Tribunal considered that Claimants' expectations that the regime would not be altered were legitimate, since the Spanish regulatory regime clearly promised that the investments would be subject to certain regulatory principles that \"*as a matter of deliberate policy*\" were to be maintained in force for a finite length of time.58 Respondent submitted that Claimants were entitled to an RRR only. The Tribunal ruled that Respondent's assertions could not be substantiated, neither by the language of the ORR (including, e.g., the sole reference to \"*reasonable rate of profitability*\" in RD 661/2007 Article 44(3)) nor by the accompanying Press Release,59 because \"*[w]hatever the rationale behind the structure of tariffs and premiums set out in RD 661/2007, the clear representation was that the structure would be maintained in the terms set out in the Royal Decree*.\"60\n\n(ix) In *OperaFund,* Claimants, citing *Chroz\u00f3w Factory* and ILC Articles 31-38, pleaded that Respondent committed an internationally wrongful act, and that damages should put Claimants in the position in which they would have found themselves had Respondent not breached the ECT.61 The Tribunal, referencing *Novenergia* and *Masdar*, reasoned:\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, has no doubt that the stabilization assurance given in Article 44(3) is applicable for the investments by Claimants. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than the one mentioned in Article 44(3): \"*revisions [\u2026] shall not affect facilities for which the functioning certificate had been granted*.\"62\n\nClaimants invested in five PV installations between July 2008 and July 2009, but all of the Claimants' facilities were registered in RAIPRE by 29 September 2008. In reference to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,63 the Tribunal determined that \"*the RAIPRE registration is an important additional element in order to assess the legitimate expectations of the investors*\" and that \"*[s]uch a stabilization promise could be perfected by the registration of the RE plants to receive the preferential FiT under RD 661/2007*.\"64 The Tribunal concluded that \"*the formal registration led to the investors' entitlement to receive the benefits under RD 661/2007 (including not being subject to regulatory change)*.\"65 Respondent also submitted in this arbitration that Claimants were entitled to an RRR only and that these were already guaranteed by the Special Regime. Claimants then submitted an Alternative Claim pleading that the Special Regime did not guarantee an RRR. The Tribunal observed: \"*This alternative is not applicable as, above, the Tribunal has accepted Claimants' primary claims for breach of the FET standard and thereby of Article 10(1) of the ECT and thereby dismissed the alternative that Respondent only guaranteed a reasonable return. There is, thus, no need for the Tribunal to determine this alternative claim.*\"66\n\n(x) In *Infrared*, Claimants submitted that Spain violated their legitimate expectations that the ORR would remain stable (i.e., immutable) throughout the lifespan of the plants or, in the alternative, that Spain violated its FET obligations by abrogating essential elements of the ORR, or at least its transparency obligations.67 The Tribunal determined that Claimants had legitimate expectations that the plants registered on the RAIPRE would be shielded from subsequent regulatory changes68 in that they were assured that the regulated tariff and pool plus premium would have continued to apply for the operational lifespan of the plants registered on the RAIPRE.69 As in *Greentech*, Claimants' expert presented to the Tribunal an alternative calculation of damages based on an RRR,70 as to which the Tribunal observed:\n\n[\u2026] the pith of the breach here does not consist in a variation of the reasonable rate of return, but rather in the frustration of Claimants' legitimate expectation that the Mor\u00f3n and Olivenza plants would be shielded from revisions of the regulated tariff, the pool price premium and the applicable lower and upper values contained in RD 661/2007. A valuation that is premised principally on the \"*reasonable*\" rate of return without regard to the actual remuneration impaired by the Measures at Issue seems equally ill-adapted to the regulatory and legislative landscape in the present case [\u2026].71\n\nIn this case, Infrared invested in two CSP plants in July 2011, which were registered in the RAIPRE in May and December 2012.\n\n(xi) In *Watkins*, Claimants sought restitution and/or compensation for losses to its 2011 investment in the Spanish wind generation sector. The wind farms were duly registered with RAIPRE by 9 December 2010 and the Claimants were entitled to the RD 661/2007 economic regime.72 In determining that Spain radically altered the applicable legal and regulatory framework73 the Tribunal rejected Spain's contention that the investors were guaranteed only an RRR in preference to the view developed by *Eiser*, *Novenergia*, *Antin* and *Masdar* over *RREEF* (see xii, *infra*).74 The Tribunal specifically wrote:\n\nThe Claimants in this case have put forward extensive evidence of contemporaneous documents showing that Spain offered investors a fixed guaranteed return and not just a reasonable return. The Tribunal has considered the contemporaneous evidence and it is not persuaded that the evidence adduced by the Respondent is sufficient for determining a \"*reasonable return*\" and neither is it in fulfilment of the representations made by the Respondent with regard to the stability of the legal and economic regime that would be applicable to RE projects in order to entice investments into the wind sector. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent's methodology for determining reasonable rate of return in the light of the amendments to the legislation is, in the Tribunal's view, not based on any identifiable criteria. The Tribunal is therefore of the view that the *RREEF* Decision does not in any way, assist the Respondent in its primary contention that the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable return on their investments and that in the Tribunal's view, is a very narrow and erroneous interpretation of the *RREEF* Decision.75 (Emphasis in original.)\n\nWith the parties having pled extensively on the matter,76 the Tribunal wrote further:\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the arguments of the Claimants and the Respondent in respect of the *RREEF* Decision with regard to reasonable return and is of the view that the *RREEF* Decision does not, in any way, assist the Respondent in its contention that the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable return on their investments and the Tribunal is of the view that the argument advanced by Spain is a very narrow and erroneous interpretation of the *RREEF* Decision, especially with regard to the issue of reasonable return.77\n\nRespondent's Alternative Claim also was rejected as a matter of valuation based on the Tribunal's determination on the merits, which accepted the Claimants' Primary Claim that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation to obtain tariffs under RD 661/2007 and not to receive a return that was implicit in those tariffs.78 Regarding the standard of proof for calculating compensation, the Tribunal agreed with Claimants that \"[\u2026] *the standard is to show the existence of damage with reasonable certainty and then only offer a basis on which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the amount of their loss*\".79 Ultimately, the Tribunal adopted the DCF method proposed by Claimants, which calculated compensation as the difference between the returns in the actual scenario, and the returns under RD 661/2007 of 8% and 9% post-tax for each of the two investments.80\n\n*Eiser*, para. 425.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Claim for Indemnity), Jurisdiction, 26 July 1927, PCIJ Rep Series A, No. 9, p. 209.\n\n*Eiser*, para. 426.\n\nIbid., para. 433.\n\nIbid., para. 434.\n\nIbid., para. 362.\n\nIbid., para. 365.\n\nIbid., para. 441.\n\n*Novenergia*, paras. 767-768.\n\nIbid., para. 154.\n\nIbid., para. 673.\n\nIbid., para. 674 (Emphasis omitted).\n\nIbid., para. 681.\n\nILC Articles, Article 35: \"*A State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:*  \n*(a) is not materially impossible;*  \n(b) *does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation.*\"\n\n*Masdar*, para. 555.\n\nIbid., para. 484.\n\nIbid., para. 512.\n\nIbid., para. 500-503.\n\n*9Ren*, para. 299 (Emphasis in original).\n\n*OperaFund*, para. 483.\n\n*Masdar*, para. 591.\n\n*Antin*, para. 274.\n\nIbid., para. 552.\n\nIbid., para. 568.\n\n*Greentech*, para. 293.\n\nIbid., para. 297.\n\nIbid., para. 439.\n\nIbid., para. 392.\n\nIbid., para. 487.\n\nIbid., para. 501.\n\nIbid., para. 493.\n\nIbid., para. 495.\n\nIbid., para. 97.\n\nIbid., para. 102.\n\nIbid., para. 107.\n\nIbid., para. 365.\n\nIbid., para. 367\n\nIbid., para. 366, citing *Eiser*.\n\nIbid., para. 398.\n\n*SolEs*, para. 467.\n\nIbid., para. 313.\n\nIbid., para. 135.\n\nIbid., para. 418.\n\nIbid., para. 542.\n\nIbid., para. 544.\n\n*9REN*, para. 378.\n\nIbid., paras. 292-299.\n\nIbid., para. 98, stating that \"*Spain announced on 27 September 2007 that RD 661/2007 would close to new investments in PV projects one year later, i.e. new PV facilities would have to obtain final registration under RAIPRE before 29 September 2008 in order to be \"grandfathered\" under RD 661/2007.*\" (internal footnotes excluded);

As the applicable legal standard for compensation, a 2-1 majority concluded that the only legitimate expectation of the Claimants was to receive an RRR for their investment.81 In arriving at this decision, the Tribunal referred to Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997,82 the preamble of RD 661/2007,83 and the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy in Spain of 30 June 2010.84 Notably, in relation to the date of final registration with the RAIPRE,85 the *RREEF* investments were made on 28 December 2010 (wind farms), 2011 (Arenales CSP Plant) and 2012 (Andasol CSP Plant), hence well after the first regulatory shift from the ORR via the 2010 Decrees86 and months after the enactment of the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy in Spain of 30 June 2010. As the Tribunal clarified, Claimants' legitimate expectations must be judged by the regime in place at the time of the investment (relying on *Novenergia*).87 In his dissent, Robert Volterra described Spain's conduct as \"*bait and switch*,\"88 regarded Spain's admission that the switch was to reduce profit levels of the investors as fatal to its theory,89 and stressed that Spain had not proven its assertion that the regulatory restructuring to the subsidy system was made in response to the cost of money in the capital markets (as an objective and variable element to evaluate the concept of a reasonable return),90 thus leading him to opine that Spain \"*breached the ECT in multiple ways, not merely in relation to a 'reasonable rate of return,* '\"91 and to disagree with his fellow arbitrators regarding the scope of the Claimants' legitimate expectations.92 Whereas the *PV Investors* Claimants unquestionably invested under the ORR (final registration with RAIPRE before 29 September 2008), RREEF invested at a time when the regulatory changes of 2010 already had foreshadowed alteration of the FiT regime following the introduction of more exacting RRR language into the 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan.93 These factors distinguish *RREEF* from *PV Investors* and the eleven cases that have rejected the Alternative Claim.\n\n(ii) In *NextEra*, Claimants asserted, relying on *Chorzow Factory* and Art. 31 of the ILC Articles, that they were entitled to full reparation by means of restitution or full compensation.94 Claimants started investing in Spain as early as 2007 via a subsidiary of NextEra.95 Claimants' Primary Claim calculated compensation on the basis of the revenues expected pursuant to the pool plus premium option under Regulatory Framework I. Claimants also presented an Alternative Claim based on Respondent's defense of an RRR. As to the RRR the Tribunal observed that:\n\n[\u2026] the assurances made by the Spanish authorities were not about a reasonable return; they were about the regulatory certainty and stability that NextEra could expect. The denial of legitimate expectations is based on the failure to provide that certainty and security by changing fundamentally the regime under which remuneration was to be calculated.96\n\nIn addressing damages the Tribunal disregarded the DCF method proposed by the Claimants and instead calculated damages in a \"*but for*\" scenario based on the RD 661/2007 regime because Claimants' Termosol Plants had been in operation only since June 2013 (final registration with RAIPRE for No. 1 and 2 Termosol Plants occurred on 29 May 2013 and 7 June 2013, respectively), i.e., less than a year before the NRR entered into full force, thus making it difficult to calculate future profits based on such a short amount of time.97 Thus, as with *RREEF*, the circumstances of *PV Investors* and the eleven cases that rejected the Alternative Claim are easily distinguishable from *NextEra,* in that the *PV Investors* Claimants obtained their RAIPRE before 29 September 2008,98 hence well before the 2010-2013 changes to the Spanish energy regulatory regime.\n\n(iii) In *BayWa*, Claimants argued that they were entitled to full reparation for the harm suffered due to the disputed measures, with damages consisting of the difference in value of the Claimants' investment under the NRR and the ORR scenarios, assuming BayWa had a right to receive payments under RD 661/2007.99 Claimants also developed an Alternative Claim based on an RRR.100 The Tribunal, by a 2-1 majority, relying on *RREEF*, held that Claimants were entitled only to an RRR and found that Claimants were already achieving more than an RRR with their wind farms. The majority determined that Spain had breached the ECT because of the clawback provision contained in the NRR, and ordered the parties and their experts to identify the quantum. A significant factor distinguishing *BayWa* from the present case and the eleven cases that have rejected the Alternative Claim is how the investments were generated. The *BayWa* Claimants invested in two wind farm projects during the years 2003-2012 and 2009-2012, respectively, increasing their ownership significantly in 2011,101 which date (2011) Claimants fixed as the date as of which to judge their legitimate expectations (which evidently is a date much later than that of *PV Investors'* investments).102 It should be noted as well that BayWa's original investment was made in 1997, when expectations for the investment pre-dated, by many years, the ORR, a point considered by the *BayWa* majority.103 The source of expectations also differs. The *BayWa* Claimants invested in wind farms, and the *PV Investors* Claimants in photovoltaic plants. The *PV Investors* Claimants' expectations accordingly were informed by different State representations (e.g., the notorious presentation \"*The Sun Can Be Yours*\"), which did not factor into *Baywa* 's investment-backed expectations into wind. Thus, the *BayWa* majority's determination that the Claimants had no right to the continuation of the Special Regime is not analogous to the present case.\n\n(iv) In *RWE Innogy*, the Tribunal held that the enactment of the NRR breached Article 10(1) of the ECT twice in that: (i) its claw-back provision unduly required Claimants to pay back certain sums received between the adoption of RDL 9/2013 and Order IET 1025/2014 (the \"clawback\" provision), and (ii) it placed an excessive and disproportionate financial burden on certain of the Claimants' plants. Regarding the second breach, the Tribunal clarified, relying on *RREEF*, that Claimants were entitled only to an RRR of 7,398%, an assessment prompted by a number of factors that are not present as regards *PV Investors*. First, RWE started investing in Spain as early as 2001. Therefore, in a reasoning analogous to *BayWa*, the Tribunal held that at that time the investors could not rely on representations made by the Spanish Government in RD 436/2004 or RD 661/2007. In fact, RWE had invested under the legal framework of RD 2818/98, whose language, the Tribunal determined, could not have been intended as a statement that incentives would not be changed at some point in the future, and therefore could not reasonably have been relied upon as such.104 Concerning the second tranche of investments made in June 2008 with the acquisition of the *Urvasco* plants, Claimants were found not to have carried out due diligence on the regulatory risk appropriate to the size of their investment.105 With respect to investments made from 2010 onwards, the Tribunal considered that at that point in time the investors had been alerted to the prospect that changes were on the horizon.106 In the present case, however, it is undisputed that the *PV Investors* Claimants relied on the ORR in making their investments in Spain, having met the 29 September 2008 RAIPRE deadline. Second, the *RWE* investments were in hydro and wind, not in solar energy, hence, unlike the *PV Investors*, the *RWE* Claimants could not rely on the representations made by the Spanish Government in respect of the solar and photovoltaic sector. As a result of these factors, the Tribunal rejected *in toto* Claimants' case for a breach of legitimate expectations and resorted to the principle of proportionality to set compensation at an RRR.\n\n*RREEF*, para. 386.\n\nArticle 30(4) of Law 54/1997 provides:  \n4. The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations operating under the special regime shall be supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms set out in regulations [\u2026]  \n\"To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of economically justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets.\"\n\nRD 661/2007, Preamble, provides: \"the owners of facilities under the special regime a reasonable return on their investment.\"\n\nThe 2011-2020 *Renewable Energy Plan*, p. 112, provides: \"*premiums corresponding to special regime installations, provide for electricity generation remuneration levels that afford a reasonable return on investment*.\" and p. 115, \"Review of remuneration: [\u2026] [The] remuneration amounts [\u2026] may be modified on the basis of technological developments within the sectors market behavior, [\u2026], while always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return.\" See also *RREEF*, paras. 382-383.\n\nRecall registration with the RAIPRE ensured legal entitlement to receive all of RD 661/2007's economic incentives.

The Tribunal first acknowledged that \"*a State cannot induce an investor to make an investment, hereby generating legitimate expectations, to later ignore the commitments that had generated such expectations.*\"107 Ultimately, the Tribunal determined that \"*the Claimants could have easily foreseen possible adjustments to the regulatory framework as those introduced by the rules of 2010*.\"108 It must be stressed that the analysis in this case was truncated in that the measures taken from 2013 onwards were not considered. This decisional framework readily distinguishes *Charanne* from *PV Investors*.\n\n(ii) In *Isolux*, Claimant invested on 29 October 2012. The Tribunal noted that as of October 2012, the FiT regime was already the object of various studies that made its modification inevitable. In particular, the Tribunal recalled that in March 2012 the National Energy Commission issued a report indicating that the Special Regime was under review, recommending various changes to the regulatory regime. In September of the same year the Spanish Supreme Court stated that \"*[t]he reasonable remuneration for investments established by Law 54/1997 does not imply, we repeat, that the remuneration must necessarily be received through the regulated tariff.*\"109 Thus, the context of the Isolux investment was markedly different from that of the *PV Investors*, which had invested in Spain up to five years before Isolux.\n\n(iii) A 2-1 majority in *Stadtwerke* held that the Spanish measures were proportionate and reasonable and that Claimants could not have any expectation that the ORR would have been maintained as it was at the time they invested, relying substantially on Spanish law (which it determined to be relevant in the ECT context).110 Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r dissented, opining that the Claimants' reasonable expectations at the time of their investment included an expectation that there would not be any fundamental and radical changes to the RD 661/2007 regime111 (and that Spain's contention that Claimants were only entitled to an RRR was incorrect).112 Timing was a significant factor in this case. The majority evidently was influenced by the fact that while Claimants had invested in Spain in October 2009, their CSP plants were registered in the RAIPRE only in April 2012.113*PV Investors* is distinguishable in that all of their investments had been registered with RAIPRE by the 29 September 2008 deadline, thus justifying their legitimate expectations under the ORR.114\n\n*Charanne*, para. 486.\n\nIbid., para. 505.\n\n*Isolux*, para. 797 (unofficial English translation from Spanish original available at https://www.energycharter.org/fileadmin/DocumentsMedia/Disputes/Case-38-Isolux\\_v.\\_Spain\\_-\\_award\\_dis.\\_opinionEN.pdf, accessed on 7 February 2020).\n\nSee *Stadtwerke*, paras. 181, 308.\n\nIbid., *Dissenting Opinion of Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r*, para. 14.\n\nIbid., para. 15.\n\nIbid., Section VI(B)(2)(iii)(b)(ii)(e); see also para. 384.\n\nSee *supra* footnote 98.\n\n8.\n\nThe present award is based expressly on *jura novit arbiter*.115 Though we are not bound by the doctrine of *stare decisis*, I find compelling the jurisprudence formed by these other renewable energy cases involving Spain's history of regulating the field. Eleven of the eighteen Tribunals have granted the Primary Claim over the Alternative Claim, despite having the Alternative Claim presented to them, in circumstances that this Award itself describes as \"*broadly similar to the Primary Claim in this arbitration*,\" citing *Eiser*, *Masdar* and *Novenergia*.116 All eleven have concluded that Spain had guaranteed that the investors were entitled to the FiT in place at the time of the investment, i.e., the Primary Claim, and could not be limited to an RRR, i.e., the Alternative Claim.117\n\n*Award*, para. 519.\n\n*Award*, para. 553.\n\n*Eiser*, paras. 433-34, 441; *Novenergia*, paras.673-681, ; *Masdar*, paras. 533, 557; *Antin*, paras. 614, 690-91; *Greentech*, paras. 501, 530-535; *SolEs*, paras. 504, 526; *9REN*, paras. 401-412; *Cube*, paras. 296, 388; *OperaFund*, paras. 594, 604; *Infrared*, paras. 410, 451, 543; *Watkins*, para. 641. See also *NextEra*, paras. 616 and 647-50, where the *NextEra* tribunal accepted the Primary Claim but applied a reasonable rate of return to calculate damages because the NextEra plants had operated under the RD 661/2007 regime for only a few months. The Tribunal declared that it could not use the DCF method since Claimants could not prove what kind of cash flow they could have enjoyed in a \"*but for*\" scenario. Accordingly, the Tribunal had to use the method proposed by Claimants in their Alternative Claim, which was their expectation of a reasonable rate of return.\n\n9.\n\nAs discussed directly above, none of the three cases (*Charanne*, *Isolux* and *Stadtwerke*) in which Spain prevailed is in any way analogous to the present case, due to the markedly different timing of their investments and the consequent difference in those investors' legitimate expectations, considering the contemporaneous state of the Spanish regulatory framework. In *Charanne*, the tribunal did not consider the Spanish measures beyond 2010. In *Isolux*, the investment came at a time when changes to the regulatory regime were evident. In *Stadtwerke*, the RAIPRE registration, which Claimants advanced as concretizing their legitimate expectations, occurred only in 2012, whereas *PV Investors'* legitimate expectations were based on RD 661/2007 inasmuch as their RAIPRE registration had been made by 29 September 2008, following Spain's 27 September 2007 announcement that RD 661/2007 would close to new investments in PV projects one year later.\n\n10.\n\nThe Alternative Claim prevailed in four cases (*RREEF*, *NextEra*, *BayWa* and *RWE Innogy*), none of which is in any way analogous to the present case. The *NextEra* Tribunal only applied an RRR because the DCF method advanced with the Claimants' primary claim could not be applied owing to NextEra's late entry into the market. In *RWE Innogy*, the Tribunal's reliance on the principle of proportionality, resulting in an award of an RRR, is distinctly different from the present case, as each turns on legitimate expectations formed at the different times their respective investments were made. The same is true of *BayWa* and *RREEF.*\n\n11.\n\nThe type of investment also sets these four cases apart from the present case, although the Award makes no effort to reconcile this important reality with its novel, indeed unique, reading of the ORR. Investment type has been a significant factor in ascertaining the claimants' legitimate expectations, which has included review of different sets of regulations applicable to specific types of investments, as well as consideration of different representations and ancillary assurances that targeted specific types of investments. Accordingly, it is well documented in these renewable energy awards that PV facilities differ from CSP, wind and hydro facilities, each of which was governed by different regulations and was the object of different representations by the Government of Spain.118 None of the four awards granting the Alternative Claim involved PV installations.119 In fact, the tribunals in all cases involving PV installations invested under the ORR have granted the Primary Claim and rejected the Alternative Claim.120\n\nIn the words of one Spanish official, \"*the CSP and PV sectors were different since the former produces more electricity using less subsidies than the latter, which explained the retroactive changes affecting PV facilities*\". *Antin*, para. 127. It was also noted in *Antin* that in 2010 CSP plants generated 0.8% of the electricity and received 3% of Special Regime subsidies, whereas PV plants generated 7% of the electricity and received 37% of the Special Regime subsidies. (*Antin*, para. 132.) The *Charanne* Tribunal observed that RD 1578/2008, 1565/2010, and 14/2010 regulated exclusively the PV industry, whereas RD 1614 2010 regulated solar, thermal and wind technologies and not PV. (*Charanne*, para. 154-155.) The *Cube* Tribunal noted that the regulation of CSP also involves \"*different regulatory incidents*\" from PV. (*Cube*, para. 508.) Similarly, a number of presentations and ancillary documents contemporaneous to the implementation of the ORR addressed specifically PV investors, e.g., the *Renewable Energy Promotion Plan 2000 \u2013 2010* (\"PER 2000 \u2013 2010\") and the notorious presentation \"*The Sun can be Yours*.\"\n\n*RREEF* involved CSP and wind, *BayWa* involved wind, *RWE Innogy* involved hydro and wind and *NextEra* involved CSP plants.\n\nSee *Novenergia*, paras. 820-21; *Greentech*, paras. 485-86; *SolEs*, para. 526; *9Ren*, para. 407; *Cube*, para. 473; *OperaFund*, para. 604.\n\n12.\n\nThe most recent *Watkins* Tribunal also was critical of the *RREEF* award, particularly concerning that Tribunal's finding that Spain committed to provide an RRR to investors, which it described as \"*not supported by a number of awards which have found that Spain did promise investors that it would not alter retroactively the specific tariffs of RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010*\", instead concluding that \"*the persuasive views set out in the decisions of Eiser, Novenergia, Antin and Masdar*\" should be favored.121 Further, relying on Robert Volterra's dissent in *RREEF,* it criticized the conclusion of his co-arbitrators that an RRR was not fixed and could evolve depending on the cost of money in the capital market, for being \"*inconsistent with the evidence that was before the RREEF tribunal especially as the cost of money in the capital markets was substantially the same in 2007 when the RD 661/2007 regime was implemented and in 2013 when the new regime was implemented*.\"122\n\n*Watkins,* para. 500.\n\nIbid.*,* para. 502.\n\n13.\n\n*Errare humanum est, perseverare autem diabolicum*.\n\n14.\n\nClearly the timing of the respective investments has been a critical distinguishing factor in ascertaining the legitimate expectations of investors, hence further reason to view the present case in a far different light from the four cases that granted the Alternative Claim. The pre-RD 661/2007 investments of *RWE Innogy* and *BayWa* indisputably affected those Tribunals' assessment of the Claimants' legitimate expectations as not being fixed by the RD 661-2007 regime. Similarly, investments made once regulatory changes evidently were on the way, as the *BayWa* and *RREEF* Tribunals found, could not legitimately expect statutorily fixed returns. The *PV Investors*' Primary Claim, on the contrary, is not affected adversely by either the timing of their investments or their type. They invested between 2007 and 2009, but all their investments were registered with the RAIPRE before the 29 September 2008 deadline, guaranteeing each of their PV installations full economic benefits under RD 661/2007. Indeed, the timing of the RAIPRE registration has had a significant impact in a series of these Spanish RE cases. The *Antin*,123*Masdar*,124*Novenergia*,125 and *OperaFund*126 Tribunals all found that registration in RAIPRE was not simply an administrative requirement, but actually gave rise to the legitimate expectations of investors so registered. I refer to the *Novenergia* tribunal's finding on this point:\n\n665. The Tribunal considers that Law 54/1997 and RD 661/2007 were clearly enacted with the objective of ensuring that the Kingdom of Spain achieved its emissions and RE targets. In order to achieve that objective the Kingdom of Spain created a very favourable investment climate for RE investors, and the nucleus of such investment climate was the Special Regime. *The requirements placed on the PV plants to qualify for the Special Regime were limited to registration with the RAIPRE, a requirement which all of the PV Plants had met within the prescribed cut-off date*.\n\n666. In the Tribunal's view, a number of relevant statements or assurances were made by the Respondent with respect to the Special Regime, as initially introduced through Law 54/1997 and further developed by RD 661/2007 and legislation in between:\n\n(e) In Law 54/1997, it was stated that RE facilities admitted to the Special Regime would be authorized to incorporate \"all the energy produced by them into the system\" and would \"obtain reasonable rates of return\" as set by the government.\n\n(f) RD 436/2004 was enacted as expressly aiming at \"provid[ing] those who have decided or will decide in the near future to opt for the special regime with a durable, objective, and transparent framework\".\n\n(g) Under RD 436/2004, PV plants were entitled to incorporate into the grid all of the electric energy produced in exchange for a FIT or premium for the lifespan of the PV plants.\n\n(h) Under RD 661/2007, which replaced RD 436/2004, PV plants enrolled in the RAIPRE before the cut-off date would be entitled to\n\n(i) incorporate all of their net production into the grid; (ii) a FIT that would only be updated in accordance with the national CPI; and (iii) receive a fixed FIT for the lifespan of the PV plants.\n\n667. These were the legal sources in force in the Kingdom of Spain when the Claimant made its investment and the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that *the above statements and assurances were indeed aimed at incentivising companies to invest heavily in the Spanish electricity sector and that the Claimant made its investment in reliance of the terms provided in RD 661/2007. The commitment from the Kingdom of Spain could not have been clearer.* A considerable number of RE companies also invested in reliance on these statements and assurances.127 (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)\n\n*Antin*, para. 552.\n\n*Masdar*, paras. 512-520.\n\n*Novenergia*, paras. 665-667.\n\n*OperaFund*, para. 483.\n\n*Novenergia*, paras. 665-667.\n\n15.\n\nSimilarly, the *OperaFund* Tribunal, referring to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,128 explained:\n\nIn view of this provision, for the present case, the RAIPRE registration is an important additional element in order to assess the legitimate expectations of the investors....\n\nClaimants' investments were made between July 2008 and July 2009, in reliance upon the fact that the PV plants were finally registered in the RAIPRE under RD 661/2007 and granted the RD 661/2007 FIT economic rights. Thus, *the formal registration led to the investors' entitlement to receive the benefits under RD 661/2007 (including not being subject to regulatory change).*\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, has no doubt that the stabilization assurance given in Article 44(3) is applicable for the investments by Claimants. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than the one mentioned in Article 44(3): \"revisions [\u2026] shall not affect facilities for which the functioning certificate had been granted.\" As put by the *Novenergia* tribunal, \"RD 661/2007 was so adamantly clear that its understanding by common readers did not require a particularly sophisticated analysis.\"129 (Citations omitted.) (Emphasis added.)\n\nArticle 44(3) of RD 661/2007 provides: \"The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January 1 of the second year following the year in which the revision had been performed.\"\n\n*OperaFund*, paras. 483-485.\n\n16.\n\nI accordingly see no reason to depart from such sound reasoning, repeatedly applied without exception by eleven predecessor tribunals confronting the same problem, as my esteemed colleagues have done. Against such a record it is intellectually disingenuous to say, as the Award does in paragraph 555, that \"[*i*]*t is not entirely unsurprising, and indeed to some extent to be expected in a system based on ad hoc adjudication, that arbitral tribunals may assess relevant circumstances in different ways*.\" One would not expect a tribunal that declaredly130 operates on the principle of \"*jura novit arbiter*\" to diverge from, indeed utterly reject, eleven predecessor tribunals' unanimous awards that addressed the same issue. Focusing even more narrowly on the sub-category of those eleven cases to which the present case belongs, in every one of the four of them that, like the *PV Investors*, specifically involved PV installations and timely RAIPRE registration (i.e., before 29 September 2008), the Primary Claim has prevailed over the Alternative Claim.131 In other words, *PV Investors, Novenergia*, *Cube*, *9Ren*, and *OperaFund* all have involved the same technology, close timing of investments, the same incentives, the same compliance with RAIPRE registration deadline, the same assurances, the same regulations, the same investment treaty, the same host State, and the same measures in dispute. Logic dictates that the *PV Investors* would harbor the same expectations and that this sub-category of the eleven cases be followed absent compelling contrary reasons. The present Award, regrettably, states no such compelling reason.\n\nAward, para. 519.\n\nSee *Novenergia*, paras. 820-21; *9Ren*, para. 407; *Cube*, para. 473; *OperaFund,* para. 604.\n\n17.\n\nAlthough the Primary Claim itself has not been quantified in these proceedings, due to the Tribunal's extended excursion into and concentration on the Alternative Claim, I am of the opinion that a proxy offered by the Claimants may be used at least to approximate the Primary Claim damages of which this Award deprives the *PV Investors.*132 The *Novenergia* Tribunal awarded damages on a \u20ac/MW of PV capacity basis. The damages awarded in *Novenergia* were \u20ac53.3 million (excluding interest) and corresponded to an installed capacity of 18.8 MW.133 This leads to \u20ac2.84 million in damages for each MW of capacity. If one assumes that *PV Investors* have 222.4 MW of capacity, and that each MW is valued at \u20ac2.84 million, Claimants would receive approximately \u20ac632 million in damages instead of \u20ac91.1 million, a difference of \u20ac540.9 million from the sum provided under the Alternative Claim in this Award, representing a mere recovery of less than seven percent of what Claimants' legitimate expectations should have generated in damages.\n\n*Claimants' Second PO 12 Post-Hearing Brief dated 29 November 2018,* paras. 10-11, n. 31.\n\n*Novenergia,* para. 483."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5 Member States Declaration | Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, of 16 January 2019, on the enforcement of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union signed by the Representatives of the Governments of Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden |\n| 22 Member States Declaration | Declaration of the Representatives of Governments of the Member States, of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union signed by the Representatives of the Governments of, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and United Kingdom of great Britain and Northern Ireland |\n| 1997 Electricity Law | Law 54/1997 on the Electricity Sector (published on 28 November 1997) |\n| 2001 Renewable Energy Directive | EU Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market |\n| 2008 Guidelines | European Commission, Community Guidelines for State Aid for Environment Protection, Number 2008/C82/0171 |\n| 2008 Presentation | The 2008 InvestInSpain presentation entitled \"Opportunities in Renewable Energy in Spain\" |\n| 2009 Presentation | The 2009 InvestInSpain presentation entitled \"Legal Framework for Renewable Energies in Spain\" |\n| 2009 Renewable Energy Directive | EU Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion and use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directive 2001/77 EC and 2003/30 EC |\n| 2010 Measures | RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 collectively |\n| 2014 Guidelines | European Commission, Community Guidelines for State Aid for Environment Protection, Number 2014/C200/0170 |\n| *Antin* | *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a\u00e0 r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.

Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe procedural history of the first phase of the arbitration until 13 October 2014 is recounted at section II of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n9.\n\nOn 14 October 2014, the Tribunal dispatched to the Parties English and Spanish versions of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and of the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of The Honorable Charles N. Brower dated 10 October 2014 (the \"Dissenting Opinion\"). The Tribunal also invited the Parties to confer and submit their proposals for the procedural calendar for the next phase of the arbitration.\n\n10.\n\nOn 24 October 2014, pursuant to paragraph 8.1 of the Procedural Rules dated 20 July 2012 (the \"Procedural Rules\"), the Parties provided the Tribunal with their positions on the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n**B. Amendments to the SoC, Procedural Calendar, Intervention by the European Commission, Publication of Awards and other related matters**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 and 4 November 2014, the Claimants and the Respondent informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to agree on the procedural calendar. The main reason for disagreement related to the Claimants\u2019 intention to amend their Statement of Claim of 28 September 2012 (the \"SoC\") \"to address the new harmful measures implemented by Spain subsequent to the filing of the original Statement of Claim in September 2012\",5 to which the Respondent \"strongly object[ed]\".6 The Parties also addressed this issue in their further submissions of 12 November, 19 November, 25 November, 28 November and 2 December 2014.7\n\nEmail from the Claimants, 3 November 2014.\n\nEmail from the Respondent, 4 November 2014.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 8, 5 January 2015, paras. 2-16 (summarizing the Parties' positions).\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 November 2014, the European Commission (the \"Commission\") filed an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party with the PCA. The Commission\u2019s request for permission to intervene was \"limited to the question of jurisdiction\".8 The Commission \"invite[d] the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction\" because of the intra-EU nature of the dispute.9 The Commission maintained that the ECT did not create obligations among EU Member States *inter se,* \"but only between the Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and each of the other contracting Parties, on the other hand [...]\".10 If the Tribunal nevertheless decided to exercise jurisdiction, the Commission reserved its right to request leave to also intervene on issues of substance.11\n\nApplication from the European Commission for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, 12 November 2014, para. 8.\n\nApplication from the European Commission for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, 12 November 2014, paras. 8-9.\n\nApplication from the European Commission for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, 12 November 2014, para. 9.\n\nApplication from the European Commission for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, 12 November 2014, para. 10.\n\n13.\n\nOn 18 November 2014, the Tribunal invited the Parties\u2019 comments on the Commission\u2019s application and asked the Parties whether they had an objection to the Tribunal providing the Commission with a copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn 5 December 2014, the Parties submitted their comments. The Claimants argued that there was no basis for the Commission to intervene in the proceedings nor was \"the intended scope of the intervention relevant to the dispute\".12 The Claimants also did not object to the Tribunal providing the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the Commission.13 The Respondent indicated that it had no objection to the Tribunal providing the Commission with a copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction (subject to certain confidentiality undertakings), or to the Commission intervening in the proceedings. However, the Respondent suggested that it may be appropriate to determine the question of the Commission\u2019s intervention after the Tribunal\u2019s determination regarding the amendment of the SoC.\n\nSee Letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 5 December 2014, p. 1.\n\nLetter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 5 December 2014, p. 6.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 January 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (\"PO8\"), in which the Claimants were granted leave to file an amended SoC. A procedural calendar for the next phase of the arbitration was circulated with PO8.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of 9 January 2015 to the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on the Commission\u2019s application. It held that it had already affirmed its jurisdiction in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.14 Under the Swiss *lex arbitri,* an award on jurisdiction did bind the Tribunal, which thus had no power to re-open a matter already decided. As the Commission\u2019s application was limited to jurisdictional issues linked to the intra-EU nature of the dispute, the Tribunal could not accept the Commission's application.\n\nExcept in respect of the Spanish incorporated entities (Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 9 January 2015, p. 2).\n\n17.\n\nBy the same letter, the Tribunal also drew the Parties\u2019 attention to the latest developments concerning transparency in investment treaty arbitration and inquired whether the Parties would consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion.15\n\nLetter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 9 January 2015, pp. 3-4.\n\n18.\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the Claimants confirmed their consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, as well as awards to be issued in these proceedings, subject to redactions to protect the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information. On the same day, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, and on 28 January 2015, suggested that the Parties and the Tribunal hold a telephone conference on this issue.16\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 28 January 2015, pp. 7-8.\n\n19.\n\nIn a second letter of the same day, Spain alleged that the Claimants had breached Article 8 of the Procedural Rules, in particular by disclosing the content of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction. According to the Respondent, on 24 December 2014, IAReporter had disclosed the outcome of the jurisdictional phase. It was the Respondent\u2019s \"foregone conclusion that the Claimants directly or indirectly disclosed either the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction or the outcome resulting from such Preliminary Award to either Mr Peterson [of IAReporter] or some third party that is not a party to these confidential proceedings\".17 The Respondent requested the Tribunal to enforce Article 8 of the Procedural Rules by ordering such sanctions as it deemed appropriate. On 28 January and 4 February 2015, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Claimants provided their comments, denying the Respondent\u2019s allegations, and the Respondent provided its responses to the Claimants\u2019 comments.\n\nSee Second Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 16 January 2015, para. 5.\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, the Claimants filed their amended SoC (the \"ASoC\") along with supporting witness statements, exhibits, legal authorities and the Second Expert Report of the Brattle Group (\"Brattle\u2019s Second Expert Report\").18\n\nThe Claimants filed a corrected version of the Brattle's Second Expert Report on 16 February 2015.\n\n21.\n\nOn 13 February 2015, the Claimants submitted the Spanish language translation of the ASoC.\n\n22.\n\nAlso on 13 February 2015, the President of the Tribunal made a disclosure, to which neither of the Parties objected.\n\n23.\n\nOn 16 February 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was available for a telephone conference as proposed by the Respondent in relation to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and asked them for their availability. On 6 March 2015, after further correspondence between the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed that the telephone conference would take place on 9 March 2015 at 16:00 (CET).\n\n24.\n\nConsequently, on 9 March 2015 at 16:00 (CET), the Parties and the Tribunal held a telephone conference to discuss the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 March 2015, the Respondent submitted additional comments on the matters discussed at the conference call. Amongst other things, the Respondent confirmed that: no matter what the outcome of the liability phase (i.e., whether [the Tribunal] finds Spain liable or not), and notwi[th]standing the fact that it is not what arises from the Procedural Rules, Spain would consent to the publication of the award on liability, even in the hypothetical case that such award could not be \"the final\" award. Furthermore, as anticipated during the procedural call Spain would also consent to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction at such point in time (i.e., when the Tribunal renders the award on liability)- which as it was explained during the procedural call, it was assumed the Tribunal would do in any event.19\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 11 March 2015, p. 3.\n\n26.\n\nIn letter of 26 March 2015, the Tribunal responded to the Commission\u2019s application of 12 November 2014. It conveyed to the Commission that it had no power to reopen jurisdictional objections that it had already decided.20 The Tribunal observed, however, that the Commission had \"reserved the right to request leave to intervene also on points of substance\".21 The Tribunal informed the Commission, *inter alia,* that it would consider any such application and requested that the same be filed by 20 May 2015. Further, as neither Party had raised an objection, the Tribunal provided the Commission with a copy of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion.22\n\nSee *supra* para. 16.\n\nSee Application from the European Commission for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, 12 November 2014, para. 10.\n\nLetter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 26 March 2015, pp. 2-3.\n\n27.\n\nAlso on 26 March 2015, the Tribunal sent a copy of the letter to the Commission just referred to and addressed the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.23 Having considered the Parties\u2019 positions, it decided that the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction would be published at the time of the issuance of the final award. Furthermore, it found that the Respondent had failed to establish the Claimants\u2019 alleged breaches of the applicable confidentiality regime.24\n\nAs raised in the telephone conference held on 9 March 2015 (see *supra* para. 24) and subsequent correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal (see *supra* paras.16-19, 25).\n\nSee *supra* para. 19.\n\n28.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, following the Parties\u2019 joint request for a revision of the procedural timetable, the Tribunal circulated a revised procedural calendar.\n\n29.\n\nOn 20 May 2015, the Commission informed the Tribunal that it would not present an application to intervene on the merits because Spain had officially notified the Disputed Measures (in accordance with the requirements of EC law) as a result of which the Commission was now obliged to take a decision on Spain\u2019s notification of the Disputed Measures.25 The Commission invited the Tribunal to suspend the arbitration until it had rendered its decision.26\n\nLetter from the European Commission to the Tribunal of 20 May 2015, para. 2.\n\nLetter from the European Commission to the Tribunal of 20 May 2015, para. 6.\n\n30.\n\nOn 22 May 2015, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence (the \"SoD\") with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and an expert report of Greatrex and Montojo Gonzalez in collaboration with Altran (the \"MG&A Report\"). On the same day, the Respondent also filed the Spanish translation of its SoD.\n\n31.\n\nOn 26 May 2015, the Tribunal provided a copy of the Commission\u2019s letter of 20 May 2015 to the Parties, and informed them of its intent to ask the Commission to provide an estimate of the timeframe in which it planned to render its decision on the Kingdom of Spain\u2019s notification of the Disputed Measures. Later that same day, the Tribunal responded to the Commission\u2019s letter of 20 May 2015.\n\n32.\n\nOn 11 June 2015, the Parties jointly requested an amendment to the dates for the document production phase specified in PO8 (as revised on 11 May 2015). The following day the Tribunal revised the time limits as requested by the Parties.\n\n33.\n\nOn 16 June 2015, the Respondent filed a corrected version of the SoD and certain additional translations. By letter of the following day, the Tribunal accepted these changes subject to any objection by the Claimants. No objections were raised.27\n\nSee email from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 22 June 2015.\n\n34.\n\nOn 17 June 2015, each Party served its requests for the production of documents, in accordance with the procedural calendar annexed to PO8 (as amended on 12 June 2015).\n\n35.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the Tribunal received further correspondence from the Commission, advising about the timing of the decision on Spain\u2019s notification of the Disputed Measures. Upon the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Parties provided their comments on 5 July 2015.\n\n36.\n\nOn 8 July 2015, the Tribunal amended the timetable to reflect the Parties\u2019 agreement to extend the date for exchanging uncontested documents from 8 July to 17 July 2015.\n\n37.\n\nOn the same day, the Parties submitted their responses and objections to the document requests.\n\n38.\n\nOn 17 July 2015, having considered the Commission\u2019s request to suspend the proceedings and the Parties\u2019 comments thereto, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to deny the Commission\u2019s request and the related reasons. On 24 July 2015, the Tribunal communicated such decision to the Commission.\n\n39.\n\nOn 20 July 2015, the Respondent asked the Tribunal and the Claimants whether they would agree to communicate the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion to the tribunal and the claimant in *CSP Equity Investment s.a.r.l. (Luxembourg)* v. *Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Arbitration 2013/094) (\"*CSP*\"). On 22 and 24 July 2015, the Tribunal and the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to such request. On 25 July 2015, the Respondent conveyed that there was no information that needed to be redacted from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, as confidentiality was covered by the rules applied in the SCC proceedings.\n\n40.\n\nOn 22 and 23 July 2015, the Claimants and the Respondent submitted their Responses to the objections to the document requests.\n\n41.\n\nOn 24 July 2015, the Tribunal forwarded to the Parties correspondence it had received from the Commission in which the Commission indicated that it would inform the Tribunal of its decision on Spain\u2019s notification.\n\n42.\n\nOn 27 July 2015, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties its understanding that the Respondent would communicate the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion to the tribunal in *CSP,* being specified that both Parties had confirmed that no information needed to be redacted from the Award.\n\n43.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 (\"PO9\") ruling on the Parties\u2019 document production requests.\n\n44.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had been requested by the counsel for the claimants in *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l.* v. *Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30) *('RREEF\"),* to submit the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction in that arbitration. It thus requested the Claimants\u2019 and the Tribunal\u2019s consent.\n\n45.\n\nTwo days later, the Tribunal and the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to such submission*.*\n\n46.\n\nOn 17 October 2015, the Claimants filed their Reply (the \"Reply\") with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements and the Third Expert Report of the Brattle Group (\"Brattle\u2019s Third Expert Report\"). On 23 October 2015, the Claimants filed the Spanish translation of the Reply and on 28 October 2015, they filed a corrected version of the Brattle\u2019s Third Expert Report.\n\n47.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the Respondent requested permission to communicate the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the tribunal in *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B. V.* v. *The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. AR/13/31) *(\"Antin\").*\n\n48.\n\nOn 3 November 2015, the Tribunal granted such permission and noted that the Claimants having consented to the publication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction on 16 January and 19 August 2015, it was not necessary for Spain to seek any further consent from the Claimants with respect to the disclosure of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to other arbitral tribunals or otherwise.\n\n49.\n\nOn 11 December 2015, in light of certain new developments, the Claimants sought leave from the Tribunal, to submit a new witness statement from a Werec representative in respect of its claims. Following further correspondence of 11 December, 16 December and 23 December 2015 between the Parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 request on 29 December 2015. On 11 January 2016, the Claimants filed the witness statement of Jes\u00fas de Ram\u00f3n-Laca Cotorruelo and on 29 January 2016, the Respondent provided its comments.\n\n50.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the ICSID Secretariat had requested the communication of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and the Dissenting Opinion to the ICSID tribunal in *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein* v. *Italian Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3) *(\"Blusun\").* As the Respondent did not consent to the transmittal of the award to the tribunal in *Blusun,* on 14 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the ICSID Secretariat that it was not in a position to disclose the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction to the tribunal in *Blusun.*\n\n51.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder (the \"Rejoinder\") with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements, and the Rebuttal Expert Report of the Altran/MaC group (the \"MG&A Rebuttal Expert Report\"). An updated version of the Rebuttal Expert Report of Altran/MaC group was filed on 3 February 2016.\n\n52.\n\nOn 7 January 2016, the Claimants alleged that the witness statements of Messrs. Davey and Olivas la Llana (submitted with the Rejoinder) did not respond to or rebut evidence submitted with the Reply, and were thus inadmissible in light of the applicable rules and contravening the Claimants\u2019 due process rights. The Claimants reserved the right to submit evidence in response to these witness statements.\n\n53.\n\nOn 7 January 2016, the Claimants requested leave to file an extract from the Respondent\u2019s pleadings in ICSID arbitration *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A.v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1) *(\"Masdar\").* The Respondent did not object. Thus, on 18 January 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that the document was part of the record as Exh. C-664.\n\n54.\n\nAt this juncture, the Respondent sought to file a decision by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The Claimants did not object and, on 25 January 2016, that document was made part of the record as Exh. R-355.\n\n**C. Hearing on Liability and other related matters**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 14 January 2016, the Parties provided the Tribunal with the names of the witnesses and experts they wished to cross-examine at the hearing.\n\n56.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 10 (\"PO10\") about the organization of the hearing.\n\n57.\n\nOn the same day, the Parties provided the Tribunal with their list of attendees for the pre-hearing telephone conference (the \"PHTC\").\n\n58.\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that she would conduct the PHTC alone by delegation of her co-arbitrators.\n\n59.\n\nOn 21 January 2016 at 6 p.m. (CET), the President of the Tribunal and the Parties held the PHTC to discuss the outstanding matters pertaining to the organization of the hearing. The PHTC was attended by the following persons:\n\n**Tribunal**  \nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Presiding Arbitrator  \nDr. Michele Potesta, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n**PCA**  \nMs. Hyun Jung Lee, Permanent Court of Arbitration\n\n**Claimants**  \nMr. Jeffrey Sullivan, Allen and Overy  \nMs. Virginia Allan, Allen and Overy  \nMr. David Ingle, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Tomasz Hara, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Pablo Torres, Allen and Overy\n\n**Respondent**  \nMr. Christian Leathley, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Eduardo Soler Tappa, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Florencia Villaggi, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Jaime de San Roman, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Pilar Colom\u00e9s, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Beverly Timmins, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Melissa S\u00e1nchez, Herbert Smith Freehills\n\n60.\n\nDuring the PHTC, which was audio recorded, the President of the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the items set out in draft PO10, as well as other matters raised by the Parties during the call.\n\n61.\n\nOn 25 January 2016, the Tribunal issued PO10.\n\n62.\n\nOn 29 January 2016, the Respondent requested leave to introduce into the record (i) the award and dissenting opinion in *Charanne B. V. & Construction Investments S.A. R.L.* v. *the Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Case No. 062/2012) (\"*Charanne*\"), and (ii) five decisions by the Spanish Supreme Court. The Claimants did not object and, on 5 February 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to file such documents, which the latter did on the same date, in Spanish (original), and 18 and 25 February 2016, in English (translations), as Exhs. RL-190, RL-191, and R-356 to R-360.\n\n63.\n\nOn 3 February 2016, the Respondent sought the Claimants\u2019 and the Tribunal\u2019s consent for communicating the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction and Dissenting Opinion to the tribunal in *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V.* v. *the Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11), which consent was given on 4 February 2016.\n\n64.\n\nOn 24 February 2016, pursuant to Procedural Rule 4.5, the Claimants requested leave to submit three additional categories of exhibits: (i) documents responding to Spain\u2019s \"late filed witness evidence\";28 (ii) documents related to the due diligence of Impax; and (iii) documents which post-dated the Claimants\u2019 last submission. On 1 March 2016, upon the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Respondent objected to the submission of these new documents. On 7 March 2016, the Tribunal granted some of the Claimants\u2019 requests and denied others. On 9 March 2016, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a consolidated index of the Claimants\u2019 exhibits and submitted the new Exhs. C-665 to C-686.\n\nSee email from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 24 February 2016.\n\n65.\n\nOn 26 February 2016, pursuant to Procedural Rule 3.7, the Respondent sought leave to file two decisions of the Spanish Constitutional Court. Following the Claimants\u2019 confirmation that they had no objection,29 on 7 March 2016, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to file the documents as Exhs. R-361 and R-362.\n\nSee letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 29 February 2016; email from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 1 March 2016.\n\n66.\n\nAlso during this period (i.e. between 23 February and 7 March 2016), the Parties and the Tribunal exchanged correspondence about the logistics of the hearing. The Parties made several joint proposals which the Tribunal approved.\n\n67.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make the necessary adjustments to the hearing schedule and the Parties subsequently provided a jointly revised schedule on 9 March 2016.\n\n68.\n\nAlso on 4 March 2016, the Respondent sought to submit documents as Exhs. R-363 to R-365. Such request was issued pursuant to leave granted by the Tribunal in its letter of 25 February 2016, which permitted the Respondent to introduce into the record any document received from the late production of documents by the Claimants on 17 February 2016.\n\n69.\n\nOn 7 and 8 March 2016, the Parties provided their lists of attendees at the hearing. On 11 March 2016, the Parties submitted demonstrative exhibits.\n\n70.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, the Tribunal issued further instructions in relation to the hearing. Also on 11 March 2016, the Claimants made a request with respect to (i) Exh. C-407 that had previously been filed erroneously and (ii) additional translations to be included in the Opus hearing bundle and considered part of the record (subject to the right of any party to dispute the accuracy of the translations). By email of the same date, the Respondent submitted comments.\n\n71.\n\nThe following day the Tribunal ruled that the Opus hearing bundle was meant as hearing support reflecting documents (including translations) already on record. That said, as the addition of translations appeared to be intended to facilitate the efficient conduct of the examinations, the Tribunal permitted the filing of the additional translations, subject to compelling objections of the Respondent and it being understood that the Respondent could question the accuracy of the translations at the hearing as well as after the conclusion of the hearing. In addition, the Tribunal admitted the filing of the original version of Exh. C-407 in the record.\n\n72.\n\nOn 14 and 15 March 2016, pursuant to section 11 of PO10, the Claimants and the Respondent filed the PowerPoint presentations for their opening statements.\n\n73.\n\nThe hearing on liability (the \"Hearing on Liability\" or the Hearing) took place from 14 to 21 March 2016 at the Peace Palace in The Hague.

It did so on 1 April 2016, the Claimants having confirmed on 25 March 2016 that they did not object.\n\n75.\n\nAlso on 20 March 2016, additional demonstrative exhibits were submitted by both Parties. On 21 March 2016, the Parties submitted their experts' PowerPoint presentations.\n\n76.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Tribunal heard opening submissions by counsel, asked questions to the Parties which counsel answered at the hearing and in their posthearing submissions, and heard evidence from the following witnesses and experts:\n\nMr. Thomas S. Murley, witness  \nMr. Tobias Pehle, witness  \nMr. Javier Valladares, witness  \nMr. Andreas Ochsenk\u00fchn, witness  \nMr. David Tilstone, witness  \nMr. Roland Schumann, witness  \nMr. Enrique Collado Arpia, witness  \nMr. Jes\u00fas de Ram\u00f3n-Laca Cotorruelo, witness  \nMr. Joris van der Geest, witness  \nMr. Roger Scherer, witness  \nMr. Raul Barrueco, witness  \nMr. Darren Kyte, witness  \nMr. Juan Ram\u00f3n Guzm\u00e1n, witness  \nMr. Pedro Manuel Diosdado, witness  \nMr. Peter Rossbach, witness  \nMr. Thomas Schreiber, witness  \nMr. Alexandre Labouret, witness  \nMr. Alfonso Olivas, witness  \nMr. Edward Davey, witness  \nMr. Carlos Lapuerta, the Brattle Group, expert  \nMr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda, the Brattle Group, expert  \nMr. Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Salguero, expert  \nMr. Grant Greatrex, expert, MaC Group  \nMr. Carlos Montojo Gonz\u00e1lez, expert, MaC Group\n\n77.\n\nFollowing a consultation with the Parties at the end of the hearing, on 23 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 in relation to post-hearing matters (\"PO11\").\n\n78.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, the Parties provided agreed corrections to the transcripts of the Hearing. On the same day, the Respondent objected to the inclusion of Exhs. C-378 and C-407, which the Claimants had uploaded to the Opus platform prior to the hearing, alleging that the Claimants had \"abused their role while taking the lead in uploading documents to the Opus platform by including two entirely new documents onto the record and to make amendments to 72 documents\".30 On 6 May 2016, the Claimants commented, stating, *inter alia,* that these matters were \"routine misunderstandings that should have properly been dealt with in correspondence between the parties\".31\n\nSee letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 22 April 2016, p. 2.\n\nSee letter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 6 May 2016, p. 3.\n\n79.\n\nBy letter of 13 May 2016, the Tribunal accepted that the Claimants had failed to submit the original English versions of the two documents by error, as was evident from the fact that in both cases two documents in Spanish were filed. Additionally, the Tribunal accepted the Claimants\u2019 explanations that the track changes visible in the footer of Exh. C-378 (and other documents), which the Respondent had raised as an issue, were the effect of an automatic-update system. The Tribunal thus invited the Claimants to submit Exhs. C-378 and C-407 in their original language together with relevant translations. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address the issue of the translations that had been added onto the Opus system before the Hearing, and the Respondent's related application for costs, in their upcoming cost submissions. On 16 May 2016, the Claimants submitted Exhs. C-378 and C-407 in English (original) and Spanish (translations).\n\n80.\n\nOn 18 May 2016, in view of the Parties\u2019 agreement, the Tribunal authorized the Claimants to file a Spanish Supreme Court judgment of 20 April 2016 as Exh. C-687. Additionally, the Tribunal provided that each Party would have an opportunity to respond to any comments made by the other Party in its reply post-hearing submission due on 17 June 2016. On 20 May 2016, the Claimants filed Exh. C-687.\n\n81.\n\nOn 20 May 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their first post-hearing briefs (\"C-PHB1\" and \"R-PHB1\") followed by Spanish translations on 31 May 2016.\n\n82.\n\nBy email of 23 May 2016, the Respondent objected to the Claimants exceeding of the word limit set by the Tribunal for C-PHB1 and annex 1 and requested that it be allowed to add to its reply brief the number of words by which the Claimants had exceeded the limit, which the Tribunal allowed, the Claimants having no objection.\n\n83.\n\nOn 30 May 2016, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 18 May 2016, the Parties filed submissions on the Spanish Supreme Court decision of 20 April 2016. Also on 30 May 2016, the Respondent contended that the English translation of Exh. C-687 (see *supra* para. 80) was inaccurate. On 2 June 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to attempt to resolve divergences in relation to that translation and to revert if disagreements remained.\n\n84.\n\nOn 15 June 2016, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to resubmit the Spanish translation of R-PHB1 ensuring that the paragraph numbers in the Spanish translation corresponded to those in the English version. The Respondent did so later that day.\n\n85.\n\nOn 24 June 2016, the Parties filed their reply post-hearing briefs (\"C-PHB2\" and \"R-PHB2\"), translations into Spanish following on 1 July 2016.\n\n86.\n\nOn 1 July 2016, the Claimants submitted their final consolidated indices of exhibits and of legal authorities.\n\n87.\n\nOn 8 July 2016, the Parties filed their submissions on costs (\"C-Costs Submission\" and \"R-Costs Submission\") and the Respondent also its consolidated indices of exhibits and legal authorities. On 11 July 2016, the Claimants filed an updated submission on costs. Reply costs submissions were filed on 15 July 2016 (\"C-Costs Reply\" and \"R-Costs Reply\"), as were the Spanish translations of the initial submissions. Spanish translations of the reply submissions were filed on 22 July 2016.\n\n88.\n\nBy email of 15 July 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that a final award had been rendered in *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands B.V.* v. *Spain* (\"*Isolux*\")*,* which was the first award on merits to address the 2013 Measures. The Respondent also attached press reports of 13 July and 15 July 2016 relating to that award. Following the Claimants\u2019 objections, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it could not consider a decision merely on the basis of press reports. However, if one of the Parties were to request leave to submit the award into the record, the Tribunal would then give appropriate directions.\n\n89.\n\nBy letter of 4 August 2016, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to formally request a copy of the *Isolux* award from the *Isolux* tribunal. On 18 August 2016, having reviewed the Parties' comments on the Respondent's request, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to use its best efforts to submit the *Isolux* award, adding that the Parties would have an opportunity to simultaneously comment on the award.\n\n**D. PO12 AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, having deliberated on the Parties' case as it had developed through the written and oral submissions and the evidence gathered so far, the Tribunal unanimously issued Procedural Order No. 12 (\"PO12\").32\n\nExcerpts from PO12 are reproduced *infra* at paras. 650-652, 666.\n\n91.\n\nOn 13 October 2016, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the likelihood that they would require certain clarifications on the matters set out in PO12 and proposed an amendment to the next procedural steps in relation to such clarifications. On the same day, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' proposal.\n\n92.\n\nOn 15 November 2016, following further correspondence between the Parties and the Tribunal on 19 October, 24 October, 28 October and 1 November 2016, the Tribunal addressed the Parties' requests for clarification. In particular, with regard to the Claimants' requests for clarification, it (i) clarified that its invitation to the Claimants to present their quantum cases \"as they deem appropriate\" related only to their alternative claim and did not cover the so-called primary claim; (ii) confirmed that it did not expect to receive submissions on liability in the context of the phase outlined in PO12, and the Parties' further submissions should be \"limited to the aspects of the *quantum* specified in PO12\"; that said, liability could be addressed in connection with comments on the *Isolux* award if it was released; (iii) provided answers to questions set out in the Claimants' letter of 19 October 2016. In connection with the Respondent's requests for clarification, the Tribunal stated that the Parties should use a regulatory lifetime of a PV plant of 30 years and that the Respondent's understanding that written submissions be presented \"in succession (i.e., the Claimants first present their written submission followed by that of the Respondent, etc.)\" was correct and reflected the text of PO12.33\n\nSee Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 15 November 2016, p. 4.\n\n93.\n\nOn 13 December 2016, due to concerns of breach of confidentiality which the Claimants had raised and which the Parties had been unable to resolve, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request to file the *Isolux* award, adding that it would reconsider its decision should circumstances change, for example if it were to receive confirmation that the claimant in *Isolux* had consented to the disclosure of the award.\n\n94.\n\nOn 14 December 2016, the Parties submitted their joint procedural calendar for the phase of the arbitration envisaged in PO12 (referred to \"PO12 phase\"). On this basis, on 19 December 2016, the Tribunal circulated a draft procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 comments, to which the latter agreed on 11 January 2017.\n\n95.\n\nFollowing further correspondence of 19, 24 and 26 January 2017 and 1, 8 and 10 February 2017, it was agreed that a pre-hearing telephone conference (the \"PO12 PHTC\") would be held on 8 January and a hearing on 16 to 20 January 2018 (the \"PO12 Hearing\").\n\n96.\n\nOn 10 February 2017, the Tribunal circulated the final version of the procedural calendar for the PO12 phase.\n\n97.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar, on 7 April 2017, the Claimants filed their \"Quantum Submission\" (the \"Quantum Memorial\") with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and an expert report of the Brattle Group (\"BQR I\"), followed on 15 April 2017, by the translation of the Quantum Memorial.\n\n98.\n\nOn 27 April 2017, pursuant to a request from the Respondent34 and having considered the Claimants\u2019 comments, the Tribunal granted the Respondent an extension of five business days for its document requests and an extension of 4 calendar days for the Counter-Memorial. It also provided the Parties with an updated procedural calendar.\n\nSee Respondent's email to the Tribunal of 26 April 2017.\n\n99.\n\nOn 5 May 2017 the Respondent served its requests for the production of documents. On 12 May 2017, the Claimants submitted their objections to the Respondent\u2019s document production requests. On 19 May 2017, the Respondent provided its replies to the Claimants\u2019 responses and objections. On 29 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (\"PO13\") on these document requests.\n\n100.\n\nOn 5 June 2017, the Claimants provided the Respondent with the documents responsive to the requests that the Tribunal had granted, subject to certain qualifications.\n\n101.\n\nOn 5 and 18 July 2017, the Respondent objected to alleged deficiencies in the Claimants\u2019 production and requested the Tribunal to grant it an extension to file the Counter-Memorial and vacate the hearing scheduled for January 2018. On 14 and 21 July 2017, the Claimants rejected the Respondent\u2019s allegations and requests.\n\n102.\n\nOn 26 July 2017 at 5 p.m. (CET), following a request from the Respondent, the Tribunal and the Parties held a hearing via conference call to discuss the issues raised in the Parties\u2019 correspondence. In addition to the members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, Messrs. Sullivan, Ingle and Busby were present on behalf of the Claimants, and Messrs. Leathley, Soler Tappa, de San Roman and Ms. Timmins were present on behalf of the Respondent. At the telephone hearing, each Party first presented its views and then answered the Tribunal\u2019s questions.\n\n103.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (\"PO14\"), with a revised procedural calendar, which addressed the Respondent\u2019s requests in relation to the document production phase and granted the Respondent an extension until 14 September 2017 to file its Counter-Memorial.\n\n104.\n\nOn 7 August 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions in PO14, the Claimants submitted documents responsive to Spain\u2019s requests and identified documents sought which allegedly did not exist or had not been located.\n\n105.\n\nBetween 14 August 2017 and 20 October 2017, the Claimants provided the Tribunal and the Respondent with updates on the status of its production of responsive documents. On 31 October 2017, the Claimants confirmed that there were no document requests outstanding.\n\n106.\n\nOn 14 September 2017, the Respondent filed its \"Quantum Counter-Memorial\" (\"Quantum Counter-Memorial\"), with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and an expert report of Econ One Research (\"EOQR I\"), followed by translations on 21 September 2017.\n\n107.\n\nOn 2 October 2017, the Claimants submitted their requests for the production of documents in accordance with the procedural calendar agreed between the Parties. On 9 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its objections. On 13 October 2017, the Claimants provided their replies. In a letter of 13 October 2017, the Claimants noted that Spain had retained a new expert (Econ One) for this phase of the arbitration instead of MG&A, whom it had used before. *Inter alia,* they reserved the right to also call MG&A for cross-examination at the PO12 Hearing. On 24 October 2017, the Tribunal wrote that it had taken note of the Parties\u2019 positions and would take a decision if and when the Claimants decided to call MG&A.\n\n108.\n\nOn 20 October 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (\"PO15\") on the Claimants' requests for document production. It reserved its decision on request no. 7 until it received answers from the Parties to questions it had laid out in correspondence, and in Annex A to PO15. The Tribunal later denied request no. 7 on 1 November 2017, following consideration of the Parties' answers of 24 and 26 October 2017, as well as of the positions that they had advanced earlier.\n\n109.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, the Respondent asked the Tribunal for a one-week extension to produce the documents ordered in PO15. On 31 October 2017, having considered the Claimants' objection to such request, the Tribunal granted an extension until 2 November 2017. The Tribunal further indicated that if, because of the delay, the Claimants had insufficient time to comment on the new documents in their Reply due on 9 November 2017, they would be permitted to file a short supplementary submission limited to addressing the documents produced late.\n\n110.\n\nAlso on 31 October 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place from 16 to 20 January 2018 at the Peace Palace in The Hague and requested that the Parties confirm their availability for the PO12 PHTC on 8 January 2018 at 5 p.m. (CET), which they did on 2 November 2017. On 2 November 2017, the Respondent also informed the Tribunal of the status of its document production and explained that it was still searching for documents, which it would produce if and when retrieved.\n\n111.\n\nOn 9 November 2017, the Claimants filed their \"Quantum Reply Submission\" (the \"Quantum Reply\") with report from the Brattle Group (\"BQR II\"), followed by translations on 17 November 2017.\n\n112.\n\nOn 27 November 2017, the Claimants complained that the Respondent had still not produced documents to any of the Claimants' requests. On 30 November 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide an update on the document production process by 7 December 2017.\n\n113.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimants' submission of three new expert reports (Exhs. C-702 to C-704), which, it said, did not rebut expert evidence presented in the Quantum Counter-Memorial. It thus requested that these expert reports be struck from the record or that it be permitted to submit rebuttal expert evidence. On 1 December 2017, further to the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants provided their comments.\n\n114.\n\nStill on 30 November 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal and the Claimants that the Commission had issued its final decision on Spain\u2019s notification of the Disputed Measures (see, *supra*, para. 29) and requested leave to submit that decision, in accordance with Articles 3.7 and 4.5 of the Procedural Rules. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimants opposed Spain\u2019s application on 4 December 2017. On 6 December 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request to file the Commission\u2019s decision into the record. On that same day, the Tribunal denied the Respondent\u2019s request to strike Exhs. C-702 to C-704 from the record.\n\n115.\n\nOn 7 December 2017, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 30 November 2017, the Respondent provided its responses as to the status of its document production.\n\n116.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, the Respondent submitted the Commission\u2019s \"Decision on the State Aid SA.40348 (20151NN) regarding Spain's Support for Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy Sources, Cogeneration and Waste\", dated 10 November 2017 (the \"EC Decision on State Aid\") into the record as Exh. RL-201 and its comments on such document. On 22 December 2017, the Claimants provided their comments.\n\n117.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the Respondent filed its \"Quantum Rejoinder\" (the \"Quantum Rejoinder\") along with accompanying exhibits, legal authorities and a report by Econ One (\"EOQR II\"), followed by a translation on 2 January 2018.\n\n118.\n\nBy letter of 4 January 2018, the Claimants complained that while documents pertaining to their production request No. 1 had been disclosed in another arbitration, the Respondent was presently \"flouting its disclosure obligations\" in the present proceedings. Hence, they asked the Tribunal to order Spain to explain why the documents had not been disclosed and order it to \"immediately\" produce any documents responsive to request No. 1.\n\n119.\n\nUpon the invitation of the Tribunal, on 8 January 2018 the Respondent submitted its comments. In a letter of 12 January 2018, the Tribunal denied the Claimants\u2019 request. On 15 January 2018, on the eve of the PO12 Hearing, the Claimants asked the Tribunal to reconsider its decision. By email of the same date, the Tribunal noted that it would address this request on 16 January.\n\n**E. The PO12 Hearing**\n-----------------------\n\n120.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 16 (\"PO16\") on the organization of the PO12 Hearing for discussion at the upcoming PO12 PHTC.\n\n121.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, by emails of 5 and 7 January 2018, the Parties provided their lists of attendees at the PO12 PHTC and submitted items to be added to the agenda, as well as draft hearing schedules.\n\n122.\n\nBy letter of 6 January 2018, the Claimants contended that Spain had made submissions on several issues of liability in its Quantum Rejoinder outside of the scope of PO12, and requested the Tribunal to strike from the record sections 3.1 to 3.3 (and the new exhibits and legal authorities submitted in support of these sections) and direct Spain to submit a revised Quantum Rejoinder. Alternatively, the Claimants requested the opportunity to respond to the submissions on liability contained in these sections. By email of the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on these allegations during the PO12 PHTC scheduled on 8 January 2018.\n\n123.\n\nOn 8 January 2018, the Hon. Charles N. Brower circulated the CV of his new law clerk, Dr. Devin Bray, and the confidentiality agreement that Dr. Bray had signed upon acceptance of his employment with Judge Brower, and invited the Parties to advise whether they had any objection to Dr. Bray\u2019s attendance at the PO12 Hearing. On 9 and 10 January 2018, both Parties stated that they had no objection.\n\n124.\n\nOn 8 January 2018 at 5 p.m. (CET), the PO12 PHTC took place as scheduled. The following persons attended:\n\n**Tribunal**  \nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Presiding Arbitrator  \nThe Hon. Charles N. Brower, Arbitrator  \nJudge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, Arbitrator  \nDr. Michele Potesta, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n**PCA**  \nMr. Julian Borda\u00e7ahar, Permanent Court of Arbitration\n\n**Claimants**  \nMr. Jeffrey Sullivan, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher  \nMs. Marie Stoyanov, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Antonio Vazquez-Guillen, Allen and Overy  \nMr. David Ingle, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Tomasz Hara, Allen and Overy\n\n**Respondent**  \nMr. Antol\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMr. Diego Santacruz Descartin, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMs. Amaia Rivas Kortazar, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMs. Patricia Frohlingsdorf Nicol\u00e1s, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMr. Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Castilla, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMr. Eduardo Soler Tappa, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Christian Leathley, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Florencia Villaggi, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Jaime de San Rom\u00e1n, Herbert Smith Freehills\n\n125.\n\nDuring the conference call, which was audio recorded, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the items set out in the draft of PO16. On this basis, on 11 January 2018, the Tribunal issued PO16 on the organization of the PO12 Hearing, with the Spanish version following the next day. On 12 January 2018, the Parties also submitted their final list of attendees at the hearing.\n\n126.\n\nOn 13 January 2018, pursuant to PO16, the Claimants requested leave to file additional documents into the record, to which, following invitation from the Tribunal, Spain objected on 15 January 2018. By email of the same date, the Tribunal issued its directions, granting certain of the Claimants\u2019 requests and denying others. On 16 January 2018, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Claimants submitted the relevant legal authorities and an updated consolidated list of legal authorities.\n\n127.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, in accordance with PO16, the Parties also filed their demonstrative exhibits and some corrected versions later that same day.\n\n128.\n\nThe PO12 Hearing took place from 16 to 19 January 2018 at the Peace Palace in The Hague and was attended by the following persons:\n\n**The Tribunal**  \nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Presiding Arbitrator  \nThe Hon.

Also on 16 January 2018, the Claimants submitted the demonstrative exhibits of the Brattle Group. On 17 January 2018, the Respondent submitted Econ One's demonstrative exhibits, and Econ One's hearing presentation.\n\n130.\n\nDuring the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal heard opening arguments by counsel, asked questions to counsel and the experts and heard evidence from the following experts:\n\nMr. Carlos Lapuerta, expert, the Brattle Group  \nMr. Richard Caldwell, expert, the Brattle Group  \nMr. Jack Stirzaker, expert, the Brattle Group  \nMr. Daniel Flores, expert, Econ One  \nMr. Jordan Heim, expert, Econ One\n\n131.\n\nThe Tribunal decided, in consultation with the Parties, to hold an expert conferencing on the last day of the hearing. During such examination, both Parties' experts stated that they would be prepared to assist the Tribunal if the latter needed help in matters of quantum.\n\n**F. PO17 AND OTHER RELATED MATTERS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nAt the end of the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the further procedural steps. As a result, on 25 January 2018 (with the translation following on 30 January), the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17 (\"PO17\"), which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n3. The Parties shall file a first round of simultaneous post-hearing briefs on **16 March 2018**. In the first post-hearing brief, each Party shall comment on the evidence gathered in the course of the Hearing to the extent relevant. In addition, each Party shall present legal arguments as to the appropriate valuation date in this case.\n\n4. Following receipt of the first round of post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal will circulate a draft procedural order setting out certain valuation parameters, inviting the Parties\u2019 experts to produce a joint valuation model (the \"Experts\u2019 Joint Model\" or \"EJM\") taking such parameters into account, and providing appropriate directions in connection with the EJM. Within **2 weeks** from receipt of the draft order, the Parties and their experts may then comment and ask clarifications on the draft order, after which it will be issued in final form.\n\n5. Within **2 months** from the issuance of the order in final form, the experts will produce the EJM taking into account the parameters provided in the order. The time limit set out in this paragraph is tentative and may be modified if a Party so requests within 10 days after having received the order.\n\n6. Thereafter, there shall be a second round of consecutive post-hearing briefs. The Claimants shall file their second post-hearing brief **8 weeks** after the filing of the EJM. The Respondent will file its second post-hearing brief **8 weeks** after receipt of the Claimants\u2019 second post-hearing brief. In the second post-hearing brief, each Party may respond to the arguments made in the first round to the extent deemed necessary, comment on the EJM, and place the result of the EJM in its overall case. In addition, to the extent deemed necessary, each Party may address the EC Decision, the *Eiser, Isolux,* and *Blusun* awards, and authorities CL-237 to CL-240, filed by the Claimants on 16 January 2018.\n\n7. The Parties shall confer and seek to agree on the word limits to apply to the two rounds of post-hearing briefs by **1 February 2018** and revert to the Tribunal with a proposal.\n\n8. The Parties may also confer and seek to agree on rules on counsel\u2019s involvement in the experts\u2019 preparation of the EJM. If the Parties cannot agree on this issue, the Tribunal will address it in its forthcoming draft procedural order on the EJM.\n\n9. No new documents may be submitted with the post-hearing briefs, except with leave of the Tribunal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, additional international decisions and awards, published after a Party\u2019s last written submission, may be submitted as new legal authorities. In this respect, the Respondent shall notify the Claimants **2 weeks** prior to the time limit for the filing of the Claimants\u2019 second post-brief of any new legal authorities on which it intends to rely in its second post-hearing brief.\n\n10. Following receipt of the second post-hearing briefs, upon request or on its own motion, the Tribunal may decide whether it is appropriate to hold a hearing for questions from the Tribunal and possibly oral arguments.\n\n133.\n\nOn 1 February 2018, the Respondent sought a clarification from the Tribunal in relation to paragraph 9 of PO17 in respect of new relevant awards to be published after the deadline. On 7 February 2018, following an invitation from the Tribunal,35 the Claimants opposed Spain's proposal. On 13 February 2018, the Tribunal explained that it had included the rule contained in paragraph 9 of PO17 on the understanding that the Parties had agreed on it at the end of the PO12 Hearing. This not being the case and considering that paragraph 9 of PO17 presented certain shortcomings, the Tribunal provide a revised version of that paragraph.\n\nSee email from the Tribunal to the Parties of 2 February 2018.\n\n134.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, the Respondent addressed the Tribunal's direction that any document under Spain's control responsive to Claimants' document request No. 1 should be produced in accordance with PO15, which had been restated on the last day of the PO12 Hearing. The Respondent confirmed that it had requested certain entities to again search their records for documents responsive to request No. 1. However, no such documents had been located. The Respondent further contended that the Claimants' allegation that certain documents had been produced in other proceedings should be rejected. In the alternative, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimants to identify the counsel who had provided such information as well as the proceedings so that Spain could review those records. The following day, the Respondent submitted attachments to its letter. On 14 February 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to address such letter and its enclosures in their second posthearing brief.\n\n135.\n\nOn 16 February 2018, the Claimants submitted the Parties' agreed version of the English and Spanish transcripts of the PO12 Hearing. Owing to an error, the Respondent re-sent both transcripts on 19 February 2018, to which the Claimants agreed on 21 February 2018.\n\n136.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, pursuant to paragraph 9 of PO17, the Claimants requested leave to file a press article from *El Confidential* dated 24 January 2018, which Spain opposed on 13 March 2018. On 14 March 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' request and the Claimants filed the article as Exh. C-705 with their first post hearing brief *(infra* paragraph 137).\n\n137.\n\nOn 16 March 2018, the Claimants filed their \"First PO12 Post-Hearing Brief\" (the \"PO12 CPHB1\"), followed by the Spanish translation on 25 March 2018. Also on 16 March 2018, the Respondent filed its \"Quantum Post Hearing Brief\" (the \"PO12 RPHB1\"), with a translation on 23 March 2018.\n\n138.\n\nOn 13 April 2018, during the course of the preparation of the EJM, the Claimants requested that \"EconOne be precluded from introducing an alternative But-For discount rate for the purposes of the Joint Model\".36 The Respondent commented on 18 April 2018.\n\nLetter from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 13 April 2018, p. 1.\n\n**G. PO18 and the EJM, new Intervention by the European Commission, the** ***Greentech*** **Documents, the** ***Achmea*** **Judgment and other related matters**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, in accordance with paragraph 4 of PO17, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 18 (\"draft PO18\") dealing with the presentation of an expert joint model (the \"Expert Joint Model\" or \"EJM\"). The Parties provided their comments on draft PO18 on 14 and 22 May 2018.\n\n140.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, the Commission informed the Tribunal that \"in case the Tribunal would deem it useful for its deliberations, the Commission would be available to update its written observations in the light of the recent judgment of the European Court of Justice in Case C-284/16 *Achmea v. Slovak Republic,* and in particular to set out its view on the consequences of that judgment for pending arbitration cases based on the Energy Charter Treaty\".37 On 22 May 2018, the Tribunal forwarded the Commission\u2019s correspondence to the Parties and invited the Parties\u2019 comments, which were provided on 1 June 2018.\n\nSee email from the European Commission to the Tribunal of 16 May 2018.\n\n141.\n\nOn 6 June 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Commission drawing the latter\u2019s attention to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 26 March 2015,38 by which it had provided the Commission with the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction. For the reasons stated in that letter, the Tribunal was unable to accept the Commission\u2019s offer to update its written observations in relation to the intra-EU objection. The Tribunal advised the Commission, however, that it welcomed the Commission\u2019s offer \"to set out in detail the impact of [the decision it adopted on Spain\u2019s notification in November 2017] on the case pending before [this] Tribunal\"39 and invited the Commission to provide its comments limited to this issue by 19 June 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties of such letter.\n\nSee *supra* paras. 26 and 27.\n\nSee email from the European Commission to the Tribunal of 16 May 2018.\n\n142.\n\nStill on 6 June 2018, further to the Parties\u2019 comments on PO18 and a request from the Claimants, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, subject to their availability, it would hear the Parties orally by telephone conference on some of the points raised in their observations on 4 July 2018 at 14:00 (CET). On 7 June 2018, the Parties confirmed their availability.\n\n143.\n\nBy letter of 14 June 2018, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to provide the Parties with a proposal for the procedure going forward40 and asked for indications of the timing of the award on liability and/or quantum and steps to avoid unnecessary delays.\n\nSee email from the Claimants to the Tribunal of 14 June 2018.\n\n144.\n\nOn 19 June 2018, the Commission provided its observations on the impact of the EC Decision on State Aid on the present case. The Tribunal forwarded the Commission\u2019s correspondence to the Parties on the same day and invited their comments, which were provided on 5 July 2018.\n\n145.\n\nBy letter of 25 June 2018, the Tribunal provided the Parties with the agenda for the conference call of 4 July. In its letter, the Tribunal also indicated that it would discuss the timing for the completion of the proceedings during the conference call, as requested by the Claimants on 14 June 2018. On 2 July 2018, after the Parties provided the lists of participants in the telephone conference on the following day, Spain protested against the attendance of the Brattle experts.\n\n146.\n\nOn 3 July 2018, having considered the Claimants\u2019 response, the Tribunal permitted the Brattle experts to attend the call, highlighting that as the call would be recorded, the Respondent would be able to provide the recording to its own experts if it so wished and if they could not participate. The following day, the Respondent confirmed that two of its own experts would attend the call.\n\n147.\n\nOn 4 July 2018, in advance of the telephone conference, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a zip file containing the Parties\u2019 correspondence in relation to the EJM and certain other documents from the record to which the Claimants might refer during the course of the call.\n\n148.\n\nOn 4 July 2018 at 2 p.m. (CET), the Parties and the Tribunal held the telephone conference to discuss draft PO18, with the following persons in attendance:\n\n**The Tribunal**  \nProf. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Presiding Arbitrator  \nThe Hon. Charles N. Brower, Arbitrator  \nJudge Bernardo Sep\u00falveda-Amor, Arbitrator  \nDr. Michele Potest\u00e0, Secretary to the Tribunal\n\n**The PCA**  \nMr. Julian Borda\u00e7ahar, Permanent Court of Arbitration\n\n**Claimants**  \nMs. Marie Stoyanov, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Antonio Vazquez-Guill\u00e9n, Allen and Overy  \nMr. David Ingle, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Tomasz Hara, Allen and Overy  \nMs. Carmen de la Hera, Allen and Overy  \nMr. Jeffrey Sullivan, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher  \nMr. Carlos Lapuerta, expert, the Brattle Group  \nMr. Richard Caldwell, expert, the Brattle Group  \nMr. Jack Stirzaker, expert, the Brattle Group\n\n**Respondent**  \nMr. Diego Santacruz Descartin, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMr. Antol\u00edn Fernandez Antu\u00f1a, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMs. Amaia Rivas Kortazar, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMs. Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Ruiz S\u00e1nchez, Abogac\u00eda del Estado  \nMr. Eduardo Soler Tappa, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Christian Leathley, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMs. Florencia Villaggi, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Jaime de San Rom\u00e1n, Herbert Smith Freehills  \nMr. Daniel Flores, expert, Econ One  \nMr. Jordan Heim, expert, Econ One\n\n149.\n\nDuring the conference call, the Tribunal heard the Parties' submissions on draft PO18 and proposed modifications thereto (submitted on 14 and 22 May 2018, *supra* paragraph 139). The recording of this conference call was sent to the Parties the following day.\n\n150.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, the Tribunal unanimously issued PO18 in final form, the Spanish translation being circulated on 2 August 2018.41\n\nExcerpts of PO18 are reproduced *infra* at paras. 655-656 and 667.\n\n151.\n\nOn 13 August 2018, the Respondent made a number of requests, among which an application that the Tribunal open a new procedural phase to consider Spain\u2019s \"new jurisdictional objection\" based on \"new facts\". In this context, the Respondent asked to file the *Achmea* judgment along with an EC Communication and fact sheet published on 19 July 2018, which provided \"guidance on the protection of cross-border EU investments, as well as on the implications of [*Achmea*], for the investor-State arbitration in the Energy Charter Treaty [...] in relation to cross border EU investments\".42 The Respondent further requested that the Tribunal allow the Commission to present its comments on the impact of the EC Communication along with the *Achmea* judgment on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the present arbitration. On 31 August 2018, as directed by the Tribunal, the Claimants provided their comments on the Respondent\u2019s requests. In accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s further directions, the Respondent filed its reply comments on 6 September, to which the Claimants responded on 11 September 2018.\n\nSee Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal of 13 August 2018, p. 1.\n\n152.\n\nOn 7 September 2018, the Claimants (on behalf of Brattle) sought a clarification43 regarding one of the areas of disagreement between the experts regarding the EJM. Further correspondence on this issue was exchanged between the Tribunal and the Parties on 9 September, 11 September, 14 September, 18 September, 21 September, and 24 September 2018. By letter of 24 September 2018, the Tribunal issued certain clarifications in relation to the Claimants\u2019 request.\n\nPursuant to para. 15 of PO18 by which the Tribunal directed the Econ One and Brattle experts to write to the Tribunal should they require clarifications in the course of the preparation of the EJM.\n\n153.\n\nOn 5 October 2018, after a short delay, the Brattle and Econ One experts filed the EJM accompanied by a Joint Memorandum to the EJM (the \"Joint Memorandum\").\n\n154.\n\nOn 11 October 2018, following an inquiry from the Claimants, the Tribunal confirmed that the filing dates for the second post-hearing briefs were 26 November 2018 for the Claimants and 4 February 2019 for the Respondent. At this juncture, the Tribunal mentioned that it would shortly provide its decision on the Respondent\u2019s request to open a new jurisdictional phase.\n\n155.\n\nOn 15 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 (\"PO19\"), denying the Respondent\u2019s request to open a new jurisdictional phase and other related requests, the Spanish translation following on 25 October 2018.\n\n156.\n\nAlso on 15 October 2018, the Claimants filed an application for the production of certain documents allegedly produced by Spain to the claimants in *Greentech Energy Systems A/S et al. v. Kingdom of Spain* (SCC Arbitration V 2015/150) *(\"Greentech\"* and the \"*Greentech* Documents\") and certain legal authorities (Exhs. CL-243 to CL-249). The following day, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants\u2019 application, which they did on 22 October 2018. On 29 October 2018, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to file the *Greentech* Documents.44 The Tribunal also later determined that the legal authorities should not be admitted into the record.45\n\nSee also Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 7 November 2018.\n\nSee Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties of 10 December 2018.\n\n157.\n\nOn 31 October 2018, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to reconsider its order of 29 October 2018 regarding the *Greentech* Documents. Upon an invitation by the Tribunal, the Claimants submitted their comments later that same day. On 7 November 2018, the Tribunal denied the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n158.\n\nBy correspondence of 12 November 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had yet to receive the *Greentech* Documents. Two days later, the Respondent advised that a change to its counsel team was the cause of the delay. On 16 November 2018, the Claimants provided comments and requested leave to file a supplemental submission following receipt of the *Greentech* documents. On 21 November 2018, the Respondent filed the *Greentech* Documents.\n\n159.\n\nOn 23 November 2018, the Brattle experts provided an agreed corrected version of the EJM. On 26 November 2018, the Tribunal conveyed its understanding that the updated EJM was submitted on behalf of both experts and that it should be advised, by 28 November 2018, if this was not the case. No such advice was provided.\n\n160.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, the Claimants noted that their request for leave to file a supplemental submission following receipt of the *Greentech* Documents remained outstanding and asked for a two-day extension for their Second PO12 PHB (until 28 November 2018) in light of the time and manner in which they had received the *Greentech* Documents.\n\n161.\n\nOn 27 November 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that when the *Greentech* Documents had been filed, the metadata had been inadvertently erased. For this reason, the Respondent resubmitted the *Greentech* Documents including the metadata.\n\n162.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal confirmed that the resubmitted *Greentech* Documents had been admitted into the record as Exhs. C-372 and C-373. The Tribunal also confirmed that the time limits for the second post-hearing briefs were extended until 29 November 2018 and 12 February 2019. The Tribunal further conveyed its understanding that there were no outstanding requests in connection with the *Greentech* Documents.\n\n163.\n\nStill on 27 November 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that this understanding was not correct because (i) the documents attached to Spain's email of 27 November 2018 also had the metadata removed; and (ii) the Respondent had failed to provide the clarification requested by the Claimants in their email of 22 November 2018 regarding the origin of the *Greentech* Documents. On 29 November 2018, upon the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent provided further comments on the *Greentech* Documents. On 10 December 2018, the Tribunal granted the Claimants leave to submit their observations to the Respondent's communication of 29 November 2018 and the Respondent an opportunity to reply in its PO12 Second PHB.\n\n164.\n\nOn 29 November 2018, the Claimants filed their \"Second PO12 Post-Hearing Brief\" (the \"PO12 C-PHB2\") (the translation being provided on 6 December 2018) and relayed that in the process of preparing such brief, it had come to their attention that (i) the document presented as Exh. C-252 only comprised an annex to the National Action Plan on Renewable Energy in Spain (the PANER) 2011 - 2020 dated 30 June 2010, when it should include the full PANER; and (ii) Annex 3 to the Claimants' application for an order on document production dated 15 October 2018 had inadvertently been omitted from the winzip of documents accompanying that submission. They requested that these documents be included in the record, which Spain opposed on 6 December 2018.\n\n165.\n\nBy letter of 10 December 2018, the Tribunal decided not to accept these documents, stating that the Claimants had not made out any \"exceptional case\"46 which would justify the introduction of Exh. C-252 and the Annex 3 mentioned above at such a late stage of the proceedings. In addition, the Tribunal also determined that new legal authorities CL-243 to CL-249 would not be admitted, noting in particular that these authorities all addressed the principle of adverse inferences which would only apply if the Claimants\u2019 primary request for the disclosure of the *Greentech* Documents had been rejected, which was not the case.\n\nSee Sections 3.7 and 4.5 of the Procedural Rules and para. 9 of Procedural Order No. 17.\n\n166.\n\nOn 20 December 2018, the Claimants submitted their observations on the *Greentech* documents.\n\n167.\n\nOn 12 February 2019, the Respondent filed its \"Second Post Hearing Brief on Quantum\" (the \"PO12 R-PHB2\"), followed by the translation on 19 February 2019. Also on 12 February 2019, the Respondent requested permission to file into the record the declaration by 22 Member States of the European Union \"on the Legal Consequences of the Judgement of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union\". Pursuant to an invitation from the Tribunal, the Claimants submitted their comments on 18 February 2019.\n\n168.\n\nBy letter of 21 February 2019, the Tribunal authorized the filing of all three declarations made by EU Member States and invited the Parties to provide their comments. On 25 February 2019, the Respondent filed such declarations under Exh. numbers RL-214 to RL-216, with an updated consolidated index of the Respondent\u2019s legal authorities. The Parties submitted their respective observations on the declarations on 7 and 21 March 2019.\n\n169.\n\nOn 26 April 2019, the Tribunal updated the Parties on the progress of its deliberations and further invited: (i) both Parties to make additional submissions on the *Greentech* Documents; (ii) both Parties to file their costs submissions pursuant to PO17; and (iii) the Respondent to file a submission on Interest.\n\n170.\n\nOn 3 May 2019, the Respondent filed its submission on the *Greentech* Documents and on 10 May 2019, the Claimants filed their reply, both in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 26 April 2019.\n\n171.\n\nOn 17 May 2019, the Respondent filed its Submission on Interest.\n\n**H. Costs Submissions and Closure of the Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nOn 14 June 2019, the Parties filed their Submissions on Costs (the \"PO12 C-Costs Submission\" and \"PO12 R-Costs Submission\"), with translations submitted on 24 and 26 June 2019.\n\n173.\n\nOn 28 June 2019, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their Reply Submissions on costs (\"PO12 C-Reply Costs Submission\" and \"PO12 R-Reply Costs Submission\"), with translations submitted on 3 July 2019.\n\n174.\n\nOn 4 September 2019, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal provide an update regarding the progress in preparing the award, which the Tribunal did on 6 September 2019. On 13 September 2019, the Claimants made further inquiries in this respect. On 18 September 2019, the Tribunal indicated that it would do the utmost to issue the award by 2019, reminding the Parties, however, that the award needed to be translated into Spanish before issuance. The Tribunal further indicated that it would write again towards the end of November with an issuance date.\n\n175.\n\nOn 2 December 2019, after noting that it had all the necessary elements in terms of liability and, if applicable, quantum to render a Final Award, the Tribunal closed the proceedings and provided an updated on the date of issuance of the award.\n\n176.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, the Respondent acknowledged the Tribunal's letter of 2 December 2019 and informed the Tribunal that on the same date Spain was notified of two new relevant decisions from ICSID tribunals which should necessarily inform the Tribunal's analysis.47 The Respondent noted that, being those awards public, it trusted that the Tribunal would take them into consideration.\n\nThe Respondent referred to (i) *Stadtwerke Munchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH and others v.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No ARB/15/16, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, 2 December 2019 (\"*BayWa*\").\n\n177.\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Respondent\u2019s communication of 4 December 2019 and took note of its content. Moreover, the Tribunal noted that in addition to the decision or awards that were on record and the additional two referred by the Respondent, it was aware of a number of other publicly available decisions or awards rendered in other arbitrations brought against the Kingdom of Spain and which concerned the measures in this case.48 The Tribunal invited the Parties to advise if there were other decision or awards rendered in arbitrations concerning the measures challenged in this arbitration. Finally, the Tribunal invited the Parties to inform whether they wished to file a short submission limited to said awards.\n\nThe Tribunal referred to (i) *9REN Holding S.\u00c0.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15; (ii) *Cube Infrastructure Fund Sicav and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20; (iii) *Nextera Energy Global Holdings B.V.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38.\n\n178.\n\nBy e-mails of 11 December 2019, both Parties agreed that filing additional submissions on these awards was not necessary.49 Moreover, they both noted that the award in the *Infrared* case50 had been issued. While the Claimants enclosed a copy of the award to their e-mail, the Respondent noted that despite the fact that the existence of the *Infrared* award was of public knowledge, the content of the award had not been made public until that date. On the same day, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of both communications and took note of their content.\n\nSee the Parties' e-mails of 11 December 2019.\n\n*Infrared Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12, Award, 2 August 2019.\n\n179.\n\nOn 27 January 2020, the Tribunal circulated a list containing the names of the Claimant entities and invited the Claimants to provide a clarification regarding the names of certain Claimant entities as well as make any other necessary corrections to the names appearing on the list. By letter of 3 February 2020, the Claimants provided the requested clarification and set out in Annex 1 to their letter the correct names of each Claimant entity.\n\n180.\n\nOn 20 February 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, having regard to Article 8.2 of the Procedural Rules and the Parties' related correspondence, after dispatch of the Award, it would give the Parties the opportunity to (i) request that redactions be made to the Final Award prior to its publication to the extent necessary to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information and to (ii) comment on the other Party's requests (if any). The Tribunal would then rule on any disagreement and instruct the PCA to publish the Final Award with the necessary redactions (if any) on its website. At the same time, it would also instruct the PCA to publish the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, in conformity with the Parties' agreement (see Claimants' letter of 16 February 2015, p. 1; Respondent's letter of 11 March 2015, p. 3). Hence, the Tribunal would stay in office in order to implement the afore-mentioned arrangements on publication.\n\n**III. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe present dispute concerns the Claimants\u2019 investment in Spain\u2019s renewable energy (\"RE\") sector, specifically in photovoltaic (\"PV\") installations representing an approximate aggregate 239,338 megawatts (MW) of electrical power-generating capacity. The dispute concerns the evolution of the legal framework applicable to the PV installations and the impact it had on the Claimants\u2019 investment. Sections III.A and III.B summarize the evolution of the legal framework in the RE sector, which is necessary to put the Parties\u2019 arguments (*infra* at Section V) into perspective. The purpose of the summary of the legal framework and of the Disputed Measures in sections III.A and III.B is to capture the general traits of the various legislative instruments which, unless otherwise mentioned, appear undisputed between the Parties.\n\n**A. The Investment Framework**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The 1997 Electricity Law**\n-------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe main piece of legislation regulating power generation in Spain is Electricity Law No. 54/1997 published on 28 November 1997 (the \"1997 Electricity Law\"). The 1997 Electricity Law divides the generation of electricity into two regimes: the \"Ordinary Regime\" which concerns conventional generation facilities (i.e., non-renewable sources) and the \"Special Regime\" which concerns power generation from RE sources, including PV energy.51\n\nElectricity Law No. 54/1997 dated 27 November 1997 (published on 28 November 1997), **Exhs. C-16** ; **R-3** ; **R-238**, Title IV, Chapter II, Articles 27-31.\n\n183.\n\nAmong the key differences between the rights and obligations available to power generators under the two regimes is the manner in which they are remunerated. While Ordinary Regime generators receive the market price for their electricity, the remuneration for Special Regime generators is supplemented by a State subsidy or premium. Article 30.4 as in force at the time when the Claimants made their investments stipulates that such subsidy shall be determined by taking into account the following factors:52\n\nthe level of voltage at which energy is delivered to the grid, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings and energy efficiency, economically viable useful heat production and the investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market. (Tribunal\u2019s translation)\n\nElectricity Law No. 54/1997 dated 27 November 1997 (published on 28 November 1997), **Exhs. C-16** ; **R-3** ; **R-238**, Article 30.4 (\"El r\u00e9gimen retributivo de las instalaciones de producci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica en r\u00e9gimen especial se completar\u00e1 con la percepci\u00f3n de una prima, en los t\u00e9rminos que reglamentariamente se establezcan, en los siguientes casos\").\n\n184.\n\nThe 1997 Electricity Law is implemented through \"Royal Decrees\" (\"RD\").53\n\nSee ASoC, para. 89; SoD, para. 100.\n\n**2. RD 436/2004**\n------------------\n\n185.\n\nRD 436/2004 of 12 March 2004 (\"RD 436/2004\") was the first RD to establish an incentive system based on a \"Feed-in-Tariff\" (\"FIT\") for investors in PV technology, based on the criteria referred to in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law.54\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exhs. C-19** ; **R-55**, Preamble para. 6.\n\n186.\n\nIn that regard, Article 22.1 of RD 436/2004 gave installation operators the option to either sell their electricity freely on the market or at a \"single, flat rate\":55\n\nIn order to sell their output or surpluses of electric power, the operators of installations within the scope of this Royal Decree must choose one of the following options:\n\na) Assignment of the electricity over to the electricity distribution company. In this case, the electricity sale price shall be expressed as a regulated tariff which shall be a single, flat rate for all scheduling periods and expressed in euro cents per kilowatt hour [i.e., a FIT].\n\nb) Sale of the electricity freely on the market, through the system of offers and bids managed by the market operator [...]. (Tribunal\u2019s translation)\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exhs. C-19** ; **R-55**, Article 22.1 (\"Para vender su producci\u00f3n o excedentes de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, los titulares de instalaciones a los que resulte de aplicaci\u00f3n este Real Decreto deber\u00e1n elegir entre una de las dos opciones siguientes: a) Ceder la electricidad a la empresa distribuidora de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica. En este caso, el precio de venta de la electricidad vendr\u00e1 expresado en forma de tarifa regulada, \u00fanica para todos los per\u00edodos de programaci\u00f3n, expresada en c\u00e9ntimos de euro por kilowatio-hora. b) Vender la electricidad libremente en el mercado, a trav\u00e9s del sistema de ofertas gestionado por el operador de Mercado [\u2026]\").\n\n187.\n\nWhatever mechanism was chosen, RD 436/2004 purported to \"guarantee to the owners of special regime installations a reasonable remuneration for their investment and to electricity consumers a reasonable allocation of the costs attributable to the electricity system\".56\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exhs. C-19** ; **R-55**, Preamble para. 7 (Tribunal's translation) (emphasis added) (\"Cualquiera que sea el mecanismo retributivo por el que se opte, el Real Decreto garantiza a los titulares de instalaciones en r\u00e9gimen especial una retribuci\u00f3n razonable para sus inversiones y a los consumidores el\u00e9ctricos una asignaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n razonable de los costes imputables al sistema el\u00e9ctrico [\u2026]\").\n\n188.\n\nThe rate of the FIT was set out in Article 33 of RD 436/2004 and was linked to a PV installation's capacity. The FIT was calculated as a multiple of the consumer electricity tariff and was available at a certain multiple for the first 25 years of the installation's operational life and at a reduced multiple thereafter. Further, Article 40 established the framework for revision of tariffs, premiums and incentives for new installations. The Claimants' investments were not made pursuant to RD 436/2004.\n\n**3. RD 661/2007**\n------------------\n\n189.\n\nRD 661/2007, which replaced RD 436/2004, is the bedrock on which the Claimants anchor their claims. While the Parties' specific arguments are addressed when setting out their positions, the Tribunal reviews here certain key provisions of this RD.\n\n190.\n\nAccording to its Preamble, one of the reasons for issuing RD 661/2007 was the need to amend the remuneration scheme established by RD 436/2004 and separate the calculation of the FIT from the consumer electricity tariff used until then (see *supra* para. 188). At the same time and in the same vein as RD 436/2004, however, RD 661/2007 reiterated that \"[t]he economic framework established in this royal decree develops the principles contained in Law 54/1997, [...] guaranteeing the owners of special regime facilities a reasonable return on their investments and electricity consumers a reasonable allocation of costs attributable to the electricity system\".57\n\nRD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, **Exh. C-35**, Preamble para. 7 (Tribunal's translation) (\"El marco econ\u00f3mico establecido en el presente real decreto desarrolla los principios recogidos en la Ley 54/1997 [\u2026] garantizando a los titulares de instalaciones en r\u00e9gimen especial una retribuci\u00f3n razonable para sus inversiones y a los consumidores el\u00e9ctricos una asignaci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n razonable de los costes imputables al sistema el\u00e9ctrico\").\n\n191.\n\nTowards this end, Article 24 of RD 661/2007 stipulated that Special Regime installations could either opt to receive a single regulated tariff expressed in terms of Euro cents per kilowatt hour (i.e. the FIT) for the sale of their electricity or they could sell directly to the market and receive the market price.58 For PV installations that opted for the first recourse mentioned above, Article 36 stipulated the fixed tariff that would be payable as follows:\n\nRD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 24.\n\n192.\n\nIn other words, depending on their installed capacity, PV installations were granted a FIT in Euro cents per kilowatt hour for the first 25 years of their operational life, and a lower amount thereafter. The FIT was adjustable annually for inflation based on the Spanish Consumer Price Index (\"CPI\").\n\n193.\n\nTo be entitled to the FIT, a PV facility needed to register with the *Registro Administrativo de Instalaciones de Producci\u00f3n en R\u00e9gimen Especial* (\"RAIPRE\") before a given time limit.59 Article 22 of RD 661/2007 provided that such time limit could be set at no less than one year after the PV sector reached 85% of its power target of 371 MW.\n\nRD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 17(c).\n\n194.\n\nArticle 17 confirmed certain other rights of Special Regime installations, i.e. the right to sell all or part of the energy produced and priority of access to the transmission grid. Finally, Article 44 provided for the adjustment and review of tariffs. In that regard, Article 44.3 read as follows:60\n\nIn 2010, in view of the result of the follow-up reports on the extent to which the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Saving and Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020, tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.\n\nThe adjustments to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper thresholds referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up document was issued before January 1 of the second year after the year in which the adjustment was implemented. (Tribunal\u2019s translation)\n\nRD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 44.3 (\"Durante el a\u00f1o 2010, a la vista del resultado de los informes de seguimiento sobre el grado de cumplimiento del Plan de Energ\u00edas Renovables (PER) 2005-2010 y de la Estrategia de Ahorro y Eficiencia Energ\u00e9tica en Espa\u00f1a (E4), as\u00ed como de los nuevos objetivos que se incluyan en el siguiente Plan de Energ\u00edas Renovables para el per\u00edodo 2011-2020, se proceder\u00e1 a la revisi\u00f3n de las tarifas, primas, complementos y l\u00edmites inferior y superior definidos en este real decreto, atendiendo a los costes asociados a cada una de estas tecnolog\u00edas, al grado de participaci\u00f3n del r\u00e9gimen especial en la cobertura de la demanda y a su incidencia en la gesti\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica y econ\u00f3mica del sistema, garantizando siempre unas tasas de rentabilidad razonables con referencia al coste del dinero en el mercado de capitales. Cada cuatro a\u00f1os, a partir de entonces, se realizar\u00e1 una nueva revisi\u00f3n manteniendo los criterios anteriores.

Registration of the Claimants\u2019 Facilities in the RAIPRE**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe 85% threshold set for the PV sector was achieved in and around August 2007. As a result, pursuant to Article 22 of RD 661/2007, Spain announced on 27 September 2007 that the time limit for RAIPRE registrations would expire on 29 September 2008.61 All of the Claimants\u2019 PV installations were registered with RAIPRE within this deadline and accordingly fell within the purview of the benefits available under RD 661/2007.\n\nResolution published in the Spanish Official Gazette dated 27 September 2007, **Exh. C-228** ; ASoC, paras. 205-212; SoD, para. 315.\n\n**5. RD 1578/2008**\n-------------------\n\n197.\n\nRD 1578/2008 was enacted on 26 September 2008, days before the time limit for registration under RD 661/2007 expired.62 It set forth the economic regime applicable to PV installations that had registered after the closure of the RD 661/2007 registration window. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the regulated tariff granted to new installations under this RD was lower than the one granted under RD 661/2007 and that these tariffs did not apply to the Claimants\u2019 installations.\n\nRoyal Decree No. 1578/2008 of 26 September 2008, **Exhs. C-242** ; **R-28**.\n\n**B. The Disputed Measures**\n----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nStarting from 2010, Spain enacted a series of measures, which had the effect of adjusting and ultimately replacing the economic incentives granted under RD 661/2007.63 These measures (the \"Disputed Measures\") consisted of:\n\na. the \"2010 Measures\" comprising of RD 1565/2010 of 19 November 2010 (\"RD 1565/2010\") and RD Law 14/2010 of 23 December 2010 (\"RDL 14/2010\") *(infra* at (1)); and\n\nb. the \"New Measures\" or the \"New Regime\" comprising of RD Law 2/2013 of 1 February 2013 (\"RDL 2/2013\"), RD Law 9/2013 of 12 July 2013 (\"RDL 9/2013\"), Law 24/2013 on the Electricity Sector of 27 December 2013 (\"Law 24/2013\"), RD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014 (\"RD 413/2014\") and Order IET/1045/2014 of 16 June 2014 (the \"Order on Parameters\") *(infra* at (2)).\n\nWithout prejudice to the Respondent's arguments, this is intended to refer to the fact that the payment made under the New Regime was not in the nature of a \"FIT\".\n\n**1. The 2010 Measures**\n------------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn 2010, Spain approved RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010. These are the first of the measures that the Claimants allege harmed their investment.\n\n200.\n\nRD 1565/2010 (as amended by Law 2/2011) extended the higher FIT provided under RD 661/2007 to 30 years and eliminated the lower FIT, with the consequence that installations would sell electricity at the market rate after year 30.64\n\nRD 1565/2010, **Exh. C-152.** The Tribunal notes that RD 1565/2010 initially limited the period for which the FIT would be available to 25 years such that from year 26, electricity would have to be sold at market price. This period was increased to 28 years by RDL 14/2010 (Final Provision One) and extended to 30 years by the Sustainable Economy Act Law No. 2 of 4 March 2011 (the \"Sustainable Economy Law\"). See Sustainable Economy Law, **Exhs. C-164** ; **R-57**.\n\n201.\n\nRDL 14/2010, for its part, established a limit on the number of hours per year for which PV installations would receive the FIT (the \"hours cap\").65 Once an installation reached this cap, it could continue to sell electricity but at market prices. The hours cap was applicable throughout the life of the installation.\n\nRDL 14/2010, **Exhs. C-154** ; **R-59**, Additional Provision One, which provided a general hours cap. It is noted that pursuant to Transitional Provision Two, a different cap was initially applicable to the installations registered under RD 661/2007 until 31 December 2013, after which the general cap applied.\n\n202.\n\nFinally, on 27 December 2012, Spain approved Law 15/2012, which imposed a tax of 7% \"on the production of electricity and its incorporation into the electricity system\".66\n\nLaw 15/2012, **Exh. C-300**, Chapter 1, Articles 1 and 8.\n\n**2. The New Measures**\n-----------------------\n\n203.\n\nIn 2013, Spain enacted a series of measures that had the effect of withdrawing the regime put in place under RD 661/2007. These measures are set out below.\n\n**a.** ***RDL 2/2013***\n-----------------------\n\n204.\n\nOn 1 February 2013, Spain introduced RDL 2/2013, by which it removed certain components of the consumer price index (\"CPI\") used to adjust the FIT for inflation under RD 661/2007.67\n\nRDL 2/2013, **Exh. C-301**, Preamble and Article 1.\n\n**b.** ***RDL 9/2013***\n-----------------------\n\n205.\n\nOn 12 July 2013, Spain enacted RDL 9/2013, which repealed all former regulations governing the PV sector, including RD 661/2007 and the 2010 Measures. In their stead, it introduced a \"New Regime\" for both existing and new installations.\n\n206.\n\nRDL 9/2013 enacted the following changes:\n\na. Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law was amended \"in order to narrow the scope of action of the Government in the development of remuneration systems\" for RE facilities.68 Pursuant to such amendment, the FIT was abolished. PV installations were now entitled to the market price supplemented by an additional amount (to which the Claimants refer as \"Special Payment\"). This \"Special Payment\" was to be \"composed of an amount per unit of installed capacity\", which \"shall cover the investment costs [...] that cannot be recovered through the sale of energy, as well as an amount for the operation of the installation to cover, as the case may be, the difference between exploitation costs and the revenues obtained from the participation of such a standard installation in the market\".69\n\nb. These investment costs were calculated by reference to the costs of a hypothetical \"Standard Installation\", envisaged as an \"efficient and well-managed\" company having \"the necessary means for the development of its field, whose costs are those of an efficient enterprise in that field and considering the corresponding revenue and a reasonable profit for the execution of its functions\".70\n\nc. The Government could revise the Special Payment every six years.71\n\nd. Further, the Special Payment was capped at \"the minimum level necessary to cover the costs [...] and [...] lead to a reasonable rate of return\".72 Such \"reasonable return\" had to be calculated on the basis of the pre-tax \"average returns in the secondary market of Spain\u2019s ten-year bonds\" \"increased by 300 basis points\".73\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. R-29**, Preamble, Part II, p. 52111.\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. C-302**, Article 1. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's translation is substantially similar. (\"[\u2026] las instalaciones podr\u00e1n percibir una retribuci\u00f3n especifica compuesta por un t\u00e9rmino por unidad de potencia instalada, que cubra, cuando proceda, los costes de inversi\u00f3n de una instalaci\u00f3n tipo que no pueden ser recuperados por la venta de la energ\u00eda y un t\u00e9rmino a la operaci\u00f3n que cubra, en su caso, la diferencia entre los costes de explotaci\u00f3n y los ingresos por la participaci\u00f3n en el mercado de dicha instalaci\u00f3n tipo\").\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. R-29**, Preamble, Part II (\"se entender\u00e1 por empresa eficiente y bien gestionada aquella empresa dotada de los medios necesarios para el desarrollo de su actividad, cuyos costes son los de una empresa eficiente en dicha actividad y considerando los ingresos correspondientes y un beneficio razonable por la realizaci\u00f3n de sus funciones\").\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. C-302**, Article 1.\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. R-29**, Article 1 (Respondent's translation) (\"Este r\u00e9gimen retributivo no sobrepasar\u00e1 el nivel m\u00ednimo necesario para cubrir los costes que permitan competir a las instalaciones en nivel de igualdad con el resto de tecnolog\u00edas en el mercado y que posibiliten obtener una rentabilidad razonable\").\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. C-302**, First Additional Provision (Tribunal's translation) (\"la rentabilidad razonable girar\u00e1, antes de impuestos, sobre el rendimiento medio en el mercado secundario de los diez a\u00f1os anteriores a la entrada en vigor del presente real decreto-ley de las Obligaciones del Estado a diez a\u00f1os incrementada en 300 puntos b\u00e1sicos\").\n\n207.\n\nThe provisions of RDL 9/2013 were not implemented immediately and were subject to a transitory period of 11 months. During this transitory period, \"in order to maintain both the flows of remuneration to the facilities, as well as the rest of the procedures, rights, and obligations\", the provisions of RD 661/2007 with respect to remuneration continued to apply. However, once RDL 9/2013 was implemented, the revenues earned by PV installations during the transitory period were to be brought in line with the revenues that should have been earned under the New Regime.74\n\nRDL 9/2013, **Exh. R-29**, Preamble at p. 52112.\n\nc. ***Electricity Sector Law 24/2013***\n---------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nOn 26 December 2013, the Spanish Parliament approved Law 24/2013, which consolidated the various legislative amendments that had taken place since the 1997 Electricity Law.75\n\nLaw 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, **Exh. C-303**.\n\n209.\n\nThis Law removed the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regime on the rationale that \"the great penetration of production technologies starting from renewable energy sources [...] has caused its individual regulation [...] to lack any purpose\". Rather, given the degree of technological development in the sector, it was \"necessary for the regulations to consider these installations in a similar way to the rest of the technology integrated in the market\".76 In other words, Law 24/2013 aimed to bring the two regimes at par, on the premise that RE no longer lacked the ability to compete in the market with more conventional sources.\n\nLaw 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, **Exh. C-303**, Preamble.\n\n210.\n\nOn this basis, the Law set up a remuneration structure along the same lines as that introduced by RDL 9/2013.77 In particular, the remuneration for the RE sector was to consist of the market price plus a supplementary amount (the Special Payment), calculated by reference to a Standard Installation and subject to revision every six years.78\n\nLaw 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, **Exh. C-303**, Article 14.\n\nLaw 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, **Exh.

Although this RD sought to implement and develop some aspects of the new remuneration regime established by RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013, it did not provide for the set of remuneration parameters necessary to calculate the costs of a Standard Installation.80 These were established by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (the \"Ministry of Industry\") in the Order on Parameters, which, among other things, fixed the reasonable return for existing installations at 7,398%.81\n\nRD 413/2014 of 6 June 2014 (published in the Official State Gazette on 10 June 2014), **Exh. C-304**.\n\nOrder on Parameters, **Exh. C-305**, Annex III.\n\n**C. The Primary and Alternative Claims**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Claimants contend that relying on the economic incentives contained in RD 661/2007 and particularly on the alleged stabilization guarantee in Article 44.3, they invested approximately EUR 2 billion in the Spanish PV sector. According to them, RD 661/2007 was specifically designed to attract investment and boost the RE sector. On the basis of RD 661/2007 and of various representations and public statements made by Spain, the Claimants had the reasonable and legitimate expectation that the incentives granted by RD 661/2007 would remain unchanged during the lifetime of their plants. However, once Spain had \"charmed\" the Claimants into making their investments, it set about enacting a series of measures that drastically scaled back and ultimately withdrew the incentives of RD 661/2007.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Spain\u2019s conduct constitutes a breach of the latter\u2019s obligations under Article 10 of the ECT. This is, in summary, the Claimants\u2019 \"primary claim\".\n\n215.\n\nSpain\u2019s primary defence is that the Claimants should have been aware that their incentives were subject to an overarching \"principle of reasonable profitability\". In other words, the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable rate of return, \"applicable at the time the Claimants made their investment\", which \"was around 7%\".82 According to Spain, the New Measures were not drastically different from the RD 661/2007 regime, maintained all the key features of that regime, and guaranteed the same level of return. As such, its conduct is well within its right to regulate and does not constitute a violation of Article 10 of the ECT.\n\nRejoinder, para. 260.\n\n216.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Spain \"did not promise any regulated Tariff under RD 661/2007 [and] [...] the Spanish system only allowed investors to aspire to reasonable profitability as provided for in the [1997 Electricity Law]\",83 in their Reply, the Claimants put forward their Alternative Claim.84 More specifically, while still maintaining their Primary Claim, the Claimants argued that \"[i]n the event that the Tribunal were to agree that the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations were limited by Spain\u2019s concept of a 'reasonable return\u2019 [...] Spain still faces international liability under the ECT\",85 because it \"significantly lower[ed] the 'reasonable return\u2019\".86 The Claimants contend that, even on the Alternative Claim, they suffered significant damages.87\n\nReply, para. 585, quoting SoD, para. 744.\n\nSee Reply, paras. 583-591. See also Brattle's Third Expert Report, para. 201.\n\nReply, para. 585.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 591.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 591 (\"Even on the Alternative Claim, Brattle explains that, the Claimants have either suffered damages that are 'even higher than when simply comparing the remuneration of existing plants' to the tariff offered by the old regime (i.e. the Claimants' Primary Claim); or, in the alternative, 'would be less than associated with the PV Investors' Primary Claim, but would still be substantial.'\" (internal footnotes omitted, emphasis removed, discussing Brattle's Third Expert Report, paras. 208-209)).\n\n217.\n\nSpain disagrees. In response to the Alternative Claim, Spain contends that the Claimants continued to remain highly profitable and achieved the reasonable return that they could have expected at the time of their investment.\n\n**IV. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n218.\n\nAlso in light of these developments, the Parties\u2019 requests for relief have evolved in the course of the proceedings.\n\n**A. The Claimants' Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n[T]hat the Tribunal enter an Award in their favour and against the Respondent as follows:\n\n(a) declaring that Spain has violated Article 10 of the ECT, as well as its obligations under international law;\n\n(b) (i) requiring that Spain provides full restitution to the Claimants by reinstating the legal framework in place at the time the Claimants made their investments in its territory and compensating the Claimants for their losses suffered prior to such reinstatement; or (ii) directing Spain to pay full compensation to the Claimants for the losses they have suffered as a result of Spain's breaches of the ECT, including pre-award interest (in both cases, with compensation to be quantified in the next phase);\n\n(c) directing Spain to pay all the costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and of any potential institutional costs, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Claimants, including the fees of their legal counsel, experts and consultants and those of the Claimants' own employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate from the date on which such costs are incurred to the date of payment;\n\n(d) directing Spain to pay post-award interest, compounded monthly, on the amounts awarded until full payment thereof (with the relevant interest rate to be set in the next phase); and\n\n(e) such other relief as the arbitral tribunal may deem just and proper.88\n\nReply, para. 661. See also C-PHB1, para. 352 (requesting \"that the Tribunal enter an Award in their favour and against the Respondent as set out in the Reply\"); C-PHB2, para. 106 (requesting \"that the Tribunal enter an Award in their favour as set out in the Reply\").\n\n220.\n\nIn their latest brief, the PO12 C-PHB2, the Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n[T]hat the Tribunal enter an award in their favour and against the Kingdom of Spain as follows:\n\n(a) DECLARING that the Kingdom of Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT; and\n\n(b) ORDERING the Kingdom of Spain to:\n\n(i) pay the Claimants compensation for all losses suffered as a result of Spain's breaches of the ECT, in the amount specified for each of the Claimants in the present submission; and\n\n(ii) pay the Claimants pre-award and post-award interest until full payment of the award is made; and\n\n(iii) pay the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the PCA, the fees and expenses relating to the Claimants' legal representation, and the fees and expenses of any expert appointed by the Claimants, plus interest;\n\n(c) AWARDING the tax gross-up claim pursuant to any of the options listed at paragraph 189 above;\n\n(d) AWARDING such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.89\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 386.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nIn their R-PHB1, the Respondent sought the following relief:\n\nSpain respectfully asks the Tribunal to:\n\na) Reject the claims made by Claimants with respect to the merits on the basis that Spain has not in any way breached the ECT; and\n\nb) In addition, to reject the restitution and compensation claims made in paragraph 661 of Claimants' Reply;\n\nc) That Claimants be ordered to pay all costs and expenses arising out of this arbitration, including the administrative expenses incurred by the PCA, the fees of the arbitrators and fees of the legal representatives of Spain, its experts and advisors including interest from the date on which the said costs were generated until the date of their effective payment; and\n\nd) Reject any and all claims made by Claimants and referred to either in paragraph 505 of their Amended Statement of Case or 661 of their Reply, or subsequently during the course of these proceedings.90\n\nR-PHB1, para. 380. See also Rejoinder, paras. 1196-1197.\n\n222.\n\nIn their final brief, the PO12 R-PHB2, the Respondent requested the following relief:\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, Spain respectfully requests the Tribunal to:\n\na) Reject any and all claims made by Claimants;\n\nb) Consequently, dismiss all liability claims and terminate the proceedings;\n\nc) Order Claimants to pay all costs and expenses arising out of this arbitration, including the administrative expenses incurred by the PCA, the fees of the arbitrators and fees of the legal representatives of Spain, its experts and advisors including interest from the date on which the said costs were generated until the date of their effective payment.91\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 427. See also Quantum Rejoinder, para. 319; Quantum Counter Memorial, para. 155.\n\n223.\n\nIn the next sections, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties positions on the Primary Claim and the Alternative Claim (respectively sections V.A and V.B).\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties\u2019 positions traverse multiple rounds of submissions and have evolved significantly over the course of the proceedings. Moreover, the Parties do not always correlate their arguments and defences to those of the other side. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has organized the following sections in a manner that it considers to best reflect the Parties\u2019 positions. Where appropriate, further details on the Parties\u2019 positions are contained in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n225.\n\nSection V.A deals with the Parties\u2019 positions on the Primary Claim, while section V.B addresses their positions on the Alternative Claim.\n\n**A. The Primary Claim**\n------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' position**\n------------------------------\n\n**a.** ***Overview***\n---------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants invoke \"six independent breaches\" of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under Article 10 of the ECT:\n\na. Spain has failed to provide \"fair and equitable treatment\" (\"FET\"). The claim for breach of the FET provision rests on three distinct breaches, i.e. (i) breach of legitimate expectations; (ii) unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate measures; and (iii) lack of transparency (7(a), (c) and (d));\n\nb. Spain has failed to \"create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\" (7(b));\n\nc. Spain has impaired the Claimants\u2019 investments through \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures\" (7(e));\n\nd. Spain has failed to ensure that the Claimants\u2019 investments were afforded \"the most constant protection and security\" (7(f)).\n\n**b.** ***Investing in PV Power Generation***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimants submit that PV technology has been an attractive, but costly, RE option for many years.92 In recent years, EU Member States have applied government-backed economic incentives, also known as \"state support schemes\", to promote the use of RE by reducing its costs, increasing the price at which it is sold or otherwise increasing the volume of energy sold.93 For the Claimants, given the start-up costs of producing PV power, there would be no investment in this sector without investment incentives.94\n\nASoC, para. 63.\n\nASoC, para. 64.\n\nASoC, para. 66.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimants explain that States use a number of different support schemes to encourage investment in RE generation. One of the most important of such schemes is the FIT, which is essentially a fixed tariff set above normal market rates.95 FITs provide a guaranteed tariff over the long term permitting to recoup high upfront investments.96 While FIT systems are expected to be adapted as investment expenses go down, such adjustments can only concern new investments, which take advantage of the lower investment costs.97\n\nASoC, para. 69.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 73.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 74.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that the capital-intensive nature of PV plant development typically requires investors to raise substantial amounts of long-term debt, or project financing, to fund their investments. In project finance, the borrowers can rely on a steady stream of revenue which the asset will generate over a long period of time to service the debt. Such reliance is particularly important because of the non-recourse nature of project finance deals. The Claimants allege that most of the Claimants' installations used project finance in their development.98\n\nASoC, paras. 72, 227-233.\n\n**c.** ***Background of Spain's Electricity Sector***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the 1997 Electricity Law granted Special Regime generators priority access to the Spanish electricity transmission and distribution network. This meant that ordinary regime generators could not sell their electricity to the distribution grid until Special Regime generators had sold all their supply.99 The Claimants submit that for them such priority access to the grid was a key attraction of Spain's regulatory framework.100\n\nASoC, para. 88, discussing the 1997 Electricity Law, **Exh. C-16**, Article 30.2(b).\n\nASoC, para. 88.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that Spain's active efforts to attract foreign investment in RE was the product of (i) binding EU obligations to meet RE consumption targets arising in particular from the UNCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, and (ii) the new Government's objective to present Spain as a global leader in green energy. They also stress that Spain does not dispute that its international commitments were a key driver behind its actions to promote and encourage investments in RE power generation installations, including PV plants.101\n\nReply, paras. 32 *et seq.*\n\n232.\n\nIn particular, among the EU instruments that the Claimants allege required Spain to reach certain RE targets, the Claimants discuss the 2001 EU Directive for the Promotion of the Use of Energy From Renewable Resources (the \"2001 Renewable Energy Directive\");102 various reports and communications from the European Commission;103 and the 2009 Directive on the promotion and use of energy from renewable sources, amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (the \"2009 Renewable Energy Directive\").104\n\nASoC, paras. 105-115, discussing Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001, on the Promotion of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market, **Exh.

C-93**.\n\nASoC, paras. 119-121.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Spain\u2019s EU-mandated duty to build RE capacity was taken up with enthusiasm by the Government of Prime Minister Zapatero that came to power in 2004.105 This was not only because the Government wanted to meet the EU obligation but because Spain viewed RE production as a means of transforming its economy, by reducing reliance on foreign energy supply, becoming a net exporter of energy, and creating jobs. Consequently, the new Government\u2019s economic policy was focused on the construction of green infrastructure and the creation of green jobs.106 In furtherance of this policy, the Government set about providing investors with incentives for building RE capacity.\n\nAsoC, paras. 122-130.\n\nAsoC, para. 124.\n\n234.\n\nAgainst that background, so the Claimants argue, on 12 March 2004, Spain enacted RD 436/2004.107 According to the Claimants, RD 436/2004 introduced for the first time an incentive system based on a lifetime FIT, replacing the previous scheme, which had provided that RE could be sold at market prices plus a premium.108 For the Claimants, Spain \"introduced a stabilisation commitment aimed at creating the desired long term stability that was necessary to attract investment\".109 This said, the Claimants specify that the RD 436/2004 FIT was originally subject to fluctuations linked to changes of consumer tariffs, which entailed a lack of predictability, resulting in turn in a lack of investment.110 This flaw was remedied in 2006, through the \"freezing\" of the consumer tariff pursuant to Royal Decree Law No. 7/2006.111 Yet, even these actions did not generate the expected level of investment.112 It therefore became necessary to consider enhancements in the incentives provided.\n\nASoC, para. 131; RD 436/2004, **Exh. C-19**.\n\nASoC, paras. 133-135, referring to RD 436/2004, **Exh. C-19,** Article 22.\n\nReply, para. 36, discussing in particular RD 436/2004, **Exh.

After analysing the barriers to PV development, the PER 2005-2010 recommended that the Spanish electricity regulators maintain the regulated remuneration for PV installations; continue to grant such remuneration for the lifetime of a PV installation in order to attract project finance, and that Spain increase its PV installed capacity targets by an additional 363 MW (from the target of 135 MW set under RD 436/2004).114 The Claimants contend that the PER 2005-2010 demonstrates Spain\u2019s awareness that development of the PV sector would require a long-term and stable cash flow through the FIT.\n\nPER 2005-2010, **Exh. C-3**.\n\nASoC, paras. 139-148.\n\n236.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the ensuing RD 661/2007 finds its roots in these recommendations.115\n\nASoC, paras. 139, 149.\n\n**d.** ***RD 661/2007 and the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations as to its continued application***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, in enacting RD 661/2007, Spain was implementing the recommendations contained in the PER 2005-2010 and seeking to induce further investments into its RE sector, given that previous regimes had failed to attract sufficient investments.116 The enactment of RD 661/2007 marked a change from the incentives provided by RD 436/2004.117\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 71-72.\n\nASoC, para. 131.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they made their investments in reliance on the incentives contained in RD 661/2007. In particular, they expected that they would be entitled to sell all the electricity produced by their PV plants at the FIT provided in RD 661/2007. Moreover, due to the express \"stabilization commitment\" contained in Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007, the Claimants further expected that any future changes to the FIT regime would only apply to new installations and not to those that already qualified under RD 661/2007.\n\n**i.** ***RD 661/2007 conferred an economic right upon the Claimants***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants submit that RD 661/2007 granted qualifying PV installations an \"immutable economic right\" to, *inter alia,* a fixed premium indexed on inflation for all of the electricity generated by their PV facilities during the entire operational lifetime.118 They argue that, when commenting on the draft of RD 661/2007, the National Commission of Energy (\"CNE\") had stressed the importance of \"regulatory stability to recover investments, maintaining regulated tariffs during the service life of existing facilities (with a transparent annual adjustment mechanism)\".119\n\nASoC, paras. 149-150.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 83, quoting National Energy Commission Report 3/2007 of 14 February 2007 on the proposal for a Royal Decree regulating the activity of electricity production under the special regime and certain facilities of technologies which can be assimilated to the ordinary regime, **Exh. R-62**, p. 25.\n\n240.\n\nOnce a PV plant had registered with the RAIPRE through the relevant Autonomous Community where the PV plant was located within a one-year period (i.e. prior to 29 September 2008), it was entitled to receive all the economic incentives of RD 661/2007, including and especially the FIT.120 The Claimants submit that each of the Claimants\u2019 individual plants received a government resolution confirming their specific entitlement to the RD 661/2007 FIT, which fact is not disputed by Spain.121\n\nASoC, paras. 157-158. See also C-PHB1, paras. 99-101, discussing RD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 17, entitled \"Rights of producers under the special regime\", which provides in its subparagraph c) that \"[t]he right to receive the regulated tariff, or if appropriate the premium, shall be subject to final registration of the facility in the Register of production facilities under the special regime of the General Directorate of Energy Policy and Mines, prior to the final date set out in Article 22\" (\"El derecho a la percepci\u00f3n de la tarifa regulada, o en su caso, prima, estar\u00e1 supeditada a la inscripci\u00f3n definitiva de la instalaci\u00f3n en el Registro de instalaciones de producci\u00f3n en r\u00e9gimen especial dependiente de la Direcci\u00f3n General de Pol\u00edtica Energ\u00e9tica y Minas, con anterioridad a la fecha l\u00edmite establecida en el art\u00edculo 22\"). The Claimants further note that Article 17 of RD 661/2007 only subjects the rights set out therein to Article 30.2 of the Electricity Law, and not to Article 30.4 (on which, according to the Claimants, Spain relies to justify the changes based on the reasonable return concept). See C-PHB1, para. 101.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 106; Reply, para. 38.\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that RD 661/2007 set no limit to the quantities of electricity entitled to the FIT. The FIT was owed for the operational life of the plant, i.e. 25-40 years.122 Specifically, each plant would receive the FIT at a particular rate depending on its capacity during its first 25 years of operation. Thereafter, the FIT would continue at a lower rate for the remaining life of the plant.123 The RD 661/2007 regime also implied that electricity distributors were required to buy all the electricity produced by PV installations at the FIT, the latter thus having priority over producers in the ordinary regime.124 More importantly, while the Claimants recognize that RD 661/2007 did not provide a perpetual tariff, they insist that any tariff adjustments would only apply to new investments.125\n\nASoC, para. 63.\n\nASoC, para. 161.\n\nASoC, para. 163.\n\nASoC, paras. 164-166; Reply, paras. 41-42.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimants stress that none of them would have made the investments had they believed that the PV investment framework was subject to changes that could affect existing investments.126\n\nASoC, para. 219.\n\n243.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 submission that RD 661/2007 conferred upon duly-registered installations a guaranteed right comprising of \"(i) the ability to sell all of an installation's electricity output; (ii) at a fixed FIT rate; (iii) billed and collected on a monthly basis; (iv) revised yearly for inflation; (v) for the lifetime of the installation; (vi) without any review or alteration to the FIT rate or term\".127 This is demonstrated by the text of the decree;128 by the fact that it provided qualifying PV installations with a FIT for the lifetime of the installation;129 by the benefits it bestowed upon qualifying installations; and by the fact that the review process for the RD 661/2007 FITs would commence in 2010, without affecting installations already holding timely RAIPRE certificates.130 In addition, Article 44.1 of RD 661/2007 established a mechanism to update the FIT in order to account for inflation.131\n\nASoC, para. 169.\n\nASoC, para. 171(a), referring to RD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 17.\n\nASoC, para. 171(b), referring to RD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 36.\n\nASoC, para. 171(c), referring to RD 661/2007, **Exh.

C-35**, Article 44.1.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants have emphasized the relevance of two provisions in RD 661/2007, Article 22 *(infra* at ((a)) and Article 44.3 *(infra* at (b)). They have also asserted that RD 1578/2008, a regulation issued after RD 661/2007, strengthened their expectations and confirmed that Spain shared these expectations at the time *(infra* at (c)).\n\n(a) The \"tariff window\" in Article 22\n-------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants indicate that RD 661/2007 did not intend to apply the Article 36 FITs to all future facilities. Rather, in accordance with Article 22, as soon as 85% of the production target for any energy group or sub-group had been reached, the Secretary General for Energy was to set a period within which facilities had to obtain final RAIPRE registration in order to be entitled to the tariffs under RD 661/2007. This registration period could be no less than 12 months.132 The Secretary General for Energy issued the resolution on 29 September 2007, confirming that FITs under RD 661/2007 would apply as long as a facility was registered prior to 29 September 2008, i.e. the end of the tariff window.133\n\nC-PHB1, para. 95.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 95-97 discussing Resolution of the Secretariat General for Energy, Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Trade (published on 29 September 2007), **Exh. R-25**. See also C-PHB1, para. 97, discussing CNE Report, **Exh. C-505**, which notes (at p. 3) (Spanish version) that \"the Secretary-General issued a Decision establishing that the current regulated tariff for photovoltaic plants definitely registered before the 30th of September 2008 would be maintained\".\n\n246.\n\nFor the Claimants, Article 22 would be devoid of meaning if Spain had remained free to change the FIT subsequently in respect of existing facilities. Similarly, it would serve no purpose for the Secretary General to set a final registration date under RD 661/2007.134\n\nC-PHB1, para. 98.\n\n(b) Interpretation of Article 44.3\n----------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants further invoke Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 (reproduced *supra* at para. 194) in support of their argument that the FIT regime provided in RD 661/2007 was not subject to changes with respect to existing investments.\n\n248.\n\nAccordingly, so say the Claimants, a review of the FITs would be carried out in 2010, at the end of the planning period set out in the PER 2005-2010 when Spain anticipated that it would reach its capacity goals, and thereafter every four years. The success of RD 661/2007 in prompting investments in the PV sector resulted in that review taking place in 2008.135 However, Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 made it clear that any revisions stemming from these reviews would not apply to existing installations.136\n\nASoC, para. 164.\n\nASoC, para. 165, discussing RD 661/2007, **Exh.

However, according to the Claimants, Spain subsequently abandoned this review process by implementing the Disputed Measures.139\n\nC-PHB1, para. 85, discussing CNE Report entitled \"Report on the Proposal for a Royal Decree to regulate and modify certain aspects relating to the Special Regime\" dated 14 September 2010, **Exh.

Thus, like Article 44.3, that provision aimed at providing certainty to investors by informing them that a new payment system for PV may be set in 2012 affecting newly built plants registered after that date.148\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 151-152.\n\n**ii.** ***RD 661/2007 was designed to attract third party financing***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants further highlight that RD 661/2007 was designed to attract third party financing.149 They argue that this is obvious from the design of RD 661/2007, which provided that qualifying PV installations be paid on a monthly basis through invoices issued by the CNE, which were then paid by electricity distributors, thus allowing investors to manage their cash flow in a predictable way.150 The design of the FIT also matched the needs of project finance loans, which typically have a term of 18 to 25 years.151 Further, the PER 2005-2010 acknowledged that approximately 77% of RE investment would be financed by long-term loans from third party lenders.152 In sum, RD 661/2007 was \"well suited to recovering invested capital, obtaining a return on invested capital, *and* attracting the necessary financing for major investment\".153\n\nASoC, paras. 175-180.\n\nASoC, para. 177.\n\nASoC, para. 178.\n\nASoC, para. 176.\n\nASoC, para. 175.\n\n**iii.** ***Spain actively encouraged foreign investment in the PV sector and made repeated representations on the economic regime of RD 661/2007***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that Spain actively encouraged foreign investment into its PV sector through advertising materials, including English-language brochures and presentations, emphasizing the stability of its investment framework and the nature of the investment incentives that its regulations offered.154 The Claimants have in particular discussed the following documents (both pre-dating and post-dating the enactment of RD 661/2007):155\n\na.

They add that, as a direct result of RD 661/2007, Spain hit the 85% threshold in a matter of months, in August 2007. As a consequence, Spain announced on 27 September 2007 that the time limit for RD 661/2007 registrations would expire on 29 September 2008.172\n\nASoC, paras. 205-212.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, the Claimants agree with Spain that the announcement of 27 September 2007 set off a \"race\", motivating investors to invest in the PV Sector before the deadline. According to the Claimants, the obvious implications of such a \"race\" is that \"everybody in the market, including all reasonable investors, understood that installations that met the deadline [...] would lock in the right to receive the RD 661/2007 FIT\".173\n\nReply, para. 44.\n\n**f.** ***The Disputed Measures***\n----------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Spain frustrated their legitimate expectations that the RD 661/2007 regime would remain stable by enacting a number of measures, which curtailed the incentives under RD 661/2007 and then withdrew them entirely.\n\n**i.** ***The 2010 Measures***\n------------------------------\n\n(a) RD 1565/2010\n----------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimants argue that RD 1565/2010174 eliminated the right of PV installations to receive the FIT for their entire life, limiting the FIT to the first 25 years of operation.175 This substantially reduced the revenues that investors could have realized as promised under RD 661/2007. Furthermore, RD 1565/2010 augured a new era of regulatory instability and was the first indication that Spain would ignore the key promises it had made to investors when promoting its FIT regime.176\n\nRDL 1565/2010, **Exh. C-152**.\n\nASoC, para. 246.\n\nASoC, para. 38.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimants reject Spain's formalistic argument that RD 1565/2010 does not contravene the literal wording of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 because the latter provision refers to \"the reviews to this sub-section of regulated tariff\" and not to a review of the duration during which the tariff would apply.177 Cutting the number of years during which a tariff applies has the same economic effect as cutting the tariff itself.178\n\nReply, para. 218, discussing SoD, paras. 330-331.\n\nReply, para. 219.\n\n(b) RDL 14/2010\n---------------\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimants contend that RDL 14/2010179 placed two separate caps on the number of hours during which PV installations could access the RD 661/2007 FIT.180\n\nRDL 14/2010, **Exh. C-154**.\n\nASoC, paras. 251-270.\n\n266.\n\nFirst, RDL 14/2010 placed a transitory cap lasting from 1 January 2011 until the end of 2013.181 The Claimants allege that this was a drastic change, as under RD 661/2007, a PV installation was paid for its full electricity production during the entire calendar year.182 That transitory cap also failed to take account of regional differences, which resulted in a disproportionate impact on the more efficient PV plants located in sunnier regions.183 Once a PV installation reached its cap for the year, it was required to sell its additional production into the wholesale electricity pool at market rates, like conventional power generators in the ordinary regime (although still with priority of dispatch).184\n\nASoC, para. 252.\n\nASoC, para. 253.\n\nASoC, para. 256.\n\nASoC, para. 257.\n\n267.\n\nSecond, upon its expiry in 2013, the transitory cap was replaced by a permanent one for the remainder of the FIT entitlement of PV installation (which was extended to 28 years under RDL 14/2014 and to 30 years by Law 2/2011).185\n\nASoC, para. 258.\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, while the transitory cap of RDL 14/2010 applied, they experienced a dramatic reduction in the production of FIT eligible electricity. As a consequence, their cash flows dropped and the uncertainty facing the investments increased.186 They refute Spain's argument that, because the PER 2005-2010 contained estimates of the number of operating hours for PV installations (on the basis of which Spain determined the FIT), PV investors should have reasonably expected that there could be a reduction in the operating hours for which they would be entitled to the FIT.187 They submit that the RD 661/2007 FIT applied to every kilowatt hour of electricity and not only for the hours estimated in the PER 2005-2010 (on which the FIT was based).188\n\nASoC, paras. 266-267, discussing Brattle's Second Expert Report, paras. 67, 72.\n\nReply, paras. 224-227, discussing SoD, para. 342.\n\nReply, para. 227.\n\n269.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 further submission that, through a series of regulations, including RDL 14/2010, Spain acknowledged the harm it had caused to PV investors and attempted to compensate for that harm, which however was ineffective.189 For the Claimants, these attempts at compensation showed the seriousness of the harmful measures that Spain had enacted in RDL 14/2010, as well as the unreasonableness of its seemingly improvised and arbitrary regulatory actions.190\n\nASoC, paras. 271-277.\n\nASoC, para. 271.\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants point to RDL 14/2010 extending the right of access of the PV installations to the RD 661/2007 FIT from 25 to 28 years.191 The three-year extension was at the original, higher FIT rate, but still subject to the permanent caps.192 The Claimants\u2019 position is that thereby Spain reinstated a small portion of what it had taken away by enacting RD 1565/2010.193\n\nASoC, paras. 272-273, discussing RDL 14/2010, **Exh.

Moreover, they caused a reduction in the value and potential resale value of the Claimants\u2019 assets.\n\n**ii.** ***Law 15/2012***\n-------------------------\n\n273.\n\nOn 27 December 2012, Spain passed Law 15/2012, imposing a 7% levy on income obtained by generators, renewable or otherwise.196\n\nLaw 15/2012 of 27 December 2012, concerning Tax Measures to Ensure Energy Sustainability (published on 28 December 2012) (\"Law 15/2012\"), **Exh. C-300**.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that although they \"are not bringing any claims with respect to damages suffered as a result of the 7% levy\", this measure is \"part of the factual background of the dispute, providing additional details of the array of measures the PV Investors were subject to during recent years\".197\n\nASoC, para. 239.\n\n275.\n\nFor the Claimants, this 7% levy amounts to a disguised tariff cut for RE installations and an additional limitation to the RD 661/2007 regime. As such, it cannot be regarded as *bona fide* taxation of general application.198 The fact that the levy is in reality a tariff cut presented in the form of a \"tax\" is confirmed by statements from the then Minister for Industry Jose Manuel Soria.199\n\nAsoC, para. 236; Reply, para. 229.\n\nReply, paras. 230-233, discussing Patricia Carmona & Javier Mesones, Interview with the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism, *La Gaceta*, 14 October 2012, **Exh.

This is because the former operate in a regulated regime and cannot pass on the 7% levy to the consumers, whereas the latter can do so at least in part when selling electricity in the open market.200\n\nASoC, para. 236; Reply, paras. 229, 234.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the damage caused by the 7% levy is now subsumed within the more substantial damage caused by the New Regime. The 7% levy may be considered neutral within the framework of the New Regime, but it is \"not neutral to installations that qualified under the RD 661/2007 economic regime, where the 7% Levy was not in place\".201\n\nReply, para. 237.\n\n278.\n\nShortly after the enactment of Law 15/2012, Spain adopted additional measures which limited the Claimants\u2019 right to deduct certain financial expenses from the application of corporate income tax.202\n\nASoC, para. 238, discussing Law 16/2012 of 27 December 2012, on Tax Measures for the Consolidation of Public Finances and the Boost of Economic Activity (published on 28 December 2012), **Exh.

Unlike the FIT, which is *solely* based on energy production, this system is only based in part on energy production, and is calculated by reference to the Government\u2019s \"standard installation\", which bears no resemblance to the Claimants\u2019 PV plants.216\n\nASoC, para. 282.\n\nASoC, para. 284(a), discussing Brattle's Second Expert Report, paras. 108-110.\n\n283.\n\nFurther, the amount of the Special Payment \"will not go beyond the minimum level necessary\" to provide what the Government considers to be a \"reasonable return\".217 This concept, so the Claimants submit, no longer operates as a \"floor\" but rather as a cap to the Special Payment.218 The \"reasonable return\", measured by reference to the 10-year Spanish sovereign bonds plus a differential (300 base points in the case of existing facilities), is set at 7,398%.219 This return is calculated over the deemed regulatory life of the plant, i.e. 30 years, is computed pre-tax and takes account of the remuneration obtained under RD 661/2007.220\n\nASoC, para. 284(b), citing to RDL 9/2013, **Exh. C-302**, Article 1(2).\n\nASoC, para. 284(b).\n\nASoC, para. 241(d).\n\nReply, para. 249(c).\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that, under the New Regime, returns achieved under RD 661/2007 in excess of the reasonable return defined in RDL 9/2013 will be deducted from payments to be received in the future. In other words, this measure is fully retroactive as it claws back payments under the old regime.221 The Claimants note that Spain does not dispute that the New Regime \"claws back\" past revenues by offsetting future ones.222\n\nReply, para. 249(c).\n\nC-PHB2, para. 58.\n\n285.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants emphasize that the Special Payment is subject to governmental discretion and its parameters may be changed \"every six years\", which makes the operation of PV plants highly uncertain.223\n\nASoC, para. 284(c); Reply, para. 246.\n\n(c) Law 24/2013\n---------------\n\n286.\n\nOn 26 December 2013, the Spanish Parliament approved Law 24/2013,224 which, so say the Claimants, introduced further harmful measures.225 In particular, such law removed the distinction between Ordinary and Special Regimes; it placed conventional and RE generators on an equal footing, depriving the latter of the unconditional priority access to the grid and dispatch.226 It also imposed on renewable installations the obligation to finance the accrued tariff deficit, i.e., the imbalance between revenues and costs in the electricity system.227\n\nLaw 24/2013, **Exh. C-303**.\n\nASoC, paras. 285-286.\n\nASoC, paras. 285, 300-301.\n\nASoC, paras. 285, 302-304. The Claimants explain that renewable energy installations are meant to receive monthly assessments with the total amount of the Special Payment, but they only receive the full Special Payment if there are sufficient revenues in the Electricity System. That is to say, the Government only pays the Special Payment to otherwise qualifying generators if the State (the Electricity System) has sufficient funds to do so. Otherwise, the renewable energy generator only receives a partial monthly payment with the possibility of recovering outstanding amounts later on during the year. If at the end of the year the Government remains unable to pay the total amount of the Special Payment to the renewable energy generator, the outstanding amount becomes part of the Tariff Deficit and the renewable energy generator will no longer recover the amounts in question (ASoC, para. 303, discussing Law 24/2013, **Exh. C-303**, Articles 19, 25.2).\n\n287.\n\nThe following months, the Claimants argue, were characterized by complete uncertainty as neither RDL 9/2013 nor Law 24/2013 defined the precise terms of the New Regime.228 The Claimants refer to this period from July 2013 to June 2014 as the \"Transitory Period\".\n\nASoC, paras. 286-287.\n\n(d) RD 413/2014 and the Order on Parameters\n-------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nOn 6 June 2014, the Government passed RD 413/2014229 and on 16 June 2014 the Order on Parameters,230 which specified the economic regime for the different RE installations, including PV plants.\n\nRD 413/2014, **Exh. C-304**.\n\nOrder on Parameters, **Exh. C-305**.\n\n(e) Content of the New Regime\n-----------------------------\n\n289.\n\nFor the Claimants, the New Regime represents a complete overhaul of the FIT regime under RD 661/2007, as a result of which the Claimants\u2019 installations were placed in a position much worse than under RD 661/2007. The New Regime undermines the very foundation on which the Claimants made their investments, namely a stable and predictable revenue stream at levels sufficient to service the debt, provide a return on investment, and justify the significant risks incurred.231\n\nReply, para. 251.\n\n290.\n\nThe Special Payment is composed of a remuneration per MW of installed capacity and a remuneration per MWh of electricity produced, seeking to cover the operating costs that cannot be met by market prices.232 It is also subject to certain thresholds of operating hours.233\n\nASoC, para. 291(b), discussing RDL 9/2013, **Exh.

C-304**, Article 21.4.\n\n291.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimants submit that the New Regime negatively affects their investments in three main ways. First, Spain\u2019s \"repudiation\" of the RD 661/2007 economic regime results in a significant reduction of cash flows, because the PV projects no longer enjoy the FIT234 and the Special Payment is only payable if the electricity system generates sufficient revenues.235 Second, the Claimants argue that the new terms deprive them of incentives to maximize day-to-day production throughout the year.236 Third, the PV projects face increased financial, operational and regulatory risks.237 The loss of the FIT has in particular affected the investors\u2019 \"ability to meet their debt obligations, which has manifested itself differently across the Claimants' projects\".238\n\nASoC, paras. 309-311; see also Reply, paras. 45, 561.\n\nASoC, para. 313.\n\nASoC, para. 315, discussing Brattle's Second Expert Report, para. 138.\n\nASoC, para. 317.\n\nASoC, paras. 54, 318 *et seq*.\n\n292.\n\nUnlike what Spain argues, the Claimants deny that the New Regime provides them with a \"reasonable return\".239 First, the 7,398% return is pre-tax rate, i.e. equivalent to 5,179% after tax.240 Moreover, it operates as a cap on returns.241 Second, Spain contradicts itself when it argues, on the one hand, that producers may obtain higher returns if they beat the parameters of the standard installations, and, on the other hand, that such higher returns were objectionable under RD 661/2007.242 Third, the concept of reasonable return itself is subject to change in light of the broad discretion left to the Government.243 Finally, the Claimants challenge the transparency of the implementation of the New Regime. The Transitory Period left PV investors in the dark as to the precise level of remuneration for existing installations.244 In support, they point to a statement made by the European Commission in July 2015 noting the legal uncertainty created by the Transitory Period.245 In this context, the Claimants also observe that the Government ultimately used its own parameters to calculate the Special Payment, notwithstanding the fact that it had instructed two independent consultancy firms, Roland Berger and Boston Consulting Group, to assist in the determination of the Special Payment.246 The Claimants further complain that the PV industry was not consulted about the parameters of the New Regime.247\n\nReply, paras. 252-261.\n\nReply, para. 253.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 31, discussing Law 24/2013, **Exh.

Customary international law principles, although relevant, only apply where the ECT is silent and therefore are a secondary source of substantive law.248\n\nASoC, paras. 382-386.\n\n295.\n\nThe ECT, being an international treaty, \"must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning given to its terms in their context and in light of the ECT's object and purpose\".249 The Claimants submit that investments in the energy sector involve high-value long-term commitments in projects that cannot easily adapt to the vagaries of legal and political changes. Consequently, the ECT\u2019s fundamental objective is \"to facilitate transactions and investments in the energy sector by reducing political and regulatory risks\".250 According to the Claimants, the ECT seeks to accomplish this objective in two ways. First, by requiring Contracting States to maintain a stable, predictable and transparent legal and regulatory investment framework. Second, by offering more robust levels of protection than ordinary bilateral investment treaties,251 subject to very few exceptions with respect to a host State\u2019s right to regulate.252\n\nASoC, para. 389, discussing the application of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, 1155 UNTS 331 (\"VCLT\").\n\nASoC, para. 395.\n\nASoC, paras. 395-396, 398.\n\nASoC, paras. 404-405.\n\n296.\n\nFor the Claimants, a central tenet of Spain\u2019s obligation \"to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment\" is to refrain from conduct that defeats the legitimate expectations on which an investor relied at the time of making its investment.253 In order to determine whether legitimate expectations have been created, the Claimants submit that regard must be had to the conduct of the host State, including (i) the legal order of the host State at the time when the investment was made *(inter alia* \"legislation and treaties, and assurances contained in decrees, licences and similar executive assurances or undertakings\");254 and (ii) \"any undertakings or representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host State\".255\n\nASoC, para. 430, citing *Saluka Investments B.V. v.

Specifically, they expected that their projects would be entitled to the economic incentives promised by RD 661/2007 for their entire operational lifetime and that any future revisions to these incentives would not affect their investments.256 This expectation was created by (i) the explicit guarantees and assurances made by Spain in the text of RD 661/2007 (on which see *supra* V.A.1.d) and (ii) the numerous public statements made by Spain and various entities, regarding the application of the regime. Moreover, these expectations were shared by other investors in the RE sector, as well as lenders, legal advisors and energy consultants.257\n\nASoC, paras. 440-442; Reply, para. 493.\n\nReply, para. 493.\n\n298.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Spain gave rise and reinforced the Claimants\u2019 expectations by making repeated statements regarding the stability of the legal regime during the period in which the Claimants invested. That apart, various Government entities and officials - such as IDAE, CNE/CNMC and InvestInSpain - made numerous representations to the same effect both before and after the approval of RD 661/2007, which confirm the legitimacy of the Claimants\u2019 expectations (set out in detail at Section V.A.1.d.iii above).258 According to the Claimants, these representations \"estop Spain from now claiming that it reserved the right to dismantle the RD 661/2007 regime\".259\n\nSee also, C-PHB1, paras. 88-89.\n\nReply, paras. 68, 521-523.\n\n299.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants contend that the statements made by various Governmental entities - specifically CNE, CNMC,260 IDAE and InvestInSpain - are attributable to Spain.261 In this respect, they argue that the relevant actions of CNE / CNMC, IDAE and InvestInSpain are attributable to Spain pursuant to Article 4 of the International Law Commission Draft Articles on State Responsibility (\"ILC Articles\"), as these entities qualify as organs of the State.262 In the alternative, the Claimants submit that CNE / CNMC's actions are attributable to Spain pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, because these entities were empowered to and did exercise governmental functions.263 In the further alternative, the Claimants argue that the acts of CNE, CNMC, IDAE and InvestInSpain are attributable to Spain under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, i.e. these entities acted in accordance with Spain's instructions or under its direction and control.264\n\nThe Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia, which succeeded the CNE in 2013.\n\nSee, ASoC, paras. 407 *ff* ; Reply, para. 424, discussing the ILC Articles, **Exh.

The Claimants submitted that pursuant to Article 22 of the ECT, if Spain entrusts an entity with regulatory, administrative or governmental authority, then that entity is also required act consistently with the ECT when exercising such authority. In this connection, the Claimants submit that, \"when considering a breach of the ECT, the conduct of State entities and Spain's obligations under Part III [of the ECT] must be assessed together. [\u2026] It is therefore logical to determine the issue with reference to the Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts\".

They refer to other investors,265 such as Iberdrola;266 legal advisors instructed by the Claimants;267 lenders involved in the financing of RE projects in Spain;268 and Grant Greatrex, one of Spain\u2019s experts in this arbitration.269\n\nReply, paras. 85-91.\n\nReply, paras. 86-88, discussing Iberdrola, Presentation on \"Renewable Energies in Spain: New Regulation (RD 661/2007)\", 29 May 2007, **Exh.

However, in disregard of these expectations, Spain enacted the measures that fundamentally altered, and subsequently withdrew, the legal and regulatory framework on which the Claimants had relied to make their investment. The Claimants\u2019 arguments on the effects of the Disputed Measures are summarized in Section V.A.1.f above. According to the Claimants, this overhaul of the economic incentives regime, constitutes a clear violation of Spain\u2019s FET obligation under the ECT.270\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 182-187, relying extensively on the decision in *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v.

It is readily apparent, the Claimants say, that the Disputed Measures did not meet this threshold.277\n\nReply, paras. 619-620.\n\n307.\n\nFirst, each of the Disputed Measures was unreasonable because they imposed retroactive incentive cuts for existing investments. According to the Claimants, given the nature of investments in PV installations (requiring large upfront capital expenses and relying on debt financing), a long term FIT was necessary to enable the Claimants to service their debt and receive a return on their investment, with the result that a significant cut in the FIT, wiping out the return and making it impossible to recoup initial expenses, was unreasonable.278\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 203-204.\n\n308.\n\nSecond, the Disputed Measures were not tailored to meet stated policy goals:\n\na. No specific explanation or rationale was provided for RD 1565/2010. To the extent the measure sought to address the \"growth in recent years in the number of electric power installations within the Special Regime\" and \"additional technical requisites\" needed to guarantee the operation of the electricity system and facilitate the growth of RE technologies, the Claimants consider that the decrease of the FIT effected by RD 1565/2010 was not the appropriate mechanism to achieve these goals.279\n\nb. Similarly, the severe and permanent cut to the FIT introduced by RDL 14/2010 was inappropriate to address the stated policy behind the introduction of this measure i.e. to remedy, the tariff deficit. According to RDL 14/2010, the tariff deficit was caused by the fall in electricity demand, the fluctuation in fuel prices and \"favourable weather\". The Claimants contend that all three circumstances were temporary, were not caused by the Claimants' installations, and did not alter the costs of the installations. It was therefore unreasonable to subject the Claimants' investments to a cut in the FIT on this basis.280\n\nc. Further, the cancellation of the mechanism whereby the FIT indexed for inflation on the basis of the CPI was also unreasonable. This is because the index used instead provided for a lower FIT only in order to reduce the income of the existing installations.281\n\nd. Moreover, the rationale behind the New Regime was unreasonable. The alleged justification for the further cut to PV tariffs in 2013 was that \"(1) 'the volume of rainfall and wind conditions have been much greater than historical averages'; and (2) there had been a 2.3% fall in electricity demand\".282 The Claimants explain that PV installations were protected against a demand risk because they had priority access to the transmission grid. Accordingly, a reduction in demand (which is in any event, temporary) cannot justify the permanent abolition of a regulatory regime. That apart, say the Claimants, \"it is absurd to change a long-term guaranteed FIT regime because the weather has changed\", especially when an increase in rainfall would reduce the amount of PV energy produced.283 Additionally, the New Measures were not implemented with due regard to the impact on existing investors.284 Finally, assuming that the policy rationale behind the New Measures was justified, the CNE had recommended a suit of proposals to address the tariff deficit, which were reasonable and did not affect the FITs for existing installations. In other words, it was possible to adopt other remedies that were adequately shaped to achieve the policy rationale, with more limited impact for the Claimants. However, the Government largely ignored these proposals and implemented the New Measures instead, without taking into account the devastating consequences for existing PV installations.285\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 205-206.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 207-211.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 212-213.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 215, discussing RDL 9/2013, **Exh.

In other words, measures that are not based on reason will be deemed arbitrary. On this basis, the Claimants contend that the Disputed Measures are arbitrary for the same reasons that they are unreasonable.286 For the Claimants, Spain\u2019s proposed threshold for arbitrariness is artificially high. Nevertheless, the Claimants view the Disputed Measures as arbitrary even when assessed against Spain\u2019s standard.287\n\nC-PHB1, para. 229; ASoC, paras. 465-471.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 230.\n\n310.\n\nFinally, the Disputed Measures are arbitrary for other reasons as well, in particular because:\n\na. They artificially cap the number of years for which the Claimants\u2019 PV installations will receive benefits to 30 years, when in reality, the operation life of PV plants is longer.\n\nb. The cap on the number of hours for which benefits are granted is arbitrary, as the same cap applies across Spain, without regard to the sunlight received in the different regions.\n\nc. Spain has not explained how it arrived at a target rate of return of 7,398% pre-tax, which rate is, in any event, unreasonable.288\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 235(i)-(iii).\n\n(c) The Disputed Measures are disproportionate\n----------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nA State breaches the FET standard if it adopts measures disproportionate to the aims pursued. This implies that measures must be (1) suitable; (2) necessary; and (3) proportionate to the aim pursued. The Claimants argue that the Disputed Measures satisfied none of these characteristics.289\n\nReply, para. 627; C-PHB1, para. 249; ASoC, paras. 481-482.\n\n312.\n\nThe Disputed Measures were not suitable because attacking the PV sector was not the solution to the tariff deficit problem, which existed before Spain induced the Claimants to invest and which was caused by the Spanish Government\u2019s failure to set electricity prices at a level that was sufficient to cover the costs of the system. Further, as there is no evidence that the Claimants were earning exorbitant revenues, the suitability of the Disputed Measures cannot be defended on the ground that they sought to rebalance the costs and incomes of the electricity system.290\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 250-251; Reply, paras. 628-629.\n\n313.\n\nThe Disputed Measures were not necessary; other more reasonable and less harmful measures were available to address the tariff deficit.291\n\nC-PHB1, para. 252; Reply, para. 632.\n\n314.\n\nThe Disputed Measures were not proportionate either as they have drastically reduced the Claimants\u2019 cash flows, brought their project companies to the verge of insolvency, and wiped out the returns that the Claimants ought to receive.292\n\nC-PHB1, para. 253; Reply, paras. 635-636.\n\n**iv.** ***The Disputed Measures were not transparent***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT requires a State to \"encourage and create [...] transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area\". The Claimants submit that Spain's conduct in dismantling the RD 661/2007 regime lacked transparency because (i) the 11-month Transitory Period left PV producers in the dark as to what would happen next; (ii) the criteria underlying the New Regime and future revisions were not explained; (iii) Spain could change some parameters of the standard installation without its methodology being known; (iv) neither is a methodology for reviewing the Special Payment established; and (v) similarly, there is no transparent methodology for determining whether a plant has achieved reasonable profitability.293\n\nReply, para. 604; ASoC, para. 464(a)-(f).\n\n316.\n\nIn response to Spain's contention that it acted transparently, the Claimants put forward the following:\n\na. Spain failed to consult the affected parties prior to enacting the Disputed Measures. The most significant measures, i.e. RDL 14/2010 and RDL 9/2013, were introduced without any dialogue with the PV sector. Spain's argument that these RDLs were designed for emergencies and do not allow for consultation, is an excuse.294\n\nb. Spain's reliance on reports issued by CNE in 2012 and 2013 to argue that the introduction and implementation of the New Regime was transparent is misplaced. Spain ignored the recommendations in CNE's 2012 report. Consequently, the public consultation that was undertaken for this report was \"at best pointless and at worst a sham\".295 As regards the 2013 Reports, these were issued after the New Regime was introduced by RDL 9/2013 and could not have influenced that regulation. In any event, the consultation process for these reports \"had not guaranteed the effective participation of affected parties\".296\n\nc. Similarly, the Memorandum issued by the Ministry concerning the June 2014 Ministerial Order rejected the \"619 submissions from companies, industrial associations, and Autonomous Communities\" merely on the basis that the Order complied with RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013 (both of which had been implemented without consultation).297\n\nC-PHB1, para. 242.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 243.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 244.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 242-246.\n\n317.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants assert that Spain\u2019s conduct was plainly not in conformity with the transparency requirements under the ECT.298\n\nReply, para. 615.\n\n**v.** ***The Disputed Measures have impaired the Claimants\u2019 investments***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides that Spain \"shall [not] in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures th[e] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of Claimants\u2019 investments. Thus, to establish a breach of this obligation, it suffices to show that the measures in question were either unreasonable or discriminatory. The standard of reasonableness, according to the Claimants, is that the State\u2019s conduct must bear a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.299 In other words, as with the FET standard of reasonableness discussed above, Spain must show that its measures were: (a) taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal; and (b) carefully tailored to achieve that goal.300\n\nASoC, paras. 490-491, relying on *Saluka Investments B.

CLA-22**, para. 460; C-PHB1, para. 255.\n\nASoC, para. 491.\n\n319.\n\nIn light of that standard, the Claimants reiterate the grounds on which they assert that the Disputed Measures were unreasonable. In sum, they contend that the remediation of the tariff deficit, cannot be a policy goal that justifies interference with the Claimants\u2019 investment. They submit that the tariff deficit was caused by Spain\u2019s persistent failure to set consumer prices at a level that was high enough to cover the actual costs of the Electricity System. As a consequence, enacting measures that are harmful to the PV sector to finance the result of several years of regulatory malfeasance is arbitrary and unreasonable.301\n\nASoC, para. 492; Reply, paras. 644-646.\n\n**vi.** ***The Disputed Measures violated the constant protection and security obligation***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that Spain breached the obligation to provide their investments constant protection and security. In particular, they claim as follows:\n\nThis obligation requires Spain to provide legal security to Claimants' investments. It is breached where a change in the legal framework makes it impossible for an investor to preserve and continue its rights associated with the investment. The obligation has been breached here as the Disputed Measures have caused Claimants to lose their right to the FIT.302 (internal footnote omitted)\n\nC-PHB1, para. 256; ASoC, paras. 494-497; Reply, paras. 648-652.\n\n**h.** ***Spain's defences are without merit***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Spain\u2019s defences are ill-founded and contradicted by the evidence.\n\n**i.** ***Spain's first defence: the RD 661/2007 regime was not guaranteed***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Spain\u2019s key defence is that they had no objectively reasonable expectation regarding the RD 661/2007 regime because they should have known that the incentives granted to them were subject to an overarching \"principle of reasonable profitability\" (or \"reasonable return\") found in the 1997 Electricity Law.303\n\nSee, PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 242-244; Reply, paras. 151 *et seq*.\n\n323.\n\nFor the Claimants, Spain\u2019s reliance on that principle is misplaced. The 1997 Electricity Law did not define reasonable return. It merely outlined the factors for determining the specific remuneration that would provide investors with a reasonable return. Such reasonable return had to be implemented through regulation. In RD 661/2007, Spain implemented the reasonable return principle by providing for specific remuneration in the form of a long-term FIT.304 In other words, RD 661/2007 represented what Spain considered a reasonable return in compliance with the principles of the 1997 Electricity Law at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment.305\n\nReply, paras. 151-155; C-PHB2, para. 30.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 278.\n\n324.\n\nAt the same time, the Claimants do not deny that Spain had the power to adjust the RD 661/2007 economic regime as costs of investment came down. According to the Claimants, this makes economic sense. However, as provided in Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007, any adjustments in remuneration could not affect existing installations.306\n\nReply, paras. 163-164.\n\n325.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that most countries with FITs use concepts similar to reasonable return in order to calculate FITs. However, reasonable return is a concept aimed at the regulator, not at investors; it is the basis upon which the regulator calculates the tariff. Thus, under RD 661/2007, the regulator determined what the return necessary to induce investment.307 This being so, an efficient investor with operating costs below those assumed by the regulator would earn a higher return than the one used to set the FIT. In the Claimants' view, this is perfectly admissible and even expected.308\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 277-278.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 279; Reply, paras. 167-171.\n\n**ii.** ***Spain's second defence: Spain did not make a specific commitment***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nSpain's second defence is that it made no commitment sufficiently specific to prevent it from enacting the Disputed Measures and that, absent such specific commitments, no legitimate expectations can arise. According to the Claimants, it is incorrect that legitimate expectations can only arise out of a specific commitment given by the host State to the investor, much less that such a commitment must be embodied in a contract containing a stabilization clause. While specific assurances may reinforce an investor's legitimate expectations, they are not indispensable. Guarantees included in general laws can give rise to legitimate expectations as well.309\n\nReply, paras. 507-509; CPHB1, paras. 189-191.\n\n327.\n\nFor the Claimants, \"[i]t is obvious that RD 661/2007 contained a number of express commitments on which Spain intended investors to rely\".310 First, Article 22 confirmed that installations that registered within the tariff window locked in the right to the tariff; second, Article 36 provided a specific tariff for 25 years and beyond; and third, Article 17 confirmed the right to obtain the FIT upon obtaining a RAIPRE certificate. These commitments created expectations, which were crystallised when the Claimants obtained RAIPRE certificates confirming their entitlement to the RD 661/2007 FIT. Spain reinforced such expectations by guaranteeing that changes to these incentives would not apply retroactively (under Article 44.3, which is an \"express stabilisation commitment\" according to the Claimants311) and by repeatedly confirming its intention as to the application of RD 661/2007.312 Alternatively, assuming that a specific commitment by the host State is required to generate legitimate expectations, the Claimants observe that the provisions referred to above did constitute specific promises and representations.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 182.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 186.\n\nReply, paras. 507-509; C-PHB1, para. 186.\n\n328.\n\nRefuting Spain's argument that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 is not a stablisation clause and that, in any event, it was not breached, the Claimants make the following points:\n\na. Article 44.3 is evidently a stabilisation clause as its terms were specific enough: it expressly stated that revisions to the FIT would not affect installations that had qualified before the review. Moreover, this commitment was made specifically to those installations that had obtained their RAIPRE certificates within the term prescribed.313\n\nb. Spain's argument that Article 44.3 has not been breached because the changes introduced did not constitute a \"tariff review\" but the introduction of a new remuneration format is flawed. Spain cannot get around the plain language of Article 44.3 by claiming that its actions are outside the purview of Article 44.3. This is precisely the sort of abusive and bad faith State conduct against which the FET standard protects investors.314\n\nc. Spain's further argument that Article 44.3 has not been breached because RDL 14/2010 and RDL 9/2013 did not change the numeric amount of the tariff but only introduced an hours cap and a modification of the system of remuneration, is equally flawed. Both measures had an effect comparable in magnitude to the reduction in the original FIT.315\n\nC-PHB1, para. 197.\n\nCPHB1, para. 198.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 199.\n\n**iii.** ***Spain's third defence: the Claimants' returns were capped at 7%***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nAt the outset, the Claimants submit that this defence \"is perhaps the most extravagant of all Spain's defences since it comes in two contradictory forms\": on the one hand Spain asserts that the reasonable return was capped at 7% and, on the other, it argues that the reasonable return was dynamic. According to the Claimants, neither position is supported by the evidence.316\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 261.\n\n330.\n\nThe first piece of evidence on which Spain relies to support the existence of a 7% cap is the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica.* The Claimants submit that the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* was not a public document. They cite the testimony of one of Spain's experts, Mr. Greatrex, who testified that he saw the *Memoria* for the first time in 2012.317 Moreover, for them, the statement made by Spain's other expert, Mr. Olivas, at the hearing that the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* was distributed to the RE associations was new and unsubstantiated.318 When the Claimants requested the *Memoria* as part of the regulatory dossier of RD 661/2007 during the document disclosure phase, Spain agreed to produce it without suggesting that it was publicly available (contrary to what it did in respect of other documents).319\n\nC-PHB1, para. 138; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 265, 267.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 140.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 142.\n\n331.\n\nThe Claimants add that the *Memoria* does not state that changes to RD 661/2007 will be made. It merely provides that the tariff set out in RD 661/2007 aims at providing PV investors with an after tax return of \"approximately 7%\", without suggesting that this operates as a cap.320 On the contrary, the word \"approximately\" makes clear that the *Memoria* recognized that investors could earn in excess of 7%.321\n\nC-PHB1, para. 135; C-PHB2, para. 49.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 266.\n\n332.\n\nThe second piece of evidence on which Spain relies is the PER 2005-2010. The Claimants point out that the reference to 7% in the PER 2005-2010 relates to *all* RE technologies and not just the PV sector. Moreover, the PER also refers to returns of \"around 7%\" after tax, which again speak against a cap. Additionally, the Claimants point out that the PER was not consistent with the *Memoria.* While the reference to 7% in the PER relates to all RE technologies, the *Memoria* provides different figures (ranging from 5% to 11%) for different types of RE technologies. In other words, so argue the Claimants, there was no clear or consistent indication that reasonable profitability meant 7% only.322\n\nC-PHB1, para. 136; PO12 C-PHB2, para. 268.\n\n333.\n\nMoreover, Spain's reliance on the testimony of its expert MG&A, is of no assistance as MG&A admitted during the hearing that there was no cap on returns under RD 661/2007.323\n\nC-PHB1, para. 271; PO12 C-PHB2, para. 265.\n\n334.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants note that the reference to 7% in the *Memoria* and the 7,398% return supposedly offered by the new regime relate to two qualitatively different concepts. RD 661/2007 provided the remuneration based on production and incentivized installations to produce as much electricity as possible, while the new regime supposedly provides a 7,398% return irrespective of the production.324\n\nC-PHB2, paras. 51-52.\n\n335.\n\nThe \"dynamic return\" theory, so say the Claimants, also lacks a basis. The Claimants acknowledge that the reasonable return would have to change over time as the cost of investments went down. However, the Claimants submit that \"Spain has failed to provide any evidence that the cost of money on capital markets had changed between 2007 (when RD 661/2007 was passed) and 2013 (when the New Regime repealed RD 661/2007) thus necessitating a change under the *'dynamic'* return theory\".325 In any event, even if such a change was necessary, Spain was estopped from altering the rate of return for existing investments.326\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 270.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 272.\n\n**iv.** ***Spain's fourth defence: the Claimants were receiving \"luxury profits\"***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Spain has presented no evidence to prove that the Claimants were receiving \"exorbitant remuneration\" or \"luxury profits\". They contend that the absence of evidence demonstrating that the Claimants were earning excessive returns is fatal to Spain's case, as without such evidence the reasonable return defence has no foundation.327\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 273-276; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 307-308.\n\n**v.** ***Spain's fifth defence: the Claimants did insufficient due diligence***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they carried out sufficient due diligence, which considered the relevant jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court and confirmed their right to receive the FIT.\n\n338.\n\nFor the Claimants, their due diligence was thorough and included requests for advice from numerous reputable law firms.328 None of these firms suggested that Spain could make retroactive adjustments to RD 661/2007.329 If Spain's argument were correct, the Tribunal would have to find that all of the law firms in Spain acted negligently by failing to inform investors and banks that RD 661/2007 could change retroactively.330\n\nSee Reply, paras. 206-213, also referring to Annex 1 to the Reply, which is a table setting out the legal advisors engaged by the Claimants.\n\nReply, para. 213; C-PHB1, paras. 128-133.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 131; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 305-306.\n\n**vi.** ***Spain\u2019s sixth defence: Supreme Court jurisprudence supports Spain\u2019s case***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimants disputes Spain\u2019s reliance on a number of Supreme Court judgments, which allegedly hold that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 cannot be interpreted as a stabilization commitment. These Supreme Court decisions relate to a different economic regime and a different period. Hence, they are irrelevant to determine whether the Claimants had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that no retroactive changes would be made.\n\n340.\n\nFirst, the Claimants submit that the vast majority of the judgments invoked by Spain were issued after the Claimants made their investment and can thus not be taken into account to assess the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.331 Only four of the judgments were in existence when the Claimants made their investments.332 However, the *dicta* contained in these judgments cannot be deemed to override the contrary statements by Spain in respect of RD 661/2007, especially since these judgments do not deal with RD 661/2007.333\n\nReply, para. 178.\n\nReply, para. 181, referring to Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 15 December 2005, rec. 73/2004, **Exh.

Indeed, so the Claimants argue, their investments were finalized (or were in the process of completion) before these judgments were rendered in December 2009.337 In any event, they do not help Spain\u2019s case, because RD 661/2007 was a vast improvement over its predecessor RD 436/2004. Therefore, the change from one regime to the other could not have indicated that the Government would implement retroactive tariff cuts such as the Disputed Measures.338\n\nJudgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 3 December 2009, rec. 151/2007 **, Exh.

RDL 1/2012 then came into force on 28 January 2012, implementing a moratorium that suspended the registration of all new RE installations in the Special Regime. This suspension prevented the plaintiff from registering its installation in the pre-assignment register of RD 1578/2008 and from receiving the RD 1578/2008 FIT.340 The Supreme Court upheld the claim considering that \"the regulatory change that Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 entailed was surprising and that it broke the principle of legal certainty by suspending the payment pre-allocation procedures\", and that RD 1578/2008 had \"created some solid expectations for the owners of the installations that they would obtain registration in that Registry and the corresponding payment for their energy in the terms provided\".341 In the Claimants\u2019 view, this decision shows that the Supreme Court fully recognizes their expectations.342\n\nClaimants' Submission on the 20 April 2016 SSC Judgment, 30 May 2016.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the 20 April 2016 SSC Judgment, 30 May 2016, para. 2.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the 20 April 2016 SSC Judgment, 30 May 2016, para. 5, discussing Decision of the Spanish Supreme Court (Contentious-administrative Chamber), Appeal No. 434/2014, 20 April 2016, **Exh.

A number of contemporaneous documents, such as a 2012 CNE Report345 and the preamble to the laws and regulations introducing the Disputed Measures indeed refer to the need to remedy the tariff deficit.346 In the Claimants' view, Spain is reluctant to admit that the tariff deficit motivated the Disputed Measures, because Spain itself caused the deficit and it would thus acknowledge that it breached the ECT.\n\nCNE, Report on the Spanish Electricity Sector, 7 March 2012, **Exh. C-334**.\n\nReply, paras. 289-294; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 274-276.\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the tariff deficit, like the over-capacity in the PV sector,347 are issues of Spain's own making, which existed long before Spain enacted RD 661/2007. The tariff deficit was the product of Spain's failures to follow its own laws; it was not a policy goal that justified interference with the Claimants' legitimate expectations.348\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain's first justification for RDL 14/2010 measures was over- capacity of the PV sector, which would ultimately have the effect of growing the tariff deficit. However, for the Claimants, the main reason for the over-capacity was the decentralized authorization and registration system which Spain put in place and which was centered around the Autonomous Communities, rather than on a sole central control authority such as the Ministry. See ASoC, paras. 323-324.\n\nASoC, paras. 327-343.\n\n347.\n\nInitially, so say the Claimants, the tariff deficit emerged out of a series of miscalculations about the costs and fluctuations in supply and demand.349 Subsequently, RDL 6/2009 set limits on the growth of the tariff deficit each year and required the Ministry to fix the network access tolls at appropriate rates. However, this was not done because the Government chose to keep artificially low electricity prices for electoral reasons.350 Similarly, the tariff deficit grew because the Government gave a high number of electricity consumers, essentially all Spanish households, the benefit of the so-called TUR *(tarifa de \u00faltimo recurso,* tariff of last recourse), i.e. a price designed to shield consumers from dramatic increases in the market price of electricity.351\n\nASoC, paras. 329, 338.\n\nASoC, paras. 331-332; Reply, para. 295.\n\nASoC, para. 339.\n\n348.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that Spain ignored all of the CNE\u2019s reasonable proposals to address the tariff deficit.352 They refer in particular to a CNE Report of March 2012, which identified measures to effect savings in the electricity system, without cutting the FIT and without imposing excessive costs on the consumers.353\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 303-310.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 303-309, discussing CNE, Report on the Spanish Electricity Sector, 7 March 2012, **Exh. C-334**.\n\n349.\n\nFinally, it is the Claimants\u2019 position that there is no evidence of causation between the tariff deficit and the cost of the Special Regime (i.e. the PV premiums), contrary to what Spain argues.354\n\nC-PHB1, para. 313.\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimants conclude by noting that the Spanish Supreme Court has issued several judgments and two sets of interim measures holding that Spain\u2019s failure to comply with the requirements of RDL 6/2009 was a clear violation of Spanish law.355\n\nASoC, para. 341.\n\n(b) Protection of consumers\n---------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that Spain's argument regarding the protection of consumers appears to have been raised solely for the purposes of this arbitration, as the only stated purpose of the measures was to address the tariff deficit.356 Indeed, Spain's policies show the opposite to a concern to protect consumers. In effect, Spain increased the VAT on electricity to 21% (when it was as low as 4% or even nil for other products and services at all). It also levies special tax on producers, all of which raises the price of electricity for consumers.357\n\nReply, paras. 330-342.\n\nReply, paras. 335-337.\n\n(c) State aid rules\n-------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the EC Decision on State Aid issued on 10 November 2017358 has no bearing on the present dispute.\n\nEC Decision on State Aid, **Exh. RLA-201**.\n\n353.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue, contrary to Spain, that there is no evidence to support the proposition that the New Measures were required to comply with applicable EU State aid rules.359 In that regard, they note that the EU guidelines being invoked post-date the Disputed Measures;360 Further, State aid was never mentioned as a purpose of the Disputed Measures.361 In any event, the Claimants contend that EU law did not require Spain to withdraw the economic regime, particularly not with respect to plants that operate under that regime.\n\nReply, paras. 344-365; Claimants' comments on EU State aid decision dated 22 December 2017, para. 2.\n\nReply, paras. 349-350, discussing Community Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection and Energy 2014-2020, Number 2014/C200/01 issued by the European Commission and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 June 2014, **Exh. RLA-126** (\"2014 Guidelines\") and Community Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection, Number 2008/C82/01, issued by the European Commission and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 1 April 2008, **Exh. RLA-127** (\"2008 Guidelines\").\n\nReply, para. 351.\n\n354.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that, contrary to Spain's contentions, the EU Decision could not affect the Claimants' legitimate expectations about the Original Regime, as it did not address that regime at all.362 The Claimants note Spain's (and the EC's) argument that a beneficiary of unlawful aid cannot entertain legitimate expectations regarding such aid. In response, the Claimants contend that the non-notification of RD 661/2007 does not undermine their legitimate expectations, for the following reasons:\n\na. As a preliminary point, the Claimants' legitimate expectations have to be adjudged under the ECT and not under EU law;363\n\nb. In any event, RD 661/2007 did not constitute State aid under EU law as FIT schemes financed by the end consumer, such as those under RD 661/2007, are not regarded as State aid;364\n\nc. Spain itself did not consider the RD 661/2007 FIT to be State aid. Otherwise, it would have notified the EC. Moreover, there is no contemporaneous evidence showing that RD 661/2007 was viewed as unlawful State aid. In other words, Spain had no expectation that the Original Regime was State aid, much less that it was unlawful;365\n\nd. Further, like Spain, the EC did not deem the RD 661/2007 FIT to constitute State aid. The Claimants point out that the EC monitored Spain\u2019s RE support schemes at all times and was therefore on notice of the provisions of RD 661/2007. However, although it had *suo motu* powers to examine unlawful aid, the EC made no suggestions that the RD 661/2007 FIT was State aid at all, let alone that it was unlawful or incompatible;366\n\ne. In conclusion the Claimants contend that upholding Spain\u2019s argument would permit Spain to benefit from its own wrongdoing, which cannot excuse Spain from liability under international law. Even assuming that the RD 661/2007 FIT did constitute State aid, it would still be compatible with EU law. This is because the Decision makes no finding on the RD 661/2007 FIT, when it could have done so, which shows that the EC \"was content that the RD 661/2007 FIT was compatible State aid\".367\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 3-4.\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 17 *ff* ; Claimants' Submission on the EC's written observations dated 5 July 2018, para. 9.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the EC's written observations dated 5 July 2018, paras. 10-14.\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 7-8, 11; Claimants' Submission on the EC's written observations dated 5 July 2018, paras. 15-16.\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 9-10; Claimants' Submission on the EC's written observations dated 5 July 2018, para. 17.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the EC's written observations dated 5 July 2018, paras. 24-27.\n\n355.\n\nThird, the Claimants stress that a \"finding of compatibility with EU law [does not] *ipso facto* also amount to a finding of compatibility with the ECT\", as the relevant standards under the two treaties are different.368\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 13-16.\n\n356.\n\nFinally, the Claimants deny Spain\u2019s contention that compensation awarded by the Tribunal on the basis that Spain modified the Original Regime, would constitute State aid. They submit that the Commission\u2019s statement to this effect at paragraph 165 of the EU Decision is not binding on the Tribunal.369\n\nClaimants' Comments on EU state aid decision dated 22 December 2017, paras. 17 *et seq*.\n\n**viii.** ***Spain\u2019s eighth defence: the Claimants have suffered no loss***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimants find this defence \"absurd\".370 They have substantiated their losses in their evidence,371 which losses caused the insolvency of many projects.372 In any event, the Claimants add, the PO12 phase, \"definitively confirms\" that each of the Claimants suffered substantial losses.373 Moreover, the CNMC itself confirmed that the New Regime reduced the remuneration and return of RE installations.374 In addition, Spain claims that the Measures were intended to cut the tariff deficit and address the over-remuneration of PV plants.

At the time of their last substantive pleading (i.e. PO12 C-PHB2), seven tribunals had issued final awards, five of which had \"found that Spain had violated the investors' legitimate expectations and ordered damages\".383 According to the Claimants, the two awards that did not find a breach of the ECT (*Charanne* and *Isolux*) were outliers that arose from facts peculiar to those specific cases.\n\nPO12 C-PHB 2, para. 4, citing the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 55.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 2; Section 10 (\"Authorities addressing modifications to RE support schemes\"), reviewing (*inter alia*) the Awards in *Eiser*, **Exh.

In particular, the FET standard is breached only by conduct that is, arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.385\n\nRejoinder, para. 731, quoting *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. the Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on pending issues related to jurisdiction and responsibility, **Exh.

The issue is not what tariff the Claimants were entitled to, i.e., either the FIT under RD 661/2007 or reasonable return. Rather, given that the Claimants\u2019 case is that Spain breached the ECT by enacting the Disputed Measures and changing the applicable rules, \"the central legal question is whether Spain was free to amend its own laws\".387 In other words, the issue in dispute is whether the Claimants could have legitimately expected the \"petrification\" of the law.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 740, 853.\n\n367.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Spain asserts that there is a presumption in international law that a State is free to amend its laws. It is from this starting point that the Tribunal must commence its assessment of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations. In other words, Spain alleges that it is for the Claimants to prove that RD 661/2007 established an exception to this rule.388\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 258-261.\n\n**ii.** ***Spain\u2019s regulatory framework in the electricity sector***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nBecause it finds the Claimants\u2019 presentation of the legal regime incomplete,389 Spain has offered a comprehensive overview of its electricity system.390 Spain explains that the Spanish electricity system (the \"SES\") forms an \"economic, technical and legal system\",391 which is governed by the following principles:\n\na. It is a \"system\", characterized by a strong inter-dependency between its actors. The various elements relating to generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity are interconnected through common mechanisms of control;392\n\nb. The supply of energy is a service of strategic importance and of \"general economic interest\".393\n\nc. The principal objective of the system is to guarantee that all consumers have access to electricity on conditions of equality and quality;394\n\nd. The system\u2019s economic viability is based on the principle of financial self-sufficiency.395 Accordingly, there is no recourse to Spain\u2019s state budget in case of a deficit, which can only be remedied by increasing income or reducing costs;396\n\ne. Following the entry into force of the 1997 Electricity Law, the sector was partly liberalized and now regulated and liberalized activities co-exist.397\n\nSoD, para. 24.\n\nSoD, paras. 22-356.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 21-22; PO12 R-PHB2, para. 22.\n\nSoD, paras. 42-43.\n\nSoD, paras. 44-46.\n\nSoD, paras. 47-48.\n\nSoD, paras. 49-50.\n\nSoD, para. 50.\n\nSoD, paras. 51-58.\n\n369.\n\nSpain adds that the legal regime governing the SES comprises of hierarchically structured laws and regulations, primary among them the 1997 Electricity Law. The 1997 Electricity Law establishes two basic principles in respect of remuneration payable to RE installations under the Special Regime:398\n\na. Premiums for the Special Regime are a cost of the SES linked to its sustainability; and\n\nb. Premiums should be set at a level that allows the Special Regime installations to achieve a reasonable return or reasonable profitability by reference to the cost of money in capital markets.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 18, 22; PO12 R-PHB2, para. 28.\n\n370.\n\nIn a nutshell, Spain submits that the subsidies granted to RE producers under the Special Regime represent a cost to the system that has to be balanced against the goal of ensuring the overall sustainability of the system. This means that if the subsidies and incentives result in an imbalance that threatens sustainability, then the regulator can legitimately adjust the remuneration to avoid over-compensation. In other words, the very nature of the SES should have alerted the Claimants to the fact that the FIT was not \"petrified\" for life.399\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 23-34; Rejoinder, paras. 844-846, 937-951.\n\n371.\n\nIn that regard, Spain contends that between 2007 and 2010 the installed capacity of the PV sector grew exponentially and surpassed all growth predictions made when determining the remuneration regime under RD 661/2007. As a result, the cost of subsidising the PV sector (by paying the FIT) also grew significantly and became the main cost of the SES.400 Spain alleges that it attempted to account for the higher costs by increasing the consumer electricity price and amortising the tariff deficit. It increased the price of electricity on 11 separate occasions, for a total of 70%.401 However, despite the high price of electricity, the revenues did not cover the growth of the costs. This resulted in a tariff deficit that posed a serious threat to the sustainability of the SES.402\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 31-32.\n\nSoD, paras. 775-777; Rejoinder, paras. 515, 560 and 1067; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 40-46.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 275.\n\n372.\n\nThis situation was exacerbated by the global financial crisis that purportedly put Spain's economy into recession. According to Spain, during and because of the economic crisis, electricity demand fell and it was no longer reasonable for Spain to continue increasing the price of the electricity paid by consumers.403 These factors combined to create an imbalance that put the SES on the brink of collapse. In these circumstances, Spain claims that it was obliged to make changes to the legal framework, which was clearly envisaged in the 1997 Electricity Law and under Spanish law generally.404\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 45-51; Rejoinder, paras. 67-71; R-PHB1, para. 34.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 51.\n\n**iii.** ***The principle of reasonable profitability***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n373.\n\nAs a general theme stressed throughout its pleadings, Spain puts forward that the Claimants could only aspire to \"reasonable profitability\".\n\n(a) Reasonable profitability as a cornerstone of the SES\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nSpain states that systematic regulation of the RE sector, including PV, began with the 1997 Electricity Law, which introduced the concept of \"reasonable profitability\" as an element in the determination of remuneration of RE facilities. In this context, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law neither provides for a petrification of the legislation nor for a perpetual tariff. It also does not state that the tariff or premiums granted by relevant regulations shall represent \"reasonable profitability\".405 Rather, Article 30.4 merely indicates that that the premiums established through RDs from time to time will ensure that operators\u2019 remuneration does not fall below a threshold that permits investors to achieve reasonable profitability.406 Different regulations that implemented Article 30.4, especially RD 661/2007, reaffirmed the principle of reasonable profitability.\n\nRejoinder, para. 282.\n\nSoD, para. 283; Rejoinder, paras. 282-284.\n\n375.\n\nWith regard to RD 436/2004, Spain underlines that even this regulation stressed the basic importance of reasonable profitability as part of the incentives system.407 The incentive scheme incorporated by RD 436/2004 - whereby the FIT was linked to the amount of consumer electricity tariff - was based on the principle of reasonable profitability and did not grant \"a petrification of the incentives/subsidies during the entire lifetime of the installation\".408\n\nSoD, para. 288, discussing RD 436/2004, **Exh. R-55**, Preamble, para. 7.\n\nSoD, paras. 287-289.\n\n376.\n\nReasonable profitability was of fundamental importance also in RD 661/2007. In support, Spain points to the text of this decree and in particular its preamble.409 Moreover, paragraph 1 of Section 44.3, when referring to the circumstances that must be taken into account when modifying the incentives provided, reiterates that a \"reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital market\".410\n\nSoD, para. 295, discussing RD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, Preamble, para. 7.\n\nSoD, para. 296.\n\n377.\n\nThus, in Spain\u2019s view, RD 661/2007 did not guarantee the immutability of the incentive scheme over the course of time. Rather, it supplemented a scheme meant to provide reasonable profitability.\n\n378.\n\nHence, nothing in the laws and regulations governing the PV sector prior to and during the time the Claimants made their investment suggests that the incentive scheme was frozen or that the FIT was guaranteed. The Claimants should thus have known that the incentives could be adapted to ensure reasonable profitability.411\n\nRejoinder, paras. 956-958.\n\n(b) Reasonable profitability is a dynamic concept\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nSpain asserts that the concept of reasonable profitability is based on the prior work of the regulator, which acknowledges an economic cost structure, defines the income necessary to pay for that structure and to adequately remunerate the investor for its capital.412\n\nRejoinder, para. 275.\n\n380.\n\nFor the Respondent, profitability must be measured regardless of the premium that the regulatory framework may have awarded at a given time. Hence, it makes no sense to compare the situations under the New Regime with the one existing when the facility was built.413 Thus, according to Spain, reasonable profitability is necessarily a dynamic concept.414 What is reasonable today may not be so in 30 years under different economic circumstances.415\n\nRejoinder, para. 280.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 16-66.\n\nRejoinder, para. 281.\n\n381.\n\nSpain argues that reasonable profitability must allow an investor to recoup investment expenses (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) and obtain a profit in line with market criteria. The alignment with market criteria meets the triple objective of (i) remunerating the investor proportionately, so that it can compete with conventional energies; (ii) guaranteeing electricity supply at an efficient cost for consumers; and (iii) making the SES sustainable.416 In particular, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law guarantees an adequate balance between the cost to consumers and the investors\u2019 profit, which is also indicated in the \"Stated Purpose\" of RD 661/2007.417 Thus, if the principle of reasonable profitability constitutes a point of equilibrium, it must have the dynamism required to adapt in case of over- or under-remuneration.418 Such dynamism is reflected in the use by the 1997 Electricity Law of the cost of money in the capital market,419 as a \"benchmark\" to judge the reasonableness of the profitability. Because the cost of money fluctuates according to macroeconomic parameters and monetary policies, reasonable profitability is necessarily dynamic.420 Like Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law, Law 24/2013 only offers investors in renewables rates of return by reference to the cost of money in the capital markets. In particular, Law 24/2013 links the reasonable return to the evolution of the Spanish state bonds.421\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 35-36.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 39-41.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 43.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 44.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 44.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 50-56.\n\n382.\n\nFurther, according to Spain, the regulatory framework of the SES is fully consistent with the Spanish constitutional principle of normative hierarchy. That principle permits the introduction of regulatory changes, which do not alter the principles of the SES set forth in the 1997 Electricity Law.422 Spain also argues that there is no provision in the entire Spanish energy legal framework that guarantees a particular remuneration that is unlimited and perpetual. Moreover, the FIT system is one incentive for renewable energies among others, including tax incentives or green certificates.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 62-66.\n\n383.\n\nIn any event, even based on the Claimants\u2019 argument that reasonable profitability \"must be the reasonable profitability applicable at the time the Claimants made their investment\", with which Spain initially appeared to agree,423 the Respondent submits that reasonable profitability at the time when the Claimants invested in Spain was around 7%. In support, Spain invokes the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* of the draft decree that was to become RD 661/2007, prepared by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Energy.424 According to the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica,* plants up to 10 MW would receive a remuneration of \"approximately 7%\", and plants above 10 MW would have a return lower than 7%.425\n\nSee Rejoinder, para. 260 (where the Respondent, discussing the Claimants' Reply, para. 152, notes that \"the Claimants make a statement in their Reply, with which Spain concurs. They state that reasonable profitability '[\u2026] must be the reasonable profitability applicable at the time the Claimants made their investment.' Spain does not deny this.

Associations representing PV energy producers, including the one of which the Claimants are members, had full access to the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* and \"even submitted comments on the case file\".428 The Respondent also points to the testimony of the representatives of one of the Claimants, Mr. Barrueco, who confirmed at the hearing that he had seen the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica.*429\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 135-140.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 141.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 145.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 150-152.\n\n385.\n\nThe PER 2005-2010, so the Respondent notes, also referred to a return of 7%.430\n\nPER 2005-2010, Spanish Government, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), August 2005, **Exh.

Separately, Spain also argues that Article 44.3 does not constitute a stabilization clause under international law, which will be addressed subsequently.\n\nRejoinder, para. 108. See also *ibid*., paras. 901-903.\n\n390.\n\nIn particular, it explains that read in its entirety and with specific reference to its first subsection, Article 44.3 provides for revisions to take place every four years (starting in 2010) if a series of conditions are met,439 and for the sole purpose of meeting the targets for the implementation of the successive plans to foster RE.440\n\nR-PHB1, para. 76; R-PHB2, para. 49.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 77; R-PHB2, para. 53.\n\n391.\n\nHowever, so the Respondent continues, the \"special revisions\" envisaged in Article 44.3 never occurred because, among other things, the targets of the PER 2005-2010 were fulfilled well before 2010, i.e. in October 2007.441 Thus, \"apart from the revisions 'of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits' provided for in article 44.3, there could be other changes made for different purposes or reasons such as to re-balance the costs of the SES to ensure its sustainability or granting of reasonable rates of return by reference to the cost of money in the capital markets\".442\n\nR-PHB1, para. 79.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 80.\n\n392.\n\nAt the Hearing on Liability, the Respondent also submitted that Article 44.3 only applied as long as RD 661/2007 was in force.443\n\nHearing on Liability Tr. [English version], Day 1 at 221:6-222:8. See also R-PHB2, para. 50.\n\n393.\n\nIn Spain's view, the interpretation of Article 44.3 is further confirmed by its \"antecedent\", Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004. The Spanish Supreme Court established that such provision was not immutable even before the Claimants decided to invest in Spain.\n\n394.\n\nSpain \"categorically denies\" that Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004 constitutes a stabilization commitment aimed at creating long term stability to attract investment.444 Spain asserts that challenges were brought against RD 661/2007, which in some cases reduced the potential remuneration existing under RD 436/2004, while always observing the principle of reasonable profitability.445 When deciding these challenges, the Spanish Supreme Court confirmed (i) that the Government may change the regulatory framework, (ii) that the expectation of receiving a FIT on a perpetual basis is not legitimate, (iii) that the modifications made were compatible with the principle of legal certainty, (iv) that the incentives scheme must be considered in conjunction with the rest of the elements that form part of the principle of reasonable profitability, and (v) that such scheme must be capable of being adapted to the circumstances from time to time.446\n\nRejoinder, para. 21.\n\nRejoinder, para. 113.\n\nRejoinder, para. 114, discussing Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 15 December 2005, rec. 73/2004, **Exh.

Therefore, \"from September 2008 the registration for RD 661/2007 was closed and the two year window for registration under article 44.3, that was supposed to take place in 2010, never applied\".450 Thus, Spain concludes, \"[i]t was simply not possible to trigger the review mechanism of article 44.3 in 2010 since such reviews would have only applied to those installations that would register in 2012 after the two year window provided in article 44.3 (which did not occur as from September 2008 registration of PV plants under RD 661/2007 was closed and PV plants registered after this date were regulated by RD 1578/2008)\".451\n\nR-PHB1, para. 123.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 125.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 127.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 128.\n\n(c) Fifth Additional Provision in RD 1578/2008\n----------------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nInitially, the Respondent argued that RD 1578/2008 did not apply to facilities registered under RD 661/2007.452 In its post-hearing submission, Spain then submitted that because the Fifth Additional Provision \"provides that it will apply to 'the activity of electricity production using solar photovoltaic technology\u2019 (unlike article 2 of RD 1578/2008, which does refer to specific PV installations registered after 29 September) [...] the modifications provided for in the Additional Provision Five, affect any PV installation, regardless of its date of registration or commissioning\".453\n\nSee Rejoinder, para. 40 (\"Spain agrees with the Claimants' contention that RD 1578/2008, which reduced the amount to be paid per kWh, does not apply to facilities registered under the RD 661/2007 regime and therefore, does not apply to the Claimants\").\n\nR-PHB1, para. 131 (emphasis in the original).\n\n398.\n\nFor the Respondent, such provision warned the Claimants that the remuneration of their PV installations could be changed.

The regulatory changes considered by the Supreme Court were not related to such specific reviews, but to the principles of sustainability and reasonable profitability.460 Moreover, the Supreme Court clearly did not regard Article 40.3 as a provision preventing subsequent modifications to the incentives offered by RD 436/2004,461 or else it could not have reached the outcome it did.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 159.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 158.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 159.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 162.\n\n402.\n\nWith respect to decisions of the Supreme Court issued *after* the Claimants' investment, a first group rendered in 2009 deals with challenges against RD 661/2007, which the Court dismissed, in spite of the presence of Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004.462\n\nRejoinder, paras. 307-320, discussing Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 3 December 2009, rec. 151/2007, **Exh.

That decision bears no relation to the Claimants' case, as it refers to the moratorium to the registration in the RAIPRE as a result of RDL 1/2012, and not to the modifications to the remuneration received by PV plants already registered in the RAIPRE.465 That judgment does not say that a plant registered in the RAIPRE will enjoy an unchangeable right to a specific subsidy or to a specific level of profits.466\n\nRespondent's Submission in relation to Spanish Supreme Court Decision of 20 April 2016, 30 May 2016, p. 2.\n\nRespondent's Submission in relation to Spanish Supreme Court Decision of 20 April 2016, 30 May 2016, p. 3.\n\n**vi.** ***In any event, Spain did not give a stabilization commitment under international law***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nSpain submits that, under international law, any legitimate expectation of stabilization may only arise if a State gives a direct and specific commitment or representation to an investor (such as in a stabilization clause), on which the latter relies to make its investment.467\n\nRejoinder, paras. 866-869, refuting the Claimants' incorrect reliance on the cases arising out of Argentina's economic crisis as standing for the proposition that legitimate expectations of stabilization in the regulatory regime can arise out of the general law.

Their expectations as to the immutability of the RD 661/2007 regime could only have been generated by an erroneous interpretation of the regulatory framework, which cannot be regarded as legitimate. The Claimants failed to conduct due diligence to inquire about the regulatory framework prior to undertaking their investments.

Where they include a regulatory section, the latter merely describes the processes to be followed to obtain the licenses, permits and authorizations necessary for operating a PV plant.470 The hearing confirmed the lack of legal due diligence.471 The diligence focused on the registration requirements for RAIPRE without addressing the substance of Article 44.3 or the nature of any allegedly \"guaranteed\" FIT.472 On the few occasions where the legal due diligence did consider Article 44.3, it merely recited the provision.473\n\nRejoinder, para. 141.

Rather, the analysis of the Claimants' return must be conducted under the 2013 Measures.506 In this respect, the future remuneration set by the 2013 Measures grants investors reasonable profitability, based on a model that considers any detrimental effects of RDL 14/2010.507\n\nRejoinder, para. 344.\n\nRejoinder, para. 344.\n\n(a) RD 1565/2010\n----------------\n\n422.\n\nSpain first claims that the Claimants' position according to which RD 1565/2010's limitation of the FIT to 25 years goes counter to Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 is erroneous, as such provision would only concern a tariff cut and not \"other elements such as the years of useful life\".508\n\nRejoinder, para. 347.\n\n423.\n\nSecond, Spain contends that the 25 or 30-year limit has no actual impact on the profitability of the plants, because the useful life of the Claimants' PV facilities does not exceed 25 to 30 years.509 For a facility to operate beyond 25-30 years, a \"substantial modification\" would be required, as the equipment would become obsolete.

That Annex sets out the average hourly production that RD 661/2007 considered could reasonably be expected in each climate zone. It is therefore clear that the values contained in Annex XII acted as an implicit basis *(\"presupuesto impl\u00edcito\")* for the tariff established in RD 661/2007. Had higher or lower production profiles been contemplated, the tariff would logically have been adjusted proportionately.

Nonetheless, it provides explanations in response to what it considers \"plainly wrong\" allegations from the Claimants.515 In particular, it submits that it is incorrect to equate the 7% levy to a tariff cut. The 7% is a tax levied on all electricity producers.516 The difference between a tariff cut and a tax is that a tariff cut does not entail any saving or increased revenue for the state, whereas a tax augments the revenues of the Treasury.517\n\nRejoinder, paras. 370-377.\n\nRejoinder, para. 372.\n\nRejoinder, para. 373.\n\n**iii.** ***The New Measures***\n-------------------------------\n\n(a) RDL 2/2013\n--------------\n\n428.\n\nWith regard to the change in the inflation index provided by RDL 2/2013, Spain first asserts that the new index is well established in worldwide economic doctrine518 and seeks to avoid distortions whereby the consumer price index would fall \"outside the foundations of the economy\".519\n\nSoD, paras. 149-160.\n\nSoD, para. 155.\n\n429.\n\nSpain's second argument is that the new index was only introduced in Spain through the approval by the European Statistic System Committee on the 26 September of 2012, which Committee approved the Regulation of the European Commission for drafting the HICP-CT (harmonized indices of consumer prices at constant tax rates), and made the calculation of this index mandatory for all EU Member States.520\n\nRejoinder, para. 379.\n\n430.\n\nThird, it is incorrect to state that the reason for the change was to remove the effect of the price of oil from the indexation. The new index was chosen to provide more stability as it removed the more volatile elements, i.e. energy products and food.521 In any event, the new index was higher in 2014 and 2016 and the fact that it was lower in 2013 is a coincidence.522\n\nRejoinder, para. 380.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 380-381.\n\n(b) The New Regime\n------------------\n\n431.\n\nSpain contends that the \"essential features\" of the regulatory framework existing at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment have been maintained.523 Under the New Regime, the Claimants continue to receive a subsidy or premium for the sale of their electricity, which results them collecting more for their production than the market price. The Claimants\u2019 attempt to downplay this fact by referring to the subsidy as \"Special Payment\", does not alter the nature of that payment.524\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 318-320.\n\nRejoinder, para. 383.\n\n432.\n\nFurthermore, Spain explains that since the enactment of the 1997 Electricity Law reasonable profitability has always been calculated taking into account (i) the reasonable costs (Capex and Opex) of a standard plant, (ii) financing with own resources (no project finance), (iii) the returns obtained at plant level, (iv) reasonableness in relation to the cost of money in the capital markets.525 This methodology has not changed under the New Regime.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 327; Rejoinder, paras. 393 *et seq*.\n\n433.\n\nFirst, just as the remuneration provided in RD 661/2007 was based on the reasonable investment costs considered in the \"standard cases\" included in the PER 2005-2010, the Order on Parameters establishes the investment costs for standard cases.526 Spain explains that the PER 2005-2010 only considered a few standard cases for lack of sufficient data, while the Order on Parameters considers 578 categories of plants.527 Further, taking into account 578 categories means \"greater granularity and precision in the regulation and accommodation of PV plants\".528\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 329-330.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 331-332.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 332.\n\n434.\n\nSecond, the remuneration is calculated for a PV plant developed using its own resources,529 as evidenced by a passage of the PER 2005-2010 which refers to \"with own resources (prior to funding)\".530 Further, the reference to external financing found in the PER 2005-2010 related to all RE technologies, and not specifically to PV.531 Thus, under RD 661/2007, Spain did not contemplate the profitability of PV projects resorting to project finance.532\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 333.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 334.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 337.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 338.\n\n435.\n\nThird, Spain's regulatory framework has always provided that the reasonable return would be calculated with reference to greenfield investors (i.e., the promoters who undertook the development, construction and commissioning of the installation). Such remuneration does not cover the extra costs incurred by \"secondary\", \"financial\" or \"brownfield\" investors, such as certain Claimants, who paid a premium for the acquisition of the asset.533 Spain contends that the calculation of the remuneration under the current regime also considers the profitability of the project at the plant level i.e., for greenfield investors, as is demonstrated by RDL 9/2013 and the Order on Parameters, which refer to the reasonable return for the \"facilities\".534\n\nR-PHB1, para. 342.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 343.\n\n436.\n\nFourth, Spain insists that reasonable profitability is linked to the cost of money in the capital markets,535 as referenced explicitly in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law and in Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007. Under the New Regime, such link is to the Government bond yield in the secondary market.536\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 344 *et seq*.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 345, discussing Article 14 of Electricity Sector Law 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, **Exh. R-6** (providing that \"reasonable profitability will, before tax, be based on the average income on the secondary market of 10-year Government bonds plus an appropriate differential\").\n\n437.\n\nMoreover, Spain stresses that RDL 9/2013 simply specifies the reasonable profitability criterion established in Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law.537 The 7,398% rate, which is the average yield of 10-year government bonds on the secondary market before RDL 9/2013 entered into force plus 300 basis points, is reasonable and cannot be reviewed until six years have elapsed from the entry into force of RDL 9/2013.538 Using the 10-year Spanish bond yield plus the 300 basis point is not arbitrary; it has been recognised as appropriate reference by various relevant entities, including the investors themselves.539\n\nRejoinder, para. 399.\n\nRejoinder, para. 400.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 246-252.\n\n438.\n\nThat rate of return does not constitute an upper limit. It represents the return to be obtained by a facility in conformity with the relevant standard facility. If an investor manages to reduce its costs below the parameters established for the standard facility, it will obtain a higher return on investment.540 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the fact that the Claimants' investments are not outperforming the standards set out in the New Measures and, therefore, the Claimants do not achieve higher returns shows that the Claimants have not been efficient in structuring and running their operations.541 For Spain, this lack of efficiency has to do with the brownfield nature of the Claimants' investments.542\n\nRejoinder, para. 405.\n\nRejoinder, para. 414.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 414-417.\n\n439.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants\u2019 argument that the 2013 Measures establish a return of 7,398% before tax, which would actually be 5.2% after tax. It contends that RE producers have tax benefits that exempt them from paying any taxes during most of the lifespan of the plants. Thus, if one applies the correct tax rate, the return will be 6.92%, which matches the 7% return after tax established by the legal framework when the Claimants invested in Spain.543 Such calculation is made taking into consideration a debt of 80%, in order to make the calculation as close to reality as possible.544 Without debt, the pre-tax rate of 7,398% would yield an after tax figure of 6.51%, which is also in line with the approximate rate of 7% provided under RD 661/2007.545\n\nRejoinder, paras. 287 and 423, citing to MG&A Rebuttal Expert Report, paras. 202-211.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 351-352.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 352.\n\n440.\n\nSpain also opposes to the Claimants\u2019 statement that the continuation of priority dispatch is uncertain.546 In this respect, Spain cites to Article 26 of Law 24/2013547 and contends that priority has been expanded under the New Regime, considering that PV installations now also enjoy priority over high-efficiency cogeneration installations.548\n\nRejoinder, para. 35, discussing Reply, para. 45.

R-6**, Article 26(2).\n\nArticle 26 of Law 24/2013 (**Exh. R-6**) reads as follows: \"2. Electrical energy from installations that use renewable energy sources and, following them, that of high-efficiency cogeneration installations, will have dispatch priority under the same economic conditions on the market, without prejudice to the requirements pertaining to the maintenance of system reliability and safety, under the terms determined in the regulations by the Government. Without prejudice to supply safety and efficient system development, electrical energy producers from renewable energy sources and highly efficient cogenerations will have priority network access and connection under the terms as set out in the regulations based on objective, transparent y non-discriminatory criteria. [\u2026]\" (Respondent's English translation).\n\nR-PHB1, para. 354.\n\n441.\n\nSpain finally asserts that the New Regime grants PV plants subsidies for a 30-year regulatory life, which is in line with the real lifespan of PV plants built under RD 661/2007.549 Indeed, under both the 2013 Measures and the previous regime, the duration of the subsidized scheme was tied to \"useful life\" of PV plants, i.e. between 25-30 years. Spain also observes that the Claimants\u2019 \"investment papers\" concur that their expectation was for a plant life of 25 to 30 years at the most.550\n\nR-PHB1, para. 363.\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 360-363. By \"investment papers\", the Respondent refers *inter alia* to the Claimants' financial statements, internal due diligence reports prepared by the Claimants to obtain necessary approvals for the investment, and external due diligence reports.\n\n**iv.** ***The Disputed Measures are not retroactive***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nIt is Spain\u2019s case that the changes to RD 661/2007 were made for the future only, and have no application to the past. Hence, this is not a situation of \"strict\" or \"proper\" retroactivity (which would be forbidden under Spanish law). Strict retroactivity would arise, for example, if the Disputed Measures clawed back remuneration collected in the past in excess of the remuneration provided under subsequent legislation.551 By contrast, where a measure applies to facilities already commissioned, only in respect of their future remuneration (i.e., prospectively), such \"faux\" retroactivity is not forbidden under Spanish law.552 The Spanish Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court have held that the application of a new regulation to pre-existing situations is allowed under Spanish law.553\n\nRejoinder, paras. 45-48.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 227-232.\n\nRejoinder, para. 48, discussing *inter alia* Judgement of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 15 November 1999, rec. 305/1997, **Exh.

RLA-134**, paras. 598-599.\n\n445.\n\nAs to the content of the obligation, Spain asserts that it cannot be equated with the \"immutability *ad infinitum* of the regulations of a State\". In other words, Article 10(1) is not a stabilisation clause; it recognises a State's right to maintain regulatory flexibility. A proper interpretation of this standard implies that the State must exercise its regulatory flexibility fairly, consistently, and predictably, taking into account the circumstances of the investment.558 In this context, Spain asserts that the Disputed Measures did not lead to irrational or unpredictable legal or regulatory instability.\n\nSoD, paras. 636-639; R-PHB1, paras. 221-228.\n\n446.\n\nFirst, the changes to the legal regime were neither constant, nor frequent, nor contradictory. They strictly adhered to the twin principles governing the applicable legal framework at the time the Claimants made their investment, i.e. (i) sustainability of the SES and (ii) reasonable profitability for RE installations in relation to the cost of money in the capital markets. Consequently, the changes were predictable. Investors should have been able to predict that if either of these principles were at risk, the Government would intervene to correct the imbalance through regulatory reform.559\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 313-314.\n\n447.\n\nSecond, Spain highlights that, as a matter of fact, the Disputed Measures were not perceived as unstable by investors, because (i) the market risk factor (beta) for RE investments in Spain decreased after the measures were enacted; and (ii) there has been a wave of new investments after the enactment of the measures. In fact, many of the Claimants have made new investments in Spain after the Disputed Measures. There have also been new investors constructing new capacity under the New Regime. Thus, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 contention, the transaction boom after the Disputed Measures is not a case of \"vulture funds\" purchasing assets from distressed investors.560\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 315-316.\n\n448.\n\nThird, as set out above *(supra* at V.A.2.c), the Disputed Measures respected the principle of reasonable profitability and maintained the essential features of the prior regulatory framework.\n\n**ii.** ***The Disputed Measures were transparent***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nSpain contends that the Disputed Measures have been implemented by fully complying with the need for transparency. It was always forthcoming with information about intended changes and it engaged in extensive dialogue with investors prior to making such changes.561\n\nSoD, paras. 768 *et seq.* ; Rejoinder, paras. 426-457, 1059 *et seq.* ; PO12 R-PHB2, para. 233; R-PHB1, para. 365.\n\n450.\n\nThe 2010 Measures were implemented through a mandatory process of approval through the \"Ministers Council\" and the Parliament, in full compliance with due process requirements. Prior to the promulgation of RD 1565/2010, the CNE presented the report from the Ministry seeking comments on draft RD 1565/2010 and received many submissions from associations and companies.562 As for the RDL 14/2010, Spain notes that there was no consultative process because a royal decree law, unlike a royal decree, does not require a consultation given its urgency.563 However, this RDL was enacted after parliamentary debate and publication. Moreover, the Spanish Constitutional Court confirmed that all legal and constitutional requirements were met in relation to the enactment of RDL 14/2010.564\n\nSoD, paras. 770-772; Rejoinder, paras. 1063.\n\nRejoinder, para. 439.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 440, 1063.\n\n451.\n\nWith regard to the 2013 Measures, Spain submits that it was forthcoming with information about the intended changes in policy and regulations. Specifically, a year and half prior to the enactment of the Measures, during the drafting process, CNE opened a public consultation that resulted in more than 477 observations and proposals concerning the electricity sector.565 The CNE then published a report that spelled out the intended policy and regulatory changes and the rationale behind them;566 the Spanish Government published several documents explaining the proposed plans for reforms;567 hearings were held before the CNE and its successor, the CNMC;568 and the advice of the Council of State was sought.569\n\nRejoinder, paras. 443, 1064.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 444, 1065-1068.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 445-446, 1069-1072.\n\nRejoinder, para. 449.\n\nRejoinder, para. 450.\n\n452.\n\nSecond, in connection with the transitory period of 11 months under RDL 9/2013, Spain recognizes that the preparation of RD 431/2014 and the Order on Parameters took time, but that time was necessary to fulfil the legal milestones established by Spanish law and to ensure transparency.570 In particular, during the transitory period, Spain implemented a complex procedure that ensured the effective participation of all interested stakeholders through public hearings before the CNE / CNMC. The submissions by the stakeholders formed the basis of reports by the CNE / CNMC, which were incorporated in the draft regulation. The Ministry as well as the Council of State recognised that the formulation of the draft regulation had included ample public participation.571\n\nRejoinder, para. 427.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1072-1075.\n\n453.\n\nFurther, Spain points out that RD 431/2014 was subject to a public consultation, which resulted in 619 submissions from companies, industrial associations and Autonomous Communities.572\n\nRejoinder, para. 1076.\n\n454.\n\nFinally, Spain considers that the engagement of the two independent consulting companies has no bearing on the transparency requirement. Spain explains that the Government terminated the contract with BCG for breach and BCG never issued a report. By contrast, a report was issued by Roland Berger, but it was not used to prepare the Order on Parameters or the remuneration standards, as it was received after the approval of RD 413/2014 and the Order on Parameters.573\n\nRejoinder, para. 430, fn. 408; SoD, para. 790.\n\n**iii.** ***The Disputed Measures are proportionate and justified***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n455.\n\nAt the outset, Spain asserts that in reviewing the reasonability and proportionality of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal should adopt a deferential approach and \"not 'act as a court of appeal over the Spanish Government'\".574 The Tribunal should not review whether the Disputed Measures were the best option out of all available measures, but recognize that Spain had selected appropriate measures from a range of reasonably available alternatives.575 For Spain, there is no consistent approach to determining proportionality. The test requires a determination of whether a measure is suitable, necessary and proportionate, comparing the detrimental effect to the advantages of achieving the objectives of the measures.576 The Disputed Measures were justified and suitable for a variety of reasons, including the need to (i) correct the over-remuneration of PV plants under the previous regime, (ii) to remedy the tariff deficit, (iii) to protect consumers and (iv) to comply with EU state aid rules.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1080; SoD, paras. 807-809.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1084.\n\nSoD, para. 806.\n\n(a) Over-remuneration of PV plants\n----------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nSpain initially appeared to suggest that the 7% reasonable profitability at the time of the enactment of RD 661/2007 was an \"upper limit\".577 In its post-hearing submission, however, Spain argues that the reasonable profitability of \"around 7%\" for PV installations at the time RD 661/2007 was a \"target\" not a \"cap\".578 However, such target was \"not achieved as the tariff from RD 661/2007 led to a situation of over remuneration and it was therefore necessary to adapt the regime by implementing the Measures\".579\n\nSee Rejoinder, para. 267 (citing to MG&A Report, page 30 and 31, conclusion 13): \"Similarly, the 7% upper limit is clearly explained in the MG&A Report: 'The containment of a reasonable return was the expected return that the investor who would have invested under the remuneration regimes of RD 661/2007 relied on; and this is set out in a target rate of return of up to 7% IRR of the project for the investors who would have connected their plants to the network until the end of September 2007 and a lower reasonable rate of return for plants that would connect as of this date'.\"\n\nR-PHB2, paras. 18-19.\n\nR-PHB2, para. 19.\n\n457.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s submission, it is \"self-evident\" that the Claimants were making \"windfall profits\" under RD 661/2007 as otherwise they would not have started arbitral proceedings since they continue to receive a return of 7,398%.580 Moreover, by 2007-2008 when the Claimants' plants were built, costs had dropped significantly and hours of production had increased compared to the estimates581 run in the PER 2005-2010, which \"led to over remuneration and windfall profits\".582 Various texts, including the \"stated purposes\" of RDL 14/2010 and RDL 2/2013, indicate that PV plants were obtaining remuneration higher than reasonable.\n\nR-PHB2, para. 21.\n\nR-PHB2, para. 22.\n\nR-PHB2, para. 22.\n\n(b) Tariff Deficit\n------------------\n\n458.\n\nSpain first recalls that a tariff deficit accrues when the tariff collected from consumers does not cover the costs of the system, thereby generating a debt on the part of all consumers to the electricity producers. This debt is securitized and paid by consumers over a series of years, as laid down by Law 24/2013.583\n\nRejoinder, para. 485.\n\n459.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the tariff deficit was created by the Government. Many factors resulted in a substantial increase of the tariff deficit after 2008 and compelled the Government to adopt a series of measures to address the problem, including the Disputed Measures. In Spain\u2019s view, such factors are the following:\n\n\u25a0 Remuneration of renewable energies, in particular PV energy, above the reasonable rate of return due to increased productivity of the plants beyond expectations; and lower investment and production costs than expected;\n\n\u25a0 The over-installation of PV facilities which generated a 25% increase in cost of the Ordinary Regime as a result of the priority of access of renewables;\n\n\u25a0 The sudden and deep drop in demand of electricity due to the economic crisis;\n\n\u25a0 The impossibility of increasing tolls, because they were the highest in Europe and had already been increased eleven times over the last few years in a context of economic crisis;\n\n\u25a0 The financing of the accumulated debt of the tariff deficits became untenable.584\n\nRejoinder, paras. 488, 1083.\n\n460.\n\nFor Spain, the Claimants\u2019 argument that the only way of remedying the tariff deficit was to increase the price of electricity paid by consumers is unrealistic given the state\u2019s need to balance competing interests.585 In that exercise, the state must not only increase the consumers\u2019 burden, but also adapt the support scheme for energy production (as was done through the Disputed Measures).586 In any event, the Government did in fact increase the price of electricity for consumers,587 by increasing the network access tolls many times, thus complying with the relevant Supreme Court decisions.588 Similarly, the Claimants\u2019 contention that Spain could have imposed a tax on all CO2 emissions or on fuel to no avail either, given that Spain had already imposed such a tax.589\n\nRejoinder, para. 490.\n\nRejoinder, para. 534.\n\nRejoinder, para. 491.\n\nRejoinder, para. 502.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1085-1086.\n\n461.\n\nSpain also contends that the tariff deficit was an element of the system since the early 2000s, i.e. long before the Claimants made their investments. Consequently, it should have informed their legitimate expectations.590\n\nRejoinder, paras. 547-552.\n\n462.\n\nSpain further highlights the impact of the economic crisis on the tariff deficit which was threatening the sustainability of the electricity system. Due to the crisis, there was an unexpected drop in demand for electricity, which led to a decrease in revenues. The repeated increases in tolls were precisely aimed at correcting that decrease. However, in such a crisis environment, it was not reasonable for Spain to continue to increase the price of electricity to consumers.591\n\nRejoinder, para. 69.\n\n(c) Protection of consumers\n---------------------------\n\n463.\n\nIt is Spain's argument that \"the purpose of the 2013 reform was to revise each and every one of the costs borne by the electricity system in order to comply with the legal system in force, both domestic and at a Community Law level, and to ensure that electricity consumers do not bear excess costs generated in the different activities\".592\n\nSoD, para. 349.\n\n464.\n\nSpain asserts that it has experienced one of the highest rises in the price of electricity in the EU over the last years (more than 70% in 7 years).593 Thus, it refutes the Claimants' argument that an increase in the tolls for consumers could have covered the tariff deficit.594\n\nRejoinder, paras. 444, 554, 1067.\n\nRejoinder, para. 553.\n\n(d) EU state aid rules\n----------------------\n\n465.\n\nWhilst it admits that European rules did not expressly require it to introduce the Disputed Measures, Spain submits that it must comply with European law, which allegedly \"prohibits perpetual and unchanging subsidies\".595 Spain contends that competition in the market cannot be achieved if the investors' private interests are the only relevant consideration, since this would worsen the existing imbalance over the years.596\n\nRejoinder, para. 596.\n\nRejoinder, para. 596.\n\n466.\n\nIn that regard, Spain submits that the EC Decision on State Aid makes it clear that Spain has not breached the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations:\n\na. The EC Decision recognises that there is \"no right to State aid\", implying that there was no right to the stabilization of the RD 661/2007 FIT. It also refers to the case law of the Court of Justice, whereby a recipient of State aid cannot, in principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to the Commission.597 It further confirms that the only expectation that the Claimants could have under EU law was the expectation of reasonable profitability.598 In sum, the EC Decision considers that there is no infringement of the FET standard of the ECT.599\n\nb. The EC Decision also ratifies the proportionality, reasonableness, transparency and stability of the New Regime, given that (i) the New Regime permits to recover capex and opex, plus a profit margin of 7,398% in line with the returns of projects recently approved by the Commission;600 and (ii) the New Regime is subject to regular revisions and assessments, which ensures that the returns remain \"reasonable\".601\n\nRespondent's Comments on the EC State aid Decision dated 14 December 2017, paras. 19-22, discussing the EC Decision on State Aid, **Exh.

Since the Claimants\u2019 make identical arguments on the lack of reasonableness of the Disputed Measures and the impairment of the Claimants\u2019 investments through unreasonable measures, Spain addresses the two together.603\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1091-1093; SoD, para. 827.\n\n469.\n\nFirst, Spain disagrees that the introduction of transitory hour caps was unreasonable or arbitrary. The hours cap imposed by RDL 14/2010 was not new. It matched the average operating hours envisaged in the PER 2005-2010 which in turn formed the basis for calculating the tariff in RD 661/2007. Moreover, the average operating hours were ultimately included in Annex XII of RD 661/2007. In other words, the hours cap in Annex XII formed an implicit basis for the tariff established in RD 661/2007 for PV facilities. As a result and because the hours cap in RDL 14/2010 was based on the PER 2005-2010, the Claimants cannot now claim that the forecast of production hours in RDL 14/2010 was unjustified or arbitrary.604\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 238-242; Rejoinder, para. 1096.\n\n470.\n\nSecond, Spain reiterates that the New Measures maintain all the features of the regime in place at the time the Claimants\u2019 invested and continues to be based on the principles of the SES. Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 arguments, the New Regime continues to provide reasonable profitability and sufficient visibility as to return.605\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 246-256.\n\n471.\n\nThird, Spain submits that it is incorrect that the New Measures were a mechanism for retaining the risks incurred by private investors, while denying them the associated rewards. PV technologies involve the lowest risk of all RE generation technologies and thus the Disputed Measures ensure more than a generous rate of return.606\n\nRejoinder, para. 1098.\n\n472.\n\nFourth, it is equally untrue that over-installation of PV capacity was a consequence of Spain\u2019s failure to oversee the registration of PV facilities. There was a globally unprecedented increase in PV installations, which nobody could foresee.607\n\nRejoinder, para. 1099.\n\n**v.** ***Spain has provided full protection and security to the Claimants\u2019 investments***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n473.\n\nSpain asserts that the Disputed Measures do not violate the full protection and security (\"FPS\") standard because (i) they do not cause physical harm to the Claimants or their investments; (ii) they do not involve third party or police measures; and (iii) they are an expression of the State's right to regulate, which was reasonably exercised.\n\n474.\n\nFirst, Spain submits that the FPS standard is limited to the obligation to provide physical security and only exceptionally extends to legal security, which circumstances are not present in the instant case.608 In any event, even if the Tribunal were of the view that the FPS standard encompasses legal security, such obligation requires the creation of legal remedies for the effective vindication of investment rights and Spain has always offered the Claimants such remedies.\n\nSoD, paras. 859-864; Rejoinder, paras. 1106-1107.\n\n475.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that there is no allegation of Spain breaching its duty of care to protect the investors and/or investments against the harmful actions of third parties. Accordingly, the Disputed Measures cannot be assessed under the FPS standard.609\n\nSoD, paras. 857-858; Rejoinder, paras. 1110-1111.\n\n476.\n\nThird, Spain reiterates that the Disputed Measures are a legitimate and reasonable expression of its right to regulate, against which the FPS standard does not protect investors.610\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1115-1119.\n\ne. ***The Claimants\u2019 failure to prove harm***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nEspecially in their submissions prior to the PO12 Hearing, Spain has emphasized that the Claimants failed to comply with their burden to prove any losses.611 The Respondent underlines that the Claimants' case is based on the alleged financial harm that they have suffered as a result of the Disputed Measures. Therefore, for the Respondent, the measure of the harm allegedly caused by the Disputed Measures is a specific and necessary element to enable the Tribunal to \"confidently rule on Spain's international responsibility\". A decision on Spain\u2019s liability that does not consider this element would not be a \"fully informed decision\".612\n\nSee, e.g., SoD, paras. 7, 23, 620; Rejoinder, Section 5.6, paras. 1121-1177; R-PHB2, paras. 4-5, 79-81; Quantum Counter-Memorial, para. 20.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 1121-1132.\n\n478.\n\nOn this premise, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate the alleged loss they suffered. For Spain, this was a calculated risk that the Claimants took when they insisted on bifurcation of the proceedings and it is not for Spain to suffer from the Claimants\u2019 gamble.\n\n479.\n\nIn the same vein, Spain argues that the Claimants\u2019 alternative case as pleaded in the Reply - which is based on the argument that the New Regime failed to provide the required reasonable return - is not substantiated. For Spain, in order to properly address this argument, the Tribunal would \"need to understand the margins\" (i.e. the difference between the reasonable rate of return at the time of investment and that under the New Regime). However, so Spain contends, while \"[t]he Claimants are essentially asking this Tribunal to find liability by relying on the principle of reasonable profitability\", they nevertheless \"turn a blind eye to the need for evidence to determine whether such reasonable profitability was actually satisfied\".613 In other words, even in this instance, the Claimants fail to prove their loss. For Spain, the mere assertion that the \"PV Investors have suffered extensive losses as a result of the measures, resulting in restructuring and insolvency proceedings\" does not constitute credible or sufficient evidence.614\n\nRejoinder, para. 1137.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1134.\n\n**B. The Alternative Claim**\n----------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThis section provides a broad summary of the Parties\u2019 positions on the Alternative Claim, it being noted that further details on the Parties\u2019 arguments are contained in the analysis of the Alternative Claim.\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nThe Alternative Claim rests on the premise that the Primary Claim is not successful and the Tribunal agrees with Spain\u2019s argument that, instead of the RD 661/2007 FIT, the Claimants are only entitled to receive a reasonable rate of return within the terms of Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (also referred to by the Claimants as the \"Original Regime\"), as it stood at the time of their investment.615\n\nSoD, para. 175; Reply, para. 587.\n\n482.\n\nIn response to this theory, the Claimants submit that Spain nevertheless faces international liability under the ECT, because the reasonable return under the New Regime is lower than the reasonable return under the Original Regime.616 On Spain\u2019s own case, at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment, the reasonable rate of return was set at around 7% after-tax (implying a pre-tax return of around 11%).617 They contend that the New Regime offers a 7,398% pre-tax return, which amounts to around 5.9% after-tax. Thus, they submit that their return is 2 percentage points below than the return of around 7% that Spain purported to guarantee under the Original Regime.\n\nReply, para. 583 *et seq.* ; PO12 PHB-2, para. 21.\n\nReferred to as the \"target rate of return\".\n\na. ***The Claimants are entitled to \"full reparation\" for violations of the ECT***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThe Claimants first discuss the context against which the Tribunal should assess the Alternative Claim. They submit that the ECT offers no guidance on the measure of compensation for a non-expropriatory breach, such as a violation of the FET standard. Consequently, it is necessary to refer to the standard of compensation under customary international law, as determined in the *Chorzow Factory* case and subsequently codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles. Pursuant to this standard, a State must make \"full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\" so as to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".618\n\nQuantum Memorial, paras. 17-18, citing ILC Articles, **Exh. CLA-13**, Article 31(1) (English version); *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, Claim for Indemnity, Merits, PCIJ Rep, Series A, No. 17, Judgment of 13 September 1928, **Exh. CLA-3**, p. 47 (\"*Chorz\u00f3w Factory*\").\n\n484.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants contend that if Spain is found to have violated its international obligations under the ECT, then consistent with *Chorzow Factory* and the ILC Articles, Spain must pay compensation in an amount that will wipe out the consequences of the unlawful measures.619\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 19; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 6-7.\n\n**b.** ***The Primary Claim should act as a benchmark***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, while quantifying damages, the Tribunal must not only respect the principle of full reparation, but also seek to \"ensure consistency with the established jurisprudence\".620 In that regard, the Claimants point out that a \"series of consistent cases\" have found that Spain violated the investors' legitimate expectations by introducing the Disputed Measures (in line with the Primary Claim) and have consequently ordered damages by reference to a DCF calculation, on the basis that the RD 661/2007 FITs would have continued to apply.621\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 45.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 40-45, discussing *Eiser,* **Exh. CLA-215**, paras. 387, 418; *Novenerg\u00eda,* **Exh. CLA-242**, paras. 681, 697; *Masdar,* **Exh. CLA-243**, para. 527; *Antin,* **Exh. CLA-244**, para. 552; and *Greentech,* **Exh. CLA-245**, para. 506.\n\n486.\n\nConsequently, if the Tribunal decides to award damages based on the Alternative Claim to ensure full reparation and consistency with the findings on damages in other PV cases, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal should use the Primary Claim as a \"benchmark\" for assessing damages.622 Although the Primary Claim has not been quantified in these proceedings, the Claimants offer two \"proxies\" for damages under the Primary Claim.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 38-45.\n\n487.\n\nFirst, the Claimants submit that the damages under the Primary Claim would be very similar to the damages under the Alternative Claim in a situation where the chosen parameters generate an Alternative Tariff that is substantially similar to the RD 661/2007 tariff. Accordingly, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to refer to the damages scenario presented by Brattle at the PO12 Hearing that produced an Alternative Tariff most closely resembling the RD 661/2007 FIT. This damages scenario - which considers PV plants with installed capacity under 100kW, a 7% rate of return, disregards past profits and uses a \"pure\" marginal plant as the cost base623- yields damages of approximately EUR 654 million.624\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 46, 49-52.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 52.\n\n488.\n\nAs a second proxy, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to look at the damages awarded in the decision rendered by the *Novenerg\u00eda* tribunal. The Claimants submit that the *Novenerg\u00eda* tribunal found Spain's implementation of the Disputed Measures in breach of the ECT and awarded damages on an equivalent basis to the Claimants' Primary Claim. Consequently, the Claimants argue that the damages awarded by the *Novenergla* tribunal would be \"a good approximation of the damages, on a \u20ac/MW basis, that may be viewed as reasonable in this case\".625\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 53.\n\n489.\n\nIn *Novenerg\u00eda* the damages amounted to EUR 2.84 million per MW of installed capacity. As the Claimants in this case collectively hold 222.4 MW of capacity, they would receive approx. EUR 632 million in damages.626\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 53-55.\n\n490.\n\nFor the Claimants, applying these proxies as a benchmark is particularly important in the present case, where the maximum aggregate amount of damages computed under the EJM (based on the narrower parameters indicated by PO18) are 25% lesser than the damages that are likely to have been awarded under the Primary Claim. The Claimants contend that any further reduction in the maximum available damages under the EJM would run contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s duty to maintain consistency in the jurisprudence and to ensure full reparation under international law.627\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 48.\n\n**c.** ***Quantification of the loss for liability and quantum***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nGiven that the Alternative Claim expresses the violation of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations in economic terms, the Claimants submit that it is necessary to measure the impact of the Disputed Measures on the value of the Claimants\u2019 investments to determine issues of both liability628 and damages. This quantification was carried out by Brattle under PO12.\n\nThe Claimants refer to this as the \"threshold liability question\". See, PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 6-8.\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimants note that PO12 directed them to compute their damages by comparing two scenarios: (a) what the Claimants call the \"Actual scenario\", which measures the cash flows and IRR as a result of the Disputed Measures, and (b) the \"But For scenario\", which measures the cash flows and the IRR in the absence of the Disputed Measures.629 If the IRR in the But For scenario is higher than the IRR in the Actual scenario, it means that Spain violated their legitimate expectations by failing to provide the target rate of return under the New Regime. The same quantification would also serve as basis for the computation of damages.630\n\nPO12, para. 3(a). PO12 assumed that the quantum of damages / harm suffered by the Claimants equals \"the difference [\u2026] between (i) the reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant [\u2026] and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period\".\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para. 36.\n\n493.\n\nThe Claimants observe that for undertaking the quantification exercise, PO12 outlined six assumptions with alternatives, namely:\n\na. Whether or not to update the remuneration under the New Regime at the scheduled periodic intervals.\n\nb. Reasonable profitability within the meaning of the 1997 Electricity Law means either a 7% after-tax return or an 8% after-tax return.\n\nc. Whether reasonable profitability should apply to either greenfield or brownfield investments (to the extent it makes any difference).\n\nd. Reasonable profitability should be measured with reference to a 30-year regulatory lifetime.\n\ne. Whether or not reasonable profitability should consider earnings prior to the enactment of the Disputed Measures.\n\nf. The valuation date should be either the date of the award or the date of the Disputed Measures.631\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 10; BQR I, para. 11. See also, PO12, para. 3(a)-(f).\n\n494.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the first of these assumptions and alternatives (at (a) above) relates to the Actual scenario. The next four assumptions (from (b) to (e), above) relate to the But For scenario. The sixth assumption (which relates to both scenarios) refers to the valuation date and essentially requires the calculation of damages *ex post* (date of potential Award) as well as *ex ante* (date of Disputed Measures).\n\n495.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants advocate for the following parameters, which in their view are the most appropriate for calculating the damages recoverable under the Alternative Claim:\n\n(a) find that the target rate of return was 8% after tax;\n\n(b) do not take into account the tax benefits of interest when calculating the effective tax rate for the purposes of establishing the Alternative Tariff;\n\n(c) adopt Brattle's preferred \"Marginal Plant\" option as the cost base;\n\n(d) do not consider past profitability;\n\n(e) assume that the reasonable return is revised every six years (which on an *ex ante* valuation in effect reduces damages); and\n\n(f) use an *ex post* valuation date in order to fully capture the harm suffered by the Claimants.632\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 67 (internal footnote omitted); PO12 C-PHB1, Appendix 1.\n\n496.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that \"holding IRRs\" should be used in the calculation of the IRRs, as opposed to \"exit IRRs\",633 and note that a computation using the parameters just referred to would result in damages in the sum of EUR 1.16 billion.\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, paras. 121-132.\n\n497.\n\nThe Claimants' detailed arguments on each of these assumptions and parameters are summarized in section VI.B.4.c below (Analysis).\n\n498.\n\nThe Claimants further observe that in PO18, in which the Tribunal asked the Parties' experts to prepare the EJM, the Tribunal narrowed down the number of inputs for calculating these cash flows and, in particular, eliminated two key parameters that had formed the basis of their prior quantification of damages, i.e. the \"pure\" marginal plant option as a potential cost base, and the *ex post* valuation date. The Claimants submit that the removal of these two parameters significantly reduced the damages that could be recovered by the Claimants.634\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 69-70.\n\n499.\n\nFirst, the Claimants submit that not using the \"pure\" marginal plant option as a cost base has a significant impact on damages. With this cost base, they could have recovered damages of approximately EUR 654 million, whereas under the EJM, their preferred set of parameters yield damages of EUR 520 million only. In either case, the Claimants point out that the damages fall well short of the value of the RD 661/2007 FIT (and consequently, the damages that according to them would have resulted in \"full reparation\").635\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 73-74.\n\n500.\n\nSimilarly, the use of an *ex ante* as opposed to an *ex post* valuation also reduces the recoverable damages. The Claimants submit that using Brattle's preferred assumptions under the EJM (but with the \"pure\" marginal plant as a cost base), results in damages of approx. EUR 654 million. By contrast, if an *ex post* valuation date is adopted, the total damages would amount to EUR 900 million.636\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 80.\n\n501.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants submit that the EJM results in significant under-compensation, as even the highest amount of damages available under the EJM (totalling EUR 534 million) will not provide \"full reparation\" to the Claimants, in accordance with the international law principles governing compensation for internationally wrongful acts.637\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 9-10.\n\n502.\n\nBy contrast, they note that applying the methodology used in other PV cases against Spain yields higher damages. For instance, according to the Claimants, the methodology endorsed by the *Novenerg\u00eda* tribunal would result in a damages award of approximately EUR 642 million to the Claimants.638 The Claimants submit that awarding damages on the basis of an \"Alternative Tariff\" set at the same level of RD 661/2007 would result in damages awarded on a basis similar to all other previous awards.639 However, this would necessitate employing the \"pure\" marginal plant cost base.640\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 10.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 11.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 12.\n\n503.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that \"the Alternative Claim and the EJM both assess damages based on the returns at the plant level (or project level). They do not assess returns on the sums actually invested by the Claimants when purchasing those PV plants\".641 They contend that the *Claimants* themselves have suffered substantial losses on their investments,642 and that \"as matters currently stand, the Claimants will not even recover the capital they invested in Spain, let alone earn a profit on that invested capital\".643\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 13 (emphasis in original).\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 13.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 14.\n\n504.\n\nNevertheless, if the Tribunal intends to award damages based on the set of parameters in the EJM, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal must choose the set of parameters that most closely reflect the reasonable return offered by Spain at the time of their investment, i.e.:\n\n(a) do not take into account the tax benefits of interest when calculating the effective tax rate;\n\n(b) choose the \"Size Reclassified\" marginal plant as the cost base [...];\n\n(c) do not consider profitability before the valuation date;\n\n(d) assume that the reasonable return is revised every six years (which in effect reduces damages); and\n\n(e) apply interest to cash flows lost before the valuation date.644\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 82-83.\n\n505.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal must adopt these permutations, as they (a) \"are most closely aligned with the methodology used by Spain when designing the Original Regime\" in which the Claimants invested; and (b) reflect the impact of the Disputed Measures.645\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 16, 18.\n\n506.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 more detailed arguments on quantification are summarized below in the analysis of the Alternative Claim.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\na. ***Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n507.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Alternative Claim as ill-founded. For Spain, there is no merit in the Claimants\u2019 argument that under the Alternative Claim their damages would still be substantial. By contrast, \"[t]he Claimants are receiving exactly the same amount of return on their investment as the one provided by the Spanish regulation at the time of their investments\" and \"the difference between returns before and after taxes is minimal, as [renewable energies] have tax benefits that exempted them from paying any taxes during most of the lifespan of the plants\".646 Spain\u2019s position is that \"[a]pplying the correct tax rate applicable to the PV investments, to a 7,398% return before taxes, it will turn into a 6.92% return after taxes, which matches the 7% return after taxes established by the legal framework when the Claimants invested in Spain\".647\n\nRejoinder, para. 968.\n\nRejoinder, para. 968.\n\n**b.** ***The Primary Claim cannot be used as a benchmark for quantifying the Alternative Claim***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Primary Claim cannot be used to benchmark the damages in the Alternative Claim. According to Spain, the Primary Claim does not represent the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations at the time of their investment and therefore does not represent any potential measure of damages.648\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 413-415.\n\n509.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal should also disregard the two proxies for damages proposed by the Claimants:\n\na. As regards the damages granted in *Novenerg\u00eda,* Spain contends that, \"despite basing its liability conclusions on radical change\", that tribunal seems to have used the claimant's DCF model, using a but-for scenario where the claimant would have continued to receive the RD 661/2007 FIT. Consequently, the damage computable in *Novenerg\u00eda* cannot be used as a reference.649\n\nb. With respect to \"pure\" marginal plant, the calculation of returns using this parameter assimilates the Claimants' plants to a 5 kW marginal plant, the cost and production parameters of which bear no relation to the Claimants' larger plants.650\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 422(a).\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 422(b)-423.\n\n**c.** ***Quantification of the loss for liability and quantum***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nOf the various assumptions provided under PO12, Spain considers the following parameters most appropriate to quantify the alleged damages:651\n\na. The But For scenario should be calculated in accordance with the methodology proposed by Econ One;\n\nb. The target rate of return in the But For scenario should be 7%;\n\nc. The \"marginal plant\" proposed by Brattle cannot be used as the cost base, because the remuneration scheme for PV installations, including the RD 661/2007 FIT, has always been based on the \"costs of standard installations that reflect the typical efficient greenfield costs in the market for the construction of certain type of installation in a given year\".652 Furthermore, Spain contends that \"the typical costs of the standard facilities included in the Parameters' Order IT Codes are [...] representative of the real costs in the market at the time of construction of the PV Plants\";653\n\nd. An exit IRR should be used for the computation of the IRRs in the Actual Scenario;\n\ne. An *ex-ante* valuation date should be adopted.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal has limited itself to highlighting Spain's arguments on only those parameters which were finally accepted or discarded in PO18. For parameters where PO18 provides alternatives, the Tribunal addresses Spain's position *infra* at VI.B.4.c.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 90, 96.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 24.\n\n511.\n\nWith regard to the options set out in PO18, it submits that the Tribunal should opt for the following in order to calculate the Claimants\u2019 alleged harm:\n\na. If an The Alternative Tariff is to be used, then it shall be calculated:\n\ni. Using the IT Codes sensitivity as cost base; and\n\nii. Taking into account the tax benefits of interests when calculating the applicable tax rate as calculated by Econ One.\n\nb. The DCF should take into account profits generated before the valuation date (since profitability can only be calculated during the full regulatory life of a plant);\n\nc. The DCF should assume that the rate of return is revised every six years;\n\nd. The IRRs for the Claimants\u2019 plants in the scenario with Measures should be calculated using the Claimants\u2019 greenfield costs excluding developers\u2019 premiums as calculated by Econ One;\n\ne. Interest should not be included, as the Tribunal did not request it and \"we are at the liability phase\".654\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 137.\n\n512.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s more detailed position on quantification for purposes of determining liability and quantum is summarized in section VI.B.4.c below which deals with the analysis of the Alternative Claim.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n513.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal provides its analysis of the Primary Claim (B) and the Alternative Claim (C). Before doing so, it addresses certain preliminary matters (A).\n\n**A. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n514.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will address (1) the scope of this Award; (2) the applicable laws; (3) the relevance of prior awards; and (4) the Respondent\u2019s outstanding procedural requests of 7 March 2019.\n\n**1. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n515.\n\nThis award deals with both liability and damages, as further explained in sections VI.B.4.a and VI.B.4.b below.\n\n**2. The Applicable Laws**\n--------------------------\n\n**a.** ***Law Governing the Arbitration Proceedings***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe place of arbitration within the meaning of Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Rules being Geneva, Switzerland (see Procedural Order No. 3, para. 52), this arbitration is subject to Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act.\n\n**b.** ***Law Governing the Merits of the Dispute***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n517.\n\nArticle 26(6) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\nA tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n518.\n\nThus, in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal will apply the Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\n\n**c.** ***Jura Novit Arbiter***\n-------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nWhen applying the law governing the substance of the dispute, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim *jura novit curia* - or, better, *jura novit arbiter* - the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its own motion, provided it seeks the Parties\u2019 views if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.655\n\nSee Swiss Supreme Court decisions 4P.114/2001 of 19 December 2001, paras. 3a, 20 *ASA Bulletin* (2002), pp. 493, 511 and 4A\\_214/2013 of 5 August 2013, para. 4. See also, in the investment treaty context, *inter alia*, *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, **Exh. RLA-197**, para. 118 *;* *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, para. 295.\n\n**3. The Relevance of Prior Awards**\n------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nBoth Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.\n\n521.\n\nAs it noted in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction (para. 53), the Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to the specific text of the ECT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law in furtherance of the certainty of the rule of law. Additional observations on the Tribunal's consideration of the awards rendered in other Spanish RE arbitrations are contained in paragraphs 551 to 555 below.\n\n**4. The Respondent\u2019s Outstanding Procedural Requests of 7 March 2019**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nAs recalled *supra* at paras. 167 and 168, upon the Respondent's request and having heard the Claimants, on 21 February 2019, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to file into the record the three January 2019 Declarations issued by the Member States in connection with *Achmea* and invited the Parties to provide their comments thereto. On 7 and 21 March 2019, the Respondent and the Claimants submitted their comments on the Declarations.\n\n523.\n\nThe Tribunal first summarizes the Parties' position and requests in connection with the Declarations and then provides its decision on these procedural requests.\n\na. ***The Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n524.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Declarations deal with the legal consequences of the judgment rendered by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") in *Achmea* \"on investor-State arbitration clauses and on the question of investment protection in the EU and in intra-EU disputes\".656 It submits that the Declarations are directed \"towards investment arbitration tribunals as well as to the investor community\".657\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 6.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 7.\n\n525.\n\nAfter recalling that the *Achmea* judgment is binding on all EU Member States,658 Spain contends that the declaration made by 22 EU Member States (the \"22 Member States Declaration\"),659 was \"[s]igned by the representative of Spain and also by the representatives of Germany and the Netherlands (relevant States on the basis of the nationality of the Claimants in the present dispute)\". In Spain\u2019s view, it \"clearly establishes that arbitrations between investors of a Member State and another Member State arising from the ECT are incompatible with EU law\".660\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 4.\n\nSee Declaration of the Representatives of Governments of the Member States, of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union signed by the Representatives of the Governments of, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and United Kingdom of great Britain and Northern Ireland, **Exh. RLA-214**.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 11.\n\n526.\n\nQuoting passages from the 22 Member States Declaration, Spain maintains that such document \"declares the Member States\u2019 understanding that an arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration clauses such as Article 26 of the ECT lacks jurisdiction when the dispute is intra-EU, on the basis that the Member States did not make any offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT to investors from other EU Member States\".661\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 15.\n\n527.\n\nIn stating that the effects of *Achmea* also extend to the ECT, the 22 Member States Declaration, so Spain explains, follows the position of the European Commission in its Communication of 19 July 2018 entitled \"Protection of intra-EU investment\".662\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, paras. 16-17.\n\n528.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the position of the 22 Member States is not \"contradict[ed]\" by the declaration signed by five other Member States (the \"5 Member States Declaration\").663 Although Spain acknowledges that the latter declaration \"differs from the 22 Member State[s] Declaration in respect of the extension of the effect of the *Achmea* Judgment to the ECT\",664 as \"the 5 Member States consider that it is preferable to not express any specific views until a 'specific judgment\u2019 on this matter is rendered and the question of whether Article 26 ECT permits intra-EU arbitration is currently being contested before a national court in a Member State\",665 it submits that the 5 Member States Declaration confirms that it is only for the CJEU \"to decide upon matters of interpretation and application of EU Law as set out in\" *Achmea.666*\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 22. See Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, of 16 January 2019, on the enforcement of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union signed by the Representatives of the Governments of Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden, **Exh. RLA-215**. Spain makes no specific submission in respect of Declaration of the Representative of the Government of Hungary, of 16 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union, **Exh. RLA-216**.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 19.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 20 referring to *Novenergia II \u2013 Energy & Environment (SCA) SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain*, Case No. 4658-18 before the Svea Court of Appeal.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 22.\n\n529.\n\nIn sum, Spain contends that the 22 Member States Declaration is relevant to the present dispute because it \"leaves no room for doubt as to the intention or understanding of the ECT parties involved in this dispute that (i) Article 26 ECT cannot be considered a valid consent to arbitration in the case of intra-EU disputes on the basis that it would be incompatible with the autonomy of EU law and (ii) any differences in interpretation must be resolved in favour of EU law\".667\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 32.\n\n530.\n\nSpain contends that EU law as interpreted by the CJEU \"qualifies as one of the 'applicable rules and principles of international law\u2019 specified in Article 26(6) of the ECT\"668 and, moreover, \"is to be taken into account when interpreting the ECT\" under Article 31(3)(c) VCLT.669 Specifically, the 22 Member States Declaration is to be taken into account when interpreting the ECT either as a \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty of application of its provisions\" (Article 31(3)(a) VCLT) or, at a minimum, as \"subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" (Article 31(3)(b) VCLT).670 Hence, \"tribunals cannot override the common will of the ECT parties as to how Article 26 shall be interpreted in line with EU law\".671\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 26.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 29.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 31.\n\n531.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to \"now reconsider *ex officio* its jurisdiction in the present case in accordance with its continuing obligation\".672 Moreover, in light of the Member States\u2019 \"undertaking of cooperation\" to inform investment tribunals of the *Achmea* judgment, Spain \"invite[s] the Tribunal to contact any of the Member States signatories to the 22 Member State Declaration concerned with this arbitration in order to confirm their unequivocal understanding of the Declaration and the obligations contained therein\".673\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 32.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 34.\n\n**b.** ***The Claimants\u2019 Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the 22 Member States Declaration draws a distinction between the legal consequences of *Achmea* for bilateral investment treaties and the ECT.674 In particular, they point to the fact that, while the 22 Member States agreed to use their best efforts to terminate intra-EU bilateral investment treaties by the end of 2019, with respect to the ECT, they only announced that they would \"discuss without undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences from the *Achmea* judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty\".675 Furthermore, the Claimants underscore that the 22 Member States Declaration states that \"Union law takes precedence over *bilateral* investment treaties concluded between Member States\", without expressing the same view with respect to the ECT, which is a multilateral treaty to which both the EU and the Member States are parties.676 Thus, in the Claimants\u2019 view, there is no agreement among EU Member States (including between the 22 signatories to the Declaration) regarding the consequences of *Achmea* for the ECT or whether EU law has precedence over the ECT.677\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 3.\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 2, discussing 22 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-214**, p. 4, para. 9 (English version).\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 3, discussing 22 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-214**, p. 1 (emphasis added by the Claimants) (English version).\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 4.\n\n533.\n\nFor the Claimants, this is consistent with the other two declarations. The 5 Member States Declaration, on the one hand, stresses the \"importance of allowing for due process and [...] that it would be inappropriate, in the absence of a specific judgment on this matter, to express views as regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty\".678. Hungary's Declaration, on the other hand, unambiguously declares that \"the *Achmea* judgment concerns only the intra-EU bilateral investment treaties\" and \"does not concern any pending or prospective arbitration proceedings initiated under the ECT\".679 Hence, Spain's argument that EU Member States \"never interpreted Article 26 of the ECT as a valid offer to arbitrate between EU Members\" is contradicted by the 5 Member States and Hungary's Declarations.680\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 5, discussing the 5 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-215**, p. 3 (English version).\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 5, discussing Hungary's Declaration, **Exh.****RLA-216**, p. 3, para. 8 (English version).\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 7.\n\n534.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's argument that the 22 Member States Declaration constitutes a subsequent agreement or practice between the EU Member States that sets out the authentic interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT is incorrect. For the Claimants, the 22 Member States Declaration does not fall within the \"agreement\" or \"practice\" under Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the VLCT, because it \"is a political statement\" setting out the steps that EU Member States will take regarding the set aside of awards and termination of intra-EU bilateral investment treaties. The Claimants contend that \"[b]eyond suggesting that the intra-EU application of Article 26 is incompatible with EU law\", the 22 Member States Declaration does not set out how the ECT ought to be interpreted. Therefore, it neither constitutes an agreement regarding the interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT nor subsequent practice evidencing any such agreement.681 Furthermore, in the Claimants' view a subsequent agreement could only be invoked if all the parties to the treaty have been involved in the interpretation of a particular meaning of a treaty term, which is not the case here.682\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 10.\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 11.\n\n535.\n\nMoreover, the 22 Member States Declaration cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction since it postdates the commencement of these proceedings and jurisdiction must be determined by reference to the date on which the proceedings are instituted.683\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, paras. 12-13, discussing *Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000* (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium) Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 3, para. 26 and *Nottebohm case* (Preliminary Objection) Judgment of 18 November 1953: I.C.J. Reports 1953 p.111, at p. 123.\n\n536.\n\nWith regard to Spain\u2019s EU law arguments, the Claimants first contend that EU law does not constitute \"applicable rules and principles of international law\" relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.684 Furthermore, Spain\u2019s argument on the primacy of EU law rests on the assumption that there is a conflict between EU law and the ECT, which in the Claimants\u2019 view is not the case.685 Should any such conflict exist, the ECT would prevail under Article 16 of the ECT.686\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 15.\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 16.\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 17.\n\n537.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that Spain\u2019s request to invite the EU Member States to intervene in these proceedings must be rejected, as Spain has failed to identify, let alone substantiate, the legal basis for its request.687 In any event, the Member States\u2019 views on the legal consequences of the *Achmea* judgment are not relevant for this arbitration and have already been reflected in their declarations.688\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 18.\n\nClaimants' comments, 21 March 2019, para. 18.\n\n**c.** ***Discussion and Decision***\n------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe Respondent makes two requests in its submission of 7 March 2019. First, it asked the Tribunal to \"reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction in the present case in accordance with its continuing obligation\".689 Second, Spain \"invite[s] the Tribunal to contact any of the Member States signatories to the 22 Member State Declaration concerned with this arbitration in order to confirm their unequivocal understanding of the Declaration and the obligations contained therein\".690\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 32.\n\nRespondent's comments, 7 March 2019, para. 34.\n\n539.\n\nStarting with Spain\u2019s first request, the Tribunal recalls that, under the Swiss *lex arbitri* and the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules applicable to these proceedings, an objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must be raised *in limine litis.*\n\n540.\n\nIn relevant part, Article 186 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (\"PILA\") provides as follows:\n\n(2) A plea of lack of jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defence on the merits.\n\n(3) The arbitral tribunal shall, as a rule, decide on its jurisdiction by preliminary award.\n\n541.\n\nArticle 23 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules, for its part, provides that:\n\n(2) A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence [...].\n\n(3) The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. [...]\n\n542.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its \"intra-EU jurisdictional objection\" timely at the outset of the proceedings. In accordance with Articles 186(2) of the PILA and 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal ruled on such objection in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.\n\n543.\n\nUnder Swiss law, awards on jurisdiction must be challenged immediately, i.e. within 30 days of notification, for irregular constitution or erroneous determination on jurisdiction (Articles 190(2)(a) and (b) and 190(3) PILA). It is undisputed that the Preliminary Award was not challenged. As a result, that award binds the Tribunal and has thus *res judicata* effect or conclusive and preclusive effects comparable to *res judicata.691* The Tribunal stated this position on repeated occasions throughout these proceedings,692 including in Procedural Order No. 19 issued on 15 October 2018 (\"PO19\"). In PO19, the Tribunal denied Spain\u2019s request to \"open a new jurisdictional phase\" as a consequence of the judgment rendered by the CJEU in *Achmea* and the related communication and fact sheet issued by the European Commission, as it considered that the Respondent was seeking to re-litigate the same intra-EU objection, which the Tribunal had already denied in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.693\n\nSee Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler & Antonio Rigozzi, *International Arbitration: Law and Practice in Switzerland* (Oxford University Press, 2015), p. 387, para. 7,105. See also Bernhard Berger & Franz Kellerhals, *International and Domestic Arbitration in Switzerland* (St\u00e4mpfli Publishers, 3rd ed., 2015), p. 252, para. 705 (\"[\u2026] a preliminary award on jurisdiction is binding upon the arbitral tribunal. As opposed to other preliminary and interim decisions, against which an immediate action for annulment is inadmissible, it is not possible for the arbitral tribunal to return to the issue of jurisdiction insofar as it has been affirmed in the preliminary award [\u2026]. If the respondent waives its right to challenge the preliminary award accepting jurisdiction, *the award produces conclusive and preclusive effects which are comparable to res judicata* [\u2026]\") (emphasis added).\n\nSee letter from the Tribunal to the Parties, 9 January 2015, p. 2; letter from the Tribunal to the European Commission, 26 March 2015, p. 2; e-mail from the Tribunal to the European Commission, 6 June 2018.\n\nSee PO19, \"Decision on the Respondent's Request to Open a New Jurisdictional Phase\", 15 October 2018.\n\n544.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the situation is no different here, as the Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction\" in relation to the same intra-EU jurisdictional defense which Spain raised at the outset of the proceedings and on which the Tribunal ruled in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction.694 In PO19, the Tribunal considered that the *Achmea* judgment, the EC communication, and the fact sheet did not change the nature of the intra-EU objection already resolved by the Tribunal, as its essence remained the same.695 It can reach no different conclusion in this instance. Indeed, the Declarations which Spain now invokes purport to provide an interpretation \"on the legal consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on investment protection in the European Union\".696 Thus, in no way do they alter the intra-EU objection. They simply add possible legal arguments in support of it. This being so, the Tribunal is of the view that its holdings in the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction in respect of the intra-EU jurisdictional objection continue to be binding upon the Tribunal and cannot be re-opened. This conclusion is further consistent with the accepted principle that the relevant time for determining jurisdiction is the date of initiation of the proceedings.697\n\nSee Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, paras. 132-207.\n\nSee PO19, para. 28.\n\nSee the title of the 22 Member States Declaration. The Hungary Declaration bears the same title. Similarly, the 5 Member States Declaration concerns \"The Enforcement Of The Judgment Of The Court Of Justice In *Achmea* And On Investment Protection In The European Union\".\n\nSee *Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000* (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium) Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 3, para. 26 (\"The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case is referred to it, it continues to do so regardless of subsequent events [\u2026]\").\n\n545.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal declines to entertain the Respondent's request to \"reconsider ex officio its jurisdiction\" as a result of the Declarations.\n\n546.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent's second request, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not sufficiently established why it should \"invite\" the views of the other Member States on the matters set out above. While the Tribunal considers that it would have the authority under its broad procedural powers to invite non-disputing State parties to the ECT to provide their views on matters of interpretation of the Treaty, if circumstances so justify, it sees no sufficient reason for doing so in this case.\n\n547.\n\nFirst, whatever views Member States could advance before the Tribunal on this matter, they could not lead the Tribunal to re-open its jurisdictional question, for the reasons explained above. Such an invitation would thus ultimately serve no purpose and only burden the proceedings. Second, the Member States\u2019 views are reflected in the three Declarations and Spain has not explained what further input could be derived by requesting the EU Member States\u2019 comments. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is sufficient to look at the plain texts of the Declarations to observe that, while all EU Member States appear to be of the view that the *Achmea* judgment concerns the interpretation of EU law in relation to an investor-state arbitration clause contained in an intra-EU bilateral investment treaty, they are not unanimous in respect of *Achmea\u2019s* applicability to the ECT. For instance, in the words of the five Member States, which include Luxembourg, the State of nationality of a number of the Claimants in this proceeding, \"the *Achmea* judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy Charter Treaty\".698 This being so, these five Member States as well as Hungary have considered it \"inappropriate\" to express any views as regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.699\n\n5 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-215**, p. 3 (English version). See also Hungary's Declaration, **Exh. RLA-216**, p. 3, para. 8 (to a similar effect) (English version).\n\n5 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-215**, p. 3 (English version); Hungary' Declaration, **Exh. RLA-216**, p. 3, para. 9 (English version).\n\n548.\n\nIn fact, even the twenty-two Member States that take the view that Article 26 as applied in an intra-EU context \"would be incompatible with the [EU] Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied\",700 recognize that they \"will discuss without undue delay whether any additional steps are necessary to draw all the consequences from the *Achmea* judgment in relation to the intra-EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty\".701\n\n22 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-214**, p. 2 (English version).\n\n22 Member States Declaration, **Exh. RLA-214**, p. 4, para. 9 (English version).\n\n549.\n\nIt is thus clear that the States signatories to the three Declarations at present disagree as to whether *Achmea* applies to the ECT and, if so, with what consequences. As put by Hungary, \"[t]he ongoing and future applicability of the ECT in intra-EU relations requires further discussion and individual agreement amongst the Member States\" (emphasis added). Therefore, while such disagreement suggests that there is neither a subsequent agreement nor subsequent practice regarding the interpretation of the ECT under the VCLT, for present purposes it shows that seeking the views of the non-disputing EU State Parties to the Treaty would not assist the Tribunal\u2019s decision-making. Accordingly, the Tribunal denies the second request raised in the Respondent\u2019s submission of 7 March 2019.\n\n**B. Liability and Quantum**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Introductory Remarks**\n---------------------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis with the so-called Primary Claim, i.e. the claim that Spain\u2019s regulatory framework and the \"stabilization commitment\" which it contains, together with the specific assurances found in Spain\u2019s contemporaneous statements, gave rise to the legitimate expectation that the Claimants\u2019 installations would be entitled to receive the RD 661/2007 tariff for their operational life, and that the Disputed Measures have frustrated that expectation.702 It is only if the Tribunal were to reach the conclusion that the Primary Claim is ill-founded that it would address the Alternative Claim, i.e. the claim that the Claimants are not entitled to earn the FIT under the RD 661/2007 regime, but only the reasonable return offered by the regulatory regime at the time when they made their investments.703\n\nSee, e.g., PO12 C-PHB1, para. 1 (explaining that the \"Claimants' primary claim [\u2026] is that Spain's regulatory framework and the stabilisation commitment contained therein, together with the specific assurances contained in Spain's contemporaneous statements, gave rise to the legitimate expectation that Claimants' installations were entitled to receive the RD 661/2007 tariff for their operational life. The Disputed Measures have frustrated that expectation\"). See also *supra* V.A.\n\nSee *supra* V.B.\n\n551.\n\nBefore engaging with the analysis, the Tribunal notes that this arbitration is one of the numerous investment treaty cases which investors have brought against the Kingdom of Spain alleging that the Disputed Measures violated the ECT. The Parties have extensively discussed some of these cases,704 including *Charanne,705 Isolux,706 Eiser,707* and *Novenergia.*708 Other decisions, such as the one in *RREEF709* among others,710 became publicly available after the Parties\u2019 second PO12 PHBs and before the Tribunal closed these proceedings on 2 December 2019. On 4 December 2019, Spain drew the Tribunal's attention to two additional cases that had been rendered on the day of the closing of the proceedings *(Stadtwerke* and *BayWa).711* On 9 December 2019, the Tribunal noted that, in addition to the decisions or awards that were on record as legal authorities and the two additional awards just referred to, it was aware of a number of other publicly available decisions or awards rendered in other arbitrations brought against the Kingdom of Spain and which concerned the measures at issue in this case. The Tribunal gave the Parties the opportunity to comment on the awards which were not part of the record.712 Both Parties concurred that additional submissions on those awards were not necessary.713\n\nSee, e.g., PO12 C-PHB1, Section 10; PO12 R-PHB1, Section 5.\n\n*Charanne B.V.

To the Tribunal's knowledge based on decisions published on the ICSID website, the IAReporter, and/or italaw, decisions or award have been rendered in the following cases: [\u2026]\". The Tribunal also invited \"the Parties to advise the Tribunal if there are other decisions or awards rendered in arbitrations concerning the measures challenged in this arbitration, in addition to those just mentioned\". It also noted that it did \"not consider that it would be assisted by submissions on the awards listed above and the two decisions to which Spain drew its attention. However, if a Party wishes to file a short submission limited to these awards, it is invited to inform the Tribunal within the same time limit. The Tribunal would then give appropriate directions\").\n\nSee the Claimants' e-mail of 11 December 2019 (noting that \"[i]n view of the advanced stage of the proceedings, the Claimants do not consider it necessary for the Parties to file submissions on these decisions\") and the Respondent's e-mail of 11 December 2019 (noting that \"regarding the possibility of filing a further submission on the new decisions the Respondent agrees with the Tribunal in that at this stage of the process it would probably not assist the Tribunal to receive additional submissions\").\n\n552.\n\nIn accordance with the principle *jura novit curia* or more accurately *jura novit arbiter,714* the Tribunal has reviewed all of the decisions or awards rendered in investment treaty arbitrations that concern Spanish renewable energies. As just recalled, the Parties had an opportunity to comment on these cases. Although the Tribunal has found it helpful to consider all of these tribunals\u2019 findings, especially on those issues of law which appear similar across all Spanish renewable energy arbitrations, it has reached its own conclusion based on the facts, the submissions and claims before it. As will be seen from the analysis below, in addressing the arguments made by the Parties, the Tribunal often engages with the conclusions drawn by other tribunals (to either distance itself or find confirmation), including in particular on the interpretation of the ECT standards, the Spanish legal framework, the content of the investors\u2019 expectations, and Spain\u2019s alleged assurances. While it does not consider it necessary or useful to engage with each and every one of the known Spanish RE awards in detail, in addressing the arguments made by the Parties it indirectly explains its disagreement with those tribunals that have chosen another approach.\n\nSee *supra* VI.A.2.c.\n\n553.\n\nBy way of general overview of the outcomes of the Spanish RE cases, this Tribunal notes that tribunals have taken a variety of approaches in deciding whether Spain is to be held liable for its conduct in relation to the RE reforms. A number of tribunals (for instance in *Eiser, Masdar,* and *Novenergia)* have upheld claims that in substance were broadly similar to the Primary Claim in this arbitration. On the other end of the spectrum, three cases have resulted in a total dismissal of the claims *(Charanne, Isolux,* and *Stadtwerke).* Finally, a third group of tribunals have entertained and, in some cases, upheld - with nuances and non-identical approaches - claims that appear similar to the Alternative Claim (so for instance *RREEF* and *BayWa).715* The picture is thus by far not unanimous and rather shows a diversity of views between arbitral tribunals.\n\nSee also *Stadtwerke*, paras. 327 *et seq*., in particular 337, 353 and 355 (where the tribunal, after concluding that Spain's measures were reasonable and proportionate, \"nonetheless consider[ed] whether the impact upon the Claimants' investment specifically was reasonable or proportionate through an assessment of the rate of return earned by the Claimants' investment before and after the disputed measures\"); In this context, the existence of *RWE Innogy GMBH and RWE Innogy Aresa S.A.U. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/34, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability, and Certain Issues of Quantum, 30 December 2019 is also noted, but without more as this decision was issued after the Parties were given their last opportunity to comment.\n\n554.\n\nAs the reasons set forth below will show, the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the expectations which investors could derive from the regulatory framework and the reasonableness of Spain's changes to such framework lead it to dismiss the Primary Claim and thus move to assess the Alternative Claim. In reaching this conclusion, it follows a broadly similar route to the one chosen by the third group of tribunals identified in the preceding paragraph. By contrast and as a result of the chosen approach, this Tribunal's reasoning necessarily differs both from the one followed by tribunals that upheld claims similar in substance to the Primary Claim and by those that dismissed all claims. The difference in approach may be explained by a number of factors. First, the facts presented to this Tribunal may not be identical to those underlying other decisions. For instance, the arbitration in *Charanne* was limited to the 2010 Measures to the exclusion of the 2013 Measures; *Isolux* was concerned with investments made in October 2012, i.e. a few years after the last of the Claimants' investment, at a time when in the *Isolux* tribunal's view the regulatory framework for RE \"was being object of various studies which made its modification inevitable\";716 in *Masdar,* the investors had received specific individual confirmations from the State that their plants would receive the FIT payments across their life span;717 similarly, in *NextEra,* the claimants relied on specific assurances given to them.718 In addition to the facts, the claims raised in some of these arbitrations differed from the present ones. In particular, in several cases upholding claims akin to the Primary Claim, the tribunal appears to have been presented with no claim equivalent to the Alternative Claim (in the sense of an *actual claim,* and not merely a defense from the Respondent or alternative damages calculations from the experts).719 Thus, in spite of the identity or close similarity of the subject matter of the disputes and of the main issues of law, not all of the elements forming the basis of the decision may be identical and the Tribunal has accordingly had \"due regard to the circumstances of [this] particular case\" in reaching its decision.720\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016, **Exh.

It is not entirely unsurprising, and indeed to some extent to be expected in a system based on *ad hoc* adjudication, that arbitral tribunals may assess relevant circumstances in different ways.\n\n556.\n\nThe Tribunal will now interpret the standards of protection under Article 10(1) of the ECT *(infra* at VI.B.2). In light of the standards thus interpreted, it will assess whether the Disputed Measures violated the Treaty *(infra* at VI.B.3). Because the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Primary Claim cannot be upheld, it will move to examining the Alternative Claim *(infra* at VI.B.4).\n\n**2. The Standards of Protection Contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. ***Introductory Remarks***\n-----------------------------\n\n557.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT, which is invoked as the legal basis of the claims made in this arbitration, provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\n558.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that Spain's measures violated a number of the obligations contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. In their latest brief, they have summarized their case in the following terms:\n\n209. The Claimants claim that Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT in the following ways:\n\n(i) Spain has failed to *\"create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\".*\n\n(ii) Spain has failed to provide *\"fair and equitable treatment\"* (FET). The Claimants' claim for breach of the FET provision rests on three non-cumulative and distinct breaches of that provision. If Spain has breached any one of these three requirements, then a breach of FET is established. These breaches of the FET provision include:\n\n(A) the Disputed Measures have frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations;\n\n(B) Spain has not been transparent in its conduct; and\n\n(C) Spain has taken measures that are unreasonable, arbitrary and disproportionate.\n\n(iii) Spain has impaired the Claimants' investments through *\"unreasonable or discriminatory measures*\".\n\n(iv) Spain has failed to ensure that the Claimants' investments were afforded *\"the most constant protection and security\".*721\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 209 (emphasis in the original, bold removed).\n\n559.\n\nThe facts on which the Claimants base their claims in respect of each of these alleged breaches are largely the same. There is also some overlap between the various sub-elements of FET,722 as well as between some aspects usually considered part of FET and other obligations under the Treaty, such as the obligation not to \"impair by unreasonable [...] measures [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of investments to which the third sentence of such provision refers.723\n\nSee ASoC, para. 428 (\"There is an overlap between the above aspects of the FET standard. For example, an investor's legitimate expectations are closely connected with a State's duty to provide a stable legal and business framework for investments and not to act arbitrarily or adopt disproportionate measures. Ultimately, in applying the FET standard, the Tribunal must determine whether, in all of the circumstances of the case, Spain's actions vis-\u00e0-vis the investor were fair and equitable. Put differently, a determination as to what constitutes a breach of the FET standard 'cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case'\" (internal footnote omitted, emphasis removed)).\n\nSee ASoC, para. 490 (where the Claimants note that \"a breach of this obligation results in a simultaneous breach of the FET standard, as no action of the host State can be fair or equitable if it is unreasonable or discriminatory\").\n\n560.\n\nThis being so, the Tribunal starts its analysis with FET, which is the standard that is most prominent in the Parties\u2019 pleadings.\n\n**b.** ***Fair and Equitable Treatment***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**i.** ***Content***\n--------------------\n\n561.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides for a commitment of the Contracting Parties \"to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment\".\n\n562.\n\nUnder the rules of treaty interpretation, which have been examined in the Preliminary Award,724 Article 10(1) must be construed \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" (Article 31(1) of the VCLT). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 31(2) VCLT, \"[t]he context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty\". In limited circumstances, the Tribunal may have also regard to the supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 VCLT.\n\nSee Preliminary Award, paras. 95-96, 176, 252.\n\n563.\n\nStarting from the text of the Treaty, this Tribunal, like others, notes that the plain meaning of the words \"fair and equitable\" included in Article 10(1) of the ECT - as in many other investment treaties - does not provide much assistance.725 The tribunal in *MTD v. Chile,* for instance, observed that \"[i]n their ordinary meaning, the terms 'fair\u2019 and 'equitable\u2019 [...] mean 'just\u2019, 'even-handed\u2019, 'unbiased\u2019, 'legitimate\u2019\";726 while the tribunal in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* stated that unfair and inequitable treatment meant treatment \"in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective\".727 As noted in *Saluka,* \"[t]his is probably as far as one can get by looking at the 'ordinary meaning\u2019 of the terms of Article 3.1 of the Treaty\".728\n\nSee, e.g., *Ioan Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, **Exh. RLA-165,** para. 504.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile SA v.

See also *Ioan Micula and others v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, **Exh. RLA-165**, para. 504.\n\n564.\n\nIn their attempt to ascertain the ordinary meaning of similarly worded FET provisions found in investment treaties, arbitral tribunals have identified a number of inherent components of the standard.729 For instance, in *Electrabel,* the tribunal gave a description that encapsulates the consensus emerging from the jurisprudence about the core components of FET and reads as follows:\n\n[T]he obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment comprises several elements, including an obligation to act transparently and with due process; and to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or from frustrating the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework adversely affecting its investment.730\n\nSee, e.g., *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 29 July 2008, **Exh. CLA-34**, para. 609; *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 14 January 2010, **Exh. CLA-156**, para. 284.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, **Exh. CLA-160**, para. 7.74.\n\n565.\n\nTo the extent relevant to address the claims and prayers for relief before it, the Tribunal likewise considers that FET encompasses the protection of legitimate or reasonable expectations, the protection against arbitrary, unreasonable, and disproportionate conduct, and the principle of transparency.\n\n**ii.** ***FET and \"Stability\"***\n---------------------------------\n\n566.\n\nThis being said, it is true that the ECT appears to place a greater emphasis on \"stable\" conditions for investments than other treaties. The first sentence of Article 10(1) provides that the Contracting Parties shall \"encourage and create *stable*, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments\" (emphasis added). The second sentence adds that such conditions \"shall include a commitment to accord at all times\" FET to investments of investors. The Claimants have argued that the reference to stability should at a minimum inform the content of FET, if not act as a self-standing obligation under the Treaty.\n\n567.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that stability is a stand-alone or absolute requirement under the ECT;731 rather, it views it as a requirement that is intertwined with and closely linked to FET. This view is in line with findings of other tribunals. The tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria* observed for example that \"stable and equitable conditions are clearly part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT\".732 Similarly, the tribunal in *Electrabel v. Hungary* held that \"[f]air and equitable treatment is connected in the ECT to the encouragement to provide stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for investors\".733 Recent decisions issued in investment arbitrations under the ECT involving Spain endorse the same conclusion.734\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Isolux* that held that \"the Arbitral Tribunal did not find, in this Article, an autonomous obligation for the Contracting Parties to promote and create stable and transparent conditions for the performance of investments in its territory, and whose violation would generate rights in favour of the investors of other Contracting Party, *per se*\" (*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016, **Exh. RLA-202**, para. 764).\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, **Exh. CLA-152**, para. 173.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, **Exh. CLA-160**, para. 7.73.\n\nSee, e.g., *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016, **Exh. RLA-202**, para. 765; *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Award, 4 May 2017, **Exh.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Award, 15 June 2018, **Exh. CLA-244**, paras. 529-530.\n\n568.\n\nThis being so, in the Tribunal's opinion, the Treaty provides for the creation and maintenance of stable conditions as part of FET within well-defined limits which derive from the object and purpose of the Treaty. In this context, Article 2 of the Treaty, which is entitled \"purpose of the Treaty\", expressly refers to the European Energy Charter (or the \"Charter\"), a political declaration that formed the basis of the ECT:\n\nThis Treaty establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.\n\n569.\n\nTherefore, the object and purpose of the ECT must be assessed in light of the Charter which is part of its context, since it was made by the Parties in connection with the conclusion of the Treaty and accepted by them as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\nThe objectives of the Charter are expressed in Title 1 which articulates the following principles:\n\nWithin the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy resources and in a spirit of political and economic cooperation, [the signatories] undertake to promote the development of an efficient energy market throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market, in both cases based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented price formation, taking due account of environmental concerns. They are determined to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market principles in the field of energy.\n\n570.\n\nAs can be seen from these principles, the Parties to the ECT aimed at realizing a balance between the sovereign rights of the State over energy resources and the creation of a climate favorable to the flow of investments on the basis of market principles.735 In other words, while the purpose of \"promot[ing] long-term cooperation in the energy field\" which is stipulated in Article 2 of the Treaty may be facilitated by stability of the investment framework, the requirement of stability is not absolute; it must be balanced with other principles, including those that are directly derived from \"State sovereignty\", e.g. the State\u2019s right to regulate and to adapt the regulatory framework to changed circumstances. More generally, the protection of investments and the right to regulate operate in a balanced way under the ECT as in all other investment treaties.\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation of this conclusion in the statements in *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 239.\n\n571.\n\nBearing these considerations in mind, the Tribunal will now set out its understanding of the various elements inherent in Article 10(1) of the ECT, to the extent that they are relevant to the claims before it.\n\n**iii.** ***Legitimate Expectations, Reasonableness and Proportionality***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Claimants\u2019 case is that the Disputed Measures frustrated their legitimate expectations.736 As a matter of principle, the Parties agree that the FET standard protects legitimate expectations.737 They disagree, however, on the precise contours of such protection and on what the investors could legitimately expect under the circumstances.\n\nSee *supra* V.A.1.d and V.B.1.a.\n\nSee, e.g., SoD, para. 646, where Spain states that it \"does not disagree with [the] proposition\" made by the tribunal in *Saluka* whereby \"[t]he standard of 'fair and equitable treatment' is [\u2026] closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of the standard\" (*Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, **Exh. RLA-151,** para. 301).\n\n573.\n\nIn conformity with a number of other investment decisions, the Tribunal recalls, that the standard of protection of legitimate expectations is an objective and not a subjective one. Thus, in the words of *Charanne* :\n\nThe determination of whether the investor's legitimate expectations have been violated must be based on an objective standard or analysis. The mere subjective belief that the investor could have had at the time of making the investment does not suffice. Similarly, the application of this principle depends on whether the expectation has been reasonable or not in the specific case. In this regard, the representations that may have been made by the host State to encourage the investment are relevant.738\n\n*Charanne B.V. Construction lnvestments S.A. R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration No. 062/20121, Final Award, 21 January 2016, **Exh. RLA-190**, para. 495.\n\n574.\n\nOr, as was held in *Perenco v. Ecuador,* \"a central aspect of the analysis of an alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations as to the future treatment of its investment by the host State\" which requires \"an objective determination of such expectations having regard to all relevant circumstances\".739\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on pending issues related to jurisdiction and responsibility, 12 September 2014, **Exh. RLA-140**, para. 560. See also *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016, **Exh. RLA-202**, para. 777.\n\n575.\n\nIt is also commonly accepted that the investors\u2019 expectations must be assessed at the time of making the investment.740\n\n*National Grid plc v. Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 November 2008, **Exh. CLA-35**, para. 173; *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sayani A.\u015e. v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, **Exh.

CLA-156**, para. 264.\n\n576.\n\nFurther, expectations which are purported to be founded on general legislation have been treated with caution in a number of recent decisions. Those cases have highlighted the tension between claims of \"stability\" based on alleged legitimate expectations and the State\u2019s sovereign prerogative to adapt the regulatory framework to changed circumstances. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the statement in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* according to which:\n\nIt is common ground in the decisions of more recent investment tribunals that the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing circumstances.741\n\n*Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, para. 422.\n\n577.\n\nRecent cases dealing with alleged expectations arising from a regulatory framework have looked at a number of factors to ascertain whether the expectation at issue was *legitimate.* A first factor identified by tribunals is the existence of specific commitments given by the State to an investor. Second, tribunals have underscored that a change in regulatory framework affecting investors must be \"reasonable\" in order to be compliant with FET. Third, in what can be seen as an over-arching requirement (in line with the interplay between stability and FET highlighted above), an investor's legitimate expectations must be balanced with the State's right to regulate in the public interest. The Tribunal briefly discusses each of these factors in turn, in so far as they are pertinent for present purposes.\n\n578.\n\nFirst, the presence of a specific promise or representation made by the host State and relied upon by the investor may be important to determine the legitimacy of the investor's expectation in respect of the stability of the regulatory framework. Accordingly, for the tribunal in *EDF v. Romania*, \"[e]xcept where specific promises or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework. Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable\".742\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Rumania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, **Exh. RLA-141**, para. 217. See also *CEF Energia BV v. Italian Republic*, SCC Case No. 158/2015, Award, 16 January 2019, para. 185(10); *Antaris Solar GmbH and Dr. Michael G\u00f6de v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-01, Award, 2 May 2018, para. 360(10); *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. The Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, **Exh. RLA-158**, para. 332.\n\n579.\n\nThe tribunal in *Continental v. Argentina* further elaborated on these aspects in the following terms:\n\n[I]n order to evaluate the relevance of that concept [legitimate expectations] applied within [the] Fair and Equitable Treatment standard and whether a breach has occurred, relevant factors include:\n\ni) the specificity of the undertaking allegedly relied upon which is mostly absent here, considering moreover that political statements have the least legal value, regrettably but notoriously so;\n\nii) general legislative statements engender reduced expectations, especially with competent major international investors in a context where the political risk is high. Their enactment is by nature subject to subsequent modification, and possibly to withdrawal and cancellation, within the limits of respect of fundamental human rights and *ius cogens;* [...]743\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. the Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, **Exh. RLA-143**, para. 261 (emphasis added, internal footnotes omitted).\n\n580.\n\nSecond, it is not sufficient that a change in the regulatory framework is detrimental to the investors\u2019 interests in order to entail State responsibility under the ECT. The change must also be \"unreasonable\". The Tribunal shares the approach taken by the tribunal in *El Paso,* which underscored that \"[e]conomic and legal life is by nature evolutionary\"744 and that:\n\n[T]he legitimate expectations of any investor [...] [have] to include the real possibility of reasonable changes and amendments in the legal framework, made by the competent authorities within the limits of the powers conferred on them by the law.745\n\n*El Paso* *Energy International Company v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, **Exh. RLA-131**, para. 352.\n\n*El Paso* *Energy International Company v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, **Exh. RLA-131**, para. 400 (emphasis added). See also *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. The Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, **Exh. RLA-158**, para. 332 (holding that \"any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve over time. What is prohibited however is for a State to act unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power\").\n\n581.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Impregilo v. Argentina* noted that:\n\nThe legitimate expectations of foreign investors cannot be that the State will never modify the legal framework, especially in times of crisis, but certainly investors must be protected from unreasonable modifications of that legal framework.746\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011, **Exh. CLA-109**, para. 291 (emphasis added).\n\n582.\n\nThird, some tribunals have subjected the protection of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations to a balancing act that takes into account the investors\u2019 legitimate or reasonable expectations and the host State\u2019s right to regulate.747 The requirement for reasonableness of the changes and the balancing test involving the investor\u2019s interests and the State\u2019s right to regulate are, in turn, linked to the requirement of proportionality of the measures. Once again, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Electrabel* which held that:\n\n[...] the application of the ECT\u2019s FET standard allows for a balancing exercise by the host State in appropriate circumstances. The host State is not required to elevate unconditionally the interests of the foreign investor above all other considerations in every circumstance. As was decided by the tribunals in *Saluka v Czech Republic* and *Arif v Moldova,* an FET standard may legitimately involve a balancing or weighing exercise by the host State.\n\n[...]\n\nThat requires a balancing or weighing exercise so as to ensure that the effects of the intended measure remain proportionate in regard to the affected rights and interests. Provided that there is an appropriate correlation between the policy sought by the State and the measure, the decision by a State may be reasonable under the ECT\u2019s FET standard even if others can disagree with that decision. A State can thus be mistaken without being unreasonable.748\n\nSee, e.g., *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, **Exh. CLA-22**, para. 306; *Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015, **Exh.****RLA-166**, para. 165; *Rusoro Mining Limited v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, **Exh. RLA-194**, para. 525.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015, **Exh. RLA-166**, paras. 165 and 180 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n583.\n\nMoreover, it is also recognized that States, as the entities tasked with balancing the often competing interests involved, enjoy a margin of appreciation in the field of economic regulation.749 This means that an arbitral tribunal asked to review general economic regulation will normally not second-guess the State\u2019s choices; it will not review *de novo* whether they are well-founded, nor assess whether alternative solutions would have been more suitable. Governments often have to make controversial choices, which especially those directly affected may view as mistaken, based on misguided economic theory, placing too much emphasis on certain social values over others.750 It is not the task of an investment treaty tribunal to evaluate the policy choices that often underpin economic decisions. This being so, the margin of appreciation accorded to the State cannot be unlimited; otherwise the substantive treaty protections would be rendered wholly nugatory. In the Tribunal's view, the limits of the State's power are drawn by the principles of reasonableness and proportionality, which must guide a tribunal's assessment of the allegedly harmful changes in the legislation.751\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation for this conclusion in *RREEF* para. 262, noting that \"[i]n order to appreciate the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of the Claimants' expectations in the present case, it must be kept in mind that it is generally recognized that States are in charge of the general interest and, as such, enjoy a margin of appreciation in the field of economic regulations. As a result, the threshold of proof as to the legitimacy of any expectation is high and only measures taken in clear violation of the FET will be declared unlawful and entail the responsibility of the State\" (*RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 262).\n\nSee also similarly *SD Myers* (\"When interpreting and applying the \"minimum standard\", a Chapter tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making. Governments have to make many potentially controversial choices. In doing so, they may appear to have made mistakes, to have misjudged the facts, proceeded on the basis of a misguided economic or sociological theory, placed too much emphasis on some social values over others and adopted solutions that are ultimately ineffective or counterproductive. The ordinary remedy, if there were one, for errors in modern governments is through internal political and legal processes, including elections\") (*SD Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, **Exhs. CLA-9** ; **RLA-156**, para. 261).\n\nSee also *Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier dnd Michael Stein v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Award, 27 December 2016, **Exh. RLA-203**, para. 319(5) noting that \"[i]n the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime\".\n\n584.\n\nFinally, while the three factors elucidated above are relevant in determining whether an investor's expectations were legitimate under the circumstances, *mutatis mutandis* they will also guide the Tribunal in its review of alleged violations of other Treaty obligations be they sub-elements of FET (e.g., the prohibition of arbitrary or unreasonable measures) or separate standards of protection (e.g., the obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable measures) (see Article 10(1), third sentence).\n\n585.\n\nIn light of the principles just discussed, the Tribunal will now turn to the Primary Claim and examine whether the Disputed Measures violated Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**3. Primary Claim: Did the Disputed Measures Violate Article 10(1) of the ECT?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine whether Spain's measures frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations *(infra* at VI.B.3.a). It will then review whether the Disputed Measures were in breach of the other sub-elements of FET and guarantees provided in Article 10(1) of the ECT *(infra* at VI.B.3.b). Finally, it will draw its conclusions on the Primary Claim *(infra* at VI.B.3.c).\n\na. ***Legitimate Expectations***\n--------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants contend that the 2010 and 2013 Measures (defined above collectively as the \"Disputed Measures\") frustrated their legitimate expectations that they would enjoy the RD 661/2007 tariff for the lifetime of their plants.752\n\nSee *supra* V.A.1.d.\n\n588.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Disputed Measures are part of Spain\u2019s regulatory framework of the energy sector and in particular of the renewable energy sector. As such, the Tribunal considers that it should not review the Disputed Measures in isolation but rather in the context of this general framework.\n\n589.\n\nIt is not disputed that renewable energy (including photovoltaic, thermal, solar, wind and certain other technologies) offers significant environmental benefits. Nor is it contested that, due to the high capital requirements, renewable energy plants have not been able to compete with conventional forms of power generation utilizing fossil fuels. In other words, the market price of electricity is not sufficient to cover the costs of installing and operating renewable energy plants. Accordingly, like many other countries, Spain decided to promote the development of renewable energy through what are in essence State subsidies.753 As noted by the tribunal in *Antin v. Spain,* \"[t]he purpose of subsidization in this context is to allow the technologies to be developed in the hope that over time the costs associated therewith will decline, thus making RE technologies more competitive\".754\n\nSee also *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38, Award, 31 July 2019, para. 415 (\"PV plants cannot compete with conventional forms of energy production without substantial public subsidy or other form of incentive. They are capital-intensive, meaning that most of an investor's costs are incurred prior to operation (90%, according to Claimant's expert). They face a long period for capital recovery. Investments in PV plants are usually heavily leveraged (in the range of 55-80% leverage)\").\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Award, 15 June 2018, **Exh. CLA-244**, para. 540.\n\n590.\n\nThe legislative centerpiece in Spain\u2019s electricity regulation is the 1997 Electricity Law, which aimed at liberalizing the energy market. In order to encourage the production of energy from renewable sources, the 1997 Electricity Law created two distinct regimes: an \"Ordinary Regime\" applicable to conventional sources of energy production (such as coal-fired power plants) and a \"Special Regime\" applicable to facilities generating electricity from renewable energy sources and registered in the RAIPRE. Facilities qualifying under the Special Regime were entitled to the general, market-based remuneration applicable by default to all facilities plus a premium, to be set by the Government through regulation. Under the Law, the premium was intended to enable energy producers \"to achieve reasonable rates of return based on the cost of money in capital markets\" (Art. 30(4)). More precisely, in its version in force at the time when the Claimants made their investments, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law read as follows:\n\n4. The payment regime for electricity production facilities under the special regime shall be supplemented by the earning of a premium, under the terms set by regulation, in the following cases:\n\na) Facilities referred to in letter a) of section 1 of article 27.\n\nb) Hydroelectric power plants with installed capacity less than or equal to 10 MW, and all other facilities referred to in letter b) of section 1 of article 27. For the purposes of this Act, urban solid waste and hazardous waste will not be considered biomass.\n\nc) Hydroelectric plants between 10 and 50 MW, facilities referred to in letter c) of section 1 of article 27, as well as the facilities mentioned in paragraph two of section 1 of article 27.\n\nTo determine the premiums, the voltage level of electricity delivered to the network must be considered, along with the actual contribution to improvement of the environment, primary energy savings, and energy efficiency, the economically justifiable production of usable heat, and the investment costs that have been incurred, for the purpose of achieving **reasonable rates of return** with respect to the cost of money on the capital market.755\n\n1997 Electricity Law, **Exh. C-16**, Article 30.4 (Claimants' English translation) (emphasis added).\n\n591.\n\nFollowing the 1997 Electricity Law, Spain enacted a number of regulations which sought to specify the general parameters set out in the Law. These regulations were passed in the context of global, regional and national efforts to address climate change, aimed at the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide. Against the background of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, the European Union had also adopted rules committing Member States, including Spain, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.756 These rules included measures to encourage the use of renewable and other environment-friendly technologies.\n\nDirective 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, **Exh. RLA-123** ; Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, **Exh. RLA-125**.\n\n592.\n\nThe first instrument enacted by the Government to implement the 1997 Electricity Law was RD 2818/1998.757 A few years after, it was followed by RD 436/2004 of 12 March 2004, which for the first time in Spain provided a remuneration system based on a FIT.758 In its preamble, RD 436/2004 stressed the principle of reasonable profitability in the following terms:\n\nWhatever the remuneration mechanism selected, the Royal Decree guarantees owners of special regime installations a reasonable return on their investments and for electricity consumers an also reasonable allocation of costs attributable to the electricity system [...].759\n\nRD 2818/1998, **Exh. C-314**.\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exh. R-55**.\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exh. R- 55**, preamble (seventh paragraph) (emphasis added).\n\n593.\n\nRD 436/2004 also stipulated in Article 40.3 that the new remuneration system would not affect existing installations:\n\n[T]he tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements which result from any of the reviews covered by this Section shall be applicable solely to installations which enter operation after the date of entry into force referred to in the previous sub-section, without retrospective effect on previous tariffs and premiums.760\n\nRD 436/2004, **Exh. R- 55**, Art. 40.3.\n\n594.\n\nThe scheme of incentives provided under RD 436/2004 was first modified by RD 2351/2004 and RD 1454/2005, and eventually replaced first by RDL 7/2006761 and subsequently by RD 661/2007.762 The latter affected existing facilities registered under RD 436/2004, in spite of the rule contained in Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004.\n\nRDL 7/2006, **Exh. C-564**.\n\nRD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**.\n\n595.\n\nRD 661/2007, which was in force when the Claimants made their investments, among other things, provided a different FIT and modified the incentives in a number of respects. In its preamble, it stressed the principle of reasonable profitability in the following terms:\n\nThe economic framework established in this Royal Decree develops the principles contained in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the electricity sector, guaranteeing the owners of special regime facilities a reasonable return on their investments and electricity consumers a reasonable allocation of costs attributable to the electricity system [...].763\n\nRD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, preamble (seventh paragraph) (emphasis added) (Tribunal's translation).\n\n596.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Spain that the cardinal principle emerging from Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law and the implementing decrees up to RD 661/2007 is reasonable profitability or the guarantee of a reasonable rate of return for investors operating in the Special Regime. In other words, the 1997 Electricity Law established the principle of reasonable profitability or reasonable rate of return as general rule leaving it to the implementing regulation, to establish the means ensuring such reasonable profitability.\n\n597.\n\nStarting from 2010, in economic conditions that had significantly changed (as explained below), a number of regulations modified the incentives scheme provided by RD 661/2007. In 2010, the Government enacted RD 1565/2010 of 19 November 2010 and RDL 14/2010 of 23 December 2010, imposing restrictions and caps on the entitlement to the FIT. In 2013, Spain then introduced RDL 2/2013 substituting another index to CPI-linked updating mechanism for the FIT. Subsequently, it promulgated RDL 9/2013 in July 2013 and Law 24/2013 in December 2013, which replaced RD 661/2007 entirely with an incentive scheme based on different types of subsidies.\n\n598.\n\nIn respect of the regulatory framework in force at the time when they made their investments, the Claimants\u2019 main argument is that Spain provided \"stabilization commitments\" in RD 661/2007 and other representations which it was bound to observe for the lifetime of the qualifying plants. The Claimants place special reliance on Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 to support their argument that future changes could not affect the benefits they were promised under RD 661/2007 and that their expectation of a 25-year FIT in the amount specified in RD 661/2007 was legitimate.\n\n599.\n\nArticle 44.3 reads as follows:\n\nIn 2010, in view of the result of the follow-up reports on the extent to which the Renewable Energy Plan for 2005-2010 and the Energy Saving and Efficiency Plan for Spain (E4) have been achieved, as well as the new objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020, tariffs, premiums, additional payments, and lower and upper thresholds set out in this royal decree will be reviewed, taking into account the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in meeting demand and its impact on the technical and economic management of the system, guaranteeing reasonable returns with reference to the cost of money on capital markets. Every four years thereafter a new adjustment will be carried out using the above criteria.\n\nThe adjustments to the regulated tariff and the lower and upper thresholds referred to in this section will not affect the facilities for which the start-up document was issued before January 1 of the second year after the year in which the adjustment was implemented.764\n\nRD 661/2007 of 26 May 2007, **Exh. C-35**, Article 44.3 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n600.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to discern in this provision a stabilization commitment that would guarantee the Claimants an immutable tariff for the operational lifetime of their plants. For the Tribunal, a systematic interpretation of this provision in its proper context can lead to no other conclusion.\n\n601.\n\nAt the outset, it must be recalled that, as an act of general regulation, RD 661/2007 was subject to the power of the legislative bodies of Spain to change the applicable rules according to constitutional procedures and principles governing law-making. It is correct that Article 44.3 states that certain revisions that may occur in the future under that decree would not affect existing installations. However, that mere statement in and of itself does not make of Article 44.3 a stabilization commitment according to which the State guaranteed that future legislative or regulatory change would not affect the investment. Moreover, Article 44.3 cannot be read in isolation but must be viewed in the context of the entirety of the Spanish regulatory framework. This context includes a number of important elements.\n\n602.\n\nFirst, as is evident from the changes which occurred since the inception of the Special Regime in 1997, the regulatory framework was subject to continuous changes aimed at adapting it to the constantly evolving technological and economic circumstances. This propensity for change should have been clear to any reasonable operator investing in this sector.765 In particular, RD 661/2007 had been preceded by a multitude of changes in the previous decade. Furthermore and importantly, one of the instruments introducing changes, RD 436/2004, contained a clause analogous to Article 44.3, i.e. Art. 40.3, and that clause had not barred the Government from introducing still other changes through the very instrument (RD 661/2007) under which the Claimants decided to invest and on which they base their Primary Claim. In such a constantly evolving framework, the Tribunal does not see how an expectation of receiving the identical FIT during 25 years (only indexed to inflation) could have been reasonable.\n\nSee also *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016, **Exh. RLA-202**, para. 788 (\"the regulatory framework had already been modified several times. The proper RDs 6611/2007 and 1565/2008 were no more than amendments to RD 436/2004. After that, RD 1565/2010 and Royal Decree Law 14/2010 modified the established economic regime in RD 661/2007 for the photovoltaic sector. All of these regulations issued for the implementation of Law 54/1997, of 27 November 1997, regarding the Electrical Sector (LSE), showed a very unstable character of a regulatory framework that the government has the power and the duty to adapt to the economic and technical needs of the moment, within the LSE framework\").\n\n603.\n\nSecond, in rulings on the various decrees that followed one another through the years, the Spanish Supreme Court had similarly held that an investor should reasonably have expected possible changes in the regulatory framework. For a tribunal operating under international law, domestic judgments are mainly \"facts\". As facts, they are relevant to the assessment of the existence of reasonable expectations. As the tribunal in *Charanne* held,\n\n[a]lthough these decisions by the Spanish courts are not binding on this Arbitral Tribunal, they are factually relevant in order to verify that the investor was unable, at the time of the disputed investment, to have the reasonable expectation that, in the absence of a specific commitment, the regulation was not going to be modified during the lifespan of the plants.766\n\n*Charanne B.V. Construction lnvestments S.A. R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration No. 062/20121, Final Award, 21 January 2016 **, Exh. RLA-190**, para. 508.\n\n604.\n\nObviously, only judgments issued prior to the Claimants' investments could inform their legitimate expectations. Thus, to assess the legitimacy or reasonableness of expectations, the Tribunal disregards later decisions. For the sake of completeness, it nevertheless observes that subsequent decisions did not contradict the Court's earlier pronouncements.\n\n605.\n\nThe first relevant judgment was rendered by the Supreme Court on 15 December 2005. There, the Court addressed the changes that RD 436/2004 had introduced to the previous regulations governing the economic regime for renewable energies. The Court held that the State has the power to amend a system of remuneration to modify the electricity sector, provided it complies with the general framework provided by the 1997 Electricity Law:767\n\nThere is no legal obstacle for the Government, in the exercise of its regulatory powers and the broad prerogatives which it enjoys in a heavily regulated sector such as electricity, to modify a specific system of remuneration provided that it remains within the framework established in the ESL [the 1997 Electricity Law] (RCL 1997, 2821). (Tribunal's translation)\n\nJudgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 15 December 2005, Appeal No. 73/2004, **Exh. R-182**, p. 15 (Respondent's English translation).\n\n606.\n\nLess than one year later, on 25 October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled on a challenge to the legality of RD 2351/2004, which had modified RD 436/2004. It insisted that operators entering a regulated market functioning with economic incentives must be aware that an incentive scheme may be amended as long as it stayed within the scope of the guarantee of reasonable profitability anchored in the 1997 Electricity Law. It is helpful for our purposes to quote the pertinent passages in full:\n\nThe appeal, raised on these terms, cannot be upheld. As the State Attorney rightly states, the owners of electricity production installations under the special regime do not have an \"unalterable right\" to remain in an unchanged economic regime governing the collection of premiums. The scheme is designed to promote renewable energy by an incentive mechanism which, like all those of this type, does not guarantee to remain unchanged in the future.\n\nIt is true that in this case fixing the premiums is subject to legislative guidelines, as stated above, but it is also true that the Council of Ministers can, respecting them, introduce quantitative variations in formulas by which the premiums are periodically authorised or their calculation. If the modification has not deviated from these legal guidelines and, again, there is no allegation of infringement of Article 30 of the Law on the Electrical Sector, it will be difficult to consider them as contrary to law.\n\nThe value of \"legal certainty\" cannot be applied to a regulatory amendment as allegedly invalidating this argument. It is true that the rules should provide some stability to the regulatory frameworks of economic activities (in fact in the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, amended by the provision now under challenge, stated that \"(...) this new methodology for calculating the special regime charges, for the security and stability it offers, should help encourage investment in this type of installation\"), but so it is that legal certainty is not incompatible with the regulatory changes from the perspective of their validity, which is the only factor on which we can decide in law.\n\nThe same consideration applies to the principle of legitimate expectations, increasingly but unduly deployed as an argument against quite a few regulatory changes that some economic operators have deemed more or less harmful to their interests. The appellants argue that their investments in the production of electrical energy under the special regime were made at a particular time \"when they trusted the Government not to change the legal conditions that decided them to (...) build their facility\". This premise leads them to conclude that the reduction of premiums subsequent to Royal Decree 2351/2004 with respect to those in Royal Decree 435/2004 is contrary to the principle.\n\nWe cannot agree that this reasoning can be applied to an incentive mechanism such as the premiums in question. Until replaced by another, the above outlined legal regulation (Article 30 of the Electricity Law) allows the respective companies to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be included as a factor relevant, **to their obtaining \"reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market\"** or, to put it again in the words of the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, **\"reasonable compensation for their investment\".** However, the payment regime under examination does not guarantee to special regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or that the formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.\n\nIn the same manner as on the basis of economic policy factors of very different sign (relating to the promotion of renewable energy but also the planning of electricity sector networks, as well as other energy saving and efficiency considerations), premiums and incentives for the production of electricity under the special regime can increase from one year to another, they may also fall when these same considerations also so advise. Provided that, we would stress, these changes are kept within the legal limits which discipline this mode of promotion, the mere fact that the updating or economic direction of the premium rises or falls does not constitute in itself grounds for nullity or affect the legitimate expectation of recipients.\n\nUndertakings which freely decide to enter the market, such as the energy generation market under the special regime, knowing beforehand that it is to a large part dependent on public authorities fixing economic incentives, are or must be aware that these incentives can be modified within the legal guidelines, by such authorities. One of the \"regulatory risks\" to which they submit, which they must necessarily bear, is precisely that of variation in the parameters of the premiums or incentives. that the Electricity Sector Law tempers, as previously discussed, but does not exclude such variation.768\n\nJudgment of Section Three of the Supreme Court of 25 October 2006, Appeal No. 12/2005, legal ground no. 3, **Exh. R-67**, pp. 3-4 (emphasis added) (Respondent's English translation).\n\n607.\n\nIn two later judgments, dating from 20 March and 9 October 2007, the Supreme Court adopted similar rulings.769\n\nJudgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 20 March 2007, Appeal No. 11/2005, **Exh. R-174** ; Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 9 October 2007, Appeal No. 13/2006, **Exh. R-164**.\n\n608.\n\nThus, at the time when the Claimants made their investments, the Spanish Supreme Court had rejected challenges to the various modifications of the regulatory incentive mechanisms and denied that investors had a vested right to specific subsidies. It is true that these decisions concerned the regulations preceding RD 661/2007, and not RD 661/2007 itself, and may have covered different types of installations. Yet, the Court\u2019s reasons address the State\u2019s power to modify regulatory incentives in a general manner that appears valid irrespective of the specifics of the actual case before it. As a result, a reasonably informed investor should have known that changes in the regulatory framework could occur. In other words, these judgments sent a clear message that the remuneration offered to *any* kind of installations under the Special Regime could be amended.\n\n609.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the finding in *Charanne* that:\n\n[the] case law from the highest courts in Spain [...] clearly established, prior to the investment, the principle that domestic law allows for changes to be made to the regulation. [...] at the time of making the investment in 2009, the Claimants could have carried out an analysis of the Spanish legal framework in relation to their investment and understood that the regulations enacted in 2007 and 2008 could be modified.770\n\n*Charanne B.V. Construction lnvestments S.A. R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration No. 062/20121, Final Award, 21 January 2016, **Exh. RLA-190**, paras. 504, 507.\n\n610.\n\nThe Supreme Court's holdings reviewed above were then confirmed in a number of judgments issued in December 2009 dealing with complaints that arose from the replacement of RD 436/2004 by RD 661/2007.771 While these judgments are not relevant to ascertain the expectations of the Claimants, as they were handed down at the time when the investments were being finalized or were already completed,772 they are noteworthy because they confirm the principles set in the earlier judgments and thus show a consistent jurisprudence.\n\nJudgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 3 December 2009, Appeal No. 151/2007, **Exh. R-183** ; Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 9 December 2009, Appeal No. 152/2007, **Exh. R-180** ; Judgment of Section Three of the Spanish Supreme Court of 9 December 2009, Appeal No. 149/2007, **Exh. R-235**.\n\nSee Claimants' Demonstrative, Table A \"The PV Investors' Plants\" (detailing the relevant dates of the Claimants' investments).\n\n611.\n\nIn sum, prior to the Claimants' investment and thereafter, the Spanish courts had consistently held that tariffs and related incentives were not \"immutable\" and investors had no vested right to specific subsidy for the future; that RD 436/2004 did not freeze the remuneration system in spite of Article 40.3; that the State had the power to change the regulatory system, and that the law guaranteed operators that they would achieve a reasonable rate of return on investments.\n\n612.\n\nWith that background in mind and in light of all circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable for investors to have expected - from an objective viewpoint and regardless of what their subjective belief may have been - that no regulatory changes to RD 661/2007 affecting their investments would ever occur.\n\n613.\n\nIt is in this context that the arguments and submissions in respect of the investor's due diligence must be viewed. For the Tribunal, this debate lacks relevance for present purposes. Indeed, whether the Claimants engaged in diligence or not and whether that diligence was \"due\" or not, cannot alter the fact that on the basis of the law and the jurisprudence the Claimants knew or should have known that changes to the regulatory framework could happen. As a consequence, expectations that they would not happen cannot be deemed legitimate.\n\n614.\n\nSo far, the analysis shows that the regulatory framework, including RD 661/2007, did not provide for a stabilization guarantee according to which investors would enjoy an immutable tariff for the life of their plants. It remains to be seen whether a different conclusion may arise from other alleged \"representations\" or \"assurances\" by Spain, its organs, and institutions linked to the Government. While it is true that Spain launched a campaign to promote the regulations and attract \"green\" investments, the Tribunal is of the view that none of the representations invoked by the Claimants constitute promises not to change the incentives contained in RD 661/2007.\n\n615.\n\nThese representations, too, must be placed in their proper context, i.e. that of a constantly evolving framework for which there was no suggestion that the State had somehow waived its sovereign prerogatives to change the laws or regulations. None of the documents, presentations, press releases, at issue are specific enough to \"lead anyone to reasonably infer that the regulated tariff would remain unmodified during the entire lifespan of the plants\".773 For instance, the press release issued by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism on 25 May 2007774 does no more than reiterate the content of RD 661/2007. Furthermore, the documents, in particular PowerPoint presentations, prepared by IDAE, InvestInSpain and the CNE775 are too general as to engender legitimate expectations that the framework could not be modified. They also make clear that the incentives granted by Spain are policy tools to achieve the targets set by Spanish and EU regulations sufficient to grant investors \"reasonable profitability\".776 It should also be borne in mind that these entities were not empowered to enact rules or regulations on energy issues in Spain.777 Thus, none of the additional \"assurances\" is susceptible of changing the clear position that emerges from RD 661/2007 read systematically against the backdrop of the 1997 Electricity Law and from the interpretation of the regulatory framework given by Spain's highest court.\n\n*Charanne B.V.

As the Tribunal has already noted, investors could legitimately expect to receive a reasonable return on their investments. This entitlement is enshrined first and foremost in the 1997 Electricity Law, which is the cornerstone of the Spanish electricity system. It is repeated in the preamble to RD 436/2004 and later, more importantly, in that of RD 661/2007. In other words, reasonable profitability or the \"guarantee\" of reasonable rates of return, to use the terms of the preamble of RD 661/2007, was the regulatory framework's *leitmotiv*, the essential feature underpinning all of the instruments that were enacted through the years. The requirement of reasonable profitability restricted the State's power to amend the framework and thereby guaranteed a level of stability of the conditions in which investors operated. Differently put, that requirement ensures the existence of \"stable conditions\" pursuant to Article 10(1) of the ECT.778\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation of its conclusion that any expectation that investors could legitimately have had was to obtain a reasonable rate of return on their investment in the holding of the tribunal in *RREEF* which held that \"[t]he Claimants cannot prevail themselves of a fixed rate of return for their investment. However, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that, whatever the means chosen by the Respondent, the Claimants could legitimately expect a return for their investment at a reasonable rate which implies significantly above a mere absence of financial loss, the precise average rate taking into account the actual cost of money on capital markets for such investments as well as other objectives\". See *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 387. See also *BayWa*, para. 498 (noting that \"this Tribunal agrees with the *RREEF* tribunal that the only legitimate expectation the Claimants could have had was that of a 'reasonable return' in terms of Law 54/1997\").\n\n617.\n\nMore specifically, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law provides for the achievement of \"*reasonable* rates of return with respect to the cost of money on the capital market\". Accordingly, an investor is entitled to a return, i.e. it is entitled to make a profit after having paid its capital and operating expenses. Moreover, the reasonableness of the profit or return must be measured by reference to the cost of money in financial matters.\n\n618.\n\nIt should be added that, in all relevant legislative and regulatory instruments, the principle of reasonable return or profitability is always intertwined with other considerations, in particular the State's concern about the cost of electricity and the competitiveness with other means of production of energy.779\n\nSee RD 436/2004, **Exh. R- 55,** preamble; RD 661/2007, **Exh. C-35**, preamble. See also *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 385.\n\n619.\n\nFurthermore, in the Tribunal's view, the guarantee to obtain a reasonable return does not imply that it acts as a \"cap\". When RD 661/2007 was in force (and the economic conditions allowed it), it cannot be doubted that efficient installations could outperform the reasonable return target and were entitled to keep the profits which the system allowed them to make. In this sense, the Tribunal does not agree with Spain's characterization of those returns as \"windfall\" or \"luxury\" profits. However, the principle of reasonable return places a limit on regulatory changes in the future, in the sense that, when the changed economic conditions prompted Spain to modify RD 661/2007, these modifications could not affect the reasonable rates of return that were promised under the 1997 Electricity Law.\n\n620.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing discussion, the Primary Claim must be dismissed insofar as it relates to their alleged expectations of obtaining the fixed tariff under RD 661/2007. As a result, the Tribunal will examine the Alternative Claim and determine whether the Disputed Measures frustrated the Claimants' legitimate expectations of a reasonable return *(infra* at VI.B.4). Before doing so, it must, however, review the other elements of the Primary Claim.\n\n**b.** ***Other Alleged Breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n621.\n\nBefore moving to the Alternative Claim, the Tribunal thus addresses the other elements of the Primary Claim, namely the allegations that regardless of legitimate expectations, the regulatory changes were unreasonable, arbitrary, disproportionate, non-transparent, or violated the full protection and security standard.\n\n622.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Spain's \"abrupt and drastic changes\"780 to the regulatory framework were unreasonable, arbitrary, and disproportionate, because \"the guarantees of the RD 661/2007 economic regime that had seduced many investors -such as the Claimants - were dismantled and repudiated\".781 More specifically, for the Claimants \"[i]t was [...] unreasonable to strip the Claimants of the key elements of the regulatory regime upon which their investments were made\".782 They also argue that the regulatory changes were \"arbitrary\" within the meaning given by the ICJ in the *ELSI* case because \"Spain committed to provide the FIT at a fixed level for 25 years and then, at a lower level, in subsequent years. It provided an express 'guarantee\u2019 that this FIT would not be changed for existing plants. Once this had successfully induced the investment [...] Spain wanted, Spain simply withdrew the regime. It cannot be disputed that such behaviour shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\".783 Finally, the Claimants contend that the Disputed Measures were \"disproportionate\" as \"there is no reasonable relationship between the burden imposed on the Claimants\u2019 investments and the stated goal of addressing the Tariff Deficit. Spain\u2019s measures had a disproportionate impact on the Claimants\u2019 investments and were introduced notwithstanding Spain's alternative options to adopt less harmful measures to ECT-protected investments\".784 In particular, the Claimants submit that the tariff deficit was largely the product of Spain\u2019s own failure to comply with its laws and in any event there were alternative less harmful solutions to address that problem.785\n\nReply, para. 602.\n\nASoC, para. 56.\n\nASoC, para. 478.\n\nReply, para. 617.\n\nASoC, para. 57(v).\n\nASoC, para. 493.\n\n623.\n\nIt arises from this summary of the Claimants\u2019 arguments that like for legitimate expectations, the alleged violations of other standards embodied in Article 10(1) are predicated upon the entitlement to the RD 661/2007 tariff. In line with its earlier conclusion that the Claimants could not legitimately expect the immutability of such tariff, the Tribunal is equally unable to accept that the elimination of RD 661/2007 and related benefits in itself constituted conduct that was unreasonable, disproportionate, arbitrary, or otherwise not \"fair and equitable\". Indeed, accepting a violation of the Treaty on these grounds would be tantamount to endorsing the immutability of the RD 661/2007 tariff, which would be contrary to the conclusion reached above in respect of legitimate expectations. The position would be different if the changes were shown to deprive the Claimants of a reasonable return, as opposed to a fixed remuneration scheme. However, this is the subject of the Alternative Claim; it is not the basis of the present claim.\n\n624.\n\nEven if the mere fact of changing the RD 661/2007 tariff was not a violation in and of itself, the changes could arguably still be unreasonable, disproportionate, or arbitrary. In this connection, the Tribunal disagrees with the approach of other tribunals that have held that \"the Claimants are in a worse position under the New Regulatory Regime than they would have been had the Respondent not abrogated the RD 661/2007 regime [and] are therefore entitled to compensation for the Respondent\u2019s breach of Article 10(1) ECT\".786 In this Tribunal\u2019s view, to establish liability as a result of regulatory changes, it is not sufficient that the investor is in a \"worse position\" than it would have been under RD 661/2007. Rather, the Treaty requires that the changes must be unreasonable, arbitrary, or disproportionate.787\n\n*Greentech Energy Systems A/S and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. V (2015/150), Final Award, 14 November 2018, **Exh. CLA-245**, para. 533.\n\nSee also *Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, **Exh. CLA-160**, para. 7.77 (\"While the investor is promised protection against unfair changes, it is well-established that the host State is entitled to maintain a reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in the public interest. Consequently, the requirement of fairness must not be understood as the immutability of the legal framework, but as implying that subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently and predictably, taking into account the circumstances of the investment\").\n\n625.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Disputed Measures were unreasonable, arbitrary or disproportionate because the new regime does not guarantee them the same tariff, or the same types of incentives, or returns comparable to those they made at the time of investment. The Respondent, for its part, has offered sufficient justifications for the enactment of the Disputed Measures which exclude a breach of the ECT on the grounds addressed here.\n\n626.\n\nIn analyzing the justifications put forward by the Respondent in support of the Disputed Measures, as recalled above,788 the Tribunal must be satisfied \"that there is an appropriate correlation between the policy sought by the State and the measure\".789 Further, in assessing a State\u2019s regulatory measures of general economic impact, the Tribunal owes a measure of deference to the Respondent.790\n\nSee *supra* para. 582.\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015, **Exh.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 468 (observing that \"the Respondent enjoys a margin of appreciation in conducting its economic policy; therefore, it will not substitute its own views either on the appropriateness of the measures at stake or on the characterization of the situation which prompted them; in particular, the Tribunal will abstain to take any position on the issue of the existence of other or more appropriate possible measures to face this situation\").\n\n627.\n\nThis being so, the Tribunal notes that the regulatory changes were prompted by a range of factors. While in 2007, Spain\u2019s economy was growing at a pace of 3.7%, in 2009 after the global economic crisis, its GDP growth had turned negative to -3.6%.791 Unemployment grew from 8% in 2007 to 25% in 2012.792 The negative evolution of the Spanish economy as a result of the financial crisis produced a substantial reduction in demand of electricity during the period 2009-2013793 and the tariff deficit rose from EUR 2 billion in 2005 to EUR 28.5 billion at the end of 2013, representing almost 3% of its GDP.794 This rise cannot be attributed to the fact that the State had not increased electricity prices in the year preceding the Disputed Measures. Indeed, Spain has demonstrated that it did proceed to price increases.795\n\nSee data provided by the World Bank at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.kd.zg.\n\nSee data provided by the World Bank at https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sl.uem.totl.zs.\n\nSee MG&A Report, para. 220. See also *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38, Award, 31 July 2019, para. 434 (\"The Tribunal accepts Respondent's contention that the economic crisis led to a decline in demand for electricity, with consequent increase in the tariff deficit\").\n\nSee European Commission, \"Macroeconomic imbalances: Country Report \u2013 Spain 2015\", European Economy Occasional Papers 216 (June 2015), **Exh.

In simple terms, it could have either imposed the burden on the producers, or on the consumers, or on the state budget. Rather than selecting one option over another, it chose a middle course, i.e. it reduced the producers\u2019 rate of return while still guaranteeing a reasonable profit. The revised rate of return was approved by the European Commission796 and is aligned with those granted by other European Union Member States, such as France, Italy, Estonia, Latvia,797 and the Czech Republic.798 There was thus an appropriate correlation between the policy objectives pursued by Spain and the Disputed Measures that diminished the amount required for subsidies in the renewable energy sector.\n\nSee European Commission Decision on the State Aid SA.40348 (2015/NN) regarding Spain's Support for Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy Sources, Cogeneration and Waste, 10 November 2017, **Exh.

RLA-213**, paras. 406, 420, 451.\n\n629.\n\nSpain also sought to avoid increasing the price of electricity charge to consumers even further. The Tribunal finds no element of unreasonableness or arbitrariness in Spain\u2019s assertion that \"in an economy heavily impacted by the economic crisis, to continue increasing the tariff payable by consumers was not an option as consumers had less capacity to pay due to the unemployment level and per capita income and such a measure could have only contributed to worsen the economic situation\".799\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 18.\n\n630.\n\nTherefore, subject to considering whether the Disputed Measures continue to afford the Claimants a reasonable rate of return (a question that is part of the Alternative Claim), the Tribunal considers that the Disputed Measures were not unreasonable, arbitrary, and disproportionate. It thus dismisses the Primary Claim insofar as it is based on these additional legal grounds, whether rooted in the FET standard or in the separate obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable measures.\n\n631.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants complain that the enactment of the Disputed Measures violated Spain\u2019s obligation to treat investors transparently. The Tribunal considers that the record does not bear this complaint. It is not established that Spain was not forthcoming with information on the intended changes in regulations. To the contrary, the Tribunal observes that Spain engaged in dialogue with investors prior to making changes and subjected the intended modifications to public consultations,800 in the context of which numerous industry associations and companies submitted comments.801\n\nSee, e.g. National Energy Commission Report on the proposal of a Royal Decree to regulate and modify certain aspects relative to the special regime, 14 September 2010, **Exh. R-197** ; Government of Spain National Program of Reforms 2012, **Exh. R-177**, pp. 2-9 (Respondent's English Translation); \"The Reforms of the Spanish Government: Determination in the face of the Crisis\", Ministry of the Presidency of the Government of Spain, September 2012, **Exh.

R-162**.\n\nSee, e.g., Information regarding the public consultation on measures for regulatory adjustment in the energy sector of 2 February 2012 and 9 March 2012 published on the website of the National Energy Commission, **Exh. R-32**.\n\n632.\n\nNeither does the record show that the Claimants were \"left in the dark\" for eleven months between RDL 9/2013 and the time when the Parameters Order was issued. The Tribunal does not find that the time elapsed between these two instruments involved a Treaty breach. Legislative processes often include consultation steps involving a variety of stakeholders - which *fosters* rather than hinders transparency -and these consultations may typically entail delays in the issuance of the final piece of legislation. In any event, the Claimants acknowledge that \"RDL 9/2013 provided that during this period the old regime would continue to apply\" and that \"producers would continue to sell electricity under the former regime\".802 Hence, even if the delay had violated the transparency obligation *(quod non),* that violation would have caused no harm. Finally, the Claimants also rely on the fact that the so-called *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* had not been published. While the *Memoria* was not published in the State Official Gazette, Spain has sufficiently established that it was \"publicly available\" upon request as it formed part of the \"regulatory dossier\" of draft RD 661/2007,803 which in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion rules out a breach of transparency.\n\nReply, para. 264.\n\nSee, e.g., Council of State Report of 26 April 2007 regarding Draft Royal Decree regulating the activity of electricity production under the special regime and of certain facilities of assimilated technologies of the ordinary regime, issued by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism, ref. 683/2007, **Exh. R-167**, pp. 4, 6-7 (Spanish version).\n\n633.\n\nFinally, the Claimants raise a claim for breach of the full protection and security (FPS) standard. They base such claim on the same facts as those underlying the FET claims, and allege that \"for reasons considered at Section 7 above [of the ASoC], Spain\u2019s measures have destroyed the legal framework of the investments. They are therefore in breach of the FPS standard\".804 The Claimants further argue that \"the New Regime represents a complete overhaul of the regulatory regime (RD 661/2007) undermining the very foundations on which the Claimants made their investments\". According to them that regime \"no longer provides the stable and predictable revenue streams at levels sufficient to service the required financing, nor does the New Regime provide the returns that justified investing in the Spanish PV sector in 2007 and 2008\".805 The obligation of full protection and security, so the Claimants continue, has been breached \"as the Disputed Measures have caused Claimants to lose their right to the FIT\".806\n\nASoC, para. 497.\n\nReply, para. 651.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 256.\n\n634.\n\nAssuming for the sake of discussion that FPS encompasses legal as opposed to physical protection, it remains that the FPS claim is predicated upon the loss of the guarantees established in RD 661/2007. As such, for the very reasons discussed in relation to that loss in the context of the FET grounds, this claim cannot succeed either.\n\n635.\n\nAs a last point, the Tribunal reverts to the European Commission's decision on State Aid dated 10 October 2017, which it has carefully reviewed along with the Parties' related submissions and the European Commission's observations of 19 June 2018. In this connection, the Tribunal observes that the decision primarily concerns the lawfulness of the new regulatory regime under EU state aid law and does not rule on the compatibility of RD 661/2007 with EU state aid rules. This being so, the Tribunal does not consider that its conclusions are incompatible with the findings of the European Commission on the Disputed Measures. The Tribunal notes in particular that in paragraph 120 the Commission took the following view:\n\nSpain has submitted cash flow calculations of 21 standard facilities. These are representative of the various technologies and installation types supported by the scheme. The data show the past sales income (including those deriving from the premium economic scheme for existing facilities), the expected future sales income, the initial investment costs, the operating costs and the compensation to be granted to each facility both for operations and for investments. For all examples provided, the Commission has verified that the aid does not exceed what is required to recover the initial investment costs and the relevant operational costs, plus a margin of reasonable return, based on the past and estimated costs and market prices (7,503 % before tax for new facilities and 7,398 % for existing facilities). These rates appear to be in line with the rates of return of renewable energy and high efficiency cogeneration projects recently approved by the Commission and does not lead to overcompensation.[FN 57]\n\n[FN 57] See for example the decisions in cases SA.47205 *Compl\u00e9ment de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour l'\u00e9olien terrestre \u00e0 partir de 2017* (France), SA. *43756 Support to electricity for renewable sources* (Italy), SA.36023 *Support scheme for electricity produced from renewable sources and efficient cogeneration* (Estonia), SA.43140 *Support to renewable energy and CHP* (Latvia), SA.43719 Syst\u00e8me d'aides aux cog\u00e9n\u00e9rations au gaz naturel \u00e0 haute efficacit\u00e9 \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique (France).807\n\nEuropean Commission Decision on the State Aid SA.40348 (2015/NN) regarding Spain's Support for Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy Sources, Cogeneration and Waste, 10 November 2017, **Exh.

However, the Arbitration Tribunals are not competent to authorise the granting of State aid. That is an exclusive competence of the Commission. If they award compensation, such as in *Eiser v Spain,* or were to do so in the future, this compensation would be notifiable State aid pursuant to Article 108(3) TFEU and be subject to the standstill obligation.808\n\nEuropean Commission Decision on the State Aid SA.40348 (2015/NN) regarding Spain's Support for Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy Sources, Cogeneration and Waste, 10 November 2017, **Exh. RLA-201**, para. 165.\n\n637.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted the Claimants\u2019 view that these explanations are \"incorrect as a matter of [EU] law\".809 This question may be left open, in particular because the Tribunal must rule on the basis of the ECT and not on projections of hypothetical consequences of the award. The Tribunal also observes that the Commission\u2019s and Spain\u2019s conclusions on this point appear premised on the possibility that an arbitral tribunal were to award compensation along the lines of the Primary Claim (see the Commission\u2019s reference to the award in *Eiser*), which claim the Tribunal does not uphold. By contrast, there seems to be no suggestion either from the Commission or from Spain that an award would constitute State aid if made on the basis of the Alternative Claim (which takes as a starting point *Spain's* defense that the Claimants could legitimately expect reasonable profitability).\n\nClaimants' Submission on the European Commission's Decision SA.40348 (2015/NN), paras. 17 *et seq*.\n\n**c.** ***Conclusions on the Primary Claim***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n638.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Primary Claim cannot be upheld. In summary, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that from the start of the Special Regime for RE with the 1997 Electricity Law, the Spanish legislature provided that investors would be entitled to \"reasonable profitability\" of their investments. The reasonable return on investments was also a key element of the regime established by RD 661/2007. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the principle of reasonable return serves as the limit of ECT-compliant regulatory changes. If changes cross the \"reasonable return\" line, that is if they deprive investors of a reasonable return, the State conduct transgresses the standards contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n639.\n\nIn other words, the Claimants are only entitled to compensation under Article 10(1) of the ECT if they establish that the new regime violates the guarantee of reasonable rate of return.810 This approach strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the protection of investors who have committed substantial resources in a sector which continues to provide Spain with the environmental benefits of clean solar power, and, on the other hand, Spain's right to regulate and adapt its framework to changed circumstances, provided that right is exercised in a manner that is proportionate, reasonable, and non-arbitrary manner.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the tribunal in *RREEF* has reached a similar conclusion. See *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 523: \"[\u2026] the Tribunal considers that, while entitled to compensation for unreasonable return on their investments \u2013 if established -, the Claimants cannot claim full compensation for the total decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of the new regime by the Respondent; they can only get compensation to the extent that such decrease is below the threshold of a reasonable return.\"\n\n640.\n\nThe Tribunal must now examine whether the regime substituting RD 661/2007 deprived the Claimants of a reasonable return. It thus moves to the analysis of the Alternative Claim.\n\n**4. The Alternative Claim**\n----------------------------\n\n641.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal analyzes whether Spain violated the ECT by not providing the Claimants with the \"reasonable rate of return\" which it promised under the regulatory framework in place when the Claimants made their investments. If Spain complied with its promise, there is no breach of the Treaty. If Spain did not comply, then the result of the inquiry into liability will at the same time quantify the loss caused by the breach.\n\n642.\n\nAfter some introductory comments on the concurrence of liability and damage findings *(infra* at VI.B.4.a) and on the procedure and expert evidence involved in the resolution of the Alternative Claim *(infra* at VI.B.4.b), the Tribunal will review the quantification parameters on which the Parties and their experts disagree *(infra* at VI.B.4.c). On this basis, the Tribunal will then draw the consequences of its analysis in terms of liability and quantum *(infra* at VI.B.4.c.xii).\n\n643.\n\nBefore delving into the analysis, the Tribunal recalls that, by definition, the calculation of damages inevitably involves assumptions about events that did not occur and \"in a case of such scope and complexity damages cannot be determined with mechanical precision\".811 The Tribunal has done its best to arrive at an accurate assessment of the damages aspects of this case, despite the significant divergences between the Parties and their experts on a number of key issues and the multiple number of Claimants involved in this arbitration.\n\n*Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Final Award, 4 May 2017, **Exh. CLA-215**, para. 473.\n\na. ***Concurrence of Liability and Quantum***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nTo recall,812 the Claimants put forward their Alternative Claim in their Reply813 as a response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Spain \"'did not promise any regulated Tariff under RD 661/2007 [and] [...] the Spanish system only allowed investors to aspire to reasonable profitability as provided for in the [1997 Electricity Law]\u2019\".814\n\nSee also *supra* V.B.\n\nSee Reply, paras. 583-591. See also Brattle's Third Expert Report, para. 201.\n\nReply, para. 585, quoting SoD, para. 744.\n\n645.\n\nMore specifically, while still maintaining their Primary Claim, the Claimants argued that \"[i]n the event that the Tribunal were to agree that the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations were limited by Spain\u2019s concept of a 'reasonable return\u2019 [...] Spain still faces international liability under the ECT\",815 because it \"significantly lower[ed] the 'reasonable return\u2019\".816 In their Reply, the Claimants contended that, even on the Alternative Claim, they suffered significant damages,817 which they proposed to quantify in the subsequent phase of the arbitration.818\n\nReply, para. 585.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 591.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 591 (\"Even on the Alternative Claim, Brattle explains that, the Claimants have either suffered damages that are 'even higher than when simply comparing the remuneration of existing plants' to the tariff offered by the old regime (i.e. the Claimants' Primary Claim); or, in the alternative, 'would be less than associated with the PV Investors' Primary Claim, but would still be substantial.'\" (internal footnotes omitted, emphasis removed, discussing Brattle's Third Expert Report, paras. 208-209)).\n\n*Ibid*., 591 (\"In accordance with the agreed procedure, the quantification of the Claimants' losses [under the Alternative Claim] will be provided in the next phase of this arbitration\").\n\n646.\n\nIn response to the Alternative Claim, Spain maintained that the Claimants continue to be highly profitable and achieve the reasonable return that they could have expected at the time of their investment.819 It bears noting that Spain did not object when the Claimants raised the Alternative Claim in the Reply in line with Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules (which allows a party to amend or supplement its claims during the course of the proceedings subject to certain conditions), unlike it did when it opposed the Claimants\u2019 intention to amend their SoC (see Procedural Order No. 18). Rather, it chose to argue the Alternative Claim on its merits.820\n\nRejoinder, paras. 10, 260-291; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 120-232.\n\nSee, e.g., Rejoinder, paras. 963 *et seq.*\n\n647.\n\nThe guarantee provided by Spain in the 1997 Electricity Law (the \"reasonable return\" or \"reasonable profitability\") is economic in nature. This being so, the Tribunal cannot verify whether or not such guarantee was observed without considering the economic impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants\u2019 investment. Only once it has ascertained such impact will the Tribunal be able to determine whether or not there is a breach of the Treaty.821\n\nAs also explained by the Tribunal at the end of the PO12 Hearing, \"[y]ou understand, of course, that we are trying to assess legitimate expectations and whether legitimate expectations have been breached. And the legitimate expectations were given in economic terms. And so we think that to understand, first, what they were, and, second, whether they were breached, we need some economic input. That was the thinking behind PO12, of course. And that is why we are doing this exercise\". PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (President), 19 January 2018, at 94:15-22.\n\n648.\n\nOtherwise said, in this particular case the quantification of the harm, if any, informs the finding on liability. Unlike other cases in which liability (e.g., the allegedly wrongful withdrawal of a permit) is clearly separated from quantum, here the two elements of the analysis are intimately intertwined. In other words, the assessment of the harm suffered by the Claimants is necessarily linked to the reasonableness, non-arbitrariness, proportionality, etc., of the Respondent\u2019s conduct. It is only if the alteration of the regulatory framework called into question the guarantee of a reasonable return that the Claimants would be entitled to compensation pursuant to the general rules of State responsibility.822\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation of its approach in the decision issued in *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 472 (\"Such an empirical assessment cannot be made in the abstract. In other words, the Tribunal will be in the position to determine whether the measures taken by the Respondent have adversely affected the Claimants' legitimate expectation for a reasonable return only when it has evaluated the loss sustained by them, taking into account all the relevant elements. In other words, the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and reasonableness is inseparable from an assessment of the damages \u2013 if any \u2013 endured by the Claimants as a consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent\").\n\n**b.** ***Procedure and Expert Evidence***\n------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, to verify whether the Alternative Claim is well-founded requires it to assess the difference (if any) between the returns the Claimants are making under the New Regime (the scenario with Measures) and those they would be making if Spain had ensured that plants receive the reasonable rates of return on offer at the time when the Claimants made their investments (scenario without Measures).\n\n650.\n\nThus, in PO12 the Tribunal requested the Parties to quantify \"[t]he harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants\" by reference \"to the difference, if any, between (i) the reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant [...] and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period\".823 To that end, the Tribunal asked the Parties to assume that \"the investors had legitimate expectations to achieve reasonable profitability within the terms of Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (as it stood at the time of the Claimants' investments)\",824 which is consistent with the conclusion the Tribunal has reached above on the content of the Claimants' legitimate expectations. The Parties were invited to assume that the reasonable profitability would \"be equal to, first, 7% on average post tax and, second, 8% on average post tax\".825\n\nPO12, para. 3(a).\n\nPO12, para. 2.\n\nPO12, para. 3(b).\n\n651.\n\nIn calculating the returns in the scenarios with and without Measures, the Tribunal further asked the Parties to assume a regulatory lifetime of a PV plant equal to 30 years.826 Whiie the various documents referred to by the Parties show regulatory lifetime periods of PV plants that range between 25 and 40 years,827 the Tribunal considers that on balance of the documentary record as a whole, a 30-year lifetime of the plant appears the most reasonable. It notes that the New Regime provides for a 30-year deemed \"regulatory life\".\n\nPO12, para. 3(d).\n\nSee, e.g., EC DG Environment, (2011), *Study on Photovoltaic Panels Supplementing the Impact Assessment for a Recast of the [Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment] WEEE Directive \u2013 Final Report*, April 2011, **Exh. C-263**, p. 6 (where the authors note that \"[a] challenge in recycling of photovoltaic panels is their long lifetime which is estimated at 25 years. However, this represents the warranty lifetime; technical lifetime could be as long as 30 to 40\"); Greenpeace & European Photovoltaic Industry Association, Solar Generation 6: Solar Photovoltaic Electricity Empowering the World, 2011, **Exh. C-157**, p. 19 (\"Module lifetime is typically considered of 25 years, although it can easily reach over 30 years\").\n\n652.\n\nIn addition to the parameters just mentioned, PO12 also set out a number of alternative variables, on which the Parties made written and oral submissions and presented different damages calculations.828\n\nQuantum Memorial, paras. 51-136; Quantum Counter-Memorial, paras. 41-79; Quantum Reply, paras. 69-262; Quantum Rejoinder, paras. 92-318; PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 44-194; PO12 R-PHB1, paras. 2-220; PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 35-206; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 137-232; BQR I; BQR II; EOQR I; EOQR II; Joint Memorandum.\n\n653.\n\nFollowing these submissions on the quantum of the Alternative Claim, the Tribunal requested the experts to provide it with a joint model, the EJM, allowing it to calculate the Claimants\u2019 IRR and possible resulting losses. At the hearing held on 16 to 19 January 2018, the experts had indeed agreed to assist the Tribunal in this task.829\n\nSee PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Lapuerta), 19 January 2018, at 65:5-6, 67:17-20; PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores; Caldwelll), 19 January 2018, at 65:8-67:16.\n\n654.\n\nOn the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions and of the experts\u2019 evidence,830 the Tribunal set out directions to be considered in the preparation of the EJM. These directions were incorporated in PO18, which was the result of a consultative process.831 Such consultation in particular enabled the Tribunal to reduce the number of assumptions for consideration, thereby diminishing the complexity of the EJM exercise. This effort came especially in response to a request from the Claimants.832\n\nSee also Procedural Order No. 17, 25 January 2018 (\"PO17\"), esp. section III.\n\nOn 30 April 2018, the order was circulated to the Parties in draft form for their comments; on 14 and 22 May 2018, each Party provided two rounds of comments to the draft; on 4 July 2018, upon the Claimants' proposal, the Parties and the Tribunal held a conference call for the Tribunal to hear the Parties on the draft of the order and ask them questions on their comments and proposed modifications; and on 18 July 2018, PO18 was issued in final form.\n\nSee letter from the Claimants, 14 May 2018, pp. 1 and 4 (\"the Claimants have serious concerns regarding the extensive scope of the draft of PO18 and its potential to lead to a further lengthy phase of the arbitration. In light of these concerns, and with a view to determining the best way forward, the Claimants propose that the Tribunal schedule a telephonic case management conference as soon as possible and, ideally, by no later than Monday 21 May 2018. In the interim, the Claimants set out below their comments on the draft PO18. The Claimants propose several modifications to the current draft of PO18 at Annex 1 which are designed to narrow the issues to be addressed by the experts in the EJM so that the Tribunal can be presented with a workable EJM [\u2026] The Claimants believe it is therefore desirable to seek to reduce the number of permutations to be contained in the EJM so that it is both helpful to the Tribunal and can be produced without significant undue cost and delay. The Claimants propose the following changes to PO18 in order to reduce the number of permutations: [\u2026]\").\n\n655.\n\nPO18 contained the following general directions:\n\n7. Further to the Tribunal\u2019s directions in Procedural Order No. 12, the examination of the experts at the Hearing, including their answers to questions from the Tribunal, and Procedural Order No. 17, the Tribunal invites the Brattle experts (presented by the Claimants) and the EconOne experts (presented by the Respondent) to confer and present an EJM on the quantum of the Claimants\u2019 so-called \"Alternative Claim\". In accordance with PO12, such quantum shall be equivalent to the difference between (i) the reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant (as specified in PO12) and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period. Further, the EJM shall be based on the parameters, including alternatives and sub-alternatives, set out in paragraph 12 below.\n\n8. In the preparation of the EJM, the experts shall not rely on documents or data that are not already in the record, subject to leave from the Tribunal if the introduction of new documents or data arises from the need to comply with their mandate under PO18.\n\n9. If the experts cannot agree on the input to be entered into the EJM with respect to a parameter, alternative or sub-alternative (see paragraph 12 below), each expert shall provide his separate input identified as such in the EJM.\n\n10. Together with the EJM, the experts may submit a joint memorandum with explanatory comments if they deem it useful. If the experts diverge on some issues regarding the implementation of the parameters specified in paragraph 12 below, they may make separate comments identified as such in the memorandum.\n\n11. The goal of the EJM is to allow the Tribunal to compute the harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants according to their \"Alternative Claim\". To do so, the EJM will allow the Tribunal to choose among the alternatives and sub-alternatives set out below. The Tribunal trusts that the experts will do their utmost to facilitate its task and produce a workable model for the purpose just identified.\n\n656.\n\nIn PO18, the Tribunal also emphasized that \"[e]ven though Brattle and EconOne have been retained by the Parties, the Tribunal expects them to act as *independent* experts to assist the Tribunal\".833\n\nPO18, para. 14.\n\n657.\n\nOn 5 October 2018, in accordance with PO18, the experts produced the EJM with a joint memorandum explaining the areas on which they agreed or disagreed (defined *supra* at para. 153 as the \"Joint Memorandum\").834 They produced a revised version on 23 November 2018, correcting an implementation error. The Parties commented on the EJM and the Joint Memorandum in post-hearing briefs of 29 November 2018 and 12 February 2019, respectively.835 The Tribunal notes that, while the EJM exercise turned out to be longer than anticipated, in particular because of the complexity of the damage calculation, it eventually accomplished its objective and neither Party requested that the Tribunal appoint its own damages expert.836\n\nSee Joint Memorandum presented by Mr. Carlos Lapuerta, Mr. Richard Caldwell, and Mr. Jack Stirzaker of the Brattle Group and Dr. Daniel Flores and Mr. Jordan Heim of Econ One, 5 October 2018 (\"Joint Memorandum\").\n\nSee PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 35-206; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 135-232.\n\nIn this context, it is noted that the Claimants have criticized Econ One's credibility (PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 21-22). While the Tribunal has taken note of this criticism, it discerns no element in the record that would lead it to disregard that expert's evidence.\n\n658.\n\nThe EJM contains a control panel comprising the following six parameters, with variables representing the inputs on which the experts diverged. A variable must be selected for each of the parameters in order to compute the loss and the corresponding IRR:\n\n1. Interest Tax Shield\n\n2. Cost Base\n\n3. Past Profits\n\n4. Revision of the Reasonable Rate of Return (\"RRR\")\n\n5. Initial Investment for IRR Calculation\n\n6. Interest\n\n659.\n\nAs mentioned above (see *supra* at para. 641), the result of the Tribunal's inquiry into liability will allow it to quantify the loss in case of breach. In other words, if the Tribunal determines that some or all of the Claimants have suffered harm under their Alternative Claim, the Tribunal will be in a position to issue an award on both liability and damages based on the Alternative Claim. As the Tribunal made clear on various occasions, PO12 initiated a hybrid liability and quantum phase.\n\n660.\n\nFor instance, at the end of the PO12 Hearing, the Tribunal explained that:\n\n[The scope of the first post-hearing brief] is about liability. And, to be very clear, it could also be about quantum. If it is not quantum of the primary claim, it is quantum of the alternative claim. But before we, in our thinking, can get to the alternative claim, we need to make the liability decision. So what we have heard this week does go to both the liability and the quantum of a possible alternative claim.837\n\n[PO12] was issued on 29 September 2016. And, from then on, we did process with submissions, evidence, following procedural order no. 12, which meant to open a quantum phase, too [*s/c*] joint with the liability because we thought that here it might be difficult to make a decision on liability without understanding part of the quantum at least.838\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (President), 19 January 2018, at 95:8-14.\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (President), 19 January 2018, at 100:15-21 (emphasis added).\n\n661.\n\nIn response to the Parties\u2019 requests for clarifications to PO12, the Tribunal also explained that \"the directions given in PO12 expand the current phase as circumscribed in the Order. If, thereafter, the Tribunal were to require further briefing and evidence to resolve the dispute, it will give further appropriate directions\".839 Thus, the Tribunal made clear that the PO12 phase expanded the liability phase to include what was set out in PO12 and that it wished to hear \"the Parties on certain aspects of the quantum. Specifically, the Tribunal would be assisted by each Claimant quantifying its so-called alternative claim...\"840\n\nTribunal's letter, 15 November 2016, p. 3 (emphasis added).\n\nPO12, para. 1.\n\n662.\n\nAs recounted above, following PO12, the Tribunal received further submissions accompanied by vast amount of documentary and expert evidence. The Tribunal is thus now in a position to resolve the dispute in its entirety and issue an award on both liability and quantum. As it stated during the 4 July 2018 telephone hearing, \"the award that we will have to issue will have to deal not only with the quantification, but also liability\".841\n\nSee Telephone conference with the Tribunal on PO18, dated 4 July 2018, 1:28:34-1:33:30. The recording of the telephone conference was circulated to the Parties on 5 July 2018.\n\n663.\n\nIndeed, the conduct of both Parties\u2019 confirms their understanding that the phase started with PO12 addressed not only liability, but also quantum. This is confirmed by the very title of the Parties\u2019 main submissions842 as well as their submissions during the document production phase.843 It was also acknowledged by the experts during the PO12 Hearing.844 Finally, the inclusion of quantum in the phase opened by PO12 was confirmed by the Tribunal when closing the proceedings, at which time it noted that it \"ha[d] all the necessary elements in terms of liability and, if applicable, quantum to render a Final Award\".845 In response, the Respondent \"acknowledge[d] the Tribunal\u2019s letter of Monday declaring the proceedings closed as of 2 December 2019\".846 This being so, the Respondent\u2019s suggestion in its last PHB that \"the purpose of the PO12 and PO18 is to assist the Tribunal in determining liability, not damages\"847 is thus ill-conceived.\n\nSee Respondent's submissions on this phase titled: (i) \"RESPONDENT'S QUANTUM COUNTER-MEMORIAL\"; (ii) \"RESPONDENT'S QUANTUM REJOINDER\"; (iii) RESPONDENT'S QUANTUM POST HEARING BRIEF\"; (iv) \"RESPONDENT'S SECOND POST-HEARING BRIEF ON QUANTUM\" (capital letters in the originals, emphases added). Likewise, see Claimants submissions on this phase titled: (i) \"CLAIMANTS' QUANTUM SUBMISSION\"; (ii) \"CLAIMANTS' QUANTUM REPLY SUBMISSION\" (capital letters in the originals, emphases added). See also Respondent's Quantum Rejoinder, para. 137, explaining that \"the reason why Spain objected to MG&A being called for cross examination is because MG&A has already been subject to cross examination on their regulatory expert reports produced in the liability phase of these proceedings and that MG&A have not produced any new report (or indeed any report) in relation to this quantum phase, for which a different expert \u2013 EO- was appointed\" (emphasis added).\n\nSee, e.g., PO15, Annex A, Spain's objections to request 4: \"the documents requested have, once again, no relevance to this quantum phase of the arbitration, but could only have been hypothetically relevant to the liability phase\" (emphasis added); PO 15, Annex A, Requests Nos 2; 3; 5; 6; and 7: \"Therefore, it is self-evident that this request is related to arguments made during the liability phase, for which the document production phase is long expired. To grant this request would unfairly re-open analysis of the liability phase, which would place Respondent at a disadvantage without a right of response. Accordingly, such requests should be summarily rejected.\"\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores), 19 January 2018, 14:17-20 \"They are intertwined. I mean, that's this phase of the arbitration does have liability and damages issues. So I don't know that anyone is going to be able to completely separate both issues.\"\n\nSee Letter from the Tribunal, 2 December 2019.\n\nSee Respondent's e-mail, 4 December 2019.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 217.\n\n664.\n\nHence, matters of both liability and quantum with respect to the Alternative Claim have been fully pleaded and both Parties have been heard and have had ample opportunity to present their respective cases. There is thus no doubt that the Tribunal is now in a position to issue an award on both liability and damages.\n\n665.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants have formulated the relief sought not by reference to the Primary/Alternative Claim, but more generally for compensation as a result of Spain\u2019s alleged breaches (see *supra* para. 220). In this connection, the Tribunal also notes that the main difference between the Claimants\u2019 initial request for relief in the Reply (see *supra* para. 219) and the final one after the quantum phase (PO12 C-PHB2, quoted *supra* at 220) is that the Claimants no longer request that Spain provide full restitution by reinstating the legal framework. Hence, the Tribunal understands that the request for restitution has been abandoned. In the event that this understanding were incorrect, the Tribunal would in any event not grant such relief in light of its conclusion that the Primary Claim, which is predicated upon the Claimants' expectation to receive the fixed FIT under RD 661/2007 over the regulatory lifetime of the plants, is ill-founded.\n\nc. ***Quantification of Loss and IRR***\n---------------------------------------\n\n666.\n\nAs recalled above, having deliberated on the Parties' case as it had developed through their written submissions on liability, their oral submissions at the hearing on liability, and their PHBs, the Tribunal issued PO12, setting out its \"directions to the Parties\".848 It is helpful to reproduce the relevant portions of PO12:\n\n1. Without prejudice to its forthcoming determinations on the claims before it, including without prejudice to its decision on liability, the Tribunal is of the view that it would be materially assisted by hearing the Parties on certain aspects of the *quantum*. Specifically, the Tribunal would be assisted by each Claimant quantifying its so-called alternative claim (Claimants' Reply, para. 583 ff.) as further specified in the following paragraphs.\n\n2. For such purpose, the Parties shall assume that, at the time when the investments were made, the investors had legitimate expectations to achieve reasonable profitability within the terms of Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law (as it stood at the time of the Claimants' investments).\n\n3. Within this specification, the Claimants may present their *quantum* cases as they deem appropriate and the Respondent may answer such cases as it deems appropriate. That said, the Tribunal would be particularly interested in submissions based on the following assumptions:\n\n(a) The harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants is assumed to be equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant (as specified below) and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period. With respect to (ii), the Parties shall work with two distinct assumptions: first, they shall assume that the New Regime undergoes a reasonable revision of the rates every six years. Second, they shall assume that there are no such revisions.\n\n(b) Reasonable profitability within the meaning of the 1997 Electricity Law at the time of the investments is assumed to be equal to, first, 7% on average post tax and, second, 8% on average post tax;\n\n(c) In respect of reasonable profitability, the Parties shall work with two distinct assumptions (to the extent these assumptions make any difference to their computations): first, they shall assume a greenfield investment and, second, they shall assume a brownfield investment.\n\n(d) The regulatory lifetime of a PV plant is assumed to be 30 years;\n\n(e) Remuneration exceeding the 7% or 8% profitability addressed in (b) above which a plant has achieved prior to the enactment of the Disputed Measures is assumed to either (i) be taken into account or (ii) not to be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the aggregate average reasonable return over the 30-year regulatory lifetime of a plant;\n\n(f) The valuation date is assumed to be either (i) the date of the valuation as proxy for the date of the award or (ii) the date of the Disputed Measures.\n\n[...]\n\nSee *supra* section II.D.\n\n667.\n\nIn its subsequent PO18, the Tribunal then asked the experts for assistance in computing a possible loss under the Alternative Claim. For that purpose, it invited them to prepare the EJM and set out certain parameters and variables, as follows:\n\n12. The EJM shall be based on the following parameters:\n\na. The harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants shall be calculated *per Claimant;*\n\nb. The harm shall be calculated by using the methodology used by Brattle in its DCF computation. Thus, the DCF methodology shall be based on the calculation of an Alternative Tariff designed to provide a 7% post-tax return (as described below). The harm shall be calculated by discounting the cash flows to arrive at the net present value of the Claimants\u2019 assets in the scenarios without Measures and with Measures.\n\nc. The experts shall use a holding IRR as opposed to an exit IRR in both scenarios (with Measures and without Measures);\n\nd. As valuation date, the EJM shall use the date of the alleged breach as it was set by agreement of the Parties, i.e. 30 June 2014;\n\ne. For the Claimants\u2019 return in the scenario without Measures, the EJM shall use a rate of return of 7% post-tax. Post-tax shall mean the return considering the impact of all taxes in force at the valuation date.\n\nf. As cost base, the EJM shall use\n\ni. Alternative 1: The \"marginal plant\" approach, with the following\n\na) Sub-alternative 1: \"Size re-classified marginal plant sensitivity\" (following the approach described in the Brattle Quantum Rebuttal Report, paras. 227 et seq.);\n\nb) Sub-alternative 2: \"IT code sensitivity\" (following the approach described in the Brattle Quantum Rebuttal Report, paras. 227 et seq.);\n\nii. Alternative 2: The \"greenfield costs\" approach, with the following\n\na) Sub-alternative 1: Including \"developer premiums\";\n\nb) Sub-alternative 2: Excluding \"developer premiums\";\n\ng. The EJM shall compute the harm in the scenario without Measures assuming that the regulator\n\ni. Alternative 1: Took account of the tax shield;\n\nii. Alternative 2: Did not take account of the tax shield;\n\nh. The EJM shall compute the harm\n\ni. Alternative 1: Assuming that revisions of returns occur under the New Regime every six years in the scenario with Measures;\n\nii. Alternative 2: Assuming that revisions of returns do not occur under the New Regime every six years in the scenario with Measures;\n\ni. The EJM shall compute the Alternative Tariff applied in the scenario without Measures\n\ni. Alternative 1: Taking into account past profits;\n\nii. Alternative 2: Not taking into account past profits.\n\n668.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Tribunal thus discusses the elements of the computation of the losses, if any, and the resulting IRRs as they are set out in PO12 and PO18, in the expert evidence, including especially the EJM and the Joint Memorandum, and in the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n669.\n\nBefore doing so, as a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that there is no substantial disagreement between the Parties as to the general principles governing reparation for unlawful acts in international law. In particular, the Respondent does not dispute the principle that, if liability were established, it has an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.849\n\nSee, e.g., PO12 R-PHB1, paras. 191-194.\n\n**i.** ***Methodology to Calculate the Harm***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Parties' Position\n-------------------------\n\n(i) The Claimants' Position\n---------------------------\n\n670.\n\nThe Claimants submit that their expert, Brattle, quantified the change in the value of their investment using a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analysis and that the Tribunal's directions in PO12 guided this quantification exercise. They note that PO12 directed them to compute their damages by comparing two scenarios: (a) what they refer to as the \"Actual scenario\", which measures the cash flows (and consequently, the IRR) now expected by the Claimants after the Disputed Measures, and (b) what they term the \"But For\" scenario, which measures the cash flows (and consequently, the IRR) that the PV investors could have reasonably anticipated in the absence of the Disputed Measures.850 For the Claimants, if the IRR in the But For scenario is higher than the IRR in the Actual scenario, it means that Spain violated their legitimate expectations by failing to provide the target rate of return under the New Regime. Further, the same quantification would also serve as a basis for calculating their damages.851\n\nPO12, para. 3(a). PO12 assumed that the quantum of damages / harm suffered by the Claimants equals \"the difference [\u2026] between (i) the reasonable return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law over the regulatory lifetime of a plant [\u2026] and (ii) the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures for the same period\".\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para. 36.\n\n671.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as a first step, Brattle measured the Claimants' cash flows in the But For scenario by implementing the assumptions set out in PO12. In that regard, Brattle notes that PO12 requires them to assume that the target reasonable rate of return Spain considered while designing the Original Regime is 7% or 8% after tax. In other words, rather than the RD 661/2007 FIT, the Claimants would be entitled to some other remuneration (to be calculated) that would enable them to obtain the above target return. For the Claimants and Brattle, it is axiomatic that such remuneration \"must be calculated on a like-for-like basis with the reasonable rate of return offered by Spain at the time of Claimants' investments\".852 This is because, first, a like-for-like comparison reflects the legitimate expectations that the Claimants would have had at the time of making their investments. Second, it is also appropriate from an economic perspective, as it allows the two measures of returns (Actual and But For) to be placed on a comparable footing.853\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para. 37 (emphasis omitted); PO12 C-PHB2, paras. 58-59.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 60, 63.\n\n672.\n\nWith this in mind, Brattle notes that under the Original Regime, Spain designed an incentive scheme based on a FIT per MWh for all qualifying installations, for all production over the entire operational lifetime of the installations. Consequently, Brattle is of the view that a \"tariff per MWh\" of production is consistent with the Claimants' expectation at the time they made their investment. Therefore, in order to determine the cash flows in the But For scenario, Brattle constructed an \"Alternative Tariff\" per MWh of production that would permit an efficient PV plant to recover costs and earn an after tax return of 7% or 8%, on a like-for-like basis as the RD 661/2007 FITs. It then applied the Alternative Tariff to the production forecast for each of the Claimants' plants to determine the cash flows in the But For scenario.854\n\nBQR I, paras. 48-50.\n\n673.\n\nAs with the But For scenario, Brattle forecast the cash flows in the Actual scenario (for the period after the Disputed Measures) by implementing the PO12 assumption regarding periodic updates to the remuneration under the New Regime.855\n\nBQR I, paras. 33, 100.\n\n674.\n\nHaving determined the cash flows in the But For and Actual scenarios, Brattle proceeded to measure the Claimants' damages by applying a DCF analysis. For this purpose, PO12 required the Claimants to measure the damages on an *ex ante* basis as well as an *ex post* basis. The Claimants adopt June 2014 for the *ex ante* valuation date as this was the date on which Spain finally defined the parameters under the New Regime.856 For the *ex post* calculation, the Claimants explain that Brattle adopts December 2016 as a proxy for the date of the award, and subsequently updates the valuation date to reflect the passage of time and availability of additional *ex post* information.857\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 53.\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 54.\n\n675.\n\nBrattle explains that under either approach, it has measured the damages using three steps, which it illustrates and explains as follows:\n\n676.\n\nThe first step of Brattle\u2019s valuation methodology looks back prior to the valuation date and considers the difference between the cash flows under the But For and Actual scenarios since the inception of the Disputed Measures in November 2010, and their cumulative effective till the valuation date. Regardless of which valuation date is ultimately used, Brattle explains that the difference between the But For and Actual scenarios is calculated on the basis of each Claimants\u2019 actual historical operating and financial data.858\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 76ff; BQR I, paras. 35, 103.\n\n677.\n\nThe second step looks forward from the valuation date and estimates the net present value (\"NPV\") of the Claimants\u2019 investment under both the But For and Actual scenario by performing a DCF analysis. In other words, Brattle derives the NPV of the Claimants\u2019 investments by discounting their future cash flows (in both scenarios) to the valuation date to account for market risk and the time value of money.859\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 79ff; BQR I, paras. 36-41, 111.\n\n678.\n\nIn the third and final step, Brattle \"considers that the PV Investors will not receive payment for damages until sometime in the future. The analysis accounts for the delay in compensation by adding pre-award interest to our June 2014 and December 2016 damage estimates, using published data concerning the yields on Spanish Government bonds\".860\n\nBQR I, para. 42.\n\n(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------------\n\n679.\n\nThe Respondent observes that pursuant to PO12, the Parties were invited to present a quantification of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the Disputed Measures, on the assumption that the harm was equal to the difference between the rate of return under Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law and the return the Claimants would make under the Disputed Measures. In other words, according to Spain, PO12 required the Parties to compare the \"actual\" rate of return obtained by the Claimants\u2019 plants against a rate of return of 7% or 8% after tax.861\n\nQuantum Counter-Memorial, para. 41; PO12 R-PHB1, paras. 68-69.\n\n680.\n\nFor Spain, the proper methodology to calculate damages was established by the Tribunal in PO12 which directed the Parties to calculate \"returns\". According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 DCF calculation \"does not calculate returns and thus fails to apply the methodology ordered by the Tribunal\".862 For Spain, the correct approach is to perform an analysis of the IRRs of the Claimants\u2019 PV plants, which is \"the most common and widely accept method to measure the economic profitability of projects\".863 Furthermore, \"[t]he calculation of returns established by the Tribunal is the correct methodology for assessing damages in this particular case as it is undisputed that the only reasonable expectation that the Spanish regulatory regime could have generated in investors is that their plants would obtain reasonable returns, and not any particular amount of cash flows\".864\n\nQuantum Rejoinder, para. 82.\n\nQuantum Rejoinder, para. 98.\n\nQuantum Rejoinder, para. 102.\n\n681.\n\nTherefore, Spain explains, Econ One calculated the \"actual\" IRR for each of the Claimants\u2019 PV plants using Brattle\u2019s DCF model for the Actual scenario, by taking into account \"(i) the costs associated with the development, operation and maintenance of the PV Plants; (ii) the cash flows generated by the PV Plants up until the relevant Valuation Date; and (iii) the value of the PV Plants as of that Valuation Date (based on the cash flows that the PV Plants can be expected to generate going forward, taking into account the Disputed Measures)\".865 It then carried out \"an 'apples to apples\u2019 comparison, contrasting the expectation of a 7/8% RRoR [reasonable rate of return] at project level as was defined in the regulation and assumed in PO12, with an actual scenario with the Measures that reflects the reality of each of Claimants' Plants and focuses on the returns at project level by considering only greenfield costs\".866\n\nQuantum Counter-Memorial, para. 43.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 156.\n\n682.\n\nSpain notes that for the But For scenario, PO12 directed the Parties to assume that \"'at the time when the investments were made the investors had a legitimate expectation to achieve reasonable profitability in accordance with the terms of Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law'\" and further stipulated the target reasonable return as 7% or 8% after tax.867 As a result, Spain explains that Econ One did not make any calculations for the But For scenario, \"but limited itself to consider that such scenario would permit Claimants to obtain a 7/8% post-tax return\". For the Respondent, this approach to the But For scenario follows from the abovementioned directions in PO12 itself.868\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 53, 68, discussing PO12, para. 2.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 69-70, discussing PO12, para. 2.\n\n683.\n\nBy contrast, Spain submits that the Claimants' calculation of their But For scenario \"does not make any sense\".869\n\nQuantum Counter-Memorial, para. 82. Although Spain takes issue with several aspects of the Claimants' calculation, at this stage and keeping in mind its directions in PO18, the Tribunal considers it sufficient and appropriate to only highlight Spain's arguments based on the Claimants' use of an Alternative Tariff and the marginal plant cost base.\n\n684.\n\nSpain contends that the But For scenario is supposed to reflect the Claimants' legitimate expectation of reasonable profitability in accordance with Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law. In that regard Spain emphasizes that Article 30.4 only specifies the parameters that will be considered while fixing the premiums for the RE sector, i.e. the investment costs and that \"the ultimate target of the remuneration [...] is to cover the investment cost, operating costs and obtain a reasonable rate of return according to the cost of money on capital markets\". It \"has never fixed a specific remunerative formula\" for calculating such premiums.870 In other words, while Article 30.4 confirms that producers can legitimately expect a reasonable return, it does not explain how such return will be calculated, much less the form it may take.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 53-58; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 124-128, 130.\n\n685.\n\nHowever, disregarding this facet of the provision, Spain observes that the Claimants construct their But For scenario based on an \"Alternative Tariff\" which would provide a 7/8% post-tax return to a \"made up 'Marginal Plant\u2019\", on the premise that this methodology allegedly reflects how Spain calculated the RD 661/2007 FIT.871 Spain submits that the Claimants\u2019 methodology is incorrect because it implies that they expected to receive a tariff on a EUR per MW of electricity-produced basis when, as explained immediately above, Article 30.4 of the 1997 Electricity Law never guaranteed the formulas for fixing remuneration.872 Hence, Spain contends that the specific remunerative formula under RD 661/2007 (i.e. a EUR per MWh tariff) had nothing to do with the principle of reasonable profitability under the 1997 Electricity Law and could not have constituted a legitimate expectation under Article 30.4.873 In other words, the Claimants could not have legitimately expected to receive an \"Alternative Tariff\".\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 80; PO12 R-PHB2, para. 129.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 81; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 130-131.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 81; PO12 R-PHB2, para. 131.\n\n686.\n\nSpain further submits that the Claimants\u2019 criticism of Econ One\u2019s valuation methodology is without merit. In particular, it refers to the Claimants\u2019 criticism that Econ One\u2019s calculation does not perform a like-for-like comparison by comparing the Claimants\u2019 actual IRRs against the hypothetical Alternative Tariff. Spain replies that it is the Claimants\u2019 valuation methodology that is flawed, for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 First, as discussed immediately above, there is no evidentiary basis to apply an Alternative Tariff at all.874\n\n\u2022 Second, Spain submits that the present situation is not a case where the regulator is setting the tariff, where it would have to consider the \"standard\" or \"typical\" costs of a plant as it would be impossible to look at the actual costs of each plant. Rather, in the present situation, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to resolve the dispute between the Parties. For Spain, \"[t]he only way to do this is to calculate the [actual] returns of such Plants [...] by considering the enterprise value of the Claimants\u2019 Plants and greenfield costs\" and not the \"fictitious\" or \"imaginary\" Alternative Tariff created by Brattle.875\n\n\u2022 Third, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 allegation, Econ One\u2019s calculation of the But For scenario does not convert the target rate of return into a cap on the amount of damages. According to Spain, the 7% or 8% return is \"taken as a benchmark to compare it with the actual returns that Claimants\u2019 Plants are obtaining with the Measures\". Spain explains that if a plant earns more than the target rate of return in the scenario with the Measures, even if such rate of return is less than the IRR that was earned under the Original Regime, such a plant would not be entitled to receive any damages as this would result in over remuneration.876\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 81; PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 130-131.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 8-10. Spain submits that \"[w]hile the regulator necessarily needs to assume standardised scenarios in order to calculate the remuneration for PV plants, investors on the other hand consider the real returns that their PV Plants would obtain based on such remuneration. Obviously, the legitimate expectation of the Claimants' PV Plants was to receive a return in the vicinity of the target RRoR established by the regulator on their initial investment (i.e. based upon their real greenfield costs)\" (Quantum Rejoinder, paras. 70-72. See also *ibid*., paras. 135-146).\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 74-77, discussing Brattle's testimony at the PO12 Hearing (PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Caldwell), 17 January 2018, at 33:15-21).\n\n687.\n\nAccordingly, Spain asks the Tribunal to disregard the But For scenario proposed by Brattle.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that with regard to the methodology to quantify the harm there appear to be two main points in dispute between the Parties, namely whether Brattle\u2019s use of (i) the so-called \"Alternative Tariff\" and of (ii) the DCF method is appropriate.\n\n689.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Brattle\u2019s approach based on the Alternative Tariff provides an appropriate methodology to calculate the \"reasonable rate of return\" equal to 7% or 8% post-tax. This is because the Alternative Tariff represents the revenue stream that provides an efficient plant with the assumed rate of return (7% or 8 % post-tax) in the scenario without Measures.\n\n690.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Spain\u2019s criticism that there is no evidence that the Claimants expected to receive the Alternative Tariff and that the Alternative Tariff is \"fictitious\" is misconceived. Of course, as such, the Alternative Tariff never existed, as the only relevant tariff that existed at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment was the RD 661/2007 FIT. However, either Spain must accept that the Claimants could legitimately expect to receive the fixed FIT under RD 661/2007 over the regulatory lifetime of the plants (in which case the Primary Claim would be well-founded, which the Tribunal has concluded is not the case) or Spain must acknowledge that the Claimants were entitled to receive the reasonable return on offer at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investments. To calculate the latter, the Tribunal accepts that the Alternative Tariff appropriately represents the revenue stream that provides the reasonable return that Spain claims the Claimants' installations were entitled to receive.\n\n691.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal also accepts Brattle's use of the DCF as an appropriate valuation methodology in this case. The DCF method is an accepted valuation method in both financial theory and in the practice, including by arbitral tribunals. While the use of the DCF may not be suited to all cases, especially where the business to be valued is not a \"going concern\" and lacks a clear record of profitability, there is no reason to discard a DCF in this case for two main reasons. First, the Claimants' installations have been operational since 2008 or earlier, which provides a reliable and sufficient record of *past* financial performance.877 Second, there is no major uncertainty regarding the plants' *future* cash flows as, on Spain's case, the Disputed Measures continue to provide investors with a reasonable rate of return for the entire regulatory life of the plant.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that other tribunals have likewise resorted to the DCF method for the purposes of the damages calculations in other Spanish renewable energy cases. See, e.g., *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Final Award, 4 May 2017, **Exh. CLA-215**, para. 465 (\"DCF has frequently been applied as an appropriate and effective method for arriving at a valuation of a business operating as a going concern prior to adverse government actions. 'DCF techniques have been universally adopted, including by numerous arbitral tribunals, as an appropriate method for valuing business assets [...]' While in this case the Tribunal does not reach the expropriation claim, the calculation of damages involves a comparable assessment of potential future revenues of a going concern with predictable capital and operating costs and cash flows\" (internal footnotes omitted)); *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018, **Exh. CLA-243**, para. 582(\"[\u2026] power plants, such as Claimant's businesses, rely on a relatively simple business model \u2013 limited only to generating electricity, pursuant to generally stable parameters. Both income generated and costs incurred are relatively predictable in the renewable energy sector\" (internal footnotes omitted)); *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Award, 15 June 2018, **Exh. CLA-244**, para. 689 (\"[\u2026] it is true that the DFC method may be inappropriate for the valuation of business concerns that are not in operation or at very early stages of operation and therefore lack a suitable track record of their performance. It may also be inappropriate for business concerns having a short performance record and subject to several variables that are difficult to forecast. However, this is not the case here [\u2026] power stations (both conventional and renewables) have a relatively simple business, producing electricity, whose demand and long-run value can be analysed and modelled in detail based on readily available data\"); *Greentech Energy Systems A/S and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. V (2015/150), Final Award, 14 November 2018, **Exh. CLA-245**, para. 480 (\"[\u2026] the Majority of the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the DCF method is appropriate in this case, because: 'the future performance of operating solar PV plants is relatively predictable (i.e., they can sell all of the electricity they produce at prices and costs that are known or can be forecast with a high degree of confidence for a significant period of time).'\").\n\n692.\n\nTherefore, in terms of general valuation methodology, the Tribunal considers Brattle\u2019s DCF methodology reasonable under the circumstances, as it seeks to quantify the Claimants\u2019 cash flows in the scenario without Measures and in the scenario with Measures and then discounts these cash flows to determine the present value of the Claimants\u2019 plants.\n\n693.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that Spain\u2019s expert, Econ One, relied on Brattle\u2019s DCF model when carrying out its calculations in the scenario with Measures without performing its own analysis. Econ One in particular used Brattle's DCF model to discount the future cash flows to derive the enterprise value of the installations:\n\nDR. FLORES: And what is the value of these futures [*sic*] returns that are yet to come? As a proxy for that we have taken the enterprise value, calculated by Brattle.\n\n[...]\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I just ask a question about the enterprise value. You say you took it as calculated by Brattle; is that right?\n\nDR FLORES: Correct, yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And that is essentially future cash flow -- net cash flows, discounted back to present value.\n\nDR FLORES: Correct. That's correct, yes.878\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores; President), 18 January 2018, at 24:16-18 and 24:24-25:6.\n\n694.\n\nBy contrast, in the scenario without Measures, Econ One\u2019s analysis \"doesn\u2019t discount future cash flows\".879\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores), 19 January 2018, at 6:3-25. See also Respondent's letter, 18 April 2018, confirming that the \"Econ One But for is not a DCF model\".\n\n695.\n\nWith regard to the inputs into Brattle\u2019s DCF model, the Tribunal observes that they were undisputed until the PO12 Hearing. In particular, in its two quantum reports, Econ One did not take issue with the discount rates, production forecasts, pool prices and interest rates used in Brattle\u2019s model. As noted above, on the contrary, Econ One relied on those same inputs in its valuation for the scenario with Measures.880\n\nSee PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores; President), 18 January 2018, at 24:16- 18 and 24:24-25:6.\n\n696.\n\nOn the last day of the PO12 Hearing, however, Econ One suggested for the first time that it disagreed with one of the inputs into Brattle\u2019s DCF model, namely the discount rate (and more specifically, the regulatory risk premium) in the scenario without Measures.881 The Tribunal considers that, as the discount rate and the regulatory risk which it includes are important factors in a DCF analysis, Econ One should have raised any concern in its reports in response to Brattle's damage calculation.\n\nSee PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Flores), 19 January 2018, at 21:9 et seq.\n\n697.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal accepts Brattle's use of the DCF as an appropriate valuation methodology. Accordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal instructed the experts to calculate the harm allegedly suffered as follows:\n\n\"[B]y using the methodology used by Brattle in its DCF computation. Thus, the DCF methodology shall be based on the calculation of an Alternative Tariff designed to provide a 7% post-tax return (as described below). The harm shall be calculated by discounting the cash flows to arrive at the net present value of the Claimants' assets in the scenarios without Measures and with Measures\".882\n\nPO18, para. 12(b).\n\n698.\n\nThe assumed rate to be used in the scenario without Measures (7% or 8%) is discussed next.\n\n**ii.** ***The Rate of Return in the Scenario Without Measures***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Parties' Position\n-------------------------\n\n699.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, for the scenario without Measures, an 8% target rate of return is appropriate. They submit that both the CNE and the Ministry of Industry contemplated a return of 8%.883 Moreover, Spain's expert, MG&A, confirmed during the Hearing on Liability that \"the CNE had in fact approved the proposed RD 661/2007 on the basis that PV installations would receive between 7.6% and 8% after tax\" returns.

It submits that the target rate of return at the time of the Claimants' investment was 7% after tax, which position is supported by the evidence of both of Spain's experts.885 By contrast, there is no evidence to support the Claimants' position that the target rate of return was 8%. Spain contends that the Claimants' and Brattle's reliance on CNE Report 3/2007886 to advocate for an 8% post-tax return is misplaced, as this report refers to an 8% return for facilities that have been operating since 2004 and with a capacity of 5kW. These parameters do not apply to the Claimants' PV plants, most of which were built in 2008 and have an installed capacity of 100kW.887\n\nQuantum Counter-Memorial, para. 57, discussing MG&A Report, Section 4.1 and EOQR I, paras 23-29, both of which in turn refer to the PER 2005-2010, **Exh.

Photovoltaic installations of this size are not normal and if implemented would not respond exclusively to profitability criteria.\n\nThe power objectives provided up to now are extended, establishing 371 MW as reference installed power objective with right to remuneration for photovoltaic installations.888\n\nMemorandum of the Draft Royal Decree regulating the activity of energy production under the special regime and certain facilities of similar technologies under the ordinary regime of 21 March 2007 in relation to RD 661/2007, 21 March 2007, **Exh. R-24**, Section 3.2.1 (emphasis added) (Tribunal's translation).\n\n703.\n\nThe PER 2005-2010 also referred to a 7% figure:\n\n*Return on Project Type:* calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return (IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard project, around 7%, on equity (before any financing) and after taxes.889 (Respondent\u2019s translation)\n\nPER 2005-2010, Spanish Government, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), August 2005, **Exh.

R-60** (full version), p. 182 (Spanish version).\n\n705.\n\nMoreover, the press release issued by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism in May 2007 equally refers to a 7% rate in the following terms:\n\nThe new regulation guarantees a return of 7% for wind farms and hydro-electric facilities that opt to transfer their production to distributors and between 5% and 9% if they participate in the electricity production market. Photovoltaic facilities with greater capacity practically double their compensation, those of a lesser size stay at the same level, and the guaranteed return is 7%.891 (Claimants\u2019 translation)\n\nPress Release announcing RD 661/2007, \"The Government prioritises profitability and stability in the new Royal Decree on renewable energy and combined heat and power\", 25 May 2007, **Exh.

This said, the emphasis in the PER 2005-2010 and the PER 2000-2010, as well as in the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* and the Ministry\u2019s press release shows an intent to guarantee \"approximately\" or \"around\" 7%. There is no dispute that the two PERs and the Ministry\u2019s press release were public (the Claimants actually rely on them to substantiate their expectations) and that, as the Tribunal has previously concluded,897 the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* was publicly available upon request.\n\nSee para. 632.\n\n709.\n\nTherefore, on balance, the Tribunal considers that the \"reasonable rate of return\" that the Claimants could have expected at the time of their investments was in the range of 7%.898 This is the rate of return which the experts used in the EJM in accordance with PO18.899\n\nSee also *Stadtwerke*, para. 337 (where, in considering \"whether the impact upon the Claimants' investment specifically was reasonable or proportionate through an assessment of the rate of return earned by the Claimants' investment before and after the disputed measures\", the tribunal found that the \"reasonable rate of return\" at the time the Claimants made their investment was \"around 7% post-tax\").\n\nSee PO18, para. 12(b) and (e).\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal finally notes that the rate of 7% is broadly aligned with those granted by other European Union Member States, such as France, Italy, Estonia, Latvia,900 and the Czech Republic.901\n\nSee EC Decision on State Aid, **Exh.

See also PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 121-132.\n\nQuantum Reply, para. 166 (emphasis omitted).\n\n712.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, submits that the Tribunal should use Econ One's exit IRRs for the computation of the Actual Scenario. Econ's exit IRRs are calculated using the initial investment cost, historical cash flows generated and the enterprise value at the *ex ante* and *ex post* valuation dates established in PO12. The enterprise value is the market value of the remaining life of the Claimants' PV Plants expressed at the valuation date using a discount rate.905 Thus, Econ One calculates the IRR that an investor would receive assuming that it sells its investment at some point, effectively cashing out the estimated fair market value of the assets through the sale. In any event, for Econ One, the distinction between exit and holding IRRs \"is not particularly relevant here since there is only a small difference between the two calculations\".906\n\nEOQR II, para. 278.\n\nEOQR II, para. 22.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n713.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, for the purposes of the computation of the IRRs, a holding IRR is to be preferred over an exit IRR. This is because Spain calculated the reasonable rate of return over the useful life of an installation (i.e. a holding IRR) and not on a sale of the plant at some moment in the future. In the words of Spain's expert, MG&A:\n\nThe remuneration model for renewable energies in Spain has always been based on the objective of conferring a Reasonable Rate of Return calculated over the whole of the installation\u2019s useful life, that is, from the moment the plant is connected and electricity production begins until the end of its useful life.907\n\nMG&A Rebuttal Expert Report, para. 152.\n\n714.\n\nIn other words, for purposes of assessing the alleged harm to the Claimants\u2019 investments, it is logical to have regard to the IRR that an investor would receive throughout the entire regulatory lifetime of the plant. By contrast, the Tribunal sees little justification in assuming that an investor sells its investment at some point, effectively cashing out the estimated fair market value of the assets through the sale.\n\n715.\n\nAccordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal directed the experts to \"use a holding IRR as opposed to an exit IRR in both scenarios (with Measures and without Measures)\".908\n\nPO18, para. 12(c)\n\n**iv.** ***The Valuation Date***\n--------------------------------\n\n(a) The Parties\u2019 Position\n-------------------------\n\n716.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt an *ex post* or \"date of the award\" valuation date. They contend that according to investment arbitration jurisprudence, an *ex post* valuation is appropriate where it allows a tribunal (a) to ensure full reparation and wipe out the consequences of a wrongful act; and/or (b) to include more recent and comprehensive data, thereby reinforcing the accuracy of the valuation. The Claimants submit that both criteria are satisfied in the present case because, first, an *ex post* assessment ensures use of actual production figures, market information and macroeconomic data, making the valuation more accurate. Second, it accounts for potential changes to the rate of return over time, thereby capturing the additional harm that the Claimants will suffer.909\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, paras. 187-190.\n\n717.\n\nIf an *ex ante* valuation date were to be used, the Claimants submit that the appropriate date should be 30 June 2014, i.e. the date \"when the June 2014 Order was implemented, which sets the precise economic parameters for calculating the Special Payment under the New Regime\".910\n\nQuantum Reply, para. 181. See also PO12 C-PHB1, para. 187 (\"In line with the Tribunal's directions in PO12, Brattle developed both an *ex ante* and an *ex post* valuation. The former uses June 2014 [\u2026]\").\n\n718.\n\nBy contrast, Spain submits that the Tribunal should adopt an *ex ante* valuation date for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Article 13(1) of the ECT expressly refers to the date of valuation as being the \"date of the unlawful act for the purpose of calculating an investor\u2019s alleged damages in case of an expropriation\". The same date of valuation should apply by analogy to other breaches of the ECT, in the absence of specific treaty language to the contrary.911\n\n\u2022 Under customary international law, a fundamental rule of damages is causation, i.e. an injured party must receive full reparation for injury \"caused by\" the internationally wrongful act. It therefore follows that the date of the alleged internationally wrongful act, i.e. of the Disputed Measures, is the only one that has a causal link with the alleged damages suffered.912\n\n\u2022 An *ex ante* valuation approach has been adopted by an overwhelming majority of arbitral tribunals applying the full reparation standard and there is no basis to suggest that an *ex ante* date of valuation will not ensure full reparation.913\n\n\u2022 An *ex post* date of valuation would be arbitrary and unlawful.914\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 188-190.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 191-196, referring to the Case concerning the Factory of Chorzow (*Germany v.

CLA-29**, para. 405.\n\nQuantum Memorial, para. 53.\n\n721.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, according to the specificities of the dispute, an *ex post* valuation may sometimes be preferable because reparation should ideally stand in lieu of restitution and an *ex post* valuation allows for the most recent information to be taken into account. This said, a valuation at the time of the breach, i.e. *ex ante,* appears particularly appropriate when the consequences of a later evolution of prices, interest rates, or other inputs are unrelated to the impugned measures and the (higher) harm can thus not be deemed to derive from the measures.\n\n722.\n\nIn this case, as Brattle explained, there appear to be two main drivers for the difference between the *ex post* and *ex ante* figures, namely the lower interest rates and the (related) possibility of revision of the returns.919 It is clear that the decrease of the interest rates was not caused by the Disputed Measures, but was mainly due to the evolution of the financial markets and to macroeconomic conditions. As for the periodic revisions, they are linked to the evolution of interest rates. To the extent that the calculation of the IRR and the corresponding loss, if there is one, seeks to track reasonable profitability, it should be measured on the conditions that prevail in the markets depending on the economic and financial surroundings.\n\nSee PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Caldwell), 17 January 2018, at 81:23-82:9.\n\n723.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that using a valuation date linked to the date of the award would not be justified. It thus opts for an *ex ante* valuation, which is the approach reflected in PO18. That order indeed provided that \"[a]s valuation date, the EJM shall use the date of the alleged breach as it was set by agreement of the Parties, i.e. 30 June 2014\".920\n\nPO18, para. 12(d).\n\n**v.** ***Harm Calculated per Claimant***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nAt the PO12 Hearing, the experts agreed that the EJM would calculate the harm \"per investor\" or per Claimant (rather than for each plant):\n\nMR CALDWELL [Brattle]: [...] we've basically got models per investor. And then some centralised -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Yes, it's per investor, since some investors have several plants.\n\nDR FLORES: Yes.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And I think you agree with the fact that we'll look at it per investor. Is that right?\n\nDR FLORES: Yes.921\n\nPO12 Hearing Tr. [English version], 19 January 2018, at 65:19-66:2.\n\n725.\n\nAccordingly, in PO18, the Tribunal instructed the experts that \"[t]he harm allegedly suffered by the Claimants shall be calculated per *Claimant\"*.922\n\nPO18, para. 12(a) (emphasis in the original).\n\n726.\n\nThe Joint Memorandum provides the following agreed explanations:\n\nThe harm allegedly suffered is calculated per Claimant entity, rather than per investor group. There are 26 Claimants in total, but some Claimants are 100% wholly owned subsidiaries of other Claimants so there is no need to distinguish between them for the purposes of the EJM. Within the 14 investor groups we distinguish between 19 Claimant entities. For example, the investor group HgCapital includes two Claimant entities: Mercurio Solar S.\u00e0.r.l and Tyche Solar S.\u00e0.r.l.\n\nThe Claimant entities included in the EJM are listed in the EJM.923\n\nJoint Memorandum, paras. 6-7.\n\n727.\n\nTherefore, in light of the experts\u2019 agreement and the absence of objection by the Parties, the Tribunal will establish the harm allegedly suffered by Claimant, that is for each of the 19 Claimant entities, as listed in the EJM.\n\n**vi.** ***Cost Base***\n-----------------------\n\n(a) The Parties\u2019 Position\n-------------------------\n\n(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position\n---------------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the IRRs in the scenario without Measures should be calculated on the basis of an efficiency benchmark, the so-called \"marginal plant\", and not on the basis of the actual greenfield costs incurred for each of the Claimants\u2019 plants.\n\n729.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the IRRs in the scenario without Measures must be determined by applying the same assumptions that Spain used when designing the RD 661/2007 regime. The Claimants explain that Spain never published the cost base (the cost and production parameters) that it employed to determine the FITs applicable under RD 661/2007. In their view, there is nevertheless evidence to demonstrate that the FITs offered under RD 661/2007 (and consequently the IRR) were calculated on the basis of a \"marginal plant\" or \"levelised cost target\",924 i.e. a hypothetical standard plant with the most efficient cost and production parameters.925\n\nThe levelised cost of a PV plant is the \"the price at which the power station would have to sell all its power, increasing each year with inflation over the power station's entire useful life, to recover all operating costs and maintenance costs, to compensate investors for all their capital outlays, and to grant them a reasonable return on their investment\". See, Quantum Memorial, para. 37 citing to Brattle's Second Expert Report, para. 26.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 130; PO12 C-PHB1, para. 49.\n\n730.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the greenfield cost base should be adopted is unfounded.926 In particular, the Claimants observe that the \"greenfield costs\" option (i.e. Alternative 2 in PO18, para. 12(f)(ii)) advocated by Spain, which adopts the actual greenfield costs of the plants as the cost base, would result in the totality of the Claimants\u2019 efficiency gains being \"stripped away\".927 Moreover, adopting this option would not only penalize efficient investors, but would also reward investors who built or bought inefficient plants. In the Claimants\u2019 submission, the inefficient plants that failed to beat the cost target should earn less than 7% after tax. However, if the greenfield costs approach were adopted, those inefficient PV plants would be awarded damages allowing them to achieve 7% after tax returns.928\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 135-137.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 159.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 160.\n\n731.\n\nThe Claimants then explain the marginal plant cost base which they adopted for their But For or without Measures scenario. Because Spain never published the costs and production data on the basis of which it calculated the RD 661/2007 FITs, Brattle had to identify the marginal plants used for each of three size categories provided under RD 661/2007. For this purpose, Brattle took the 42 standard installations defined by Spain under the New Regime (corresponding to the Claimants\u2019 plants) and grouped them according to the three size categories that existed under the Original Regime, i.e. (i) 100kW and under; (ii) between 100kW and 10MW; and (iii) above 10MW.929 Once regrouped, for each of the three size categories, Brattle identified the standard plant that represented the marginal plant under the Original Regime. This resulted in the so-called \"pure\" marginal plant option, according to the Claimants.930 The Alternative Tariff for each of the Claimants' plants was determined based on the size category into which each plant fell. The Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt the \"pure\" marginal plant as the cost base as it most closely resembled the actual RD 661/2007 marginal plant.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 140-141; PO12 C-PHB1, para. 78.\n\nThe denomination of \"pure\" for this marginal plant option is used by the Tribunal for easier understanding in order to distinguish it from the two other marginal plant options proposed by Brattle, i.e. the \"size re-classified marginal plant\" and the \"IT Code\" marginal plant, which were ultimately retained in PO18 (see PO18, para. 12(f)(i)).\n\n732.\n\nHowever, in the event that the Tribunal would not agree to use the \"pure\" marginal plant, Brattle proposed two alternative efficiency standards for calculating damages. The first alternative was based on the so-called \"size re-classified marginal plant\" and the second, on using the actual \"IT Code\" applied by Spain to each of the Claimants' PV installations under the New Regime.\n\n733.\n\nUnder the size re-classified marginal plant option, Brattle regrouped the 42 standard installations into the five size categories introduced by the New Regime (as opposed to the three size categories under RD 661/2007 which it had done for the \"pure\" marginal plant). These five categories are the following: (i) less than or equal to 5kW; (ii) between 5kW and 100kW; (iii) between 100 kW and 2MW; (iv) between 2MW and 10MW; and (v) above 10 MW. This analysis \"assigns each project a marginal plant based on the new size category assigned to it under the New Regulatory Regime, rather than a marginal plant based on the original size category assigned to it under RD 661/2007\".931\n\nBQR II, para. 227.\n\n734.\n\nThe second alternative calculation is based on using the actual \"IT Codes\" applied by Spain to each of the Claimants' PV installations under the New Regime.932 In other words, the \"Own IT-Code\" cost base adopted the efficiency benchmarks that Spain itself established under the New Regime.\n\nAs explained by Brattle, \"[t]he June [2014] Ministerial Order defines 42 separate standard installations (IT-codes) for PV projects previously receiving the FITs under RD 661/2007. For each of the 42 separate IT codes, the June Ministerial Order defines construction costs, and operating costs and production levels throughout the expected 30-year regulatory life of the standard installation\". See BQR II, para. 116 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n735.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, compared to the \"pure\" marginal plant option, the \"size re-classified marginal plant\" cost base, \"allows Spain to (i) create new efficiency standards *ex post\"* as it contemplates five size categories and therefore five marginal plants (as compared to the three original categories under RD 661/2007).933 Further, it allows Spain to \"re-classify the Claimants\u2019 plants [...] *ex post\",* from the smaller categories under RD 661/2007 to the larger size categories defined under the New Regime, thereby reducing the cost and production parameters to which they are subject. Overall, it allows Spain to appropriate some of the efficient gains achieved by the Claimants under RD 661/2007. Nevertheless, it is to be preferred to the \"IT Codes\" option, so say the Claimants, as it allows the Claimants to retain at least some of their efficiency gains.934\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these size categories are (i) installed capacity less than or equal to 5kW; (ii) installed capacity more than 5kW but less than or equal to 100kW; (iii) installed capacity more than 100 kW but less than or equal to 2MW; (iv) installed capacity more than 2MW but less than or equal to 10MW; and (v) installed capacity greater than 10 MW. Of these five size categories, the Claimants 68 PV plants fall into categories (ii) to (v), and are assigned a marginal plant based on which size category they fall into.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 144; PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 88-89.\n\n736.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants submit that opting for the \"Own IT-Code\" cost base in the EJM would allow Spain to appropriate a substantial portion of their efficiency gains, in contradiction to the undisputed evidence of both Parties\u2019 experts that the Claimants were entitled to retain their efficiency gains.935 For the Claimants, applying the Own IT-Codes cost base would allow Spain to retroactively change the fundamental characteristics of the regulatory regime applicable to existing investments, inasmuch as this option not only re-categorises plants depending on their size but also depending on the year of commissioning and the technology used. It therefore introduces many levels of remuneration for different types of plants, where only three existed under the Original Regime.936 In the circumstances, the Claimants submit that there is no compelling reason to depart from the \"Size Re-classified\" marginal plant and choose the \"Own IT-Code\" option instead.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 151-158.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 149-150; PO12 C-PHB1, paras. 85-89.\n\n737.\n\nThe Claimants submit that if, despite evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal adopts the actual greenfield costs of the plants as the cost base (as advocated by Spain), then the quantification proposed by Brattle should be preferred. In that regard, the dispute between the experts concerns the inclusion of developer premiums in the calculation of greenfield costs.\n\n738.\n\nBrattle notes that, in the event the Tribunal decides to include developer premiums in the greenfield costs, both Parties agree on the quantification of these costs.937 Thus, for Brattle, the dispute between the experts concerns only the situation were developer premiums are excluded. Should the Tribunal decide to exclude developer premiums, then the Tribunal should opt for Brattle\u2019s calculations.\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 21.\n\n739.\n\nThe experts\u2019 quantification of the greenfield costs in a situation excluding the developer premiums differs because of their different understandings of the components of \"developer premiums\". For Brattle, it is not appropriate to exclude from the greenfield costs elements of the price paid by an investor to acquire a project prior to construction (as Econ One does), because part of such price will have compensated the original developer for the costs that it incurred for designing the project and obtaining the necessary permits. Thus, these amounts should be included in the calculation of greenfield costs.938\n\nQuantum Reply, paras. 129-130.\n\n(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position\n------------------------------\n\n740.\n\nSpain submits that the remuneration scheme for PV installations, including the RD 661/2007 FIT, has always been based on the \"costs of standard installations that reflect the typical efficient greenfield costs in the market for the construction of certain type of installation in a given year\".939 Furthermore, Spain contends that \"the typical costs of the standard facilities included in the Parameters\u2019 Order IT Codes are [...] representative of the real costs in the market at the time of construction of the PV Plants\".940\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 96. Spain has also insisted that its regulatory framework has always provided that the reasonable return will be obtained at the plant level or, in other words, that the investment costs considered and the profitability obtained are calculated with reference to greenfield investors (i.e., the promoters who undertook the development, construction and commissioning of the installation). Such remuneration does not cover the extra costs incurred by \"secondary\", \"financial\" or \"brownfield\" investors, such as the Claimants, who paid a premium for the acquisition of the asset. Spain contends that the calculation of the remuneration under the current regime also considers the profitability of the project at the plant level (i.e., for greenfield investors), as is demonstrated by RDL 9/2013 and the Order on Parameters, which refer to the reasonable return for the \"facilities\". See R-PHB1, paras. 338-343.\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 24.\n\n741.\n\nBy contrast, Spain asserts that the \"marginal plant\" used by Brattle is not representative of the typical costs and production of the Claimants\u2019 plants. This is because Brattle\u2019s marginal plant applies the costs of the most expensive (but efficient) 5kW plant constructed in 2007 to calculate the \"Alternative Tariff\" and applies the same tariff to all of Claimants' plants \"which are approximately 3.8MW on average\" in size and were constructed in 2008, when costs of construction were lower.941\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, paras. 98-101, 103-104.\n\n742.\n\nIn Spain's submission, the fact that the marginal plant is not representative of typical costs is reinforced by the alternative cost bases proposed by Brattle. These show that \"(i) [...] using a 100 kW plant instead of a 5 kW plant, reduces the alleged damages by around 30% and (ii) using the IT Codes which are the representative of the standard costs of Claimants' Plants, again, reduces the claimed damages by around 40%\".942\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 102 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n743.\n\nThus, the Respondent concludes, \"Brattle's 'Marginal Plant' theory does not make economic sense and there is absolutely no evidence in the record to support that this was the expectation of Claimants\".943\n\nPO12 R-PHB1, para. 93.\n\n744.\n\nMore specifically, Spain contends that the IRRs should be calculated using the Claimants' greenfield costs excluding developer premiums, as calculated by Econ One.944 Spain recalls that greenfield investment costs are the costs incurred at the beginning of a project's lifecycle that are necessary to begin the operation of a PV facility.945 It contends that the only appropriate way to calculate greenfield costs is by excluding developer premiums, since these are not \"greenfield costs\" (i.e. costs necessary to put the plant in operation) and their inclusion would lead to unreasonable results.946\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 203-214.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 204.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 207.\n\n745.\n\nFor Spain, Brattle's argument that developer premiums should be included in the greenfield costs is speculative and unsupported by the evidence, because \"[a]t least part of such acquisition prices will have compensated the original developer for the costs that it incurred in designing a project and compiling the necessary permits\".947\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 208-211.\n\n746.\n\nIf the Tribunal agrees with Spain, the latter further states that the Tribunal should opt for Econ One's calculations of the greenfield costs excluding developer premiums, as Brattle's calculations \"continue to be completely overstated\".948\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 212-214.\n\n747.\n\nFinally, if the Tribunal were to adopt an approach based on the Alternative Tariff, the Respondent agrees with the Claimants that their greenfield costs should not be considered as the cost base for the Alternative Tariffs under the EJM. While Spain\u2019s position is that the only legitimate expectation was for the Claimants to obtain a remuneration that would provide them a rate of return *on their reasonable and efficient greenfield costs* (as opposed to a tariff per MWh), if the scenario without Measures were to \"be calculated on the expectation of receiving a remuneration based on alternative tariffs of \u20ac per MWh, the consistent approach would be to use the standard efficient costs in the market at the time of investment to calculate such tariff, which is represented by the IT Codes\".949\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 150.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n748.\n\nThe first question to be decided with regard to the cost base is whether the Alternative Tariff should be calculated using an efficiency benchmark such as the \"marginal plant\", i.e. essentially a standard plant (PO18, para. 12(f)(i), Alternative 1), or the actual greenfield costs of each of the Claimants\u2019 plants (PO18, para. 12(f)(ii), Alternative 2). On the basis of the record and the expert evidence, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the appropriate option is the marginal plant as opposed to the actual greenfield costs of an individual installation, for the following reasons.\n\n749.\n\nFirst, there is no serious dispute between the Parties that the reasonable return calculated by Spain at the time when the Claimants\u2019 plants were built was based on a marginal plant.\n\n750.\n\nIn its Quantum Counter-Memorial, Spain confirmed that the regulatory regime in place at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investments was a marginal plant system:\n\nSpain has always claimed:\n\na) That the tariffs offered under RD 661/2007 were calculated in order to give the installations an implicit RRoR;\n\nb) That such RRoR was based on implicit levelised-costs associated with an efficient marginal plant; [...]950\n\nQuantum Counter-Memorial, para. 125 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n751.\n\nFurther, Spain\u2019s expert in the liability phase, MG&A, opined that the regulatory regime was based on a standard or marginal plant:\n\nAs can be verified according to the basis of the CNE reports 4/2004 and 3/2007, the CNE has pursued exactly the same steps to calculate the remuneration for photovoltaic energy in 2004 (for the development of RD 436/2004), in 2007 (for the development of RD 661/2007) and afterwards in 2008 (for the preparation of RD 1578/2008). This procedure involves analysing the investment and operating costs of a standard type photovoltaic infrastructure and determining the income required to generate an Internal Return Rate after taxes higher than the Target Rate of Return (TRR).951\n\nMG&A Report, para. 301 (bold in original omitted, underlining added).\n\n752.\n\nMG&A also explained that the reasonable return under the 1997 Electricity Law was calculated using \"a methodology based on installation types with standard technical and economic variables\" and that one of the \"two main principles\" of the 1997 Electricity Law was that the reasonable return was defined with reference to \"the standard economic and technical parameters for installation types for each technology\".952 This is also consistent with the contemporaneous documents describing the reasonable rate of return under the RE framework. For instance, the PER 2005-2010 defines the reasonable rate of return as follows:\n\n*Return on Project Type:* calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return (IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard project, around 7%, on equity (before any financing) and after taxes.953\n\nMG&A Rebuttal Expert Report, paras. 118, 131.\n\nPER 2005-2010, Spanish Government, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), August 2005, **Exh. R-26**, p. 274 [p. 8 of the PDF] (emphasis added) (Respondent's English translation).\n\n753.\n\nIt is natural that the Spanish regulator would refer to a standard plant, rather than the actual costs, in setting the premiums under the 1997 Electricity Law, as it would be almost impossible for it to look at the actual costs of all installations *ex ante.* In fact, the use of a marginal plant system appears to be standard regulatory practice in other countries too.954\n\nSee BQR II, para. 208.\n\n754.\n\nWhile the Tribunal\u2019s task in this case is to calculate the Claimants\u2019 alleged harm as opposed to setting tariffs or other premiums (which is the regulator\u2019s task), this difference in perspective does not warrant abandoning the marginal plant approach which is implied in Spain\u2019s energy incentives framework. Thus, the Tribunal concludes on this point that the regulatory framework at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investment was designed to offer a 7% return after tax on the marginal plant, being noted that the actual returns for a particular PV installation could vary based on the plant's own characteristics.\n\n755.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that, if an Alternative Tariff is used to calculate profitability in the scenario without Measures (which was the Tribunal's determination, see *supra* at VI.B.4.c.i(b)), the only consistent approach is to consider the costs of a standard plant as the appropriate cost base. In particular, in its latest submission, the Respondent has taken the following view:\n\n[T]he Claimants submit that their greenfield costs should not be considered as the cost base for the alternative tariffs. Spain agrees. As explained previously, Spain's position is that the only legitimate expectation was for the Claimants to obtain a remuneration that would provide them a RRoR on their reasonable and efficient greenfield costs, not on a tariff based on \u20ac per MWh. However, as the Tribunal has decided in PO18 that the but-for scenario should be calculated on the expectation of receiving a remuneration based on alternative tariffs of \u20ac per MWh, the consistent approach would be to use the standard efficient costs in the market at the time of investment to calculate such tariff, which is represented by the IT Codes.955\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 150 (emphasis added, internal footnote omitted).\n\n756.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the appropriate cost base is the marginal plant. This being so, the next question is which of the three marginal plant options proposed by Brattle is the most appropriate one to quantify the Alternative Claim.\n\n757.\n\nThe first marginal plant option, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Marginal Plant\" option in capital letters by the Claimant and which the Tribunal refers to as the \"pure\" marginal plant option to distinguish it from the other two alternatives, essentially takes the 42 standard installations defined by Spain under the New Regime (that correspond to the Claimants' PV plants built in 2007 and 2008) and regroups them according to the three size categories that existed under the regime in place at the time of the Claimants' investments. With regard to this option, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has convincingly established that Brattle's \"pure\" marginal plant is a 5kW PV installation, whereas the Claimants' installations have higher capacities. Because of the shortcomings of this option linked to the size of the plants, in PO18, the Tribunal directed the experts to only take into account the two remaining options, namely the size re-classified marginal and the IT Codes marginal plants, which incorporate sensitivities responding to Spain's criticism.956\n\nSee PO18, para. 12(f)(i).\n\n758.\n\nBetween those two options, the Tribunal considers that the size re-categorization performed by Brattle in the size re-classified marginal plant option correctly remedies the deficiency of its \"pure\" marginal plant. By contrast, the \"IT Codes\" option is less appropriate, as it would wipe out all of the efficiency gains that investors obtained compared to the marginal plant under the regulatory regime in place at the time of the Claimants\u2019 investments. As the Tribunal already noted (see *supra* at para. 619), the guarantee to obtain a reasonable return did not imply that it acted as a \"cap\".\n\n759.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the cost base should use the marginal plant approach, with the size re-classified marginal plant sensitivity (PO18, para. 12(f)(i)(a)). In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the Parties\u2019 experts agree on the input for this cost base.957 Hence, the Tribunal will select the option \"Standard installation - size reclassified\" in parameter 2 of the EJM.\n\nSee Joint Memorandum, para. 13, noting that \"Brattle and Econ One agree concerning the relevant standard costs in each of the two marginal cost scenarios. The cost base includes both the initial investment cost and, when evaluating past profits, also considers the historical profitability over the period 2006-2013\".\n\n**vii.** ***Tax Shield***\n-------------------------\n\n(a) The Claimants\u2019 Position\n---------------------------\n\n760.\n\nIn the EJM, the experts concur that \"[g]iven that the Alternative Tariff is calculated on a pre-tax basis, it must include a gross-up to account for corporate taxes\".958 It is for this reason, the Claimants submit, that Brattle used a 17% tax rate to gross-up the 7% or 8% post-tax return into a pre-tax IRR in order to calculate the revenue line in its But-For scenario.959\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 88, discussing Joint Memorandum, para. 37.\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para. 93.\n\n761.\n\nHowever, the Claimants submit that the experts disagree on three matters pertaining to the calculation of the effective tax rate:\n\ni. They divergence on whether the calculation of the effective tax rate should take into account the \"interest tax shield\". The Claimants explain that the tax shield is the reduction in payable taxes as a result of the interest payments to be made on loan financing, which, under the Spanish tax code, can reduce the overall amount of taxes paid by a company.960 It is the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Tribunal should not take the tax shield into account (Alternative 2 in PO18, para. 12(g));\n\nii. They are also in disagreement on the calculation of the interest tax shield in the event that the Tribunal decides to include the tax shield (contrary to the Claimants\u2019 position);\n\niii. They further put forward different methodologies for calculating the effective tax rate.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 89(i), 90-108.\n\n(i) Interest tax shield\n-----------------------\n\n762.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 submission that the Tribunal should not take into account the interest tax shield in the effective tax rate calculation, as Spain did not consider the benefits of the tax shield when setting the tariffs under the Original Regime. The Claimants underline that the revenues provided to the PV plants under the Original Regime was on a pre-tax basis. However, the reasonable return was calculated on a post-tax basis. Consequently, according to the Claimants, it would have been impossible for Spain to guarantee a 7% post-tax return without considering a specific tax rate for calculating the FIT.\n\n763.\n\nActually, there is ample evidence, so the Claimants argue, in support of their position that Spain did not consider any tax shield. First, the Claimants point out that Spain\u2019s (and Econ One\u2019s) current position on the inclusion of the interest tax shield is directly contradicted by the position adopted by Spain\u2019s previous expert, MG&A. That expert repeatedly confirmed that the reasonable rate of return offered under RD 661/2007 did not take the effects of debt into account.961 Thus, until PO12, it was undisputed that Spain did not consider the tax shield when setting the RD 661/2007 FIT.\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, paras. 109-111.\n\n764.\n\nSecond, the Claimants refer to the PER 2000-2010 and the PER 2005-2010, both of which specify that the reasonable rate of return for a standard project is calculated on the basis of preserving a certain internal rate of return, *before any financing.962* For the Claimants and Brattle, the phrase \"before any financing\" corroborates that Spain did not consider the interest tax shield while determining the reasonable rate of return.963\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para. 105(a)-(b) (emphasis added), referring to PER 2000-2010, 30 December 1999, **Exh. R-60** (full version), p.182 and PER 2005-2010, Spanish Government, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), August 2005, **Exh. R-26**, p.274 [p. 8 of PDF] (Respondent's English translation). See also, Quantum Reply, paras. 147-152.\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, paras. 106-108; PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Lapuerta), 19 January 2018, at 61:19-62:9.\n\n765.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that their position is confirmed by the *Greentech* Documents.964 According to the Claimants, the *Greentech* Documents contain the calculations that underlie the *Casos Tipos* in the PER 2005-2010, on the basis of which Spain determined the RD 661/2007 FITs. These calculations show that interest payments on loans were not considered.965 The Claimants discuss the DCF analysis contained in the *Greentech* Documents and argue that, if the PER DCF model considered the tax deductibility of interest on loans (whether third-party or shareholder loans), the model would deduct interest payments from the \"Gross Margin\" when calculating the \"Taxable Income\".966 The absence of any such deductions for interest supports the fact that Spain did not consider the benefits of financing when calculating the target rates of return of 7% after tax set out in the PER 2005-2010.967\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 95-108.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 102-104.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 107.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 107.\n\n766.\n\nThe Claimants seek to refute Spain's attempts to discredit the *Greentech* Documents, on the ground that, by reference to their metadata, these documents were created in 2017 (as initially argued by Spain) or in 2009 (as subsequently argued by Spain) and could thus not have been served to set the RD 661/2007 FITs. The Claimants submit first that Spain produced these documents in the *Greentech* arbitration in response to a request to produce documents relevant to determine the RD 661/2007 FITs. Thus, Spain itself represented that these documents predated RD 661/2007. Second, the content of these documents itself evidences that they were produced in 2005 during the preparation of the PER 2005-2010, and not in 2017 or 2009. Third, the DCF calculations in these documents is consistent with the calculations for *Casos Tipos* in the PER 2005-2010.968 Fourth, the *Greentech* Documents confirm that the tax shield was *not* taken into account in calculating the target rate of return.969\n\nSee in particular Claimants' letter, 10 May 2019.\n\nSee Claimants' letter, 10 May 2019, p. 3.\n\n767.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants submit that \"all of the evidence on the record, including AME's [MG&A's] testimony, shows that Spain has consistently defined target rates of return for renewable projects on a *before financing* basis, that is, without taking into account the tax shield\".970\n\nPO12 C-PHB1, para 112 (emphasis in original).\n\n(ii) If at all, tax shield to be computed according to Brattle's approach\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n768.\n\nIn the alternative, should the Tribunal determine that the interest tax shield must be considered, the Parties' experts disagree as to how the shield should be built into the effective tax rate. According to the Claimants, this requires certain assumptions about the type of financing at issue. In particular, assumptions need to be made about (i) the proportion of external loan financing in the capital structure; (ii) the term of the loans; and (iii) the interest rate.971\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 120.\n\n769.\n\nThe Claimants note that the PER 2005-2010 (based on which the RD 661/2007 FITs were determined), only provides guidance as to the first of these three assumptions, stipulating that RE installations would be financed with 77% debt. Consequently, so say the Claimants, Brattle has adopted this figure for its calculation.972\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 121, discussing the Joint Memorandum, para. 69.\n\n770.\n\nGiven the absence of guidance for the two other parameters, the Claimants explain that Brattle uses the best evidence available to it: the actual third party loans entered into by the project companies. On this basis, Brattle assumes a loan-term of 15 years and an average interest rate of 5%, both being broadly reflective of the terms of the actual loan agreements. For Brattle, these parameters are reasonable, given the initial expectation of a 25-year regulatory life under RD 661/2007 and given that the average loan interest rate would need to be below the overall project rate of return (i.e. below 7%).973\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 121.\n\n771.\n\nThe Claimants note that Econ One disagrees with the parameters chosen by Brattle. Instead, it assumes 85% financing, a loan term of 20 years and an interest rate of 7% on the basis of a distinction between third-party and shareholder loans. According to the Claimants, this distinction is arbitrary. It is \"nothing more than an *ex post* invention of Econ One\"974 and was \"never mentioned in the PER 2005-2010, the *Memoria Econ\u00f3mica* or any of the contemporaneous regulatory evidence referred to by Econ One\", nor was it addressed by MG&A.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 122, referring to Joint Memorandum, para. 74.\n\n772.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants find the assumptions adopted by Econ One inappropriate for other reasons as well. This is because the \"debt profile assumed by Econ One would leave a representative standard installation under the New Regime unable to meet its debt obligations\" and in breach of the financial covenants found in typical loan documentation.975\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 123-125.\n\n773.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should not consider the interest tax shield while determining the effective tax rate. Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to take into account the interest tax shield, the Claimants submit that it should adopt the debt profile proposed by Brattle, which results in an effective tax rate of 10.8%.976\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 38.\n\n(iii) Methodology for calculating the effective tax rate\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n774.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Brattle and Econ One also diverge on the determination of the effective tax rate. This divergence, say the Claimants, boils down to two questions: \"(i) what period of depreciation to take into account; and (ii) whether a single effective tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant or whether a different rate should be calculated for each year of that lifetime\".977\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 109.\n\n775.\n\nAs regards the first issue, Brattle chooses a depreciation period of 25 years, as this is the period actually used by Spain in the PER 2005-2010 and subsequently confirmed by the *Greentech* Documents. According to the Claimants, there is no reason to depart from this approach.978\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 111-112.\n\n776.\n\nIn connection with the second issue, the Claimants submit that a single effective tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant contrary to Econ One's approach of applying a series of annual tax rates. The Claimants argue first that Econ One's current position, which was only put forward in the EJM, departs from its earlier one under PO12 \"where [Econ One] noted the time profile of tax payments but nevertheless used a single effective tax rate\".979 For the Claimants, this is \"another opportunistic attempt to reduce damages at the 11th hour\".980 Second, the Claimants allege that Econ One's approach \"results in systematic under-recovery because of inconsistencies between the cash flow profile used by Econ One to derive the annual effective tax rates in the first place and its final re-profiled series of Alternative Tariffs\".981 Econ One's approach allegedly never results in a 7% after-tax rate of return. Finally, the Claimants submit that Spain did not adopt Econ One's approach when determining the RD 661/2007 tariff.982\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 113, citing EJM, para. 50 (Brattle).\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 114.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 115, citing EJM, para. 53 (Brattle).\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 113-116.\n\n777.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants submit that Econ One's approach must be rejected and a single effective tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of the plant.\n\n(b) The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n778.\n\nSpain's position on the effective tax rate and tax shield is as follows:\n\n\u2022 The effective tax rate should reflect the real taxes paid by PV installations and therefore include the tax shield that those facilities enjoy under the Spanish tax regime;\n\n\u2022 The tax shield should be calculated following the Econ One methodology; and\n\n\u2022 The correct calculation of the effective tax rate is the one provided by Econ One.983\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 151-184.\n\n(i) Interest tax shield\n-----------------------\n\n779.\n\nSpain contends that the tax shield must be taken into account in calculating the effective tax rate.984 It explains that PV facilities, like any Spanish company, are eligible to deduct interest payments and depreciation from their taxable income and to apply investment tax credits, thereby reducing corporate taxes. Furthermore, according to Spanish tax law, \"projects are eligible to deduct the interest payments on shareholder loans\" which substantially reduce taxes due.985 Moreover, as PV facilities are capital intensive, and therefore enjoy a substantial depreciation tax shield, their tax rate should be lower than average. As a consequence of these tax deductions, in the Respondent\u2019s view, Claimants\u2019 PV Plants paid few to no taxes.986\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 153-164.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 153.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 153.\n\n780.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 argument that Spain did not take the interest tax shield into consideration when it set the RD 661/2007 FIT, Spain contends that:\n\n\u2022 The PER 2005-2010 did not include a consideration of the effective tax rate applicable to PV plants, since that depends on the characteristics of each individual plant;987\n\n\u2022 The reference in the PER 2005-2010 to an investment with 100% own resources refers to project returns and had nothing to do with the applicable effective tax rate;988 and\n\n\u2022 There is no evidence that the Claimants invested in reliance on the fact that the PER 2005-2010 calculated the remuneration to PV plants considering a 17% tax rate and no legitimate expectation can be formed on this basis.989\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 155(a).\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 155(b)\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 155(c).\n\n781.\n\nWith respect to the *Greentech* Documents, Spain contends that they are irrelevant for the resolution of this dispute.990 Initially it maintained that the metadata showed that the documents were created in 2017, which would have meant that they were not used to calculate the tariff of RD 661/2007 as they post-date RD 661/2007 by 10 years.991 Subsequently, when disclosing the excel spreadsheets underlying the *Greentech* Documents, the Respondent contended that the documents were created in 2009, thus in any event post-dating RD 661/2007.992 In addition, Spain argues that the Claimants cannot pretend that they had legitimate expectations at the time of investing in Spain based on the *Greentech* Documents, as they admit not having seen such documents prior to the disclosure in this arbitration in 2018.993\n\nSee PO12 R-PHB2, paras. 157-159; Respondent's letter, 3 May 2019.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 158.\n\nSee Respondent's letter, 3 May 2019.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 157-159; Respondent's letter, 3 May 2019.\n\n782.\n\nIn contrast, the Respondent submits that the Claimants should have been aware of CNE Report 3/2007, which mentions 0% taxation in its calculations.994\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 160-161, discussing CNE Report 3/2007, **Exh. C-311** ; Reply, paras. 69, 195, 493, 538.\n\n(ii) Tax shield to be calculated according to Econ One\u2019s methodology\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n783.\n\nThe Respondent contends that for the calculation of both the effective tax rate and the tax shield, the Tribunal should follow Econ One\u2019s approach. This means that:\n\n\u25a0 The calculation of the tax shield should consider an 85% level of debt (as opposed to Brattle\u2019s 77% figure). For the Respondent, debt financing of 85% is a conservative assumption, given that \"some of the Claimants\u2019 plants had shareholder loans for over 100% over its greenfield investment cost\".995\n\n\u25a0 The calculation of the tax shield should consider a 20-year debt with a 7% interest rate, which again is proven by the Claimants\u2019 own loan documentation (covering external loans as well as shareholder loans).996\n\n(iii) Effective tax rate to be calculated according to Econ One\u2019s methodology\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 180.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 183-184.\n\n784.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should adopt Econ One\u2019s calculation of the effective tax rate. Specifically, it should use the following specifications:\n\n\u25a0 The appropriate depreciation period for the calculation of the effective tax rate must be 20 years (and not 25 years, as argued by the Claimants). For the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 own documents support a 20-year depreciation period, while the reference to a 25-year period in the PER 2005-2010 (on which the Claimants\u2019 rely) relates to the technical useful life, and not to depreciation for tax purposes;997\n\n\u25a0 The effective tax rate should consider the time profile of tax payments, which means applying the effective tax rate on an annual basis in such a way that there is no offset for taxes in the early years (when no taxes are expected) and a 25% offset in the later years.998 For the Respondent, to assume that the projects pay the same 10.8% effective tax rate every year, as Brattle does, is incorrect.999\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 168-171.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 173.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 174.\n\n(c) Discussion\n--------------\n\n785.\n\nThe reasonable profitability guaranteed by the 1997 Electricity Law aims at a post-tax returns, whereas the Alternative Tariff is computed on a pre-tax basis. It is therefore necessary to gross up the Alternative Tariff to reach a post-tax return.\n\n786.\n\nIn light of the experts' evidence and the Parties' submissions, the main issue arising in connection with the tax gross up appears to be whether the latter should account for the interest tax shield available to investments with debt financing. Accordingly, the Tribunal asked the experts to compute the loss in the without Measures scenario as follows :\n\ng. The EJM shall compute the harm in the scenario without Measures assuming that the regulator\n\ni. Alternative 1: Took account of the tax shield;\n\nii. Alternative 2: Did not take account of the tax shield[...]1000\n\nPO18, para. 12(g).\n\n787.\n\nIn addressing the interest tax shield, the experts disagreed on essentially two matters, i.e. (i) the methodology to estimate the effective tax rate, an estimate that they both deem necessary,1001 and (ii) the inclusion of the tax shield in that estimate and, if so, the relevant modalities.\n\nJoint Memorandum, paras. 37-38.\n\n788.\n\nAs a result of these divergences, the experts have built four options of effective tax rates into the EJM, i.e. 16.9% (not taking into account interest tax shield under Brattle's methodology), 15.5% (same under Econ One's methodology), 10.8% (taking into account interest tax shield under Brattle's methodology), and 4.7% (same under Econ One's methodology).\n\n789.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the record is not entirely conclusive on whether the regulator did or did not take into account the tax shield when setting the premiums. On the one hand, certain documentary evidence appears to suggest that when designing the RD 661/2007 premium, the regulator envisaged a 7% post-tax return without taking into account financing and, hence, without taking into account a possible tax advantage (so the PER-2000-2010 and the PER 2005-2010).1002 On the other hand, the CNE Report 3/2007 mentions \"0% taxation\" in its calculations.1003\n\nSee in particular PER 2000-2010, 30 December 1999, **Exh. R-60** (full version), p. 182 (specifying that the reasonable rate of return of a standard project was \"calculated on the basis of preserving a minimum 7% IRR, with equity (before financing) and after taxes\") and PER 2005-2010, Spanish Government, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (IDAE), August 2005, **Exh. R-26**, p. 274 [p. 8 of PDF] (Respondent's English translation) (referring to a rate of return on a standard project as \"calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return (IRR)\u2026 (before any financing) and after taxes\").\n\nCNE Report 3/2007, **Exh. C-311**, Annex III, p. 47 [p. 112 of the PDF] (Spanish version).\n\n790.\n\nBe that as it may, some of the documents mentioned above, such as the two PERs form the basis for the calculations of the RD 661/2007 tariff. As such, they cannot be determinative for present purposes. Indeed, in its analysis of the Primary Claim, the Tribunal has held that the Claimants could have no legitimate expectation of an immutable RD 661/2007 tariff and the underlying methodology, but only to a reasonable return of 7% post-tax. It is true that, when implementing the 7% guarantee, the Tribunal was guided on some issues by the choices which the regulator made for RD 661/2007. The Tribunal took such guidance because these choices appeared economically well-founded in light of the issue under review or because they were in line with standard practices. This does not imply that the Tribunal must systematically follow the methodology of RD 661/2007.\n\n791.\n\nIn this particular instance, the evidence on record indicates that the Claimants expected to pay little or no taxes on their revenues, mainly because they expected to be able to deduct interest on loans. In other words, they expected to benefit from the tax shield. For instance, in its investment proposal, NIBC forecasted that its Aldesa plant would not pay any tax on its profits until 2029.1004 Similarly, in a document from 2009 relating to Ampere's acquisition of a participation in the Aznalcollar plant, the plant was forecast not to pay any tax until 2027.1005 Comparable projections may be found for other investors, including AES, MEIF (for the Cadiz Plant) and Whiteowl Capital.1006 For the Tribunal, there can be no better evidence of the Claimants\u2019 expectations than their own projections.\n\nSee Final Investment Proposal to Investment Committee for project Aldesa dated 25 September 2009, **Exh. C-127**, p. 34 (English version).\n\nSee Ampere Equity Fund, Draft Investment Proposal for the Aznalcollar PV Project, March 2009, **Exh. C-404**, p. 10 (English version).\n\nSee BQR-AES-8.5, 2015 Financial Model, tab \"Aggregated Fin Statements,\" Row \"39\"; BQR-MEIF-5.1, tab \"IRR,\" Row 68; BQR-WOC-5.1, tab \"Summary\\_new,\" Row 26.\n\n792.\n\nAnother consideration also plays in favour of taking account of the tax shield. As a matter of law, compensating the Claimants for taxes they have not paid would be contrary to the principle that reparation cannot exceed the harm effectively suffered. In other words, one cannot do better in litigation than in real life.\n\n793.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the so-called *Greentech* Documents and the Parties\u2019 multiple submissions thereon.1007 The Tribunal considers that these documents are unhelpful to resolve the present issue, as - on the Claimants\u2019 submission - they allegedly informed the calculations contained in the PER 2005-2010 and \"pertain[] to Spain\u2019s administrative analysis regarding how Spain determined remuneration under RD 661/2007\".1008 As was explained above, since the Claimants have no entitlement to the FIT under RD 661/2007 and its methodology, the latter lack relevance in a context such as the present one, where other elements of the record lead to a different outcome.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants' request that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the Respondent's failure to produce the *Greentech* Documents has become moot as the Respondent eventually produced the *Greentech* Documents. In any event, the Tribunal considers that, having regard to the extensive documentary evidence produced by both Parties, any failures that may have occurred in the document production process (which have not been established) in no way alter its conclusions of law and fact.\n\nSee Claimants' letter, 10 May 2019; Claimants' Application for Order in Relation to Document Production, 15 October 2018, para. 13.\n\n794.\n\nIn addition to their difference about the tax shield, the experts are also divided on the method to establish the effective tax rate, specifically on (i) what period of depreciation to take into account; (ii) the effect of financing; and (iii) whether a single effective tax rate should be calculated for the lifetime of a plant or whether a different rate should be calculated for each year of that lifetime.\n\n795.\n\nHaving reviewed the experts\u2019 evidence, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that it must calculate the effective tax rate in line with the principles that guided its foregoing analysis on the tax shield. This being so, it notes that on most of the issues, Brattle relies on the PER 2005-2010, while Econ One uses actual data from the Claimants\u2019 documents. In particular, Brattle considers that it is appropriate to use a 25-year depreciation period because it is \"the one actually used by Spain in the PER 2005- 2010\".1009 It further relies on the PER 2005-2010 in respect of the possible effect of financing and its conclusion that \"the PER [...] indicated an assumption that renewable installations would be financed with around 77% debt\".1010 Moreover, it considers that \"[a] 15-year loan term [...] makes sense given initial expectations of a 25-year regulatory life under RD 661\".1011\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 40. See also *ibid*. para. 71 (\"We addressed the depreciation assumption above, explaining our reliance on the PER 2005-2010\").\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 69.\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 70.\n\n796.\n\nAs was discussed above, the Tribunal is not bound by the RD 661/2007 methodology when calculating the 7% reasonable return in the scenario without Measures and should not grant the Claimants more than their actual harm (see *supra* at...). In that light, Econ One's assumptions and calculations appear more appropriate. In this respect, the Tribunal accepts that the 20-year depreciable life used by Econ One is the typical tax advantage utilized by photovoltaic facilities.1012 It also finds Econ One's assumption of a 7% interest rate on shareholder loans more reflective of actual conditions than Brattle's 5% rate, as in fact certain plants had interest rates higher than 10%.1013 Furthermore, it finds Econ One's 85% financing assumption reasonable, because, as a matter of fact, the actual PV plants of the Claimants benefitted from a principal balance above 90%.1014\n\nSee, e.g., EO-EOX-5, Cantillana PV - Financial Statement (Consolidated) - Anemoi Cantillana, S.L., Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, p. 13; EO-IMP-29, LSY ElCalaver\u00f3n PV - Financial Statement (Individual) -Langsyne Spain, S.L., Annual Accounts for the year ended in December 31, 2009 (BQR-IMP-1.1), p. 10.

This approach is consistent with the history of the PV plants, which paid no taxes in the period preceding the Disputed Measures.1015\n\nSee Joint Memorandum, para. 86, and EOQR II, paras. 261, 266.\n\n798.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the harm in the scenario without Measures must be computed assuming that the regulator took account of the tax shield and implementing Econ One\u2019s estimate of the effective tax rate. Hence, the Tribunal will select the option \"Include Interest Tax Shield (Econ One)\" in parameter 1 of the EJM.\n\n**viii.** ***Revisions of Rate of Return***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Parties\u2019 Position\n-------------------------\n\n799.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal should assume that, in the scenario with Measures, revisions of returns occur under the New Regime every six years as it is undisputed that under the New Regime \"Spain is set to revise the pre-tax reasonable return at the beginning of 2020 and then every six years thereafter\".1016\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 164, discussing Joint Memorandum, para. 87.\n\n800.\n\nThe Claimants explain that selecting their preferred alternative for the EJM actually lowers the Claimants\u2019 damages, because, based on data available as of June 2014, which is the valuation date, the experts \"forecast the pre-tax return to evolve to: 7.2% for 2020-2025, 8.4% for 2026-2031, 8.5% for 2032-2037, and 8.1% for 2038 onwards\".1017\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 165, discussing Joint Memorandum, para. 88.\n\n801.\n\nSeparately, the Claimants also note that according to the New Regime regulations currently in force and the data now available (which would have been considered with an *ex post* valuation date), the returns will be further reduced, because the return for the period of 2020-2025 will be lower than the amounts predicted in 2014. For the Claimants, \"[t]his reflects the unpredictable nature of the New Regime and, therefore, the high regulatory risk under the New Regime\".1018\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 166-168.\n\n802.\n\nSpain agrees with the Claimants that the DCF should consider the scheduled revisions of the rate of return and submits that it has always been its position that reasonable profitability is a flexible concept that should be reviewed periodically to reflect the changes in the cost of money in the capital markets.1019\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 201-202.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n803.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 agreement and of the fact that this appears the correct solution, the Tribunal will assume that revisions of returns will occur under the New Regime every six years in the scenario with Measures. Indeed, as was also set out by the experts in the Joint Memorandum, with the Disputed Measures in place, the applicable reasonable pre-tax rate of return as of the valuation date is 7,398% and Spain is set to revise such tax at the beginning of 2020 and then every six years thereafter. The revisions will be based on the evolution of the Spanish 10-year government bond yield.1020 The Tribunal further notes that the experts agree on the forecast evolution of the rates of return.1021\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 87.\n\nSee Joint Memorandum, para. 88.\n\n804.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal selects the input \"Assume Revision of Returns Occur\" in parameter 4 of the EJM.\n\n**ix.** ***Past profits***\n--------------------------\n\n(a) The Parties\u2019 Position\n-------------------------\n\n805.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the revenues that they have received before June 2014 when the New Regime was implemented must not be considered in constructing the Alternative Tariff (Alternative 2, para. 12(i)(ii), PO18). For the Claimants, this option is the correct choice, as otherwise the Tribunal would endorse \"one of the most severe aspects of the New Regime\", i.e. the retroactive clawback of past profits.1022\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 170-173.\n\n806.\n\nIn the event the Tribunal decides not to take account of past profits, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt Brattle\u2019s implementation of that option. According to the Claimants, Econ One\u2019s implementation is inappropriate. The Claimants essentially contend that the straight line depreciation assumed by Econ One is not proper because the RD 661/2007 tariffs increased annually in a non-linear manner in accordance with inflation. As a result, the capital recovery tended to be lower in the early years of the project and higher in later years as a result of the inflation indexation. Consequently, the recovery was less than that implied by straight line depreciation.1023\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 175.\n\n807.\n\nBy contrast, Spain submits that the only way to calculate profitability is by considering the full regulatory life of a project. It thus contends that the Tribunal should consider \"past profits\", i.e. the revenue obtained in the period from the day that the PV plant commenced operation and June 2014, when the Order on Parameters was issued.1024\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 186-187.\n\n808.\n\nSpain explains that from an economic perspective, the only manner to measure a rate of return is to consider the entire life of a project, which entails that all past profitability must be accounted for in the calculations.1025 This has also been confirmed by the EC Decision on State Aid.1026\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 189.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 189, discusssing EC Decision on State Aid, **Exh. RLA-201**, para. 156.\n\n809.\n\nContrary to what the Claimants allege, Spain takes the view that the Disputed Measures are not retroactive and only have prospective effect. Thus, Spain argues that the so-called \"retroactive claw-back of past profit\" referred to by the Claimants is nothing more than the regulator considering historical data in setting the future framework.1027\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 193-194.\n\n810.\n\nHowever, should the Tribunal decide that the correct solution is to ignore past profits, then Spain contends that it should follow Econ One's calculations rather than Brattle's.1028 In Spain's view, Econ One is right in only ignoring *excess profitability* (i.e. higher than 7% post-tax) and in assuming that in the first 6-8 years the Claimants' PV plants recovered a portion of their initial investment cost based on normal profitability necessary to recover the investment over the 30-year useful life.1029\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 197-200.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 200.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n811.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the computation of the loss, if any, in the scenario without Measures must take or not take account of past profits earned by the Claimants' plants before the Disputed Measures. Accordingly, in PO18 the Tribunal provided two alternative permutations as follows:\n\nThe EJM shall compute the Alternative Tariff applied in the scenario without Measures\n\ni. Alternative 1: Taking into account past profits;\n\nii. Alternative 2: Not taking into account past profits.1030\n\nPO18, para. 12(i).\n\n812.\n\nThe New Regime essentially envisages that the 7,398% profitability is calculated for the lifetime of the plants taking into account past earnings made in excess of that target. The Tribunal is of the view that the inclusion of past profits in the computation would be tantamount to repealing or clawing back earnings which were legitimately made under the previous regime. Thus, it considers that, for the purposes of quantifying the Alternative Claim, it would not be admissible to deduct past profits when calculating an investor\u2019s remuneration going forward.\n\n813.\n\nThis conclusion is consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s prior finding on the Primary Claim that as long as RD 661/2007 was in force (and the economic conditions allowed it), efficient installations could outperform the reasonable return target and were entitled to keep the profits which the system allowed them to make.1031 The contrary solution would imply that the State can change legislation with retroactive effect, which would be contrary to the principle of non-retroactivity. In this respect, the Tribunal cannot follow Spain when it argues that the Disputed Measures are not retroactive, as \"they do not seek to recover any subsidies received before the date the legislation comes into effect. Rather, they simply seek to change the regime in a forward looking way\".1032 Although it is true that payments already received need not be returned under the New Regime, in practice this particular aspect of the New Regime entails that payments under RD 661/2007 are deducted from future remuneration and treated as offsets to the total amount that investors will be allowed to earn going forward. The Tribunal thus has no hesitation to find that it is correct not to take past profits into account when calculating an investor\u2019s remuneration going forward.1033\n\nSee *supra* para. 619.\n\nRejoinder, para. 1044.\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation in the decisions in *RREEF*, according to which the claw back would deprive investors of acquired rights in violation of the non-retroactivity principle (see *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and on The Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018, para. 328) and *BayWa*, paras. 495-496 (where the tribunal agreed with the analysis in *RREEF* and noted that \"[t]o claw back those profits on the basis of a subsequent judgment that they were 'excessive' was inconsistent with the principle of stability in Article 10.1 of the ECT and has not been shown to have been necessary to resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event by the Disputed Measures without much further delay and without the element of claw-back of payments earlier lawfully made\").\n\n814.\n\nThe experts concur on the calculation of the Alternative Tariff taking into account past profits (which option, however, the Tribunal has now discarded), but disagree on the calculation of the Alternative Tariff ignoring past profits.\n\n815.\n\nOn this latter aspect, the Tribunal favors Econ One\u2019s method, as it correctly ignores only *excess* profitability (i.e., profitability above 7% post tax). By contrast, Brattle disregards *any* past revenue. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the latter approach is incorrect, as under a regime guaranteeing a 7% return (which is what the Claimants should have legitimately expected and which is thus to be assumed in the scenario without Measures), the Claimants would have made such return and there is no good reason not to take that 7% return into account to establish the IRR over the lifetime of the plant. Only the profits above 7%, which represent the extra gains of efficient plants and operators, must not be considered to compute the IRR over the operational life of the plant. Doing otherwise would be equivalent to taking these efficiency gains away from the Claimants, a claw-back that the Tribunal has deemed inadmissible for the reasons explained above.\n\n816.\n\nThe Tribunal is further convinced that Econ One\u2019s approach is also more reasonable in a number of other respects. First, as Spain\u2019s expert does, it is sound to assume that in the first years of operation the plants recovered a portion of their initial investment amount. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that an installation from 2008 which started operating in 2009 should have recovered 5/30 of the initial investment amount by the entry into force of the New Regime and, consequently, the remaining investment to be recovered as of 2014 is 83.3% of the initial investment cost base. By contrast, the Tribunal sees no good reason to assume a new plant with over 100% of the initial investment cost base yet to be recovered as of 2014, as Brattle does. Furthermore, Econ One does not add inflation to the asset base, which Brattle does thereby unduly inflating the harm.1034\n\nSee also the discussion at the Hearing: PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version] (Caldwell), 17 January 2018, at 159:24-160:3.\n\n817.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal selects the input \"Ignoring Past Profits (Econ One)\" in parameter 3 of the EJM.\n\n**x.** ***Initial Investment Costs***\n-------------------------------------\n\n818.\n\nThe issue of the greenfield costs which was already evoked in the context of the cost base, also plays a role to establish the Claimants' initial investment for purposes of the experts' IRR calculation. In this respect, the Joint Memorandum provides the following explanation, it being noted that these paragraphs are agreed between the experts:\n\n**X. Interpreting the IRRs**\n\n113. As indicated above, the results file displays Claimant IRRs for each combination of inputs, assuming that the Measures are in place. Of the six possible inputs in PO18, paragraphs 12 (f)-12 (i), only three affect the IRR calculation:\n\n\u2022 Initial Investment Amount\n\n\u2022 Revision of RRR\n\n\u2022 Interest Tax Shield\n\n114. **Initial Investment Amount** : There are four options for the initial investment amount for IRR calculations. The four input options are summarized by investor group in **Table 2**, which are then subdivided into Claimant entities. As indicated in that table, the costs will be the same for all four inputs for several of the Claimant entities. The Claimant entities with differences are explained in detail in Section V.B above.1035\n\nJoint Memorandum, paras. 113-114 (emphasis in original).\n\n819.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that greenfield investment costs are the costs borne at the beginning of a project's lifecycle that are necessary to bring a plant into operation. This includes the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) costs associated with the photovoltaic modules and the civil works required to put them in place, the cost to connect the facility to the electricity grid, initial inventory required for normal operation, permitting and licensing fees. The Tribunal agrees with Spain that other costs that may be borne by investors are not strictly necessary for the operation of the plant. These include costs associated with debt financing, acquisition premiums paid to developers or for brownfield assets (investments that are either nearly or completely developed and operational).\n\n820.\n\nDeveloper premiums fall in the second category. They are not strictly speaking greenfield costs in the sense that they are not required to bring a plant into operation. The Tribunal notes that Brattle does not dispute that brownfield costs should *not* be included in the calculation of the Claimants\u2019 IRRs for the purposes of considering whether they obtain returns in accordance with the reasonable profitability principle under the 1997 Electricity Law.1036\n\nBQR II, para. 99 (\"A final measurement issue is highlighted by Econ One's exclusion of any 'development premiums' from its estimates of greenfield costs. We agree with Econ One that the Original Regulatory Regime return target relates to greenfield investment, as opposed to brownfield investment, which involves purchases of plants already in operation or nearing the end of construction. We therefore ignore the brownfield acquisition premiums paid by many of the PV Investors from our own estimates of greenfield costs\", internal footnotes omitted).\n\n821.\n\nHowever, Brattle argues that:\n\nRemoving the entire acquisition price is inappropriate [...]. At least part of such acquisition prices will have compensated the original developer for the costs that it incurred in designing a project and compiling the necessary permits. The available accounting data do not distinguish what part of the price relates to direct cost recovery, and what part represents a \"premium\" in the sense of a profit for the original developer. We continue to include the greenfield acquisition prices in our estimates of greenfield construction costs.1037\n\nBQR II, para. 180 (emphasis added, internal footnote omitted); see also Joint Memorandum, para. 26.\n\n822.\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced that, lacking clear evidence shedding light on the composition of the acquisition prices, it would be appropriate to include the developer premiums in the costs. Hence, it considers that on balance it should exclude developer premiums from the calculation of the IRR.\n\n823.\n\nThis being so, the experts disagree on the figures of greenfield costs in the option \"Excluding developer premiums\". As summarized in table 2 of the EJM, Brattle values the total costs excluding developer premiums at EUR 1,802.8 million, whereas Econ One\u2019s figure is EUR 1,772.2 million.1038 There is thus a difference between the experts\u2019 numbers of EUR 30.6 million, which is due to the fact that Brattle characterizes the cost items included in this amount as costs other than developer premiums when Econ One regards them as developer premiums. The disagreement between the experts relates to seven Claimants, the disagreement being relatively minor for five of them.1039\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 18.\n\nSee Joint Memorandum, para. 29.\n\n824.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the experts\u2019 calculations and in particular sections IV.B.3 (\"Excluding 'Developer Premiums\u2019 (Brattle)\") and IV.B.4 (\"Excluding 'Developer Premiums\u2019 (Econ One)\") of the Joint Memorandum and the passages of the expert reports referred to therein. It reaches the conclusion that Econ One\u2019s calculations of the greenfield costs excluding developer premiums better comport with the notion of greenfield costs that the Tribunal has retained, i.e. those costs necessary to bring the plant into operation (see *supra* at 819). It is also better in line with the position taken above according to which, lacking clear evidence that an item forms part of greenfield costs as defined earlier, that item should not be included in such costs and thus deducted as developer premiums. For these reasons, the Tribunal selects the input \"Exclude 'Developer Premiums\u2019 (Econ One)\" in parameter 5 of the EJM.\n\n**xi.** ***Interest***\n----------------------\n\n(a) The Parties\u2019 position\n-------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe Claimants note that the treatment of interest was not a parameter identified in PO18 as something that should be the subject of different parameters in the EJM. The Claimants explain that during the course of the preparation of the EJM, Econ One took the view that, although it agrees that interest should be calculated on lost historic cash flows, it disagreed that the EJM should allow the Tribunal to make that calculation. Thus, the Tribunal will need to determine whether it wishes to take advantage of the EJM for purposes of calculating interest on lost historic cash flows, which the Claimants believe it should.1040\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 177.\n\n826.\n\nWith regard to pre-award interest, the Claimants submit that interest must be applied to both the lost \"historical\" cash flows (in the period from 2011 to June 2014) and the lost \"future\" cash flows (from June 2014).1041 Brattle takes the view that the 10-year Spanish bond rate is the appropriate rate for pre-award interest.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 179.\n\n827.\n\nWith regard to post-award interest, the Claimants contend that the rate should be higher than the pre-award interest rate, in order to reflect the higher risks associated with a debt that is overdue and to encourage payment of the award by Spain in priority to other indebtedness.1042\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 181-182.\n\n828.\n\nWith regard to the EJM, the Claimants explain that the model does not compute interest beyond the valuation date of June 2014. The disagreement between Brattle and Econ One as to the implementation of interest in the EJM is therefore limited to the computation of interest on the lost \"historical\" cash flows, in the period from 2011 to June 2014.1043 The Claimants submit that the \"Include Interest in Past Damages\" option (supported by Brattle) in the EJM, applying interest at the 10-year Spanish bond rate to all harm suffered by the Claimants, should be preferred to Econ One's option of \"Exclude Interest From Past Damages\", which does not calculate interest on lost \"historical\" cash flows in the EJM.1044\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 183.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 184-185.\n\n829.\n\nThe Respondent argues that PO18 did not instruct the experts to include interest calculations in the EJM, which is the reason why Econ One did not include interest in the EJM.1045 For Spain, this approach is in accordance with \"the purpose of PO12 and PO18 [which] is to assist the Tribunal in determining liability, not damages\".1046 That apart, Spain contends that calculation of interest up to June 2014 is unhelpful at this stage because the date of the Award is not known.1047\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, paras. 215-216.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 217.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Interest dated 17 May 2019, para. 6, discussing Joint Memorandum, paras. 108-109.\n\n830.\n\nSubject to the preceding argument, Spain and Econ One submit that the appropriate pre-award interest rate is the six-month EURIBOR as it is a short-term risk-free rate without spread.1048 Spain objects to the choice of interest rates proposed by Brattle and the Claimants. It submits that the 10-year Spanish bond rate put forward by Brattle is inappropriate as it is higher than the risk free rate and rather than \"compensat[ing] the Claimants for the passage of time\", it would effectively serve to \"discipline or otherwise incentivize [S]tates towards one policy approach or another\". Moreover, there is no rationale that justifies the 2% spread above LIBOR advanced by the Claimants as such a spread would only be applicable in order to protect a lender against the risk of default of the borrower.1049\n\nRespondent's Submission on Interest dated 17 May 2019, para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Interest dated 17 May 2019, paras. 9-10.\n\n831.\n\nFinally, Spain opposes the Claimants' claim for a higher rate of interest. For Spain, a higher post-award rate of interest has a punitive character, which is incompatible with the compensatory nature of damages under international law. Further, a higher rate also presumes, without any legitimate basis, that Spain will not discharge its obligation to promptly pay the damages awarded by the Tribunal. Instead, Spain submits that the Tribunal should apply a risk-free rate for post award like for pre-award interest, as this has been considered appropriate by other international tribunals.1050\n\nRespondent's Submission on Interest dated 17 May 2019, paras. 14-20.\n\n(b) Discussion\n--------------\n\n832.\n\nThe determination of interest has two aspects in this case. First, interest on so-called lost \"historical\" cash flows must be determined, i.e. cash flows from 2011 to June 2014 must be carried forward from the date they were earned until the valuation date. This question is related to one of the inputs in the EJM (parameter 6). Second, from the valuation date on, any amount due must bear interest until payment in full.\n\n833.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal addresses the first question, i.e. the calculation of interest on lost historical cash flows. The second question is addressed in section VI.B.4.c.xiii below, which deals with interest on the amounts awarded.\n\n834.\n\nAs explained in the Joint Memorandum, \"[b]oth experts agree that the historical cash flows must be rolled forward with interest to achieve full compensation\".1051 However, Brattle and Econ One are in disagreement on the \"prejudgment\" interest rate.1052 Having reviewed the experts\u2019 positions, the Tribunal considers it is justified to apply the Spanish 10-year borrowing rates to bring the lost historical cash flows forward to the valuation date. It reaches this conclusion because, by not allowing Claimants to earn the guaranteed return for a number of years, Spain has exposed the Claimants to risks that are identical to those assumed by investors who have lent money to Spain, and the government bond rate reflects the remuneration paid to market participants for bearing those risks. Furthermore, Spain now bases the remuneration under the New Regime on Spanish 10-year bond yields.\n\nJoint Memorandum, para. 105 (Brattle).\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n835.\n\nThus, the Tribunal will resort to Brattle\u2019s implementation of the interest input, i.e. to the option \"Include Interest in Past Damages\" in parameter 6 of the EJM, thereby letting interest accrue at the 10-year Spanish bond rate to update lost past cash flows to June 2014.\n\n**xii.** ***Overall Results of Loss Computation***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The Claimants\u2019 position\n---------------------------\n\n836.\n\nThe Claimants make the following conclusive remarks on the IRRs that result from the implementation of the EJM in accordance with the parameters set out in PO18. They submit that following the Tribunal\u2019s directions in PO18 and its letter of 24 September 2018, the EJM contains the IRR calculation for the Claimants\u2019 PV plants (but not for the Claimant entities themselves) in the scenario with Measures.1053\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 186.\n\n837.\n\nThey recall that the IRR calculation (both in the But For and Actual scenario) in the EJM is affected by three out of the six inputs in PO18: (a) the cost base; (b) whether the calculation considers future revisions of the reasonable rate of return; and (c) whether the interest tax shield is taken into account in the computation of the effective tax rate. Given the multiple disagreements between the Parties\u2019 experts regarding these parameters, there are \"32 possible sets of Claimant IRRs with the Measures in place\".1054 The Claimants are of the view that given the multitude of potential IRRs for each Claimant, the IRR results set out in the EJM \"will be of little value to the Tribunal unless they are interpreted in the context of the assumptions that underlie them\".1055\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 187, discussing Joint Memorandum, para. 118.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 187.\n\n838.\n\nIn that regard, the Claimants underline that Spain has admitted that the New Regime offered a lower rate of return than the Original Regime. This implies that an IRR calculation for the New Regime\u2019s standard installations in the Actual scenario that results in returns above 7% after tax by definition cannot be using the same assumptions as those used by Spain when setting the RD 661/2007 tariffs.\n\n839.\n\nWith that in mind, the Claimants invite the Tribunal to compare the IRR results under Brattle\u2019s preferred methodology (not including the tax shield in the effective tax rate calculation), which are shown in Table 5 from the Joint Memorandum, with those under Econ One\u2019s preferred methodology (including the tax shield in the effective tax rate calculation), which are in Table 6 from the Joint Memorandum.1056 The Claimants underscore that Brattle\u2019s results show that under the New Regime all of the standard installations receive returns of 6.1% to 6.2% post-tax, which is substantially less than the 7% post-tax return that the Tribunal determined and Spain argued was on offer under the Original Regime.1057 By comparison, using Econ One's approach, standard installations would achieve around 7% post-tax IRRs, which is the same as the target return alleged to be offered under RD 661/2007. According to the Claimants, this is inconsistent with the fact that the New Regime reduced returns.1058\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, paras. 190, 194.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 191.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 196.\n\n840.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that Spain's focus on the IRRs is consistent with Econ One's position that those investors whose plants' returns exceed 7% are not entitled to damages. This approach is, in the Claimants' view, wrong, because it eliminates damages for those investors whose plants were more efficient than the standard (marginal) plant and rewards those investors whose plants suffered from inefficiencies.1059\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 197, discussing the following passage from the PO12 Hearing Tr. [English version], 19 January 2018, at 84:3-18:  \nTHE PRESIDENT: So it's important that we get it. The standard cost --typical cost of 50, the plant is actually built for 48 because this is a very efficient operator. Right? So he saves 2. He saves 2. The result of that is that he achieves 7.7 IRR because his initial investment costs are lower. Then the disputed measures reduce his IRR to 7.2. You simply -- you say he's above 7, he's fine. We don't deal with him anymore. You don't consider that he's entitled to damages for the difference between 7.7 and 7.2. DR FLORES: That is correct. We did not calculate damages for that.  \nTHE PRESIDENT: And the situation is different for Brattle, where Brattle considers that this drop from 7.7 to 7.2 entitles that claimant to damages. Is that right?  \nMR LAPUERTA: Yes.\n\n841.\n\nIn conclusion, applying Brattle's preferred damages permutations under the EJM, the Claimants contend that the 14 Claimant groups are entitled to an aggregate amount of EUR 520 million, as shown in the following chart:1060\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Claimant Entity | Investor Group | Impact (\u20ac Millions) |\n| 1. | AES Solar Energy

the Claimants' plants paid and will pay a 17% tax rate, which is incorrect,1066 and (ii) are based on \"Brattle's calculation of the Claimants' greenfield costs which is not supported by the evidence

is below 7%. By contrast, for the remaining 9 Claimant entities the IRR with the Disputed Measures in place is in excess of 7%. For the reasons explained *supra* at 648, by reducing the reasonable rate of return below 7%, Spain acted unreasonably and disproportionately and hence violated FET. Therefore, the Claimant entities whose IRR with the Disputed Measures are lower than 7% are entitled to compensation and the harm calculated by the experts in the EJM represents the measure of compensation for each Claimant entity.\n\n848.\n\nMore specifically, the following Claimant entities are entitled to receive the following amount as a result of the Respondent\u2019s breach:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Claimant entity**1068 | **Amount of Damages (EUR millions)** |\n| AES Solar Energy Co\u00f6peratief U.A | **15.4** |\n| Ceconat Energy GmbH | **5.4** |\n| Ampere Equity Fund B.V. | **11.1** |\n| Element Power Holdings B.V. | **2.2** |\n| Eoxis Holding S.A. | **6.1** |\n| Impax Solar Investment S.\u00e0.r.l | **29.3** |\n| Impax New Energy Investors S.C.A. | **7.3** |\n| InfraClass Energie 4 GmbH & Co.

KG | **0.1** |\n\nThe names of the Claimant entities have been updated following the list circulated by the Claimants on 3 February 2020.\n\n849.\n\nWith respect to some of these investors (Ceconat, DIF/Ampere, NIBC and KGAL), the Respondent has argued that \"this underperformance was not a result of the Disputed Measures, but rather directly attributable to private decisions made by those Claimants\".1069 The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent\u2019s arguments and considers them insufficiently substantiated. In particular, it notes that the Respondent relies on certain criticism voiced by Econ One in relation to the IRRs of these investors.1070 It is true that in its reports and presentations, Econ One discusses the possibility that high costs depressed these IRRs, either through inefficiency or related party transactions. However, Econ One does not rely on direct evidence, let alone conclusive one, showing that costs were inflated. It merely suggests that inflation \"could\" or \"may\" have occurred based on the involvement of related parties in the construction or operation and maintenance of the plants.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 220.\n\nSee PO12 R-PHB2, paras 220-225, referring in particular to EOQR II, paras 110, 112-120, 132-136, 183-196, 207, 233; and EO Presentation, pp. 38-39, 42.\n\n850.\n\nIn addition to the lack of proof, the Tribunal finds that costs are already correctly factored in the EJM, and it is unconvinced that they should gain relevance again here in the manner advocated by Spain and Econ One. Finally, the fact that the two Claimant entities belonging to the KGAL group \"on average\" are making an IRR higher than 7%1071 is irrelevant for present purposes, as the Tribunal must consider the harm \"by Claimant entity\" and not on average across various Claimants entities. Accordingly, the entity belonging to the KGAL group (Infraclass Energie 4 GmbH & Co KG), whose IRR is below 7% (in this case, 5%), is entitled to compensation.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 225.\n\n**xiii.** ***Interest on Amounts Due1072***\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe Parties' positions on the interest on amounts due are recapped *supra* at VI.B.4.c.xi.\n\n851.\n\nHaving concluded that the Claimant entities listed above are entitled to recover damages as a consequence of Spain's breach of the ECT, the Tribunal now deals with interest on the amounts due.\n\n852.\n\nArticle 26(8) of the ECT provides that \"the awards of arbitration [...] may include an award of interest [...]\". It is well-established that interest forms an integral part of any award of compensation, the aim of which is to achieve full reparation and to re-establish the situation which would have existed if the illegal acts had not been committed. As mentioned above, the full reparation principle is not disputed between the Parties. Tribunals have repeatedly held that, in order to achieve full reparation, it is necessary that an award of damages bear interest.1073\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, Lisbon, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95, **Exh. CLA-18 /****RLA-31** ; *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, **Exh. CLA-131**, paras. 174-175; *Continental Casualty Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, **Exh. CLA-202**, para. 308.\n\n853.\n\nWith regard to interest running from the valuation date to payment in full, the Tribunal considers that interest must accrue at the same rate and upon the same terms both before and after the award. This is the consequence of the fact that the Respondent's obligation to pay damages does not arise on the date of the award but rather at the time when the internationally wrongful act caused harm.1074 Additionally, as noted in *Micula,* there is in any event no basis to distinguish between pre- and post-award interest as the purpose of both is to compensate for the deprivation of funds.1075\n\nSee also *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, **Exh. RLA-197**, paras. 436-438.\n\n\"As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal does not see why the cost of the deprivation of money (which interest compensates) should be different before and after the Award, and neither Party has convinced it otherwise. Both are awarded to compensate a party for the deprivation of the use of its funds. The Tribunal will thus award pre- and post-award interest at the same rate\" (See *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. The Republic of Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, **Exh. CLA-161**, para. 1269).\n\n854.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the interest should be compounded in line with generally accepted financial practice. If the Claimants had not been deprived of the funds to which they were entitled, they could have invested them and would have earned compound interest. Similarly, if as a result of the deprivation, they had to borrow money, they would also have paid compound interest. Case law confirms this choice.1076\n\n*Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others v. The Republic of Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, **Exh. CLA-161**, paras. 1266-1267; *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena v.

TAX GROSS-UP**\n---------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n856.\n\nThe Claimants make a tax gross-up claim in accordance with the full reparation principle under international law. They contend that any amount awarded would be subject to corporate taxes in their home jurisdictions (The Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Germany), whereas dividend distributions made in the ordinary course would not have been subject to taxation.1077 They have presented memoranda from tax lawyers confirming the tax treatment of an award in each of those jurisdictions.1078\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 200.\n\nSee Flick Gocke Schaumburg Report on the taxation of the Award in Germany, 9 November 2017, **Exh. C-702** ; Houthoff, Buruma Tax Report on the taxation of the Award in the Netherlands, 9 November 20117, **Exh. C-703** ; Baker and McKenzie, Tax Report on the taxation of the Award in Luxembourg, 7 November 2017, **Exh. C-704**.\n\n857.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that the EJM does not include their tax gross-up claim given that the precise amount of the tax gross-up will only be ascertainable after the Tribunal has determined the amount owing to the Claimants in its award. In the circumstances, the Claimants propose that, \"[t]he grossed-up sum can be calculated and agreed by the Parties' experts in accordance with the Tribunal's decision on other aspects of quantum\".1079 They contend that \"[t]hereafter, there would be a number of potential options pursuant to which the Tribunal may address the tax gross-up claim\", including:\n\n(a) award the tax gross-up in the amount computed by the experts on the condition that the appropriate entity provides a written undertaking that any amount not paid over to the relevant tax office is returned to Spain (i.e. an undertaking against double recovery);\n\n(b) order for the full amount of the tax gross-up to be placed into an escrow account, pending a final determination from the appropriate tax authority, following which the relevant amount would be paid over and any remaining funds returned to Spain; and\n\n(c) order that Spain hold the Claimants harmless from any amount of tax due, in which case no funds would pass until the tax authorities reach a decision.1080\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 205.\n\nPO12 C-PHB2, para. 205.\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' request for a tax gross-up should be denied for the following reasons:1081\n\na. First, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider a tax gross-up claim pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, which carves out taxation matters;\n\nb. Second, Spain cannot be held responsible for taxation by other States;\n\nc. Third, any award would be exempted from taxation in the States of each of the Claimants' nationalities because it would be considered a dividend payment; and\n\nd. Fourth, the claim is uncertain and speculative and has been previously rejected by numerous tribunals on this ground. In any event, the Claimants have not proven their tax gross up claim, as the Tribunal has decided to treat the various memoranda from tax advisors submitted by the Claimants as party submissions rather than evidence.1082\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 426; Quantum Counter-Memorial, Section 8.\n\nPO12 R-PHB2, para. 426(d), discussing the Tribunal's letter to the Parties dated 6 December 2017.\n\n**3. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n859.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Parties' submissions on the tax gross-up claim, including the tax law memoranda (Exhs. C-702 to C-704) which, in accordance with its letter of 6 December 2017, it had decided to treat as party submissions on law.\n\n860.\n\nAs an initial matter, it disagrees with the Respondent that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the tax gross-up claim pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, which carves out taxation matters. In the Tribunal's view, Article 21 is concerned with whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction over a dispute where the impugned measures are taxation measures. By contrast, as a tax gross-up claim on amounts awarded concerns the computation of damages, it is unrelated to the nature of the measures complained of.\n\n861.\n\nWhile it thus has jurisdiction over the Claimants' tax gross up claim, the Tribunal does not regard it as well-founded. In line with other arbitral tribunals which have dismissed similar claims, the Tribunal is of the view that such tax gross up would be speculative and uncertain.1083 So for instance, the speculative nature of the claim was stressed in *Servier v. Poland,*\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has considered the possible tax ramifications of this Award, it can find no reason to speculate on the appropriateness, one way or another, of any proposed \"gross-up\" to take into account potential tax liability, whether in Poland or in France. The ultimate tax treatment of an award representing the \"real value\" of an investment must be addressed by the fiscal authorities in the investor's home jurisdiction as well as the host state.1084\n\nSee, e.g., *Venezuela Holdings et al v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award, 9 October 2014, paras. 386-388, **Exh. CL-188** (\"this claim is speculative and uncertain\"); *Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe v. Venezuela*, Decision on Liability and the Principles of Quantum, 30 December 2016, paras. 904-905, **Exh. RL-199** (\"such request is speculative and unfounded; the Tribunal therefore sees no basis for ordering an indemnification against foreign taxation liabilities as requested by Claimant. Consequently, Claimant's claim that Respondent be ordered to indemnify Claimant in respect of any double taxation liabilities that would arise in France or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for Venezuela's adverse measures is denied\").\n\n*Les Laboratoires Servier, S.A.S., Biofarma, S.A.S. and Arts et Techniques du Progres S.A.S. v. Republic of Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), PCA Case No. 2010-12, 14 February 2012, para. 666, **Exh. RL-211**.\n\n862.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds confirmation in its conclusion that such a tax gross-up would be speculative in the Claimants' enumeration at para. 205 of the PO12 C-PHB2 of the \"potential options pursuant to which the Tribunal may address the tax gross-up claim\" (quoted *supra* at para. 857). It notes that at least two of them are subject to a possible determination by the competent tax authorities.1085 This, in the Tribunal's view, corroborates the uncertainty that surrounds the Claimants' tax gross-up claim.\n\nSee PO12 C-PHB2, para. 205 (b) (\"order for the full amount of the tax gross-up to be placed into an escrow account, pending a final determination from the appropriate tax authority, following which the relevant amount would be paid over and any remaining funds returned to Spain\", emphasis added) and (c) (\"order that Spain hold the Claimants harmless from any amount of tax due, in which case no funds would pass until the tax authorities reach a decision\", emphasis added).\n\n863.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal is unconvinced that a tax gross-up would meet the requirement of causation of the loss. As held by the tribunal in *Rusoro v. Venezuela,* \"[a]ny tax liability arising under [the home State's] tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other than the [respondent State]), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from [the respondent's] breach of the Treaty and does not engage [the respondent's] liability\".1086\n\n*Rusoro Mining Limited v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, para. 854, **Exh. RL-194**.\n\n864.\n\nFinally, in the Tribunal's view, it is significant that no investment treaty tribunal, including ICSID tribunals who have found Spain liable in respect of the measures at issue here (see, e.g., *Eiser,*1087*Masdar,*1088 and *Antin*1089*),* appears to have upheld similar claims.\n\n*Eiser*, para. 456.\n\n*Masdar*, para. 660.\n\n*Antin*, para. 673.\n\n865.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the tax gross-up claim.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n**A. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n866.\n\nThe Claimants request that the costs they have incurred in the liability and quantum phase be borne entirely by the Respondent.1090 The total costs incurred by the Claimants (as on 14 June 2019) is GBP 11,387,747.75.1091\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 1; PO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 1.\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, Schedule 1.\n\n867.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in the event the Tribunal decides in their favor and dismisses the various defenses advanced by Spain, the Claimants should be entitled to recover their entire costs on a full indemnity basis pursuant to the \"loser pays\" principle enshrined in Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.1092 The Claimants submit that an award on costs on this basis is necessary to reinstate them in the position they would have been in but for Spain\u2019s violations of the ECT.\n\nC-Costs Submission, paras. 4-6, 8; PO12 C-Costs Submission, paras. 5-7, 9.\n\n868.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that Spain should bear all costs because Spain has unnecessarily delayed the arbitration and increased the costs of the proceedings by making meritless applications, claims and objections. In particular, Spain aggravated the dispute by introducing the New Measures after the Claimants had filed its original SoC. This necessitated \"a wholesale overhaul of [the] entire claim\", as admitted by Spain, in order to include submissions and evidence on the New Measures, which significantly increased the complexity of the case and by extension, the Claimants\u2019 costs.1093 Moreover, the Claimants contend that Spain has adopted multiple inconsistent positions throughout these proceedings. For example, during the PO12 phase, Spain \"performed a volte face [and] abandoned its previous assertion that [...] the reasonable profitability calculated by Spain at the time the Claimants\u2019 plants were built was based on a marginal plant [...] These inconsistencies unnecessarily increased costs as the Claimants were required to litigate issues that previously had been agreed between the parties\".1094\n\nC-Costs Submission, paras. 10-13.\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 11; *see* also C-Costs Submission, paras. 14-15.\n\n869.\n\nFurther, Spain\u2019s conduct in relation to document production also significantly increased the costs of these proceedings. The Claimants note that although they disclosed over several thousands of documents in this proceeding, Spain raised repeated and baseless complaints against the Claimants\u2019 production, the resolution of which generated multiple rounds of correspondence and even required a telephone hearing, on Spain's insistence. Moreover, even though the Tribunal rejected Spain's complaints, the latter persisted making baseless arguments once again in its PO12 Counter-Memorial. In addition, Spain failed to disclose a single document since PO12. The only documents that Spain \"was forced to disclose after years of misrepresentation and dilatory tactics\" were the *Greentech* Documents. The Claimants submit that Spain was under an obligation to disclose these documents from October 2017, especially after the Claimants had identified the failure to produce these documents and the Tribunal ordered their disclosure on 29 October 2018. Yet, Spain only disclosed the documents on 3 May 2019 after another order from the Tribunal.1095\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, paras. 12-15.\n\n870.\n\nFinally, Spain has repeatedly tried to re-litigate its intra-EU objection, which must have cost consequences.1096\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 16.\n\n871.\n\nThe Claimants further oppose the allegations made by the Respondent in support of its request that the Claimants should bear the entire costs of the proceeding. They also object to certain categories of costs claimed by Spain on the ground that these do not fall within recoverable costs identified in Article 40(2)(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules because they have not been actually \"incurred\", such as (i) EUR 577,460.57 with respect to yet unbilled Econ One fees;1097 and (ii) EUR 325,993.80 of legal fees and EUR 61,189.70 of expert fees that are alleged pending settlement.1098\n\nPO12 C-Reply Costs Submission, paras. 7-9.\n\nC-Reply Costs Submission, paras. 9-10. With regard to these amounts, in its PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 8(a) and (d), the Respondent explained that \"[a] total of EUR 325,993.80 was included in respect of legal fees which had been incurred since the previous invoice but which were not later invoiced to Spain due to contractual budget limitations and therefore this should be removed from the calculations\" and that \"[a] total of EUR 574,181.30 was recorded as having been paid in respect of expert professional fees to Mac Group & Altran and a further EUR 61,189.70 was included in respect of fees which had been incurred but which had not been invoiced to Spain. This should be replaced by the total of EUR 629,161.00 to reflect amounts which were definitively invoiced to Spain by Mac Group & Altran during the Merits phase\".\n\n872.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants request \"that the Tribunal renders an award pursuant to Article 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules: [...] ordering that Spain bear all of the Claimants' costs of the arbitration [...] [and] [...] interest thereon at such reasonable commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, compounded monthly\".1099 The Claimants also request that costs \"be allocated per Claimant group in accordance with [the] percentages\" set out in Section 4.4 of the Claimants' PO12 Costs Submission dated 14 June 2019 \"[s]hould the Tribunal grant the Claimants' request that Spain bear all of the Claimants' costs of the arbitration\".1100\n\nC-Costs Submission, para. 27; PO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 27.\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 26. The Claimants have set out their costs in Schedule 1 of the PO12 C-Cost Submission dated 14 June 2019, setting out the various categories of costs incurred by them since the commencement of the arbitration proceedings, but excluding the costs associated with the Jurisdictional Phase, in Schedule 1 of their PO12 Cost Submission.\n\n**B. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nThe Respondent seeks an award of costs, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the UNICTRAL Rules, on the grounds that the Claimants' claims are without merit and should be dismissed entirely.1101 It claims costs in the amount of EUR 6,075,665.52.1102\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 9-11; PO12 R-Costs Submission, paras. 14-16.\n\nPO12 R-Costs Submission, Annex I.\n\n874.\n\nSpain submits that it introduced regulations in the exercise of its legitimate right to regulate the electricity sector, that these regulations were foreseeable and in conformity with the legal principles of sustainability and reasonable profitability. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Claimants commenced the present arbitration \"on the basis of a completely speculative claim and on unfounded legal grounds\".1103 A concrete example of the Claimants' conduct increasing the costs incurred by Spain is their assertion that Spain breached its obligation to provide full protection and security to their investments. The Claimants have devoted to this claim no more than four paragraphs in the ASoC and five paragraphs in the Reply and did not address it in a substantial way during the Liability Hearing. Nevertheless, Spain had to devote considerable time and resources in defending such an unfounded claim.1104\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 12-14; PO12 R-Costs Submission, paras. 17-19.\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 15.\n\n875.\n\nIn the same vein, the Respondent calls on the Tribunal to consider the conduct of the Parties when allocating costs. It argues that the Claimants' procedural behavior has led to significant delays and costs. For example, the Claimants' misconduct was evident during the document production phase, where the Claimants engaged in a fishing expedition, requesting 79 categories of documents, all of which were largely irrelevant. Moreover, the Claimants \"ambushed the proceedings at the eleventh hour with an unjustified application\" to include numerous new documents into the record. As the Claimants introduced these documents into the record only days prior to the Liability Hearing, the Respondent was not afforded an opportunity to \"thoughtfully consider or analyze such documents or to rebut the documents with evidence\".1105 The Respondent also criticizes the Claimants\u2019 decision to aggregate a large number of claims in the same arbitration. It finds that this concentration led to a significant increase in the costs of the quantum phase, as it was necessary to analyze the loss of each of the 26 Claimants allegedly arising out of the Disputed Measures, which increased the legal fees and expert costs.1106\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 18-20; PO12 R-Costs Submission, paras. 20-21.\n\nPO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 23(iii).\n\n876.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent contends that the Claimants \"unreasonably and unnecessarily, [sought] to repeatedly push for Spain to disclose to them the so-called Greentech Documents\", even though these documents were \"utterly irrelevant to the resolution of this dispute\". The Claimants\u2019 refusal to accept this fact caused many unnecessary procedural steps and added costs which should be paid by the Claimants.1107\n\nPO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 23(iv).\n\n877.\n\nThus, Spain concludes that while it has acted in good faith throughout this arbitration, it continues to be met by ambushes, inappropriate and costly distractions and a litany of procedural abuses by the Claimants. Spain also oppose the arguments in support of the Claimants\u2019 request that Spain should bear the entire costs of the proceeding.\n\n878.\n\nSpain further objects to the amount of costs sought by the Claimants as being unreasonable, and in some cases insufficiently described. For example, the legal fees claimed by the Claimants are twice as high as the Respondent\u2019s,1108 when counsel on both sides worked in much the same way.1109 Similarly, the Respondent objects to the expert fees charged by the Brattle Group in the quantum phase as being unreasonable and double the expert fees and costs claimed by Spain for the same period.\n\nPO12 R-Reply Costs Submission, paras. 21 *et seq.*\n\nR-Reply Costs Submission, paras. 19-30; PO12 R-Reply Costs Submission, paras. 21 *et seq.*\n\n879.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimants to bear the costs of all phases of the arbitration which remain subject to the Tribunal\u2019s determination along with interest thereon at such reasonable commercial rate as the Tribunal deems appropriate, compounded monthly.1110\n\nPO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 25 and Annex I; PO12 R-Reply Costs Submission, para. 36; R-Costs Submission, para. 24 and Annex I.\n\n**C. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n**1. The costs of the arbitration pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n880.\n\nArticle 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n881.\n\nArticle 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies the categories of expenses that qualify as \"costs of arbitration\" in the following terms:\n\nThe term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n882.\n\nThus, Article 40(2) recognizes broadly three categories of costs and expenses: (i) \"Tribunal Costs\" comprising of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and Secretary; (ii) \"Party Costs\" comprising of the legal and witness related costs incurred by the Parties; and (iii) \"Administrative Costs\" comprising here of the fees and expenses of the PCA, including with regard to hearing and other expenses.\n\n**2. Cost advances**\n--------------------\n\n883.\n\nOn the date of issuance of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, out of the total advances deposited by the Parties, a sum of EUR 74.42 remained in the deposit after deducting the amounts incurred towards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretary and the PCA. This amount was credited to the subsequent phase of the arbitration.1111\n\nPreliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 373.\n\n884.\n\nThereafter, the Parties advanced the following additional sums with the PCA:\n\na. On 14 November 2014, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 200,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;\n\nb. On 18 and 31 December 2015, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 250,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;\n\nc. On 15 December 2016, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 200,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;\n\nd. On 15 and 21 December 2017, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 205,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost;\n\ne. On 1 and 13 December 2018, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 150,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the advance on cost; and\n\nf. On 13 December 2019 and 13 January 2020, the PCA acknowledged receipt of EUR 150,000 from each Party towards their respective shares of the final advances on cost.\n\n885.\n\nAccordingly, the total advance paid by the Parties, following the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, amounts to EUR 1,155,000 each (EUR 2,310,000 in total).\n\n**3. Tribunal and administrative costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nIn the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal determined the total costs of the proceeding and the allocation of such costs for the Jurisdictional Phase (i.e., from 11 January 2013 until the completion of the jurisdictional phase).1112 However, the Tribunal reserved its determination on the allocation of costs incurred in the \"Pre-Jurisdictional Phase\" (i.e. from the commencement of the arbitration until the date of Spain\u2019s jurisdictional objection of 11 January 2013) for subsequent decision.1113\n\nPreliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 370.\n\nPreliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 372.\n\n887.\n\nTherefore, the present decision concerns the costs incurred by the Parties for:\n\na. The Pre-Jurisdictional Phase (from the commencement of the arbitration until 11 January 2013);\n\nb. The liability and quantum phase (from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction until this Final Award).\n\n**a.** ***For the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n888.\n\nAs set out in paras. 350-355 of the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, the costs incurred towards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Secretary, and the PCA in the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase are EUR 157,773.36, detailed as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tribunal and Secretary fees | EUR | 142,606.00 |\n| Tribunal and Secretary expenses | EUR | 7,706.17 |\n| Administrative Costs | EUR | 7,461.19 |\n| Total Costs up to 11 January 2013 | EUR | 157,773.36 |\n\n**b.** ***For the liability and quantum phase***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n889.\n\nIn the liability and quantum phase, the members of the Tribunal collectively spent a total of 2,548.6 hours as follows: The Hon. Charles N. Brower, 853.6 hours; Judge Bernardo Sepulveda-Amor, 569 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 1,126 hours. In the Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the Tribunal\u2019s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 500 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n890.\n\nIn the same period of time, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 966.1 hours. In the Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the Secretary would be compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 280 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.\n\n891.\n\nTherefore, while the total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT) would amount to EUR 1,544,808, in order to avoid requesting additional funds, the Tribunal decided to reduce its fees to EUR 1,473,150.8 for this phase of the arbitration.\n\n892.\n\nThe Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 74,729.\n\n893.\n\nWhile the PCA fees for this phase of the arbitration would have amounted to EUR 86,845, in line with the Tribunal's decision to reduce its fees as explained *supra,* the PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 83,149.93 for the administration of the case and its registry services.\n\n894.\n\nOther costs, relating in particular to the hearings expenses, the IT costs (including the Opus 2 services), catering, court reporting services, interpretation, as well as the translation of the Award, amount to EUR 679,044.69.\n\n895.\n\nThus, the total costs of the proceedings relating to the liability and quantum phase amount to EUR 2,310,074.42, detailed as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tribunal and Secretary fees | EUR | 1,473,150.8 |\n| Tribunal and Secretary expenses | EUR | 74,729 |\n| Administrative Costs | EUR | 762,194.62 |\n| Total Costs | EUR | 2,310,074.42 |\n\n**c.** ***Total Tribunal and administrative costs***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n896.\n\nHence, the total costs of the proceedings for both the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase and the liability and quantum phase amount to EUR 2,467,847.78. Considering that it was necessary for the Tribunal to reduce its fees, there is no unexpended balance to be returned to the Parties in accordance with Art. 43(5) UNCITRAL Rules. The PCA will provide the Parties with the case's statement of account once the 30-day time period under Arts. 37 to 39 has elapsed.\n\n**4. Allocation of the costs of the arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n897.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out the standard on the basis of which the Tribunal must determine the allocation of the above categories of costs:\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n898.\n\nThus, the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\"1114 bear all of the costs of the arbitration. Both Parties accept such \"loser pays\" principle and have argued their cost requests accordingly.1115 The second sentence of Article 42(1) grants the Tribunal the authority to apportion costs among the Parties if, in light of the \"circumstances of the case\", it decides that such apportionment is \"reasonable\".\n\nSee the English version of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides: \"[t]he costs of the arbitration shall *in principle* be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties\" (emphasis added), while the Spanish version reads: \"[l]as costas del arbitraje ser\u00e1n a cargo de la parte vencida o las partes vencidas\", without including the equivalent of the words \"in principle\".\n\nSee C-Costs Submission, para. 5; PO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 6; PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 16; R-Costs Submission, para. 11.\n\n899.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the outcome of the arbitration and notes that the outcome of the liability and quantum phase is not clear-cut. The Claimants brought two claims, the Primary and the Alternative Claims. The Tribunal found that the Primary Claim was not well-founded, which entails that Spain is the prevailing Party on such claim.\n\n900.\n\nWith regard to the Alternative Claim, approximately half of the Claimant entities within the list agreed between the experts was able to prove that the IRR with the Disputed Measures in place was below 7% and was thus considered entitled to compensation. This part of the Claimants has thus prevailed on the Alternative Claim, although it was awarded less than what it claimed. In assessing the outcome, it bears noting that these Claimants would not be made whole had they not resorted to arbitration, which could not be done without incurring costs whatever the amounts claimed and awarded.\n\n901.\n\nFinally, the remaining Claimants succeeded neither on the Primary nor on the Alternative Claim. This being so, however, the Tribunal does not accept Spain's contention that the Claimants initiated a \"groundless arbitration\", based on \"a completely speculative claim and on unfounded legal grounds\".1116 As mentioned above, the Alternative Claim did in part succeed. As to the Primary Claim, while the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that it was not well-founded, it was certainly not frivolous.\n\nR-Costs Submission, paras. 12-13; PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 17.\n\n902.\n\nThus, pondering the relative weight of the outcome on the claims and the various considerations made above, the Tribunal considers that the cost allocation that most appropriately reflects the outcome of the proceedings is for the Claimants, on the one hand, and the Respondent, on the other, to bear the costs of the proceedings in equal shares and for each side to bear the legal fees and other expenses which it incurred.\n\n903.\n\nIn line with Article 42(1) second sentence, the Tribunal has further reviewed the other circumstances which according to the Parties have aggravated their cost burden and is of the view that none of those circumstances changes the allocation just set out. In particular, with respect of document production, it does not consider that the Claimants made excessive document production requests. As far as the Respondent is concerned, it is true that the latter was not forthcoming in the production of the *Greentech* Documents. However, this incident is not material enough to make a sensible difference in the overall cost allocation. Similarly, on the intra-EU objection, while the Tribunal has denied Spain\u2019s request to re-open jurisdiction, such request was not frivolous, keeping in mind developments such as *Achmea* and the Member States Declarations. Finally, the Tribunal finds no fault in the Claimants\u2019 decision to bring the claims in an aggregate form. It is true that conducting one arbitration on behalf of 14 groups of investors inevitably increases costs compared to proceedings involving only one claimant. By contrast, it is not true that conducting one arbitration with 14 groups of claimants is more expensive than the total costs of 14 arbitrations with one claimant (or claimant group).\n\n904.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal has reviewed the amounts of the costs claimed by each Party. Both sides have incurred costs which are certainly considerable. However, as both accept, these proceedings were highly complex.1117 Seen in light of such complexity and the high stakes involved, the costs incurred by the Parties are not unreasonable. It is true that the Claimants\u2019 legal costs are considerably higher than those of the Respondent. The disparity may be due to a number of factors. First, as explained by the Respondent, \"the fees paid to Herbert Smith Freehills were established pursuant to a public tender dated 14 September 2011 and are considerably below what is considered to be market value\".1118 Furthermore, the Claimants produced seventeen fact witnesses and Spain only two. Thus, the difference between the legal fees incurred by the Parties is not unjustifiably disproportionate.\n\nPO12 C-Costs Submission, para. 19 (\"this is a complex ECT arbitration in which there was substantial briefing by both parties and voluminous amounts of fact and expert evidence. Moreover, unlike most investment treaty arbitrations, this case involves 14 separate and independent Claimant groups, each with a separate documentary record and separate fact witnesses\"); PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 12 (\"The costs claimed properly reflect the nature of the dispute and the positions that Spain necessarily had to adopt given Claimants' amended pleadings and the extent of evidence. In particular, the Tribunal will recall that Spain had to answer a case brought initially by 88 Claimants and after the Jurisdiction Phase by 26 Claimants, which required the individual review of documentation provided by each Claimant\").\n\nR-Costs Submission, para. 8; PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 5.\n\n905.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal has reviewed the Claimants\u2019 objections against specific cost items presented by Spain. The Tribunal could dispense with ruling on these objections, in light of its decision that each Party bear the costs related to its own representation. However, for the sake of completeness, it briefly addresses the main objections raised by the Claimants to the following cost items.\n\n906.\n\nFirst, in respect of the costs claimed by Spain for the *Abogac\u00eda del Estado,* the Tribunal is satisfied by Spain\u2019s explanation that \"[s]ince the Abogac\u00eda del Estado does not have a system based on hourly rates, its legal fees have been calculated considering one third of the legal fees of Herbert Smith Freehills, which is proportional to the amount of resources and time expended by the Abogac\u00eda del Estado in these proceedings\".1119 Second, the Tribunal has taken note of the Claimants\u2019 objection that certain costs claimed for the Econ One services have not been \"incurred\" by Spain, because they have not yet been invoiced and \"no undertaking has been provided confirming that Spain will incur these costs\".1120 At the same time, it has also noted the Respondent\u2019s representation that these amounts are \"owed under the contract between Spain and Econ One but ha[ve] not yet been invoiced by Econ One\".1121 The Tribunal has no reason to doubt this representation and considers that the statement that this amount \"is owed\" is substantively equivalent to a representation that \"it will be incurred\".1122\n\nR-Costs Submission, para.6(iii).\n\nPO12 C-Reply Costs Submission, para. 8.\n\nPO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 11.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied of Spain's explanations in respect of certain figures that had been included in its previously submitted cost submissions and have been corrected in its later submissions. See PO12 R-Costs Submission, para. 8.\n\n907.\n\nFinally, with respect to the allocation of the Claimants\u2019 costs *among themselves,* the Tribunal understands from the table set out in Section 4.4 of the Claimants\u2019 PO 12 Costs Submission dated 14 June 2019 that the Claimants may have internal arrangements in place as to how the arbitrations costs are divided. Accordingly, the Claimants have requested that \"[s]hould the Tribunal grant the Claimants' request that Spain bear all of the Claimants' costs of the arbitration, the Claimants request that these costs be allocated per Claimant group in accordance with these percentages\" (emphasis added). In light of the Tribunal's decision (which is *not* that \"Spain bear all of the Claimants' costs of the arbitration\"), the Tribunal need not address the Claimants' request that costs be allocated in accordance with the percentages set out in the table. Furthermore, the Tribunal is not privy to the Claimants' internal arrangements for the scenario that *only some* of them would succeed on (part of) the claims. This being so, as the Claimants have brought their claims in an aggregate form and in light of the determination that each side must bear its own costs, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to leave it to the Claimants to make any relevant determination on the apportionment of costs among themselves in accordance with their internal arrangements or otherwise.\n\n**IX. LANGUAGE OF THE AWARD**\n-----------------------------\n\n908.\n\nLike the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, this Award is made in both English and Spanish. There is no agreement between the Parties as to which of the two language versions should prevail. In accordance with PO2, the Tribunal decides that the English version of this Award shall prevail.1123\n\n*See* also Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction, para. 374.\n\n**X. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n909.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:\n\na. The Kingdom of Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT to the extent held in the body of the Award;\n\nb. The Kingdom of Spain shall pay the following amounts to the following Claimant entities:\n\ni. AES Solar Energy Cooperatief U.A: **EUR 15.4 million** ;\n\nii. Ceconat Energy GmbH: **EUR 5.4 million** ;\n\niii. Ampere Equity Fund B.V.: **EUR 11.1 million** ;\n\niv. Element Power Holdings B.V.: **EUR 2.2 million** ;\n\nv.

The Kingdom of Spain shall make the payments ordered in the preceding paragraph together with interest at the Spanish 10-year bond rate, compounded semi-annually, from 30 June 2014 until payment in full;\n\nd. The costs of the arbitration relating to the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase (from the commencement of the arbitration until 11 January 2013) and the liability and quantum phase (from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction until this Final Award), in a total amount of EUR 2,467,847.78, shall be borne in equal shares by the Claimants, on the one hand, and by the Kingdom of Spain, on the other;\n\ne. Each Party shall bear the legal fees and other expenses which it incurred in connection with the Pre-Jurisdictional Phase (from the commencement of the arbitration until 11 January 2013) and the liability and quantum phase (from the Preliminary Award on Jurisdiction until this Final Award) of this arbitration;\n\nf. All other claims and requests are dismissed."}]}
