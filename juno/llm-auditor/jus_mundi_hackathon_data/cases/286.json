Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the Tribunal issued its Partial Award, in which it decided as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent breached the Energy Charter Treaty by repealing the Income Tax Holiday and by modifying the Original Depreciation Provisions of the Act on Income Tax (Act No. 586/1992) is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(b) GIHG's claim that the Respondent has breached the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty\u00a0is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(c) Radiance Energy Holding's claim that the Respondent has breached the Luxembourg-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(d) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is granted;\n\n(e) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty\u00a0is granted;\n\n(f) Natland Investment's claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is granted;\n\n(g) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(h) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security standard in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(i) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the non-impairment standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(j) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the most-favored- nation clause in Article 3 of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed; and\n\n(k) All other claims, defenses and requests for relief, including claims for compensation and costs, are deferred to a subsequent phase of the arbitration.1\n\nPartial Award, para. 508. The correction of the Partial Award on 20 February 2018 in accordance with Article 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules did not affect the Tribunal's decision.\n\n2.\n\nBy correspondence dated 9 February 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Respondent had submitted a set-aside application against the Partial Award in Switzerland and that they had agreed to stay the arbitration until the Swiss Federal Tribunal had decided on the set-aside application. On the same date, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreement to stay the arbitration.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter dated 23 October 2020, the Claimants, on behalf of both Parties, informed the co-arbitrators and the PCA that the Swiss Federal Tribunal had rejected the Respondent's request to set aside the Tribunal's Partial Award and that the suspension agreed by the Parties in this arbitration was therefore lifted.\n\n4.\n\nIn order to recompose the Tribunal after the presiding arbitrator's vacancy on August 2018, the Parties submitted an agreed protocol for the appointment of a replacement presiding arbitrator and requested that the co-arbitrators and the PCA confirm whether they would agree to the proposed procedure. On 27 October 2020, the co-arbitrators and the PCA confirmed that they would adopt the Parties' agreed protocol set forth in the Claimants' letter of 23 October 2020.\n\n5.\n\nOn 26 January 2021, in accordance with the agreed protocol, Professor Alfredo Bullard was appointed as the presiding arbitrator in this matter.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 4 February 2021, the Tribunal directed the Parties to coordinate and seek agreement on the procedural calendar for the next phase of the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nBy correspondence dated 4 March 2021, the Parties, noting the Respondent's intention to raise a jurisdictional objection based on the CJEU's Judgment in the *Achmea* case (\"the ***Achmea*** **Judgment**\") (the \"***Achmea*** **Objection**\"), advised the Tribunal that they had agreed on the timetable and format for submissions on the admissibility of the Respondent's *Achmea* Objection.\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 March 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, whereby it accepted the Parties' agreement on the timetable and the format for submissions on the admissibility of the *Achmea* Objection and limiting the submissions to 15 pages each. The Tribunal also agreed to a procedural session by videoconference following the completion of the Parties' aforementioned written submissions.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 March 2021, the Respondent filed its Submission on Admissibility of *Achmea* Objection (the \"**Respondent's First Submission**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 8 April 2021, the Claimants filed their First Submission on Inadmissibility of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection (the \"**Claimants' First Submission**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 April 2021, the Respondent submitted its Second Submission on Admissibility of *Achmea* Objection (the \"**Respondent's Second Submission**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 May 2021, the Claimants submitted their Second Submission on Inadmissibility of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection (the \"**Claimants' Second Submission**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 25 May 2021, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by videoconference.

In addition, the Tribunal put questions to the Parties.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 June 2021, after having carefully considered the arguments put forth by both Parties, the Tribunal informed them of its decision to declare the Respondent's *Achmea* Objection inadmissible. Through the present Decision, the Tribunal provides its reasoning on the matter to the Parties.\n\n**II. The Parties' legal positions**\n------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *Achmea* Objection is admissible notwithstanding the advanced stage of the proceedings, because the *Achmea* Judgment qualifies as a new circumstance that permits the raising of a new jurisdictional objection.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent is prohibited from raising the belated *Achmea* Objection by operation of the doctrines of preclusion, waiver, estoppel, and *res judicata*.\n\n**(a) The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *Achmea* Objection is admissible, despite the advanced stage of the proceedings, because (i) the *Achmea* Judgment is a new circumstance that constitutes \"good cause\" for the Respondent to raise a corresponding jurisdictional objection; (ii) the *Achmea* Objection was timely raised; and (iii) it is not precluded by waiver, estoppel or the doctrine of *res judicata*.2\n\nRespondent's First Submission, para. 16; Respondent's Second Submission, para. 5.\n\n20.\n\n*First*, with reference to *Frontier v. Czech Republic*, the Respondent argues that, under Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has the authority to admit jurisdictional objections even after the filing of the Statement of Defense, if the Tribunal considers it to be \"appropriate,\" and if the Parties' due process rights are respected.3 The Respondent submits that the *Achmea* Judgment is \"an important 'new development' that gave rise to a 'new situation,'\" given that it \"preclude[ed]\" the Respondent's consent to investor-State arbitration clause in any intra-EU investment treaties, including the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT at issue.4 This development, the Respondent continues, goes to \"the very root of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal,\"5 and therefore entitles the Respondent to raise the *Achmea* Objection even at a late stage of the proceedings, as confirmed by commentators and case law.6\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 14, referring to Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 12 November 2010, para. 205 (**Ex.

RLA-302**); Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 11:18 \u2013 12:8.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal has the \"duty, right and competence to satisfy itself that all jurisdictional requirements are fulfilled, regardless of the particular stage of the arbitration,\" especially when it is faced with an issue that goes directly to the validity and enforceability of the international treaties on which the Tribunal's jurisdiction is said to rest.7\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 17, *citing* *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Award, 14 October 2016, para. 5.34 (**Ex. RLA-317**).\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' criticism regarding its reliance on awards rendered under the ICSID Convention because, in the Respondent's view, both the ICSID Rules and the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules permit a tribunal to admit a late jurisdictional objection, provided that the delay is justified, *i.e.*, is attributable to circumstances and facts that arose only after the statement of defense was filed.8\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 15.\n\n23.\n\nFor the Respondent, contrary to the Claimants' submission, Article 186(2) of the Swiss Private International Law Act (\"**PILA**\") does not affect the Tribunal's power to admit the *Achmea* Objection under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, because it is not a mandatory provision.9 Further, the Respondent asserts that a jurisdictional objection based on a fact that did not exist at the time of the merits defense, raised as soon as practically possible after that fact became known and in a manner that does not prejudice the Claimants' procedural rights, does not implicate the \"proper and fair conduct of the arbitral proceedings\" addressed in Article 186(2) of the PILA.10\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 16; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 9:4-6.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 16.\n\n24.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent notes that it indicated its intention to pursue the *Achmea* Objection to the Claimants as soon as the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceedings resumed after the agreed suspension of proceedings was lifted.11 Accordingly, the Respondent argues that it raised the *Achmea* Objection as soon as practically possible after the *Achmea* Judgment was rendered and that the timing of its objection entails no prejudice to the Claimants.12\n\nRespondent's First submission, paras. 27, 29.\n\nRespondent's First Submission, paras. 29-30; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 13:14-22.\n\n25.\n\n*Third*, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that the *Achmea* Objection is precluded by waiver or estoppel.13 The Respondent notes that it is an EU Member State and, as such, it is \"preclud[ed]\" as a matter of prevailing EU law from consenting to intra-EU investor-State arbitration.14 With reference to *Urbaser v. Argentina*, the Respondent further explains that such consent cannot be created by waiver or estoppel, because \"[j]urisdiction is fixed by [a] treaty\" between one or more States.15\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 19; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 10:10- 12.\n\nRespondent's First Submission, paras. 34-35, *citing* Case C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV* ECLI:EU:C:2018:158, Judgment, 6 March 2018, *dispositif* (**Ex. RLA-293**); Respondent's Second Submission, para. 21; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 5:18-21, 10:12-23.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 20, *citing* *Urbaser S.A. and others v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 December 2012, para. 112 (**Ex. RLA-318**). *See also* Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 10:24 \u2013 11:16.\n\n26.\n\nEven if the Respondent could waive, or be estopped from raising, the *Achmea* Objection, the Respondent posits that its statements in the course of the proceedings that it would not pursue an intra-EU jurisdictional objection cannot be construed as a waiver of the *Achmea* Objection.16 For a waiver to be effective, it must be unambiguous, and the Respondent argues that an unambiguous waiver would not have been possible prior to the issuance of the *Achmea* Judgment.17\n\nRespondent's First Submission, para. 31, *referring to* Respondent's Statement of Defense, paras. 433-441.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, paras. 22, 24-25. *See also* Respondent's First Submission, paras. 32-33.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that the *Achmea* Objection is still \"a live issue\" is evident from the resignation of the former presiding arbitrator, Dr Heiskanen, on the basis of a potential issue conflict, as the resignation would not have been necessary had there been a clear and binding advance waiver of the *Achmea* Objection.18\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 23.\n\n28.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent's statements had amounted to a waiver, the Respondent argues that such waiver would have been ineffective, because it had an international obligation to object to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 4(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\").19\n\nRespondent's First Submission, paras. 35-36; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 5:3- 13.\n\n29.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' reliance on the tribunals' findings in the parallel *Antaris* and *WAIEN et al.* arbitrations that the Czech Republic had waived the *Achmea* Objection, the Respondent considers those findings unavailing, because the decision to accept jurisdiction despite the *Achmea* Judgment did not affect the outcome of those arbitrations, since all claims on the merits were rejected.20\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 26, *referring to* *WA Investments-Europa Nova Limited v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-19, Award, 15 May 2019, paras. 444, 730 (**Ex. CLA-172**); *Voltaic Network GmbH v.

CLA\u2010176**). *See also* Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 8:10-14, 9:7-11.\n\n30.\n\nAs regards the issue of estoppel, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not demonstrated that they changed their position for the worse in reliance on the Respondent's statement.21 In addition, raising the *Achmea* Objection at this stage, in the Respondent's view, does not entail further delay to the proceedings or benefit the Respondent procedurally.22\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's First Submission, para. 38; Respondent's Second Submission, para. 28; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 13:22 \u2013 14:9.\n\n31.\n\nLastly, the Respondent, relying on *GPF v. Poland*, denies that the *Achmea* Objection is precluded by the international law doctrine of *res judicata*, given that it was not \"debated or decided\" in the Partial Award.23 The Respondent further disputes that a mere mention in a footnote of the Partial Award that the Respondent was not raising an intra-EU jurisdiction could suffice to dispose in advance of the complex issues raised by the *Achmea* Judgment.24\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 29, *citing* GPF GP S\u00e0rl v. The Republic of Poland, SCC Case No. V 2014/168, Final Award, 29 April 2020, para. 291 (**Ex. CLA-199**); Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, pp. 9:23 \u2013 10:8.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 30.\n\n32.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent argues that *Achmea* issues that were not debated and decided in the Partial Award or in the Swiss Federal Tribunal's set-aside judgment do not give rise to an application of the *res judicata* doctrine under Swiss law.25 In any event, the Respondent emphasizes that the *Achmea* Judgment constitutes a material and relevant change in circumstances that occurred after the decision on a particular issue was made. That is a situation, which under Swiss law, allows the Tribunal to re-examine its decision until it disposes of all requests for relief in relation to that issue.26\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's Second Submission, para. 31.\n\n**(b) The Claimants' position**\n-------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the *Achmea* Objection should not be admitted, because (i) it is precluded by waiver or estoppel under the applicable rules and (ii) the Partial Award already determined with *res judicata* effect the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the Respondent's liability in this arbitration.27\n\nClaimants' First submission, paras. 8-9, 11; Claimants' Second Submission, para. 3; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021 p. 16:17-23.\n\n34.\n\n*First*, pursuant to Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is barred from raising an intra-EU objection at this stage when it not only failed to raise the objection in its Statement of Defense, but also explicitly and repeatedly waived it throughout the proceedings.28 In support of their contention, the Claimants highlight the fact that investment tribunals faced with \"circumstances essentially identical\" to the present case dismissed belated applications on the part of the respondent to raise the *Achmea* Objection on the basis that the respondent waived its right to raise the intra-EU jurisdictional objection.29\n\nClaimants' First Submission, paras. 9, 12-13; Claimants' Second Submission, paras. 34; Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 23:10-16.\n\nClaimants' First Submission, paras. 14-15, *referring to* *WA Investmen \u2010ts Europa Nova Limited v.

CLA\u2010176**); Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 17:7-14.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the deliberate use of the words \"shall\" and \"not later than\" in Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, without containing any caveat, demonstrate that the provision is to be construed narrowly, such that \"untimely jurisdictional objections [are] admitted only in very rare circumstances.\"30\n\nClaimants' Second Submission, paras. 6-7, *citing* J. Paulsson and G. Petrochilos, \"UNCITRAL Arbitration\", in Kluwer Law International, 2017, para. 29 (**Ex. CLA-171**) (emphasis added by the Claimants); Procedural Meeting Transcript, 25 May 2021, p. 23:20-24.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the *Achmea* Judgment constitutes a new and exceptional circumstance, in particular a new \"fact,\" that justifies the consideration of a new jurisdictional objection.31 In the Claimants' view, \"labelling the intra-EU objection '*Achmea* objection' does not make it something new\" since \"the \"intra-EU issue [is] the same issue that has ... been decided in *Achmea*.\"32 Specifically, the Claimants rely on *Gavrilovi\u0107 v. Croatia* to argue that while the *Achmea* Judgment clarified the law, an objection based thereon could have been raised before or the right to do so could have been reserved.33\n\nClaimants' First Submission, para. 28; Claimants' Second submission, paras. 14, 19.\n\nClaimants' Second Submission, paras. 4, 33, *citing* *WA Investmen \u2010ts Europa Nova Limited v.

The Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The law applicable to the admissibility of the objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nOn 14 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, whereby it decided the place of the arbitration to be Geneva.72 Consequently, the law applicable to determine the admissibility of Respondent's objection is Swiss law.73\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, para. 1.10.\n\nSwiss Private International Law Act, Art. 176(1) (\"The provisions of this chapter shall apply to arbitrations if the seat of the arbitral tribunal is in Switzerland and if at least one of the parties at the time the arbitration agreement was concluded was neither domiciled nor habitually resident in Switzerland\").\n\n55.\n\nThe arbitration, and the question of the admissibility of a belated jurisdictional objection, is also governed by the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, as agreed upon by the Respondent on 9 July 2013 and by the Claimants on 22 July 2013.74\n\nPartial Award, para. 15.\n\n**(b) Timeliness and preclusion**\n---------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nUnder Swiss law, objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction are regulated by Article 186(2) of the PILA, which establishes that: \"*A plea of lack of jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense on the merits*.\" It is accepted that, pursuant to such rule the admissibility of an untimely jurisdictional objection should be considered foreclosed or precluded.75\n\nGirsberger, N. Voser, *International arbitration, Comparative and Swiss Perspectives*, Schulthess, 2016, para. 564 (\"A plea of lack of jurisdiction may no longer be raised after the objecting party has submitted pleadings on the merits. Art. 186(2) SPILA is viewed as a mandatory provision from which parties cannot deviate contractually\") (**Ex. CLA-212**). *See also* G. Kaufmann-Kohler and A. Rigozzi, *International Arbitration, Law and Practice in Switzerland* (Oxford University Press, 2015), para. 5.12 (referring to the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules) (**Ex. CLA-213**).\n\n57.\n\nSwiss jurisprudence has applied the rule of preclusion under Article 186(2) PILA even for issues of objective arbitrability.76 Therefore, the Tribunal considers that under Swiss law, it is irrelevant at this stage to determine if the *Achmea* objection gives rise to a matter of objective arbitrability or of public policy. The Tribunal must determine only whether the prerequisites for preclusion are satisfied or not.\n\nG. Kaufmann-Kohler and A. Rigozzi, *International Arbitration, Law and Practice in Switzerland* (Oxford University Press, 2015), para. 3.39 (**Ex. CLA-213**).\n\n58.\n\nNotwithstanding that certain doctrine cited in the written submissions holds such rule to be mandatory,77 the Claimants concede that under Swiss law the Parties may agree to a more specific rule on how the defense should be submitted, for instance, by reference to the rules of arbitration.78 This, however, does not prejudice the preclusion effect if the defense is untimely.\n\n*Id*.\n\nClaimant's Second Submission, para. 21; B. Berger*, Commentary on Chapter 12 PILS, Article 186 [Jurisdiction]*, in M. Arroyo (Ed.), *Arbitration in Switzerland: The Practitioner's Guide*, Kluwer Law International (2018), para. 40 (\"Art. 186(2) PILS is a rule of procedure. Therefore, the arbitral tribunal shall have due regard to any more specific procedural rules determined by the parties, whether directly or by reference to rules of arbitration or a procedural law of their choice.\") (**Ex. CLA-214**).\n\n59.\n\nIn this case, it is Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules which states that any \"*plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised not later than in the Statement of Defense*.\" Without prejudice to such provision, it is accepted that \"*the drafting history of the 1976 Rules shows that untimely jurisdictional objections could be admitted only in very rare circumstances, under the general powers granted to arbitrators to conduct the arbitration by article 15(1) (now article 17(1))*\".79\n\nJ.

CLA-174**).\n\n60.\n\nArticle 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that \"*[s]ubject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given a full opportunity of presenting his case*.\"80 This provision sets out the Tribunal's general powers to conduct the proceedings, under which a late jurisdictional objection may be reasonably admitted under exceptional circumstances (good cause), *e.g.*, material new facts. *Contrario sensu,* if such condition is not satisfied, foreclosure should operate. The Tribunal is called upon to find a balance between ensuring the Parties' right to present their case, without affecting the efficiency of the proceedings and the procedural stages set.\n\nUNCITRAL Rules. Article 15(1).\n\n61.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the Respondent requests leave to submit a jurisdictional objection long after submitting its Statement of Defense, and even after the rendering of an award on jurisdiction and liability. The Tribunal must thus assess whether there exists a \"good cause\" to allow an exception to the usual rule.\n\n62.\n\nAfter thoroughly considering the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal finds that there is no such good cause in the present case. In reaching its conclusion, as explained below, the Tribunal has taken into account the Parties' conduct and the current stage of the proceedings. Neither admits of the conclusion that there are new circumstances that in the present case would justify a belated objection.\n\n63.\n\n*First,* if the defendant had the possibility to raise the objection timeously, and it did not, the Tribunal should not then admit it. The Tribunal finds that in this case, Respondent could have either raised the intra-EU objection earlier or reserved its right to do so once the *Achmea* Judgment was rendered. However, it let pass the procedural stage established under the rules.\n\n64.\n\nThis situation is similar to that which arose in the *WAIEN et al*. cases, where the *Achmea* Objection was also raised belatedly and therefore not admitted. The awards states as follows:\n\n\"In this case, there is nothing to which the Respondent can point to satisfy the requirement in both Article 186(2) of the PILA and Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules that the jurisdictional objection in question was raised no later than the statement of defense, or any defense on the merits. Rather, as detailed below, the Respondent specifically and repeatedly stated throughout these proceedings that it would not object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of the intra-EU nature of the dispute.\"81\n\n*WA InvestmentsEuropa Nova Limited v.

The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014\u2010*21, Award,* 15 May 2019, para. 343 (**Ex. CLA\u2010*****174***) (emphasis added in original).\n\n65.\n\nIn this case, as in *WAIEN et. al.*, the Respondent not only failed to raise an objection concerning the intra-EU nature of the dispute, but it repeatedly stated that it would not do so.\n\n66.\n\nBy the time it filed its Statement of Defense, on 30 October 2015, the Respondent was aware of the debate over whether an EU member state could validly offer to arbitrate controversies under a BIT with investors from another EU member state. Specifically, Respondent was aware of the position expressed by the European Commission in the *amicus curiae* filed in the arbitral proceeding which would later give rise to the *Achmea* Judgment, as the Statement of Defense shows: \"*Of course, the Czech Republic does not believe that its obligations under the BIT or the ECT are inconsistent with its obligations under EU law* ... *Unlike the European Commission, the Czech Republic does not insist that the Tribunal find that the applicability of EU law deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction*.\"82\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defense, para. 5.\n\n67.\n\nFurthermore, for the Tribunal, this is a clear declaration that the Respondent would not raise an objection akin to the position set forth by the European Commission in the *Achmea* arbitration.\n\n68.\n\nBy the time the hearing of this case took place (from 13 to 17 March 2017), the Respondent was aware that, on 3 March 2016, the German Federal Court of Justice had requested the CJEU to make a preliminary ruling on the *Achmea* arbitration.83 However, during the hearings, the Respondent did not mention such proceeding before the CJEU. As the Claimants point out, this differs from Poland's conduct in the *Strabag* case, where the state reserved its right to raise the *Achmea* objection once the CJEU took a decision on the matter.84\n\nCase -C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v Achmea BV* ECLI:EU:C:2018:158, 6 March 2018 (**Ex. RLA- 293**).\n\n*Strabag SE, Raiffeisen Centrobank AG and Syrena Immobilien Holding AG v. Republic of Poland*, ICSID Case No. ADHOC/15/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 4 March 2020, para. 8.91 (**Ex. RLA-301**).\n\n69.\n\nEven when the *Achmea* Judgment was issued on 6 March 2018, it cannot be considered as a new fact, so as to justify that the general arguments made in reliance upon it could not have been submitted earlier in this arbitration. The Tribunal agrees with the criterion in the *Gavrilovi\u0107* case in that sense: \"*[T]he decision itself is legal rather than factual in nature: it clarifies the law in the EU. On balance, the Tribunal considers that the \"fact\" of the ruling in* Achmea *does not suffice as a basis for the objections that the Respondent seeks to raise at this stage of the proceeding*\".85\n\n*Gavrilovi\u0107 and Gavrilovi\u0107 d.o.o. v. Republic of Croatia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/39, Decision on the Respondent's Request of 4 April 2018, 30 April 2018, para. 42. (**Ex. CLA-188**).\n\n70.\n\n*Second,* as noted, the Respondent expressly and repeatedly stated on several occasions that it would not raise the intra-EU BIT Objection. From the information provided by the Parties, the Tribunal has confirmed that during the 2014-2017 period, the Respondent stated on at least five occasions that it would not question the Tribunal's jurisdiction using arguments based on intra-EU law, for instance:\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's e-mail to the Arbitral Tribunal of 31 January 2014: \"*To be clear, the Czech Republic does not intend to raise the intra\u2010EU BIT objection*.\"\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's Letter to the Arbitral Tribunal dated 6 October 2014, p. 2: \"*The Czech Republic reaffirms that it will not raise the* intra-EU objection in this proceeding.\"\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's Statement of Defense, paras. 356, 433-434, 442; and the Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 281: \"*The Czech Republic does not respond to Claimants' extended comments concerning the European Commission's jurisdictional objection* ... *given that the Czech Republic's views on these matters have already been explained in its Statement of Defense.*\"\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's opening presentation, slide 89: \"*The Czech Republic does not advance an '*intra-*EU' jurisdictional objection*.\"\n\n71.\n\nIn the Statement of Defense, the Respondent stated that it was aware of parallel investment arbitrations in which this type of objection had already been presented. However, the Respondent also indicated that it would not follow those cases insofar as it did not perceive a collision of those investment treaties with EU law:\n\n\"[T]he Czech Republic in this arbitration is not pleading a fundamental incompatibility between investment treaties and EU law\" ... \"the Czech Republic has raised EU law-based jurisdictional objections in other intra EU investment arbitrations ... [T]he Czech Republic is not raising a similar objection in this case\" ... \"In this case, the Czech Republic does not perceive a collision of those investment treaties with EU law. Accordingly, the Czech Republic does not pursue the jurisdictional objection articulated by the Commission before this Tribunal.\"86\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defense, paras. 356, 433-434, 442.\n\n72.\n\nThese statements reaffirm that the Respondent had the opportunity to raise the intra-EU objection, now called the *Achmea* Objection, but chose to waive it. Even putting to one side the Claimants' argument on estoppel and waiver under international law, such express waivers demonstrate that there is no new circumstance that would justify the admission of a belated jurisdictional objection and avoid its preclusion under the UNCITRAL Rules and Swiss law.\n\n73.\n\n*Third*, and without prejudice to the standalone argument regarding its effects akin to *res judicata*, the Tribunal considers that the existence of a Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability is another reason for rejecting the claimed existence of a good cause to admit a late jurisdictional objection.\n\n74.\n\nThe late stage of the proceedings and the peril to an efficient and timely solution of the dispute should be weighed by the Tribunal when evaluating the admission of a belated submission under Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules. In this case a Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability shows that the proceedings are significantly advanced and considerable resources have been spent by the Parties, relying on the assumption that all the possible objections were being discussed and considered. From the Tribunal's perspective, this precludes a finding of good cause to admit a late objection.\n\n75.\n\n*For the abovementioned reasons*, the Tribunal concludes that the there is no \"good cause\" for the *Achmea* Objection to be admitted outside of the opportunity granted by Swiss law and the UNCITRAL Rules and the possibility of raising it at this stage of the proceedings should therefore be considered precluded or foreclosed.\n\n***(c) Res*** **judicata**\n--------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAside from the untimeliness of the Respondent's objection, in the Tribunal's view, admitting the objection would contradict the Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, which is binding and has preclusive effects akin to *res judicata*. This would in turn violate public policy, to the possible detriment of the validity of the final award under the law of the seat.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to Swiss law, the Tribunal may not depart in its final award from the decisions already taken in a previous interlocutory award on a material preliminary issue. According to the Swiss Federal Tribunal, the former would violate procedural public policy.87\n\nSwiss Federal Tribunal, *Case No. 128 III 191*, Judgment, 3 April 2002, para. 4(a) (\"An arbitral tribunal violates procedural public policy if it disregards the res judicata effect of a previous decision or if the final award departs from the opinion expressed in an interlocutory award disposing of a material preliminary issue.\") (**Ex. CLA-225**).\n\n78.\n\nAs shown by relevant precedents and doctrine, although partial awards do not have *res judicata* effects under Swiss law, they do have binding and preclusive effects akin thereto. As held by the Swiss Federal Tribunal: \"*[A]s to interim or preliminary awards ... which determine preliminary issues of procedure or merits, they do not have res judicata effect; having said that, unlike procedural orders or directives which can be modified or revoked over the course of the proceedings, such interim awards are binding on the arbitral tribunal which rendered them.*\"88\n\nSwiss Federal Tribunal, *Case No. 128 III 191*, Judgment, 3April 2002, para. 4 (**Ex. CLA-225**); S. Schaffstein, *The Doctrine of Res Judicata Before International Commercial Arbitral Tribunals* (Oxford University Press, 2016), paras. 4.79-4.80 (**Ex. CLA-224**).\n\n79.\n\nNotwithstanding that, under international law, a decision on jurisdiction does constitute a final (and binding) award on the matter, which carries *res judicata* effects. As quoted in the *Iberdrola II* case:\n\n\"'[T]he majority of commentators appears to agree that positive and negative arbitral decisions on jurisdiction constitute 'genuine arbitral awards' and should be entitled to the same *res judicata* effects as other arbitral awards.' For instance, Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldman write that '[a] decision on jurisdiction, the applicable law or the principle of liability ... is a final decision on one aspect of the dispute,' and 'should therefore be considered as an award, against which an immediate action to set aside can be brought.'\"89\n\n*Iberdrola Energ\u00eda, S.A. v. The Republic of Guatemala*, PCA Case No. 2017-41, Final Award, 24 August 2020, para. 264 (**Ex. CLA-205**).\n\n80.\n\nRespondent had the chance to challenge, and did challenge, the Tribunal's jurisdiction according to the applicable law. In the Partial Award, in addition to its findings on liability, the Tribunal rejected certain objections to its jurisdiction. This decision was in turn confirmed by the Swiss Federal Tribunal, which rejected Respondent's motion to set aside the Partial Award. The Tribunal is bound by its original finding on jurisdiction and could not decide otherwise now.\n\n81.\n\nAlthough the Partial Award did not expressly address what is now called the *Achmea* Objection, it upheld the Tribunal's jurisdiction, except for the admitted objections, and decided that the Respondent was internationally liable for certain treaty breaches. A finding of liability means \"*by necessary implication*\" that the Tribunal has decided that it has jurisdiction on the merits and that any other objection, including the intra-EU nature of the arbitration agreement, has no merit.\n\n82.\n\nThe doctrine of \"necessary implication\", found in international law precedents submitted by the Parties, extends the *res judicata* effects of a decision to questions not expressly stated but logically implied by an award.90 The Tribunal considers that Swiss rules on *res judicata* and binding effects akin thereto require, by logical necessity, the application of such doctrine.\n\n*Question of the Delimitation of the Continental Shel between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 Nautical Miles from the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, 17 March 2016, I.C.J. Reports 2016, para. 68 (**Ex. CLA-203**); *Iberdrola Energ\u00eda, S.A. v. The Republic of Guatemala*, PCA Case No. 2017-41, Final Award, 24 August 2020, para. 288 (**Ex. CLA-205**).\n\n83.\n\nIf the objection were admitted and the Tribunal were to find that it did not have jurisdiction in the first place, it would be modifying what can no longer be modified due to the binding effect (akin to *res judicata*) of the Partial Award: that, except for those objections admitted by the Tribunal, it had jurisdiction to declare the Respondent internationally liable. In that sense, the relation between a finding of liability and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is akin to that of \"chicken and egg.\" If the former exists, the latter, by necessary implication, must have preceded it.\n\n84.\n\nAdmitting the Respondent's objection would derogate from the preclusive effects akin to *res judicata* by calling into question one of the premises of the Partial Award, namely that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute, except for those of the objections admitted. Thus, in the Tribunal's view, it would be contrary to the public policy of the place of arbitration, would render the final award invalid and thus cannot be admitted by the Tribunal.\n\n**IV.

The Claimants' investments were effected through their purchase of shareholdings in, and/or the financing of, Energy 21 a.s. (\"**Energy 21**\"), a Czech joint stock company, beginning in 2008. As a result of the Claimants' investments in Energy 21, the Claimants indirectly owned eleven special purpose vehicles (\"**SPVs**\"), each of which has operated at least one solar power plant in the Czech Republic. The Claimants' investments were made subsequent to the establishment by the Czech Republic, beginning in 1992, of a legal, regulatory, and tax regime for renewable energy sources (\"**RES**\" and the \"**RES Regime**\"). In the earlier phase of the proceedings, the Claimants argued that the \"dismantling\" of the RES Regime breached several obligations incumbent on the Czech Republic under the ECT and the BITs and therefore entitled them to compensation in the amount of not less than CZK 2,212 million. The Respondent denied all of the Claimants' allegations, arguing that the Claimants were not entitled to any damages.\n\n6.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's findings in the Partial Award dated 20 December 2017, the Claimants, in the current phase of the proceedings, seek compensation for loss suffered as a result of the Respondent's breaches in the amount of not less than CZK 1,769.8 million. The Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to meet the burden of proving their damages and rejects the Claimants' calculation of damages.\n\n**C. The Partial Award**\n------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the Tribunal issued its Partial Award on issues of jurisdiction and liability, the dispositive part of which provides:\n\n508. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent breached the Energy Charter Treaty by repealing the Income Tax Holiday and by modifying the Original Depreciation Provisions of the Act on Income Tax (Act No. 586/1992) is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(b) GIHG's claim that the Respondent has breached the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(c) Radiance Energy Holding's claim that the Respondent has breached the Luxembourg-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(d) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is granted;\n\n(e) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is granted;\n\n(f) Natland Investment's claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is granted;\n\n(g) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(h) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the full protection and security standard in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(i) The Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the non-impairment standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty is dismissed;\n\n(j) Natland Group's claim that the Respondent has breached the most-favored-nation clause in Article 3 of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty is dismissed; and\n\n(k) All other claims, defenses and requests for relief, including claims for compensation and costs, are deferred to a subsequent phase of the arbitration.\n\n8.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal decided to postpone its decision on certain remaining issues to a subsequent phase of the proceedings as follows:\n\n503. As set out above in Section VI, the Tribunal has found that, while the Solar Levy does not fall under the Tax Exemption in Article 21(7) of the ECT, the Income Tax Holiday and the Original Depreciation Provisions do. Accordingly, although the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT over claims arising out of the Solar Levy (and indeed has found that the imposition of the Solar Levy constitutes a breach of the Respondent's obligations under the ECT, the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT and the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT), it has no jurisdiction under the ECT over any claims arising out of the repeal of the Income Tax Holiday and the modification of the Original Depreciation Provisions. The Tribunal has further found in Section VIII above that the Claimants' claims based on the alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, insofar as they are based on the Income Tax Holiday and the Original Depreciation Provisions, stand to be dismissed for lack of merit.\n\n504. However, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants' valuation approach does not attempt to segregate the impact of the Solar Levy from the impact of the repeal of the Income Tax Holiday and the modification of the Original Depreciation Provisions. The Tribunal is therefore not in a position to quantify the Claimants' losses based on the findings it has reached. However, given the factual and legal complexity of this case, involving a variety of jurisdictional and legal issues arising under four different investment treaties, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to simply dismiss the Claimants' case for compensation for failure to meet the burden of proving their losses. Anticipating the Tribunal's findings on the many jurisdictional and legal issues arising in this case, and then developing alternative calculations for each scenario, cannot reasonably be expected from either Party.\n\n505. Moreover, as set out in Section VIII above, the Tribunal has deferred its decision on whether the fact that a great bulk of the Claimants' total installed photovoltaic electricity generation capacity was installed in 2009 and 2010, when the \"solar boom\" was already emerging as a legitimate policy issue in the Czech Republic, has any impact on the Claimants' claims, in relation to quantum. The Tribunal is not in a position to make this determination in the absence of a valuation approach which takes into account the Tribunal's determinations on its jurisdiction and on the scope of the Respondent's liability under the applicable investment treaties. As noted above, the relevance of the EU State aid rules and of the Commission's decisions, to the extent not already addressed above, will also be addressed in that context.\n\n506. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds it appropriate, in accordance with Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, to issue a Partial Award which deals with issues of jurisdiction and liability only, and to postpone its decision on the issues of quantum to a subsequent phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal will revert to the Parties after the issuance of this Partial Award, in order to establish, in consultation with the Parties, a procedural calendar for the second phase of this arbitration.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe following constitutes an abridged summary of the course of the proceedings. A more detailed account of the procedural history preceding the issuance of the Partial Award may be found within that Award.\n\n10.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 8 May 2013, the Claimants commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT, Articles 8 of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT, and the Luxembourg-Czech Republic BIT, and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.\n\n11.\n\nBy the Respondent's letter of 9 July 2013 and the Claimants' letter of 22 July 2013, the Parties agreed that the present arbitration shall be governed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules (1976) (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"). Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the arbitration proceedings were deemed to have commenced on 15 May 2013, the date on which the Respondent received the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants appointed Mr Doak Bishop as the first arbitrator. The Respondent appointed Mr J. Christopher Thomas K.C. as the second arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the two co-arbitrators appointed Dr Veijo Heiskanen as the presiding arbitrator of the Tribunal. Dr Heiskanen accepted this appointment on 19 November 2013 and the Tribunal was duly constituted.\n\n14.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, Mr Bishop advised the Parties that his firm had been engaged in \"matters that may involve issues similar to those in this arbitration\". Mr Bishop, while noting that he had not been involved in those matters and that they did not involve the Parties, nonetheless resigned as arbitrator in the proceedings \"in order to avoid any perception of bias\".\n\n15.\n\nOn 24 September 2014, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants appointed Mr Gary Born as co-arbitrator in these proceedings pursuant to Articles 7(1) and 13(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules to replace Mr Bishop.\n\n**B. Written Submissions, Document Production, Hearing, And Partial Award**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 January 2014, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Parties submitted a common draft of Procedural Order No. 1 and a proposed procedural calendar, identifying areas of agreement and disagreement.\n\n17.\n\nOn 24 January 2014, the Tribunal convened the first procedural meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n18.\n\nBy 3 March 2014, the Parties and the Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment, which recorded, inter alia, that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") would act as the Registry and administer the arbitral proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nOn 14 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters, and where no agreement was reached, setting forth the Tribunal's directions, having heard the Parties and deliberated. Specifically, the Tribunal*, inter alia*, (i) determined Geneva as the place of arbitration; (ii) directed the Claimants to file a Statement of Claim; (iii) directed the Respondent to file its Request for Bifurcation in light of the Respondent's intention to object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction; and (iv) directed the Parties to attempt to reach an agreement with regard to a procedural timetable.\n\n20.\n\nFollowing receipt of further proposals by the Parties, on 7 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the timing of the document production.\n\n21.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Claimants submitted a procedural timetable agreed by both Parties, which was confirmed by the Tribunal the following day.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting out its decision regarding the Parties' outstanding disputed document production requests.\n\n23.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 and the Concurring Opinion of Mr Born, in which the Tribunal, *inter alia*, granted the European Commission's (the \"**Commission**\") request \"to file a written *amicus curiae* submission on the three points of law mentioned in its Application [\u2026] subject to an undertaking by the Commission to pay reasonable additional costs incurred by the Parties as a result of its intervention, if so ordered by the Tribunal\".\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 January 2015, the Tribunal approved a revised procedural calendar agreed by the Parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 20 January 2015, the Tribunal confirmed its general consent to a Disclosure Agreement entered into by all parties in PCA Cases No. 2014-19 to 2014-22,1 2014-01,2 and the present arbitration, under which the parties agreed to disclose the rulings rendered in each of these cases.\n\n15 years for installations commissioned by 31.12.2007\n\n*(1) Antaris Solar GmbH (2) Dr. Michael G\u00f6de v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-01.\n\n26.\n\nOn 2 February 2015, the Commission filed its written submission and requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision that the Commission should undertake to pay reasonable costs incurred by the Parties as a result of its intervention.\n\n27.\n\nOn 16 February 2015, in light of the Commission's refusal to provide that undertaking (which had been one of the conditions subject to which the Tribunal had granted the Commission's request to file an *amicus* submission), the Tribunal advised the Commission that its submission would not be considered by the Tribunal.\n\n28.\n\nOn 19 March 2015, the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim, together with witness statements and expert reports.\n\n29.\n\nOn 20 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its request for bifurcation of proceedings, requesting that the Tribunal \"hear its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as a preliminary question\".\n\n30.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, rejecting the Respondent's request for bifurcation of the proceedings, and confirming the procedural calendar as agreed by the Parties.\n\n31.\n\nOn 15 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, setting out its decision regarding the Respondent's further document production requests.\n\n32.\n\nOn 31 October 2015, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense, together with an annex, witness statement, and expert reports.\n\n33.\n\nOn 23 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, setting out its decision regarding the Claimants' further document production requests.\n\n34.\n\nOn 4 May 2016, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits and Quantum and Answer to Objections to Jurisdiction, together with an annex, witness statements, and expert reports.\n\n35.\n\nOn 6 September 2016, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder, together with an annex, witness statement, and expert reports (the \"**2016 Rejoinder**\").\n\n36.\n\nOn 28 October 2016, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with an updated annex, and expert reports.\n\n37.\n\nOn 31 January 2017, the Tribunal granted the Parties' requests for the admission into the record of a decision of the Commission on the \"Czech Republic Promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources\" issued on 28 November 2016 and made public on 23 January 2017, and for the submission of written comments on that decision.\n\n38.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, in accordance with leave granted by the Tribunal, the Claimants submitted the Supplemental Report by their quantum expert, Mr Geoffrey Senogles.\n\n39.\n\nOn 15 February 2017, both Parties submitted their comments on the Commission's decision dated 28 November 2016.\n\n40.\n\nOn 27 February 2017, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Supplemental Report of Mr Senogles, together with the Third Expert Report of Mr Michael Peer.\n\n41.\n\nFrom 13 to 17 March 2017, a hearing was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n42.\n\nOn 16 June 2017, the Parties filed simultaneous costs submissions.\n\n43.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the Tribunal issued the Partial Award in which it dealt with issues of jurisdiction and liability.\n\n44.\n\nOn 18 January 2018, in accordance with Article 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimants submitted a request to the Tribunal to correct a few \"clerical or typographical errors\" in the Partial Award.\n\n45.\n\nOn 24 January 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it did not wish to make any comments on the Claimants' request for corrections.\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 February 2020, pursuant to Article 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules, as requested by the Claimants, the Tribunal made three sets of corrections to the Partial Award of 20 December 2017.\n\n**C. Suspension of the Proceedings and the Reconstitution of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, the Tribunal requested that the Parties confer on the schedule of the next phase of the proceedings and report the outcome of their discussion by 2 February 2018.\n\n48.\n\nOn 29 January 2018, the Parties jointly requested that the Tribunal grant a one-week extension until 9 February 2018 to inform the Tribunal of the outcome of their discussions regarding the schedule of the next phase of the proceedings. The Parties' joint request for extension was granted on the same day.\n\n49.\n\nBy correspondence dated 9 February 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Respondent had submitted a set-aside application against the Partial Award in Switzerland and that they had agreed to stay the arbitration until the Swiss Federal Tribunal had decided on the set-aside application. The Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreement to stay the arbitration on the same day.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter dated 15 February 2018, the Respondent expressed its formal reservation of rights, asking the Tribunal to take note of \"[t]he Czech Republic's objections regarding violations of its procedural rights aris[ing] from the Partial Award of 20 December 2017\", which are \"separate from and additional to the objections raised in the Czech Republic's set-aside application to the Swiss Federal Tribunal against the Tribunal's rulings on jurisdiction\".\n\n51.\n\nOn 24 June 2018, Mr Born tendered his resignation as co-arbitrator due to \"unforeseen developments in another proceeding\".\n\n52.\n\nOn 9 and 26 July 2018, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively took note of Mr Born's resignation and raised no objection in this regard.\n\n53.\n\nOn 9 August 2018, Dr Heiskanen disclosed that he was acting as counsel in three investment arbitration proceedings in which the implications of the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 6 March 2018 in the case of *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV* (the \"***Achmea*** **Judgment**\") on the tribunal's powers to entertain the case had arisen as an issue. Dr Heiskanen indicated that his involvement in the three matters did not affect his independence and impartiality in the present arbitration but, nevertheless, he was prepared to tender his resignation as the presiding arbitrator in this case should either Party take a different view.\n\n54.\n\nOn 15 August 2018, the Respondent accepted Dr Heiskanen's offer to resign from the Tribunal. Additionally, considering the *Achmea* Judgment to have \"a direct bearing on this arbitration\", the Respondent indicated that it intended to bring up this issue once the suspension of the proceedings was lifted.\n\n55.\n\nIn light of the Respondent's letter of 15 August 2018, Dr Heiskanen tendered his resignation as the presiding arbitrator in this arbitration on 20 August 2018.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated 20 August 2018, the Claimants appointed Mr John Beechey C.B.E. as arbitrator pursuant to Articles 13(1) and 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n57.\n\nFollowing Dr Heiskanen's resignation, the Claimants also requested that Mr Beechey and Mr Thomas appoint a new presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n58.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, the Respondent challenged Mr Beechey's appointment as arbitrator and requested him to resign. The Respondent's request for Mr Beechey's resignation was based on (i) his appointment as an arbitrator in four pending cases, which Respondent contended raised matters of fact and law \"extremely similar\" to those already determined in the Partial Award; and (ii) Mr Beechey's service as the President of the ICSID tribunal in *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1, an investment arbitration case which, amongst other things, dealt with the impact of the *Achmea* Judgment.\n\n59.\n\nOn 2 September 2018, the Respondent stated its intention to submit a formal notice of Mr Beechey's challenge by 4 September 2018 pursuant to Article 11(1) the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n60.\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Mr Beechey informed the Parties that he had reviewed the concerns of the Respondent and decided that the appointing authority in this matter should consider the challenge on its merits.\n\n61.\n\nOn 4 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Notice of Challenge of Mr Beechey pursuant to Articles 11(1) and 11(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules based on the reasons mentioned above. The Respondent invited the Claimants and Mr Beechey to comment on the Notice of Challenge by 19 September 2018.\n\n62.\n\nOn 19 September 2018, objecting to the Respondent's challenge of Mr Beechey, the Claimants advised Mr Thomas that the Parties would approach the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the \"**SCC**\") and request it to decide the Respondent's challenge of Mr Beechey in accordance with the SCC Procedures as Appointing Authority under the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n63.\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of the SCC dismissed the Respondent's challenge of Mr Beechey.\n\n64.\n\nOn 23 October 2020, the Claimants, on behalf of both Parties, informed the Tribunal and the PCA that the Respondent's request to set aside the Tribunal's Partial Award had been rejected by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court and that the suspension agreed by the Parties in this arbitration had therefore been lifted.\n\n65.\n\nOn that same date, in order to fill the vacancy left by the former presiding arbitrator's resignation in August 2018 and to reconstitute the Tribunal, the Parties submitted an agreed protocol for the appointment of a replacement presiding arbitrator. They requested the co-arbitrators and the PCA to confirm whether they would agree to the proposed procedure. On 27 October 2020, the co-arbitrators and the PCA confirmed that they would adopt the Parties' agreed protocol.\n\n66.\n\nOn 26 January 2021, in accordance with the agreed protocol, Professor Alfredo Bullard was appointed as the presiding arbitrator in this arbitration.\n\n**D. The Decision on the Respondent's** ***Achmea*** **Objection and the Determination of the Procedural Calendar**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nOn 4 February 2021, the Tribunal directed the Parties to confer and seek agreement on the procedural calendar for the next phase of the proceedings.\n\n68.\n\nBy correspondence dated 4 March 2021, the Parties, noting the Respondent's intention to raise a jurisdictional objection based on the *Achmea* Judgment (the \"***Achmea*** **Objection**\"), advised the Tribunal that they had agreed on the timetable and format for submissions on the admissibility of the Respondent's *Achmea* Objection. Additionally, the Parties (i) informed the Tribunal that they would submit their respective positions on the issues of disagreement relating to the procedural calendar of the next phase of the proceedings; and (ii) proposed to schedule a procedural session by videoconference following the completion of the Parties' submissions on the *Achmea* Objection.\n\n69.\n\nOn 5 March 2021, the Parties submitted their respective positions on outstanding issues of disagreement relating to the procedural calendar for the next phase of the proceedings, including the title of the written pleadings therein.\n\n70.\n\nOn 9 March 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 8, (i) establishing the timetable for the Parties' submissions on the admissibility of the *Achmea* Objection; (ii) reserving the determination of all other issues raised in the Parties' correspondence of 5 March 2021 to a subsequent procedural order; and (iii) agreeing to a procedural session by videoconference following the completion of the Parties' written submissions on the *Achmea* Objection.\n\n71.\n\nBetween 24 March and 10 May 2021, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, the Parties respectively submitted two rounds of submissions on the admissibility of the *Achmea* Objection.\n\n72.\n\nOn 19 May 2021, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Parties, *inter alia*, confirmed that the procedural calendar for the next phase of the proceedings remained an issue of disagreement between the Parties to be discussed during the procedural meeting scheduled on 25 May 2021.\n\n73.\n\nOn 25 May 2021, a procedural meeting was held by videoconference in which counsel and representatives for the Parties, the Tribunal, and the PCA participated. At the procedural meeting, the Parties addressed the Tribunal on the admissibility of the *Achmea* Objection and discussed the outstanding issues of procedure-related disagreements between the Parties. At the end of the procedural meeting, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and revert with a joint proposal regarding the procedural calendar for the next phase of this arbitration by 4 June 2021, taking into account the Tribunal's request that the Parties submit updated quantum reports, which took into consideration the Tribunal's determination on its jurisdiction and on the scope of the Respondent's liability under the applicable investment treaties as set out in the Partial Award.\n\n74.\n\nOn 4 and 5 June 2021, the Parties respectively submitted their positions on the procedural calendar.\n\n75.\n\nOn 6 June 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to declare the Respondent's *Achmea* Objection inadmissible in these proceedings and that its reasoning would be provided in writing in due course. In light of its decision, the Tribunal invited the Parties to seek an intermediate solution between their current positions regarding the procedural calendar and to revert by 9 June 2021.\n\n76.\n\nOn 9 June 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement on the procedural calendar for the next phase of the arbitration, but not on the meaning of \"accompanied by expert report(s) on quantum\" included in the proposed calendar. Accordingly, the Parties submitted their respective positions on the expression in separate communications on the same day.\n\n77.\n\nOn 16 June 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, *inter alia*, (i) establishing the procedural calendar as agreed by the Parties; and (ii) deciding that \"[e]ither Party may adduce without limitations the evidence with its written submissions that it considers relevant to the issues left open by the Partial Award\".\n\n78.\n\nOn 22 July 2021, as foreseen in the Tribunal's letter of 6 June 2021, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Admissibility of the *Achmea* Objection, declaring the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction based on the *Achmea* Judgment inadmissible.\n\n**E. The Claimants' Request to Amend the Case Caption**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nOn 10 May 2021, the Claimants notified the Tribunal that (i) Natland Investment had been renamed NIG N.V. (\"**NIG**\") on 20 October 2015; and (ii) Natland Group had been renamed NGL Business Europe (\"**NGL**\") on 12 April 2015 and subsequently merged into the Cypriot company Capamera Limited (\"**Capamera**\") on 3 February 2017. Accordingly, the Claimants requested that the case caption of this arbitration be modified to reflect the changes of names of the Claimants.\n\n80.\n\nOn 14 May 2021, the Respondent confirmed that it did not object to amending the case caption to reflect Natland Investment's new name. However, it objected to the amendment of the case caption in respect of the addition of Capamera. It requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to explain (i) the delay in the making of the disclosures; (ii) whether the Claimants believed that the dissolution of Natland Group in 2017 carried any implications for the Partial Award; and (iii) the factual, legal, and procedural bases on which the Claimants based their request for the addition of Capamera as a claimant in this arbitration.\n\n81.\n\nOn 19 May 2021, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's objection relating to the case caption, clarifying that, as a result of the merger, Capamera had become the universal successor of Natland Group by operation of law. As such, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's objection, because, in their view, the merger was irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes.\n\n82.\n\nDuring the procedural meeting of 25 May 2021, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit evidence from Mr Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ra\u0161ka regarding the corporate events concerning Natland Group as the basis of the Claimants' request to modify the case caption.\n\n83.\n\nOn 4 June 2021, the Claimants indicated that they would be in a position to file Mr Ra\u0161ka's statement by 18 June 2021.\n\n84.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Claimants filed the statement of Mr Ra\u0161ka dated 16 June 2021 relating to the change of names of Claimants Natland Investment and Natland Group.\n\n85.\n\nOn 28 June 2021, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent provided its comments on Mr Ra\u0161ka's statement and reiterated its request that the Tribunal decline to amend the case caption.\n\n86.\n\nBy letters dated 8 and 15 July 2021, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively maintained their positions with respect to the Claimants' request to amend the case caption.\n\n87.\n\nOn 24 July 2021, the Tribunal requested the Claimants by 3 August 2021 (i) to disclose the legal advice provided to Mr Ra\u0161ka in connection with the reorganization of the Natland Group companies in Cyprus; (ii) to submit a report by an independent expert on Cypriot law addressing the legal bases of that reorganization; and (iii) to explain the reasons for the delay in disclosing Natland Group's merger into Capamera. As to the procedure by which the Claimants' request would be considered and resolved, the Tribunal proposed the following two options: (i) a separate procedure on an expedited timetable in which each Party would adduce expert evidence of Cypriot law and make further submissions as to the effect of the merger of Natland Group into Capamera, followed by a short virtual hearing; or (ii) incorporation of these issues into the pleadings already scheduled for the quantum phase of the proceedings. The Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and present their agreed position on the procedure by 6 August 2021.\n\n88.\n\nBy letter dated 3 August 2021, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that no written legal advice was provided in relation to the potential implications of the merger for the arbitration and that they would be in a position to file an expert report on Cypriot law with the submission due on 1 September 2021. The Claimants further explained that they had not disclosed Natland Group's merger into Capamera in the earlier phase of the proceedings, because they had been advised that they were \"irrelevant corporate events, having no implication for the arbitration\".\n\n89.\n\nOn 6 August 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to proceed under the second option proposed by the Tribunal to resolve the Claimants' request to amend the case caption, i.e., that the Parties would file any expert reports regarding Cypriot law, together with the submissions that had already been scheduled, and that they would incorporate into such submissions any further arguments that they might have on this matter.\n\n**F. Written Submissions in the Current Phase of the Proceedings and Organization of the Hearing**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nOn 1 September 2021, the Claimants filed their Submission, together with (i) an expert report by Mr Richard Edwards of FTI Consulting3 (\"**FTI**\"); (ii) an expert report by Mr Bas Opmeer of FSV Belastingadviseurs; and (iii) a Legal Memorandum on Cypriot Law by Dr Marcos Gregorios Dracos (the \"**Submission**\").\n\nThis was the first such report prepared by Mr Edwards in this arbitration. During the prior phase of the arbitration, the Claimants' damages analyses were conducted by Mr Senogles, then of Charles River Associates.\n\n91.\n\nOn 3 November 2021, the Claimants, on behalf of both Parties, requested that the Tribunal approve the Parties' agreement to amend certain deadlines in the procedural calendar.\n\n92.\n\nOn 4 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, endorsing the Parties' agreement to postpone certain deadlines for their remaining submissions and the notification of witnesses and experts to be cross-examined.\n\n93.\n\nOn 24 November 2021, the Respondent submitted its Response Submission on Remaining Issues (the \"**Response**\"), together with (i) the Fourth Expert Report of Mr Peer; and (ii) the First Expert Report of Mr Kypros Ioannides.\n\n94.\n\nOn 21 January 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, endorsing the Parties' agreement further to postpone certain deadlines for their remaining submissions and the notification of witnesses and experts to be cross-examined.\n\n95.\n\nOn 9 February 2022, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 11, the Claimants submitted their Reply (the \"**Reply**\"), together with (i) the Second Report of Mr Edwards and (ii) the Second Legal Memorandum on Cypriot Law by Dr Dracos.\n\n96.\n\nOn 20 April 2022, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Submission on Remaining Issues (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), together with (i) the Fifth Expert Report of Mr Peer; (ii) the Second Expert Report of Mr Ioannides; and (iii) the Expert Report of Professor Stef van Weeghel.\n\n97.\n\nOn 19 May 2022, the Claimants informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that they had inadvertently failed to submit two earn-out letters (the \"**Earn-Out Letters**\") that they had intended to produce together with their Reply. They sought leave from the Tribunal to submit these documents, as well as a corrected version of Appendix 5 to the Second Expert Report of Mr Edwards. With the consent of the Respondent, the Earn-Out Letters were admitted into the record on 20 May 2022 as factual exhibits C-494 and C-495.\n\n**G. Hearing**\n--------------\n\n98.\n\nOn 7 March 2022, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Parties agreed to hold the hearing at the Winter Palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy in Vienna, Austria (the \"**Winter Palace**\").\n\n99.\n\nOn 8 April 2022, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit comments on certain issues concerning the administrative and logistical arrangements for the hearing by 9 May 2022.\n\n100.\n\nOn 10 May 2022, the Tribunal granted a one-day extension for the Parties to respond to the issues raised in the Tribunal's letter of 8 April 2022.\n\n101.\n\nOn 10 May 2022, following a one-day extension granted by the Tribunal, the Parties submitted a joint letter concerning the administrative and logistical arrangements for the hearing, advising the Tribunal that they had reached agreement on most of the outstanding hearing-related issues. The Parties requested that the Tribunal resolve any remaining areas of disagreement on the basis of written submissions that they were to file simultaneously.\n\n102.\n\nOn the same date, upon the Parties' request, the Tribunal confirmed, *inter alia*, that (i) the hearing would take place in-person; and (ii) it did not envisage the need to summon for cross-examination any witness or expert in addition to those notified by the Parties.\n\n103.\n\nOn 12 May 2022, the Tribunal provided its observations on the Parties' agreed positions set out in their joint letter of 10 May 2022 and, where the Parties had been unable to reach agreement, set out its directions. The Tribunal therefore vacated the pre-hearing conference scheduled for 17 May 2022.\n\n104.\n\nFrom 23 to 25 May 2022, a hearing was held at the Winter Palace. The following individuals attended:\n\n**Tribunal:**\n\nProfessor Alfredo Bullard (Presiding Arbitrator)  \nMr John Beechey C.B.E.  \nMr J.

In the course of his cross-examination, Mr Ra\u0161ka had stated that the members of the International Photovoltaic Investors Club (the \"**IPVIC**\") had shared certain expenses relating to solar arbitrations through a \"funding arrangement\" (the \"**Funding Agreement**\"), a fact which, according to the Respondent, had previously been unknown to it.4\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 201:7-25; Day 2, pp. 4:6-7:11. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 247:25-249:2; Day 3, pp. 126:22-131:14, 151:3-20, 152:22-153:9.\n\n106.\n\nFollowing the Respondent's request that the Claimants disclose the Funding Agreement and having heard the Claimants' objections thereto, the Tribunal directed the Parties to set out their positions in writing on the same day.5 In subsequent correspondence between the Parties, the Respondent sought additional information from the Claimants, including the disclosure of a copy of the Funding Agreement. Based on its exchanges with the Claimants, at the end of the second day of the hearing, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of its intention to file an application for the disclosure of the Funding Agreement.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 4:16-25, 5:22-6:10, 6:20-7:11.\n\n107.\n\nAlso on 24 May 2024, the Tribunal requested that the Parties' experts\u2014Mr Edwards and Mr Peer\u2014submit a joint report by 30 June 2022, setting out (i) their agreed views on the specific questions posed to them by the Tribunal during the hearing; and (ii) their separate views on points that were not agreed in appendices A and B to the joint report, with a maximum total of ten pages per appendix.6 It was also agreed that the Parties would submit simultaneous comments on the joint report by 21 July 2022.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 163:16-164:22.\n\n108.\n\nAt the close of the 25 May 2022 hearing day, after receiving written submissions on the Respondent's disclosure request and hearing oral clarifications from the Parties, the Tribunal ordered, *inter alia*, that after the close of the hearing, two of the Respondent's counsel be permitted to review a copy of the Funding Agreement on a confidential basis in order to assess its relevance for this Arbitration.7\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 151:3-14, 152:22-153:9, 173:20-177:12.\n\n**H. The Respondent's Request for the Disclosure of the Funding Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that two of its counsel, Mr Evseev and Ms Silberman, had reviewed the Funding Agreement as instructed, and within the limits set by the Tribunal. Since the review of the Funding Agreement \"confirmed and exacerbated [its] concerns\", the Respondent requested that the Funding Agreement be made available for review by all of the Respondent's internal and external counsel, so that it could present an application to the Tribunal (the \"**Proposed Application**\").\n\n110.\n\nOn 28 May 2022, having received the Claimants' submission that the Respondent's proposed application concerning the Funding Agreement should be prepared only by the two counsel for the Respondent who had reviewed the Funding Agreement, the Tribunal requested the Claimants to provide it with copies of the Funding Agreement and its Amendment by no later than 30 May 2022. The copies of the Funding Agreement and the Amendment were provided to the Tribunal on the same day.\n\n111.\n\nOn 8 and 13 June 2022, at the Tribunal's invitation, Mr Evseev and Ms Silberman and the Claimants respectively submitted their comments on the relevance and materiality of the Respondent's proposed application, taking account of the current stage of the proceedings.\n\n112.\n\nOn 30 June 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, in which it denied the Respondent's application for the production of the Funding Agreement and for the filing of further submissions in relation to it.\n\n113.\n\nOn 22 July 2022, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of its objections to Procedural Order No. 12. It requested that the Tribunal: (i) take note of its objections; (ii) reconsider its decision to deny the Respondent's application for the production of the Funding Agreement; (iii) permit Ms Silberman to share with the Respondent's party representatives and its entire counsel team the two letters that preceded the issuance of Procedural Order No. 12; and (iv) clarify that Procedural Order No. 12 should not be read as preventing the Respondent from using the descriptions of the Funding Agreement already on the record for its submissions on costs. Furthermore, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal direct the PCA to ask the two former members of the Tribunal, who had resigned following the issuance of the Partial Award, to conduct conflicts check for the period in which they had served as arbitrators in this matter.\n\n114.\n\nOn 8 August 2022, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants submitted their comments on the Respondent's requests of 22 July 2022. Leaving aside the request that the Tribunal take note of the Respondent's objections to Procedural Order No. 12, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's other requests which, in their view, \"essentially [sought] to reverse the Tribunal's directions and determinations\". The Claimants deferred to the Tribunal's discretion to decide whether to instruct the PCA to contact the former members of the Tribunal for conflict check purposes.\n\n115.\n\nOn 31 August 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had taken careful note of the objections and reservations expressed by the Respondent with regard to Procedural Order No. 12.\n\n116.\n\nOn 6 September 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the PCA, acting under instructions of the Tribunal, had confirmed that the two former members of the Tribunal had carried out further conflict checks. Each had declared that he had no conflict of interest to disclose.\n\n117.\n\nOn 25 October 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, (i) dismissing the Respondent's request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision to deny the Respondent's application for the production of the Funding Agreement; (ii) dismissing the Respondent's request to release to the Czech Republic the submissions made by the Parties' counsel prior to the issuance of Procedural Order No. 12; and (iii) clarifying that the description of the Funding Agreement already on the record and those contained in Procedural Order No. 12 may be used by the Parties in their costs submissions.\n\n118.\n\nOn 5 April 2023, Ms Silberman informed the Tribunal that she would retire from Arnold & Porter on 12 April 2023. She requested the Tribunal's authorization to convey the relevant documents \"directly, exclusively and confidentially\" to Mr Craig Steward, Arnold & Porter\u1fbds General Counsel, assuring the Tribunal that the firm would take the necessary measures to prevent access to the Funding Agreement by other attorneys, employees or third parties.\n\n119.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal confirmed receipt of Ms Silberman's communication and invited the Claimants to provide their comments by 11 April 2023.\n\n120.\n\nOn 11 April 2023, the Claimants confirmed that they had no objections to Ms Silberman's request. Accordingly, the Tribunal granted Ms Silberman's request on 12 April 2023.\n\n**I. Joint Expert Report and Submissions on Costs**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nOn 9 June 2022, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had not reached an agreement in relation to the preparation of the experts' joint report, which the Tribunal had directed Mr Edwards and Mr Peer to submit by 30 June 2022. They requested the Tribunal to instruct \"each expert (i) to coordinate with the other expert in the preparation of the joint report, without any consultation with, or intervention by, counsel, except in case the experts need to approach the Tribunal for clarifications; and (ii) not to discuss or share with counsel any correspondence, documents or material exchanged with, or received from, the other expert, or the experts' joint work\".\n\n122.\n\nOn 14 June 2022, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject the Claimants' application of 9 June 2022 on the basis that \"it would create a risk of infringing upon the [P]arties' due-process rights\".\n\n123.\n\nOn 20 June 2022, the Tribunal, having considered the Parties' views on whether their respective experts should be able to consult with counsel in the preparation of their joint report, instructed each side to submit, together with the joint expert report, a short explanation as to what the extent of its involvement in the preparation of the joint report had been.\n\n124.\n\nOn 15 July 2022, following a 15-day extension granted by the Tribunal, Mr Edwards and Mr Peer filed their Joint Expert Report (the \"**Joint Expert Report**\"), together with Appendices A and B, which outlined each expert's separate views on points that were not agreed.\n\n125.\n\nOn 15 and 16 July 2022, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively outlined the extent to which they had been involved in the preparation of the Joint Expert Report.\n\n126.\n\nOn 5 August 2022, following an extension granted by the Tribunal, the Parties filed their comments on the Joint Expert Report.\n\n127.\n\nOn 16 December 2022, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their respective submissions on costs (the \"**Claimants' Submission on Costs**\" and the \"**Respondent's Submission on Costs**\", respectively).\n\n128.\n\nOn 19 December 2022, the Respondent submitted an updated version of its Submission on Costs correcting a few minor errors.\n\n129.\n\nOn 5 January 2023, the Respondent noted that the Claimants' Submission on Costs included information on the contents of the Funding Agreement that had previously been held to be confidential and not part of the record. In light of Procedural Order No. 13, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal (i) disregard such information; and (ii) declare such information excluded from the record.\n\n130.\n\nOn 13 January 2023, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimants provided their response to the Respondent's request of 5 January 2023, requesting that the Tribunal (i) dismiss the Respondent's request; or (ii), if it ordered the Claimants to remove references to the Funding Agreement, to require the Respondent to withdraw its argument in its Submission on Costs that \"there is no evidence in the record as to what percentage of [the Claimants'] costs were borne by Claimants themselves\".\n\n131.\n\nOn 18 January 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (i) granting the Respondent's request that references to the Funding Agreement be excluded from the Claimants' Submission on Costs, and (ii) dismissing the Claimants' request that the Tribunal exclude the above-cited sentence from the Respondent's Submission on Costs.\n\n**J. The Tribunal's Request for Documentation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nOn 25 January 2023, the Tribunal requested *inter alia* that the Claimants produce, or explain the reasons why it could not produce, (i) an inventory of the assets transferred to Capamera, which was marked as Annex 1 to Appendix B-5 to Dr Dracos' First Expert Report (the \"**Inventory**\"); and (ii) copies of the Earn-Out Letters.\n\n133.\n\nOn 1 February 2023, the Claimants provided their response to the Tribunal's letter of 25 January 2023. The Claimants stated *inter alia* that, despite their best efforts, they were not able to locate a copy of the Inventory. With regard to the Earn-Out Letters, the Claimants noted that these documents had been produced before the hearing on 20 May 2022, and were on the record as exhibits C-494 and C-495.\n\n134.\n\nOn 3 February 2023, the Respondent indicated that it would be prepared to provide brief comments on the Claimants' communication of 1 February 2023.\n\n135.\n\nOn 4 February 2023, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide comments on the Claimants' communication of 1 February 2023. The Claimants were given leave subsequently to reply to the Respondent's comments.\n\n136.\n\nOn 8 February 2023, the Respondent provided its comments on the Claimants' communication of 1 February 2023. The Respondent noted that the Claimants' communication of 1 February 2023 marked the first time that the Claimants had (i) acknowledged that they had performed a search for the Inventory, and (ii) expressed the view that the Inventory's existence was doubtful. In regard to the latter claim, the Respondent contended that, on the contrary, it seemed highly likely that the Inventory had existed at one point in time, since it had been mentioned in a \"Merger Scheme\" annexed to a Cypriot court order of 3 February 2017, and that, had Natland Group's treaty claims carried the value alleged in the Claimants' quantum assessment, they surely would have been included in such Inventory. For these reasons, the Respondent submitted that the conclusion to be drawn must be that no treaty claims were ever transferred to Capamera.\n\n137.\n\nOn 13 February 2023, the Claimants provided their reply to the Respondent's comments of 8 February 2023. The Claimants reiterated that they had carried out multiple extensive searches for the Inventory in the course of the present proceedings. The Claimants further reiterated that they continue to regard the existence of the Inventory as doubtful, for the following reasons: (i) the description of the Inventory in the \"Merger Scheme\" suggests that, if anything, it was conceived as a collection of financial statements from the companies involved in the merger rather than a stand alone document specifically prepared for the merger; (ii) since the merger was a group restructuring, there had been no compelling need to record and value what had been transferred to Capamera; and (iii) the merger approval by the 3 February 2017 court order was not limited to items listed in the Inventory, but rather it related to the transfer of all \"properties, assets and liabilities\" to Capamera, thereby making the hypothetical content of the Inventory less significant, including with respect to the question of whether Natland Group's treaty claims had been properly transferred to Capamera.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThis section recalls the facts relevant to this phase of the proceedings and the questions left open by the Partial Award. This overview, however, is not exhaustive of all the events and circumstances laid out by the Parties in their submissions, nor of their diverging views thereon. For a more comprehensive factual background, regard should be had to paragraphs 84 to 145 of the Partial Award.\n\n**A. The RES System established by the Respondent, The Solar Levy, and the \"Solar boom\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimants' investments through Energy 21 took place in the context of what has been described repeatedly throughout these proceedings as a \"solar boom\". This refers to a period of rapidly expanding investment in the Czech Republic's solar energy sector, precipitated by the reduction of the costs of entry originally associated with the country's solar market. Those costs had been reduced substantially as a result of the very significant and unanticipated reduction in the costs of importing photovoltaic panels from China and Taiwan, which had taken the Respondent and industry participants by surprise. Here, relevant details surrounding the 'solar boom' are restated, including the legislative and policy framework that enabled it, the \"legitimate policy issue\" that arose for the Respondent, and the measures that it took to address that issue.8\n\n*See* Partial Award, para. 428.\n\n**1. The Respondent's RES Regime**\n----------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent established its RES Regime over the course of a number of years.9 In 1992, the Czech Republic introduced Act No. 586/1992 on Income Tax (the \"**Act on Income Tax**\").10 Pursuant to this Act, a tax exemption applying to income gained from the operation of solar facilities (the \"**Income Tax Holiday**\") was established, as were rules for the depreciation for tax purposes of certain PV plant components (the \"**Original Depreciation Provisions**\").11\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 84-104. *See also* Submission, paras. 17-31; Response, paras. 6-22.\n\nPartial Award, para. 84; Act on Income Tax (**Ex. C-18/R-61**).\n\nPartial Award, para. 84; Act on Income Tax, s. 19 (**Ex. C-18/R-61**).\n\n141.\n\nOn 31 March 2005, in connection with its newly assumed European Union (\"**EU**\") law obligations,12 the Respondent enacted Act No. 180/2005 on Promotion of Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources (the \"**Act on RES Promotion**\").13 At a time of global recognition of the need to address climate change,14 the Czech Republic was set a target (the \"**EU Target**\") of 8% for contribution of electricity produced from RES as a proportion of total electricity consumption by 2010.15 Later, in 2009, this target was increased to 13%.16\n\n*See* European Commission, Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy, 26 November 1997 (**Ex. C-345**); EU Parliament Resolution on Electricity from renewable energy sources and the internal electricity market, 30 March 2000 (**Ex. C-347**); Directive 2001/77/EC on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, 27 September 2001 (**Ex. C-20**); European Commission, Communication from the Commission: The Support of Electricity from Renewable Energy Sources, 7 December 2005 (**Ex.

C-26/R-5**) (hereinafter \"**Act on RES Promotion**\").\n\nReply, para. 14: \"The Czech Republic's adoption of an incentive regime to encourage the use of RES\u2013 including the Act on Promotion \u2013 is linked to, and was triggered by, the global initiatives against climate change dating back to the 1992 United Nations Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to that Convention\".\n\nAnnex II to the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic et al. and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, 12.

C-23**).\n\n142.\n\nThe Act on RES Promotion was designed to help the Czech Republic meet the EU Target by providing two tariff incentives to stimulate investment in RES: (a) the Feed-in Tariff (the \"**FiT**\"), a fixed purchase price for units of electricity delivered to the grid by RES producers, and (b) the Green Bonus, a payment made by the grid operator to RES producers for electricity they sold on the free market or consumed themselves (the \"**Green Bonus**\" and, together with the FiT, the \"**Subsidies**\").17\n\nAct on RES Promotion, ss. 4, 6 (**Ex. C-26/R-5**).\n\n143.\n\nThe FiT scheme obliged Czech electricity consumers to purchase RES-generated electricity energy at the price set by the Czech Government's Energy Regulatory Office (\"**ERO**\").18 The ERO's role in relation to the Subsidies formed part of its broader mandate to \"support economic competition, to support the use of renewable and secondary energy sources, and to protect consumers' interests in those areas of the energy sector where competition is impossible\".19\n\nPartial Award, para. 94.\n\nAct No. 458/2000 on Business Conditions and Public Administration in the Energy Sectors, 28 February 2005, s. 17(3) (hereinafter \"**Energy Act**\") (**Ex. C-152**).\n\n144.\n\nBuilt into the Act on RES Promotion was a guaranteed 15-year return on investments for RES producers,20 which, it will be recalled, was held by this Tribunal to be an intrinsic \"stability guarantee\" for investors.21 In essence, this required that the Subsidies in respect of a RES investment be maintained by the ERO at a consistent level for 15 years from the point at which that investment was commissioned. That 15-year period was subsequently lengthened to 20 years.22\n\nAct on RES Promotion, s. 6(1)(b)(2) (**Ex.

The Emergence of a Solar Boom as a \"Legitimate Policy Issue\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nInitially, it was not expected that the Act on RES Promotion would have a substantial impact on the growth of solar energy.26 Indeed, the Parties agree that when the Act on RES Promotion was drafted in late 2003, expectations of such growth in this segment of the renewable energy sector were low, due to the then prohibitively high costs of solar panels (which account for a significant proportion of the total cost of solar plants).27\n\nFor instance, the Claimants' Reply notes that \"[t]he Act on [RES] Promotion proved incapable of meaningfully promoting PV energy from 2006 to 2008\". *See* Reply, para. 27.\n\n*See* Partial Award, para. 90; Response, para. 20; Reply, paras. 22-23.\n\n147.\n\nBy 2009, however, the cost of solar panels had reduced significantly as a result of markedly cheaper imports from Asia.28 In this respect, the Parties disagree as to whether such cost reductions were foreseeable in the period between 2003 and late 2008, when they are said to have begun.29 The Claimants suggest that the Respondent's policymakers \"had evidence of the large potential for PV cost reductions as early as 2005\".30 By contrast, the Respondent points to, *inter alia,* a Governmental report of September 2005 which found it \"unlikely\" that there would be \"any significant increase in installed capacity or electricity production in the immediate future\".31\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 101, 121, 426. This spawned an anti-dumping duty investigation by the European Commission.\n\nPartial Award, para. 121, *referring to* 2016 Rejoinder, para. 109; Second Expert Report of Wynne Jones, 3 September 2016 (hereinafter \"**RER-Jones-2**\"), para. 7.11; Hearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 91:3-20, *referring to* Presentation by Wynne Jones, slide 6.\n\nDirect Examination of Dr Pablo T.

R-165**).\n\n148.\n\nNevertheless, as was held in the Partial Award, reductions in the costs of constructing PV plants stimulated increased investment into such plants and thereby created a legitimate policy issue for the Czech Government, of which the Claimants were aware..32 Specifically, the FiT rate for 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 had been set by the ERO on 18 November 2008,33 prior to a \"sharp decrease\" in the cost of solar panels that began towards the end of 2008.34 The result was a mismatch between the costs upon which the level of investment support offered by the Respondent in the form of the Subsidies had been calculated, and the actual, lower costs of the solar panels experienced in the market, which had the effect of increasing the investors' rate of return, incentivizing a large increase in grid interconnection requests. The Partial Award noted the Respondent's observation that \"the total installed PV capacity in the Czech Republic increased from 754 Megawatts (\"**MW**\") in September 2010 to 1,959 MW by the end of 2010\".35\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 426-428.\n\nEnergy Regulatory Office, Price Decision No. 8/2008 which sets the support of electricity production from renewable energy sources, from the combined production of electricity and heat, and from secondary energy sources, 18 November 2008 (**Ex.

ERO's concerns in 2009**\n-----------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe ERO expressed alarm at the rising number of connection requests for PV plants in mid-2009.40 At the time, the 5% Limit operated to impede the ERO from reducing the FiT to a level commensurate with the costs of PV panels.41\n\n**RWS-Fi\u0159t-1**, paras. 12-13; *see also* Letter from Josef Fi\u0159t to the Minister of Industry and Trade, 1 July 2009 (**Ex.

Now, with a dramatic drop in the price of solar panels, the solar [FiT] suddenly became far more generous than it was ever intended to be, which caused the unsustainable boom\".\n\n151.\n\nIn June 2009, an article was published that recorded the statements of the ERO's chairman that the ERO was planning to reduce the FiT through dealings with the Czech Government, but that such changes would be unlikely in 2009.42 It was also noted that \"solar energy [was] starting to cause some problems for the [S]tate\", which was looking to \"stop [the] power plants boom\".43\n\nR.

In a letter dated 8 September 2009, Mr Josef Fi\u0159t wrote of the \"critical need\" for an amendment of the Act on RES Promotion, based on the \"dramatic situation\" of a rising number of grid connection requests.58 Specifically, Mr Fi\u0159t suggested that approval for connections to the grid had been granted for more than 2000 MW of capacity, a figure that he described as \"particularly alarming\".59\n\nLetter from Josef Fi\u0159t to Old\u0159ich Voji\u0159, 8 September 2009, p. 1 (English translation) (**Ex.

R-295**).\n\n173.\n\nThe Emergency Coordination Committee considered a number of options, taking into account the prevailing socio-economic conditions in the Czech Republic.87 On 13 October 2010, it transmitted to the Czech Parliament draft legislation that would see the State budget contribute to RES financing.88\n\n*See* Transcript of Senate Committee Session, 29 November 2010, p. 2 (**Ex. C-370**).\n\nDraft Act amending the Act on RES Promotion, 13 October 2010 (**Ex. R-268**).\n\n174.\n\nIn addition, at its 15 October 2010 meeting, the Emergency Coordination Committee raised the possibility of \"withholding tax on sales of electricity from photovoltaic power plants\".89 Subsequently, on 2 November 2010, a second draft of this legislation was produced (the \"**November Bill**\"), which involved RES financing from the State budget but also introduced a levy on PV producers.90\n\nMinutes of the third meeting of the Coordination Committee, 15 October 2010 (English translation), p. 3. (**Ex. C-325**).\n\n*See* Resolution of the Economic Committee of the Chamber of Deputies from the 5th Meeting, 2 November 2010 (**Ex. R-269**).\n\n175.\n\nThis levy had been discussed in the media in September 2010.91 However, its place in a legislative instrument was not made public until the November Bill was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 9 November 2010.92 At this point, the media reported that a levy had been included in the then-approved November Bill.93\n\n*See* Peter Vasek, \"We made concessions, but it will not put the budget at risk\", 24 September 2010 (**Ex.

Amendments to the RES Regime**\n-----------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn late 2010 and in 2011, a series of amendments to the Respondent's RES Regime occurred. The Respondent introduced Act No. 346/2010, repealing the Income Tax Holiday and modifying the Original Depreciation Provisions.94 Through a separate act, it introduced the \"solar levy\" (collectively the \"**Measures**\", which together formed the \"**Amended RES Regime**\").95\n\nAct No. 346/2010 (**Ex. C-38**/**R-28**); Partial Award, para. 128.\n\nAct No. 402/2010 (**Ex. C-37**/**R-173**). *See* Explanatory Report on Act No. 330/2010, 15 September 2010 (**Ex. R-172**); Act No. 346/2010 (**Ex. C-38/R-28**); Partial Award, paras. 126-128.\n\n177.\n\nThe solar levy was introduced through Act No. 402/2010 (\"**Act 402/2010**\"), adopted by the Czech Parliament on 14 December 2010 and brought into effect on 1 January 2011 (the \"**Solar Levy**\").96 Applying from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 to revenues generated by PV plants that had been into operation between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010, the Solar Levy had the effect of reducing the payments made to electricity producers on a per MW basis.97 It was set at 26% for payments to solar energy producers under the FiT system and 28% for payments to solar energy producers under the Green Bonuses system.98 Act 402/2010's other effect was, as had been envisioned in earlier draft legislation, to source contributions to RES funding from the Czech State budget.99 This changed the RES Regime from one financed entirely by consumer subsidies (in the form of higher electricity bills) to a hybrid system that combined consumer subsidies with subsidies supplied from the State's budget. It is evident from the Commission's later decision, of 28 November 2016, that this arrangement raised issues of State aid under EU law.100\n\nAct No. 402/2010, Art. VI (**Ex. C-37**/**R-173**).\n\nAct No. 402/2010, s. 7(a) (**Ex. C-37**/**R-173**). *See* Partial Award, para. 126.\n\nPartial Award, para. 126.\n\nAct No. 402/2010, s. 6(a)-(b) (**Ex. C-37/R-173**).\n\nEuropean Commission, \"State Aid SA.40171 (2015/NN) \u2013 Czech Republic: Promotion of electricity production from renewable energy sources\", C(2016) 7827, 28 November 2016 (**Ex. R-367**) (hereinafter the \"**Decision**\").\n\n178.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Solar Levy came \"completely out of the blue\" and was attached to their investments, which were originally guaranteed to the Subsidies, unencumbered, and for a 15- and then 20-year period.101 As such, the introduction of the Solar Levy, the Claimants assert, was criticized by the Commission in light of its \"retroactive character\".102\n\nSubmission, para. 24; Reply, para. 123. *See also* Partial Award, para. 96.\n\nReply, para. 124, *citing* Letter from Ms Hedegaard and Mr Oettinger (European Commissioners) to Mr Kocourek (Czech Minister of Trade and Industry), 1 January 2011 (**Ex. C-337**).\n\n179.\n\nOn 1 January 2011, Act No. 330/2010 also entered into force. It amended Section 3(5) of the Act on RES Promotion and abolished any incentives related to photovoltaic plants with installed output exceeding 30 kilowatt peak (\"**kWp**\") commissioned after 1 March 2011.103\n\nExplanatory Report on Act No. 330/2010, 15 September 2010 (**Ex. R-172**). *See* Partial Award, para. 127.\n\n180.\n\nPartly entering into force upon its publication on 30 May 2012 and partly on 1 January 2013, Act No. 165/2012 repealed further provisions of the Act on RES Promotion (the \"**New RES Act**\"). One such result of the New RES Act was the termination of all contracts between RES producers and grid operators that had provided the former with either the FiT or Green Bonus, taking effect from 31 December 2012.104\n\n*See* Partial Award, para. 129.\n\n181.\n\nThe Solar Levy was extended so as to apply beyond 31 December 2013 through the introduction of Act No. 310/2013 (\"**Act 310/2013**\"),105 which entered into force on 13 September 2013. From 1 January 2014 onwards, however, the Levy itself was reduced to 10% from 26%, and was only applicable to those plants which were commissioned in 2010.106\n\n*See* Partial Award, para. 130.\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 128, 130.\n\n**B. The Claimants and Their Investments**\n------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants in this arbitration are Natland Investment, Natland Group, GIHG, and Radiance. Each Claimant made investments in the RES sector in the Czech Republic through Energy 21.107 In turn, Energy 21 created or purchased shareholdings in SPVs which themselves commissioned and built PV plants in the Czech Republic.108\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 105, 107.\n\nOverview of the solar plants operated by the SPVs (**Ex.

The Claimants and their corporate reorganizations**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nNatland Investment, an entity incorporated in the Netherlands, was, at the relevant times, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Natland Group.109\n\n*See* Energy 21's Structure Diagram, 30 June 2011 (**Ex. C-45**); Claimants' Submission, para. 237.\n\n184.\n\nOn 20 October 2015, Natland Investment was renamed NIG.110 According to Mr Ra\u0161ka, the renaming was a \"mere formality [to] reflec[t] a company policy that 'Natland' explicitly appears only in the name of companies that actively seek new investment opportunities\".111\n\nClaimants' Letter to the Tribunal, 10 May 2021, p. 1, Annex I.\n\nThird Witness Statement of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ra\u0161ka, 16 June 2021 (hereinafter \"**CWS-Ra\u0161ka-3**\"), para. 4.\n\n185.\n\nNatland Group, an entity incorporated in Cyprus in 2009, was itself part of the broader Czech-owned investment group Natland (\"**Natland**\"), whose purpose was to seek out investment opportunities in medium-sized companies.112 Natland's majority shareholder at the relevant times was Mr Ra\u0161ka.113\n\n*See* Partial Award, para. 105.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 175:6-14.\n\n186.\n\nOn 12 April 2016, Natland Group was renamed NGL.114 Thereafter, various steps were taken to dissolve Natland Group, including preparing a draft plan relating to its dissolution on 15 October 2016,115 and issuing a formal resolution approving the restructuring plan on 15 November 2016.116 In early December 2016, Mr Ra\u0161ka approved the plan to reorganize Natland Group, specifically to merge into Capamera, after, it was said, having received oral legal advice that the reorganization would have no impact on this arbitration.117\n\nClaimants' Letter to the Tribunal, 10 May 2021, p. 1, Annexes II and III; Claimants' Letter to the Tribunal, 19 May 2021, p. 2. *See also* Expert Report of Marcos Gregorios Dracos, 26 August 2021 (hereinafter \"**CER-Dracos-1**\"), para. 11.\n\n**CER-Dracos-1**, Order of the District Court of Larnaca, 3 February 2017, Appendix B-5, para.

The Claimants' Investments in Energy 21**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nAround 2008, the Claimants identified the production of electricity from PV plants as \"a favorable investment\" in the Czech Republic.131 According to the Claimants, this was influenced by the RES Regime outlined above, \"the stability promised by the Czech Republic\", and the downward trend in the prices of solar panels.132\n\nPartial Award, para. 106.\n\nPartial Award, para. 106. *See* Statement of Claim, paras. 96-101.\n\n194.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants made their investments in the Czech Republic through Energy 21,133 the parent of which was initially Natland Investment Group B.V. (\"**Natland B.V**.\").134 As discussed in the Partial Award, the Claimants invested in Energy 21 through a succession of equity acquisitions and debt financings, made by individual Claimants, comprising three phases.135\n\nAccording to the Statement of Claim, fn. 56, Energy 21 was set up on 5 March 2007 with the name Sumacon a.s. which was changed to Energy 21 a.s. on 21 April 2007. *See* Witness Statement of Tom\u00e1s Raska, 18 March 2015 (hereinafter \"**CWS- Raska-1**\"), para.11.\n\nNatland B.V. is to be distinguished from the other members of Natland that are party to this arbitration. *See* **CWS- Raska-1**, paras. 10-11.\n\n*See* Partial Award, paras. 110-117.\n\n195.\n\nThe first phase of the Claimants' investment in Energy 21 occurred on 20 May 2008 when GIHG purchased 50% of Energy 21 from Natland B.V.136 On 3 March 2009, GIHG slightly reduced its shareholding by selling a 0.75% stake to Mr Daniel Kunz.137 Subsequently, on 19 August 2009, GIHG sold another 2.5% stake to DCEMF Mezzanine Holdings B.V (\"**DCEMF Mezzanine**\").138 After doing so, GIHG's stake in Energy 21 sat at 46.75%.139\n\nSale and purchase agreement between Natland B.V.

(as seller) and Genus Investment (as buyer), 18 December 2009 (**Ex. C-96**). At the time of this transaction, Natland Investment was instead named Genus Investment N.V. It became Natland Investment on 1 March 2010. *See* Commerce Chamber, History - NATLAND Investment Group N.V., 2 September 2014 (34368681) (**Ex. C-95**). *See also* Partial Award, fn. 76.\n\n197.\n\nIn the course of Energy 21's operation and during some of these various acquisitions, Natland B.V., GIHG, Natland Group and two other entities, Feraton Financial Services B.V. (\"**Feraton**\") and Blando Investments S.A. (\"**Blando**\"), either extended loans to Energy 21 or entered into agreements to assign receivables associated with such loans.141\n\n*See, e.g.,* Submission, para. 37, *referring to* Partial Award, para. 111, Statement of Claim, paras. 123-125; Reply, para. 353.\n\n198.\n\nOn 18 December 2009, the same day as Natland Investment's purchase, Natland Group bought the receivables associated with loans that had been previously granted to Energy 21 by Feraton.142\n\nContract on the transfer of securities between Natland B.V. (as seller) and GIHG (as buyer), 18 December 2009 (**Ex. C-96**).

However, on 3 June 2010, Radiance entered into a s second agreement on the transfer of shares with GIHG, Natland Investment and Energy 21. This was pursuant to and on identical terms as the 11 May 2010 transaction, but was governed by Czech law so as to avoid any doubt as to the validity of the transfers. *See* Agreement for the sale and purchase of shares between Natland Investment and GIHG (as sellers) and Radiance (as buyer), 11 May 2010 governed by English law (**Ex.

The Claimants' Request for Relief**\n----------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn their Submission, the Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to:\n\n(i) compensate Claimants for all losses caused to them as a result of the introduction and the prolongation of the Solar Levy, in an amount of not less than CZK 1,769.8 million (inclusive of pre\u2010award interest), apportioned among Claimants as follows:\n\n\u2022 GIHG **CZK 331.8 million**\n\n\u2022 Natland Group / Natland Investment\n\no **CZK 296.1 million**, in case compensation is paid to Natland Group, or\n\no **CZK 393.2 million** (inclusive of tax gross\u2010up) , in case compensation is paid to Natland Investment\n\n\u2022 Radiance **CZK 1,141.9 million**\n\n(ii) pay to Claimants post\u2010award interest on any amount of damages awarded under (i) above, from the date of the final award until payment of the amounts determined therein at the interest rate of pre\u2010award interest plus 2% , compounded annually; and\n\n(iii) reimburse Claimants for all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, and all other costs of the arbitration, including any expenses arising from the participation of third parties.242\n\nSubmission, para. 252.\n\n242.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to:\n\n(i) compensate Claimants for all losses caused to them as a result of the introduction and the prolongation of the Solar Levy, in an amount of not less than **CZK 1,769.8 million** (inclusive of pre\u2010award interest) , apportioned among Claimants as follows:\n\n\u2022 GIHG **CZK 331.8 million**\n\n\u2022 Natland Group (now Capamera) / Natland Investment (now NIG)\n\no in case compensation is paid to Natland Group (now Capamera) **CZK 296.1 million**, or\n\no in case compensation is paid to Natland Investment (now NIG) **CZK 393.2 million** (if the Tribunal awards tax gross-up), or, in the alternative, **CZK 296.1 million** plus a declaration that the Czech Republic is bound to refund any taxes that Natland Investment will pay in the Netherlands on the compensation awarded to it in the final award,\n\n\u2022 Radiance, **CZK 1,141.9 million**\n\n(ii) pay to Claimants post-award interest on any amount of damages awarded under (i) above, from the date of the final award until the payment of the amounts determined therein at the higher of the following rates: (i) the rate of the pre-award interest plus 2%, or, alternatively (ii) the 10-year yield of the Czech zero-coupon bond on the date of the final award.\n\n(iii) reimburse Claimants for all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, and all other costs of the arbitration, including any expenses arising from the participation of third parties.243\n\nReply, para. 507.\n\n243.\n\nIn their Submission on Costs, the Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to:\n\n(i) reimburse Claimants **Euro 7,825,214.42**, i.e. all costs of the merits phase of this arbitration that culminated in the Partial Award issued on December 20, 2017;\n\n(ii) reimburse Claimants **Euro 1,912,956.59**, i.e. all costs of the quantum phase in the event that Claimants be awarded damages, regardless of their amount and, in any case, at least Euro 99.829,97, as the legal costs they incurred in relation to Respondent's challenge of Mr. Beechey, its *Achmea* Objection, its applications concerning the Funding Agreement, and its objection giving rise to the \"Capamera issue\", as well as the non-legal costs relating to these procedural incidents;\n\n(iii) pay interest compounded annually on any amount awarded to Claimants under (i) and (ii) above, at the rate indicated in para. 507(*ii*) of the Reply \u2013 or at the higher rate that the Tribunal considers more appropriate to reflect the current environment of high and still rising inflation244 \u2013 from December 20, 2017 until full payment for any sum awarded under (i) above, and from the date of the final award until full payment for any sum awarded under (ii) above; and\n\n(iv) reject any request by Respondent to be reimbursed any portion of its costs relating to this arbitration.245\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 35; Reply, para. 503.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 35.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nIn its Response, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n(i) Reject Claimants' requests in respect of Capamera;\n\n(ii) Declare that Claimants are not entitled to any damages; and\n\n(iii) Award to the Czech Republic any additional relief as the Tribunal may consider just and appropriate, including costs, legal fees and expenses, and interest.246\n\nResponse, para. 312.\n\n245.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n(i) Reject Claimants' requests in respect of Capamera;\n\n(ii) Declare that Claimants are not entitled to any damages; and\n\n(iii) Award to the Czech Republic the totality of its costs, legal fees, and expenses, as well as interest thereon; and\n\n(iv) Grant such additional relief as the Tribunal may consider just and appropriate.247\n\nRejoinder, para. 176.\n\n246.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n(i) Reject Claimants' request for the Czech Republic to bear any of their costs, legal fees, or expenses; and\n\n(ii) Order Claimants Natland Investment, G.I.H.G., and Radiance, jointly and severally, to bear, in whole or in appropriate part, the costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the Czech Republic in the arbitration, plus interest at the six-month U.S. Treasury rate (or such other rate as the Tribunal deems appropriate) until the date of payment.248\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 14.\n\n**V. THE CLAIMANTS' ENTITLEMENT TO MONETARY RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Parties concur that the standard of compensation under customary law is that set forth in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case: \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".249\n\nSubmission, para. 67, *citing Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, Claim for Indemnity (The Merits), Permanent Court of International Justice, Judgment of 13 September 1928, PCIJ Series A No. 17 (1928), p. 47 (**Ex. CLA-118**) (hereinafter \"***Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)***\"); Response, para. 65.\n\n248.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree as to whether the Claimants are entitled to monetary relief under the aforementioned standard of full reparation. Notably, the Parties disagree on the following issues, which include the specific issues raised by the Tribunal in the Partial Award and deferred to this phase of the proceedings:\n\n(a) Whether the Claimants have identified any compensable injury;\n\n(b) Whether the Claimants assumed the risk that ultimately could affect the profitability of their investments and, if so, what is the impact of the assumption of that risk on quantum;\n\n(c) Whether the Claimants willfully contributed to the solar boom and, if so, what impact does that have on quantum;\n\n(d) Whether EU State aid law bars the awarding of any compensation to the Claimants;\n\n(e) Whether Natland Group has a claim on the merits that is separate from that of Natland Investment;\n\n(f) Whether Natland Group and Natland Investment are entitled to claim collectively for the same loss;\n\n(g) Whether Natland Investment has made a claim under the Netherlands-Czech BIT that relates to a protected investment; and\n\n(h) What is the effect on quantum, if any, of the Claimant[s] Radiance's wholly-owned subsidiary, E21 Holding B.V., purchasing GIHG's and Natland Investment's remaining shareholdings in Energy 21 (22.50% and 20.08% respectively, or 16.37% and 19.37%, respectively) after the Solar Levy was enacted.\n\n249.\n\nIn addition to these issues, the Parties also disagree on the Claimants' Request to Amend the Case Caption, in order to include Capamera as successor of Natland Group.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Request to Amend the Case Caption, followed by the questions arising by the claims brought by Natland Group and Natland Investment, since these issues determine which entities shall be entitled to reparation following the breach identified in the Partial Award. The Tribunal will then address the Respondent's arguments regarding the alleged lack of identification of a compensable injury, assumption of risks, contributory fault, and EU State aid rules, which the Respondent avers should deprive the Claimants from receiving any compensation.\n\n**A. Whether Capamera is Entitled to Continue Natland Group's Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants seek leave of the Tribunal to amend the case caption to reflect the new name of Natland Group resulting from a merger so as to allow Capamera to pursue the claims in this arbitration originally brought by Natland Group.250 The Claimants, relying on Dr Dracos' Reports, argue that, as a matter of Cypriot law, Capamera became the universal successor of Natland Group and therefore it is entitled to continue the claims of Natland Group in these proceedings.\n\n*See* Section II.E of the Final Award. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 57:15-60:23.\n\n252.\n\nObjecting to the Claimants' request, the Respondent relies on Mr Ioannides' Reports. It argues that Capamera has no standing in this arbitration, given that (i) it is a standalone entity distinct from Natland Group that has not established jurisdiction in its own right; and (ii) the Claimants have not shown that Natland Group's investment treaty claims were transferred to Capamera.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in accordance with investor-State arbitral jurisprudence,251 the effects of the merger at issue must be assessed exclusively under Cypriot law, given that all companies involved in the merger were incorporated in Cyprus.252 Conversely, nothing in the jurisprudence supports the Respondent's position that international law or EU conflict-of laws rules are applicable in the specific context of assignment by way of merger.253\n\n*See* Claimants' letters to the Tribunal, 19 May 2021 and 8 July 2021. *See also* Reply, fn. 542.\n\nReply, paras. 350-351. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 57:19-21.\n\nReply, paras. 352-353. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 58:11-17.\n\n254.\n\nAs explained by Dr Dracos, the Claimants assert that the Court of Larnaka approved the merger pursuant to Sections 198 and 200 of the Cypriot Companies Law, allowing Capamera to acquire all properties of Natland Group, so as to become \"in substance, the 'successor' of Natland Group\".254 The properties acquired by Capamera, the Claimants continue, included Natland Group's treaty claims because, under Cypriot law, causes of action are considered a form of intangible property that can be transferred in a merger.255 In particular, the Claimants note that there was nothing abusive in Natland Group merging with Capamera as the merger was carried out only to reduce costs.256\n\nSubmission, para. 249, *referring to* **CER-Dracos-1**, paras. 12-14, 17-23, 26.\n\nSubmission, para. 249, *citing* **CER-Dracos-1**, paras. 16-23. *See also* Expert Report of Marcos Dracos, 7 February 2022 (hereinafter \"**CER-Dracos-2**\"), para. 5.\n\nSubmission, para. 250. *See also* **CWS-Ra\u0161ka-1**, para. 7.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimants contest the Respondent's interpretation of \"property\" in Section 200 of Cypriot law, which it bases on a judgment of the majority of the House of Lords in 1940.257 Noting that the present circumstances deal with \"a completely different situation, in a completely different world\", the Claimants' expert, Dr Dracos asserts that this \"old precedent [\u2026] [i]f applied in Cyprus [\u2026] would create significant problems in the operation of the merger provisions in Cypriot Companies Law, and run contrary to business realities and business needs\".258\n\nReply, para. 358, *referring to* UK House of Lords, *Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd* [1940] A.C. 1014 (**Ex.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimants' request to amend the case caption on the basis that investor-State jurisprudence prevents Capamera from joining these proceedings as a new party without the Respondent's consent.261 In this respect, the Respondent argues that the issue of standing in this case is governed by international law and that the Claimants have failed to cite any authority that would allow a putative new claimant entity, without proving the jurisdictional prerequisites, unilaterally to add itself as a party to an ongoing investor-State arbitration.262\n\nResponse, para. 195, *referring to* *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 10 March 2014, paras. 228-229 (**Ex. RLA-369**).\n\nResponse, para. 201; Rejoinder, para. 29(b).\n\n258.\n\nEven assuming *arguendo* that Capamera's standing in this arbitration turned exclusively on Cypriot law, the Respondent relies on Mr Ioannides' report to argue that \"Section 200 of the Cypriot Companies Law does not allow for the transfer of property rights which are not as a matter of law transferable or assignable\" and that this provision only concerns those property rights, \"with which the original company has the right to deal without having to obtain the consent of some third party\".263 In fact, the Respondent points out that Dr Dracos, in contradiction to the Claimants' arguments, has twice stated that a Cypriot court would not have jurisdiction to order that Capamera be made a claimant in this case.264\n\nSubmission, para. 200, *citing* Expert Report of Kypros Ioannides, 23 November 2021 (hereinafter \"**RER- Ioannides-1**\"), para. 6(d).\n\nRejoinder, para. 29(f), *referring to* **CER-Dracos-1**, para. 25; **CER-Dracos-2**, para. 38.\n\n259.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent notes that while the question of transferability or assignability of a chose in action in Cyprus is a matter to be determined under the law governing such chose in action, the Claimants' claims in this arbitration are brought under international law by virtue of international treaties and, hence, \"[there is] no reason to believe that Cypriot law governs the [c]laims\".265\n\nResponse, para. 200, *citing* **RER-Ioannides-1**, para. 6(f).\n\n260.\n\nConsequently, for the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of showing that Natland Group transferred its investment treaty claims to Capamera and that Capamera is entitled to continue Natland Group's claims and seek damages.266\n\nRejoinder, para. 29(d).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants' request regarding the case caption to replace \"Natland Group\" with \"Capamera\" should be granted.\n\n262.\n\n*First*, the issue underlying the Claimants' request is one of party succession, not one of admitting a third party into an ongoing arbitration. The Tribunal has not identified any requirement in the applicable treaties, nor in international law broadly considered, establishing that party succession requires consent by a respondent. In consequence, if Capamera is the successor to a party that the Tribunal has already determined was a proper party to the arbitration, it is not necessary for the Respondent to consent to the substitution of Capamera for Natland Group. Capamera would not be adding itself to the arbitration; it would, rather, be carrying on the arbitration to which Natland Group was a proper party. Thus, the key point is whether Capamera can be considered the successor of Natland Group for the purposes of the present case.\n\n263.\n\n*Second*, in the Tribunal's view, the effects of Natland Group's merger into Capamera are principally determined by reference to Cypriot law, since it is the law of the company's place of incorporation. This approach to the applicable law has been applied in many prior cases, for example, by the tribunal in *Noble Energy, Inc. and Machalapower Cia. Ltda. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, where the effects of the merger of Samedan Oil Corporation into the claimant - Noble Energy Inc. - for the purposes of party succession were determined based on the laws of the state of Delaware:\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Delaware law governs the merger and its effects. It follows that the consequences of the merger are that \"Noble Energy succeeded to all of Samedan's rights and obligations under its contracts\" [\u2026]. Section 259(a) of the Delaware General Corporations Law refers to the surviving or resulting company as \"possessing all the rights\" of the merged companies and states that all property \"shall be vested\" in the surviving or resulting company [\u2026].\n\nThe Respondents contend that Ecuador law and the terms of the Investment Agreement govern the consequences of the merger. The Tribunal will revert later to the applicability of the Investment Agreement. At this juncture, with respect to the applicable national law, it agrees with the Claimants that Delaware law governs the validity and effects of the merger between Samedan Oil Corporation and Noble Energy, both being companies incorporated under the laws of Delaware.\n\nOn the basis of the certificate of ownership and merger of 17 December 2002 [\u2026], the Tribunal is satisfied that Samedan Oil Corporation was merged into Noble Energy and that Noble Energy is the surviving entity of the merger, it being understood that \"all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises, and every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually the property of the surviving [\u2026] corporation\" and that \"all debts, liabilities and duties of the respective constituent corporation shall thenceforth attach to said surviving [\u2026] corporation [\u2026]. In other words, Noble Energy has absorbed Samedan Oil Corporation and succeeded to all its rights and obligations.267\n\n*Noble Energy, Inc. and Machalapower Cia. Ltda. v. The Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, ICISD Case No. ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 87-89 (**Ex. RLA-16**).\n\n264.\n\n*Third*, Mr Dracos and Mr Ioannides agree that universal succession does not exist under Cypriot law.268 Nonetheless, in the Tribunal's view, the terms of the merger in the present case did include Natland Group's claim in the present arbitration.\n\n**CER-Dracos-1**, fn. 14; **RER-Ioannides-1**, para. 8.2.\n\n265.\n\nNatland Group's merger into Capamera was approved by the District Court of Larnaka on 3 February 2017.269 The terms of the merger were established in the Draft Terms of the Merger dated 15 October 2016, which state as follows:\n\nFrom an accounting point of view, all the actions of the Absorved Companies which are carried out on behalf of the Transfer Company as of 1st January 2017 will be considered as actions of the Transfer Company CAPAMERA LTD.\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the Absorbed Companies will be transferred to the Transfer Company CAPAMERA LTD.270\n\n**CER-Dracos-1**, Appendix B-5, Cypriot Order.\n\n**CER-Dracos-1**, Appendix B-5, Order Exhibit B.\n\n266.\n\nMr Dracos has opined that, by virtue of section 200 of the Cypriot Companies Law, the property transferred from Natland Group to Capamera included the claims in this proceeding, as a type of intangible property.271 On the other hand, Mr Ioannides has explained that the transfer of all property cannot include \"property rights which were not as a matter of law, transferable or assignable\",272 although he took no view on whether Natland Group's treaty claims fall within such a category of rights under international investment law.273\n\n**CER-Dracos-1**, para. 15.\n\n**RER-Ioannides-1**, para. 10.13(c).\n\n**RER-Ioannides-1**, para. 10.22.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and Mr Ioannides that the transferability of the treaty claims is subject to international law. On the facts of the present case and the submissions presented by the Parties, however, the Tribunal cannot identify a rule of public international law that would restrain the assumption of an established treaty claim by an entity which has merged with the party which previously held such claim in accordance with applicable municipal law.\n\n268.\n\nConsequently, it is the Tribunal's view that, since, to use the Larnaka District Court's phrasing, all assets and liabilities of Natland Group having been transferred to Capamera, such transfer validly includes the former's treaty claims. Therefore, Capamera shall be considered as Natland Group's successor for the purposes of the present arbitration.\n\n269.\n\nAlthough this finding upholds Capamera's substitution of Natland Group, before moving on to other matters, the Tribunal considers it necessary to express its disapproval of the way in which the Claimants handled the Capamera issue. Although Natland Group approved the plan to restructure on 15 November 2016, and the merger was approved on 7 February 2017, the Claimants did not disclose this fact until May 2021. Notably, Mr Ra\u0161ka, who had testified that Natland Group was still existent in his Second Statement dated 4 May 2016,274 failed to update the Tribunal on the matter in the hearing held in March 2017, a month after the merger was effected. This should have been disclosed openly to the Tribunal and to the Respondent. It was not, and as a result it caused unnecessary complications in the current phase of the proceeding. As explained in paragraph 732 below, this fact has been taken into account by the Tribunal when deciding the allocation of the costs of the arbitration.\n\nWitness Statement of Thomas Ra\u0161ka, 4 May 2016, para. 18.\n\n**B. Claims Brought by Natland Group and Natland Investment**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Partial Award deferred to this phase of the proceedings the determination of:\n\n(a) whether Natland Group has a claim on the merits that is separate from that of Natland Investment;275\n\n(b) whether Natland Group and Natland Investment are entitled to claim collectively for the same loss;276 and\n\n(c) whether Natland Investment has made a claim under the Netherlands-Czech BIT that relates to a protected investment (i.e., Energy 21).277\n\nPartial Award, para. 241.\n\nPartial Award, para. 241.\n\nPartial Award, paras. 241, 266.\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants answer each question in the affirmative. The Respondent disagrees.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Natland Investment and Natland Group are entitled to pursue independent investment treaty claims with regard to the same investment comprising the 20.08% interest in Energy 21, \"which, as at 1 January 2011, was directly held by Natland Investment and indirectly held by Natland Group via its wholly owned subsidiary Natland Investment\".278 According to the Claimants, this is permitted under the ECT and the BITs, which recognize shareholdings in a company as a form of protected investment.279 The Claimants further note that it is well established under international investment law that shareholders generally have standing to bring claims for damages arising from measures that affect the local companies in which they hold a direct or indirect interest.280\n\nSubmission, para. 237.\n\nSubmission, para. 238, *referring to* ECT, Art. 1(6)(b); Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 1(a)(ii); Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 1(1)(b).\n\nSubmission, paras. 238-239; Reply para. 297.\n\n273.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent's assertion that only Natland Group may claim damages is incompatible with the fact that Natland Group's qualifying investment consists, *inter alia*, of its indirect shareholding in Energy 21, and not of its direct shareholding in Natland Investment.281 In any event, the Claimants consider that the Respondent's objection has no practical significance, given that the damages would come out the same, even if the claim only concerned Natland Group's shareholding in Natland Investment.282\n\nSubmission, para. 240.\n\nSubmission, para. 240.\n\n274.\n\nThat said, the Claimants submit that Natland Group and Natland Investment \"do not intend to abuse the ISDS system\" and therefore \"accept that compensation in respect of their (then) 20.08% interest in Energy 21 will be paid only to one of them\" in order to avoid double recovery.283\n\nSubmission, para. 241; Reply para. 298.\n\n275.\n\nAs to the Tribunal's question whether Natland Investment made a claim under the Netherlands-Czech BIT that relates to a protected investment (i.e., Energy 21), the Claimants clarify that Natland Investment's substantive claims in this arbitration have consistently concerned the loss it suffered due to its \"direct\" shareholding in Energy 21, which the Tribunal has already found to be protected under the Netherlands-Czech BIT.284 Such position, the Claimants note, is also consistent with Mr Edwards' damages calculation, which is based on the diminution of the fair market value of the Claimants' investments in Energy 21 caused by the imposition of the Solar Levy.285\n\nSubmission, para. 243; Reply, para. 302, *referring to* Partial Award, paras. 266, 437, 508(f). *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 61:14-23.\n\nReply, para. 304. *See also* Expert Report of Richard Edwards, 1 September 2021 (hereinafter \"**CER-Edwards-1**\"), para. 1.39. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 62:4-7.\n\n276.\n\nConsequently, for the Claimants, \"the only issue that remains to be decided in this phase of the arbitration is the quantification of the damage suffered by Natland Investment's 'direct' investment in Energy 21\", because of the imposition of the Solar Levy, which the Tribunal has found to be a breach of the FET standard under the Netherlands-Czech BIT.286\n\nReply, paras. 302-303, 305, *referring to* Partial Award, paras. 437, 508(f).\n\n277.\n\nLastly, rejecting the Respondent's argument that Natland Investment is not entitled to damages, because the Solar Levy had an impact only on the PV plants, which are not protected under the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, the Claimants contend that Natland Investment would in any event be entitled to recover damages under the ECT, which protects both \"direct\" and \"indirect\" investments.287 The Claimants further assert that the Solar Levy \"severely impaired Energy 21's value, and in turn Natland Investment's shareholding in Energy 21, which \u2013 as the Tribunal found \u2013 is a 'protected investment' under Article 1(a) of the Netherlands BIT\".288 Given that Natland Investment is not requesting compensation in respect of \"investments and expenses incurred by entities over which there is no jurisdiction\", the Claimants consider the present case distinguishable from *PSEG v. Turkey*.289\n\nReply, paras. 306-308. *See also* Partial Award, para. 508(d).\n\nReply, para. 309.\n\nReply, paras. 310-311, *citing* *PSEG Global, Inc., And Konya Ingin Electrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award, 19 January 2007, para. 325 (**Ex. CLA-29**) (hereinafter \"***PSEG Global v. Turkey, Award***\").\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal cannot award compensation to Natland Group, because Natland Group and Natland Investment are advancing identical claims despite being two entities with two separate investments.290\n\nResponse, para. 172.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the \"proposed solution\", namely that the two Natland entities bring one claim collectively, is also untenable, since Natland Group no longer exists.291 In this respect, the Respondent emphasizes that while Mr Ra\u0161ka could have left Natland Group intact for a *de minimus* sum (at an annual cost of EUR 350), he chose voluntarily to dissolve Natland Group and revealed this information only in May 2021, over four years after the Cypriot court approved the restructuring.292\n\nResponse, para. 173.\n\nResponse, paras. 177-179, Figure 9.\n\n280.\n\nMoreover, considering that Mr Ra\u0161ka\u2014a Czech national\u2014was able to bring claims in this arbitration by relying only on Natland Group's place of incorporation and its \"permanent seat\" in Cyprus,293 the Respondent avers that \"it is inappropriate for [the] Claimants to argue at this stage that a corporate reality such as the non-existence of Natland Group should be ignored\".294 Instead, the choices made by Mr Ra\u0161ka should \"carry consequences\".\n\nResponse, paras. 174-176.\n\nRejoinder, para. 30.\n\n281.\n\nFinally, the Respondent posits that the Claimants have failed to show that Natland Investment's damages claims are related to the Energy 21 shares, which it owned directly, and are not based on alleged harm to an asset, like the SPVs and the PV plants, which it held indirectly through Energy 21.295 In this respect, the Respondent points out that Mr Edwards' damages model analyzes the alleged impact of the Solar Levy on \"the PV plants' cash flows\", i.e., on the cash flows of assets that the Tribunal has deemed to not qualify as \"investments\".296\n\nResponse, para. 163; Rejoinder, para. 26.\n\nResponse, para. 163, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 3.7.\n\n282.\n\nThe Respondent further takes issue with the Claimants' decision to insist on the claims based on the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT if Natland Investment would nonetheless be entitled to recover the same damages under the ECT as the Claimants submit.297\n\nRejoinder, para. 27.\n\n283.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, *PSEG v. Turkey* is instructive, because the tribunal rejected the claimant's damages claim on the grounds that it \"w[ould] not undo with one hand what it did with the other\".298 As the Tribunal has already determined that the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT does not protect any Czech assets that a Dutch entity owns through a Czech intermediary, the Respondent argues that an alleged injury to assets like the PV plants and the Czech SPVs cannot be the subject of a damages claim by Natland Investment.299 After all, one of the \"most basic rules in investor-State arbitration is that '[t]he claim must relate to the claimant's investment, and not someone else's investment'\".300\n\nResponse, para. 164, *citing* *PSEG Global v. Turkey*, Award, para. 325 (**Ex. CLA-29**).\n\nResponse, para. 164.\n\nRejoinder, para. 25, *citing* Z. Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims, p. 248 (**Ex. RLA-3**).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent's argument regarding Natland Investment's claims in relation to a protected investment and the possibility for it to posit a claim in conjunction with Natland Group's claim to be unfounded.\n\n285.\n\nThe Partial Award granted (i) \"[t]he Claimants' claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty\"; (ii) \"Natland Group's claims that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty\"; and, (iii) Natland Investment's claim that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic Bilateral Investment Treaty.301\n\nPartial Award, para. 508.\n\n286.\n\nThis decision, which is *res judicata*, was made considering that the Claimants' investment in the Czech Republic was made through Energy 21.302\n\nPartial Award, para. 107; Statement of Claim, para. 103.\n\n287.\n\nRegarding the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, the Respondent challenged the Tribunal's jurisdiction, arguing that Natland Investment had failed to make an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 1(a), which defines \"investments\" as \"every kind of asset invested either directly or through an investor of a third State\".303 However, the Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction by stating the following:\n\n266. However, this is not the end of the matter in the present case. The Tribunal notes that according to Article 1(a)(ii) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, the term \"investments\" \"shall comprise every kind of asset invested either directly or indirectly through an investor of a third State and more particularly, though not exclusively \u2026 shares \u2026 and other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures, as rights derived therefrom.\" It is undisputed that Natland Investment, an entity incorporated in the Netherlands, was during the relevant period a shareholder in Energy 21, a legal entity incorporated in the Czech Republic. It would therefore appear to be indisputable, and the Tribunal finds, that Natland Investment has made an \"investment\" in the Czech Republic through its shareholding in Energy 21. For purposes of this determination, it does not matter whether Natland Investment's substantive claims in this arbitration are for compensation for damage sustained by Energy 21, or for damage sustained by the SPVs in which Energy 21 held shares, or for damage to the assets held by the SPVs. This is a matter for the merits, not for jurisdiction, and the Tribunal therefore defers the determination of whether Natland Investment has made a claim that relates to a protected investment (i.e., Energy 21) to the merits, specifically quantum.304\n\nPartial Award, para. 260.\n\nPartial Award, para. 266.\n\n288.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal's understanding that the Claimants' protected investment is composed by their shareholding in Energy 21 is also *res judicata*. What has been left open for this phase of the proceedings in this regard is the determination of whether Natland Investment's claim is effectively related to this protected investment.\n\n289.\n\nIn response to this question, the Claimants maintain that their \"substantive claim in this arbitration is for damages inflicted to its interest in Energy 21\".305 As such, the report prepared by their quantum expert, Mr Edwards, contains an instruction \"to assess the Claimants' losses from the diminution in the fair market value [\u2026] of their investments in Energy 21 caused by the imposition of the [Solar Levy]\".306 The methodology used by Mr Edwards then focuses on the enterprise value of the SPVs, considering that it is reflected on the equity value of Energy 21.307\n\nSubmission, para. 244.\n\nSubmission, para. 244, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 1.39.\n\nSubmission, para. 244, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 1.49.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent, however, asserts that there is no evidence to support the relation between Natland Investment's claim and the protected investment under the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT. In the Respondent's view, Mr Edwards' damages model does not refer to a protected investment, because it revolves around the alleged impact of the Solar Levy on the PV plants' cash flows, which do not qualify as \"investments\".308\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, para. 3.7.\n\n291.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Tribunal considers and concludes that the Claimants' allegation that Natland Investment's claims substantively refer to its shareholding in Energy 21 should be sufficient to consider that its claim is related to a protected investment, which is precisely the shareholding in Energy 21. That is all the more so, considering that one of the possibilities of calculating the impact on this investment is through its main assets, as the Claimants have proposed:\n\n3.7 I understand that it it's the Claimants' case that the First and Second Solar Levies affected the cash flows that the PV plants were expected to generate. It follows that the impact of the levies on the cash flows generated by the PV plants will be reflected in the value of the PV plants and (in full) in the value of the Energy 21 SPVs which own the plants. This impact will, through its 100% ownership of the SPVs be reflected (in full) in the value of Energy 21 and, therefore, in the value of the Claimant's investments in Energy 21 in proportion to their respective shareholdings.309\n\nResponse, para. 163, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 3.7.\n\n292.\n\nA different matter, discussed in Section VII, is whether the Claimants' assertions and methodology sufficiently prove the damages claimed to have been inflicted on their protected investment, their shareholding in Energy 21.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the issues brought forth on *PSEG v. Turkey*. In that case, the tribunal first dismissed the claims brought by one of the claimants for lack of jurisdiction.310 Nonetheless, another claimant continued to claim damages in relation to events affecting the entity over which jurisdiction was rejected, with the result that it was no longer a party.311 Accordingly, the *PSEG v. Turkey* tribunal rejected the possibility of awarding compensation \"in respect of investments or expenses incurred by entities over which there is no jurisdiction\".312\n\n*PSEG Global Inc., The North American Coal Corporation, and Konya Ilgin Elektrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketiv. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 June 2004, paras. 188-194, (**Ex**.**CLA-282**).\n\n*PSEG Global v. Turkey*, Award, para. 322 **(Ex. CLA-29**).\n\n*PSEG Global v. Turkey*, Award, para. 325 **(Ex. CLA-29**).\n\n294.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal finds that Natland Investment's claims are, in fact, related to their protected investment, their shareholding in Energy 21. The Tribunal has not found that it lacks jurisdiction over Natland Investment's claims. Thus, the present case stands on a different factual footing from that of the *PSEG v. Turkey* case.\n\n295.\n\nRegarding Natland Investment and Natland Group, during the first phase of the proceedings, the Respondent also contested the Tribunal's jurisdiction by stating that \"Natland Group in any event cannot assert claims based on the same interest as its subsidiary Natland Investment, except if it makes a claim for loss of value of its subsidiary. However, Natland Group has not made any such claim\".313\n\nPartial Award, para. 238.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction, considering that the issue raised was a matter related to quantum and not to jurisdiction, and deferred the decision to this phase:\n\n241. Finally, as to the Respondent's argument that Natland Group cannot claim for the same loss as Natland Investment, the Tribunal considers that the issue is not one of standing but rather a question of whether the Natland Group has a claim on the merits that is separate from that of Natland Investment, and whether Natland Group and Natland Investment are entitled to claim collectively for the same loss. The Tribunal considers that this issue is closely linked to the merits and will therefore consider it on the merits, specifically quantum.314\n\nPartial Award, para. 241.\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Natland Investment and Natland Group are entitled to pursue independent claims in respect of the same 20.8% interest in Energy 21. The reason would be that such share was directly held by Natland Investment and indirectly by Natland Group, precisely via Natland Investment.315\n\nSubmission, paras. 237-239.\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it would be impossible to advance two identical claims over different investments.316\n\nResponse, para. 172.\n\n299.\n\nAs explained above, the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims is derived from their shareholding in Energy 21. This shareholding, was, as of 1 January 2011, directly owned by Natland Investment and, as such, qualifies as a direct investment under the ECT317 and the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT.318\n\nNetherlands-Czech Republic BIT, Article 1(a)(ii).\n\nECT, Article 1(6)(b).\n\n300.\n\nDuring this period, Natland Investment was also wholly owned by Natland Group. This means that Natland Group was also the owner of the shareholding in Energy 21 that Natland Investment possessed, but in an indirect manner. The Tribunal notes that this ownership also qualifies as an \"investment\" under the ECT319 and the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT.320 In fact, the Tribunal has upheld its jurisdiction over Natland Group's claim considering that the investment consists of the shareholding in Energy 21.\n\nECT, Article 1(6)(b).\n\nCyprus-Czech Republic BIT, Article 1(1)(b).\n\n301.\n\nIn this sense, the issue left open by the Partial Award is whether Natland Investment's and Natland Group's claims differ in terms of damages, and whether they can claim them collectively.\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in order to answer this question, three distinctions should be made. *First*, as a matter of fact, if there is an economic loss suffered by Energy 21, both Natland Investment and Natland Group would see it reflected in their respective balance sheets, in one case directly, and in the other, indirectly. Both would have suffered the same or similar damages as a consequence of the same action, in this case, as a consequence of the Respondent's breach of the fair and equitable treatment.\n\n303.\n\n*Second*, as a matter of law, each entity has a right to claim for such damages, even under different legal treaties, as is the case here. Natland Investment has a right to claim the damages suffered under the ECT and the Netherland-Czech Republic BIT. Natland Group has a right to claim the damages suffered under the ECT and the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT.\n\n304.\n\n*Third*, however, as a matter of enforcement, since Natland Investment is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Natland Group, any payment received by Natland Investment would also benefit Natland Group. The Claimants are not allowed to receive double recovery and the fact that they are pursuing claims in relation to the same shareholding in Energy 21 means that, should any compensation be ordered for the offending measure's impact on this investment, the Respondent would only need to pay the compensation ordered to one of them. This has been explicitly recognized by the Claimants.321\n\nSubmission, para. 241.\n\n305.\n\nThat being the case, the Tribunal considers it best to establish that the payment be made to only one of the entities. In doing so, the Tribunal takes into consideration that (i) it has already determined that both companies' investment is comprised of their shareholding in Energy 21 and that (ii) according to Claimants, should the compensation be paid entirely to Natland Group (now Capamera), there would be no need for a tax gross up322 (discussed in Section VII.F.2). Consequently, the Tribunal will order that the payment be made in favor of Natland Group (now Capamera).\n\nSubmission, para. 168.\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent has also questioned Natland Group's grounds over the fact that this enterprise no longer exists.323 The Tribunal considers that this objection was already answered in Section V.A.3 above, which dealt with the question whether Capamera is entitled to continue Natland Group's claims.\n\nResponse, para. 179.\n\n**C. Whether the Claimants Have Identified Any Compensable Injury**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they are entitled to damages, because the Solar Levy decreased the value of Energy 21 by reducing the cash flows generated by the PV plants. By contrast, the Respondent argues that the reduction in cash flows caused by the Solar Levy cannot be construed as a compensable injury in light of the Tribunal's findings in the Partial Award.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they are entitled to compensation because the Solar Levy decreased the value of Energy 21 by (i) reducing the PV plants' cash flows; and (ii) increasing the perception of risk associated with the Czech PV market.324 In this respect, the Claimants reject the Respondent's arguments that the Claimants contributed to the solar boom and that the Solar Levy was \"a reasonable and appropriately tailored response\" to the problems created by the solar boom.325 The Respondent's position, the Claimants argue, is irreconcilable with the Tribunal's \"unquestionabl[e]\" finding that the Solar Levy was an unlawful measure in breach of the FET standard and with the Tribunal's request that the Parties present a valuation model that \"segregate[s] the impact of the Solar Levy\".326\n\n*See* Submission, para. 158.\n\nReply, para. 313, *citing* Response, para. 64.\n\nReply, paras. 314, 316-317, *citing* Partial Award, para. 504.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimants also take issue with the Respondent's understanding of the principle of full reparation, namely that the Tribunal needs to assess what would have happened if the unlawful measure (i.e., Solar Levy) had not been enacted.327 In the Claimants' view, while reparation is due only to the extent necessary to \"reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed\", this does not call for speculation as to alternative courses of action the Respondent might have followed had it not adopted the Solar Levy or whether any hypothetical actions by the Czech Republic would have affected the investors' investment in a way similar to the Solar Levy.328 In particular, the phrase \"in all probability\", the Claimants submit, requires a probabilistic assessment of damages and \"the use of an ex ante or ex post approach to valuation\".329\n\nReply, para. 319.\n\nReply, paras. 320-321, *citing* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, p. 47 (**Ex. CLA-118**).\n\nReply, para. 321.\n\n310.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants posit that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that it would have enacted \"corrective measures\" to address the solar boom.330 Moreover, while it must be assumed that the Respondent would have enacted lawful measures to counter the solar boom had it not imposed the Solar Levy, the fact that measures of that kind could have been adopted, in the Claimants' view, does not justify any hypothetical reduction to the Claimants' damages.331 Even if the Respondent could not have enacted any lawful measures that would include reducing the FiT, the Claimants argue that this too would have violated Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion that guarantees a fixed FiT level.332\n\nReply, para. 322.\n\nReply, para. 323.\n\nReply, paras. 324, 327.\n\n311.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the cases cited by the Respondent in which the tribunals considered a but-for scenario of the State adopting alternative corrective measures to reduce subsidies, are distinguishable from the present case, given that (i) the Tribunal in the Partial Award has determined that the Act on RES Promotion guaranteed a stable FiT level, rather than a reasonable rate of return, and that the Respondent is liable for having violated that guarantee; (ii) it was not \"inevitable\" that the Claimants would be called to bear the financial burden of the support they would be receiving under the Act on RES Promotion; and (iii) the crisis which led the State to adopt measures is not comparable to the situation in which the Czech Republic adopted the Solar Levy.333\n\nReply, paras. 324-326, *citing* *Hydro Energy v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nRecalling the Partial Award's findings that the reduction in the level of RES support was \"a reasonable and appropriately tailored response to the problems that the solar boom had created\", to which the Claimants had contributed,334 the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that the Solar Levy decreased the value of Energy 21 by (i) reducing cash flows to the PV plants that Energy 21 owned indirectly; or (ii) creating a purportedly higher perception of risk.335 The Respondent concludes that the reduction in cash flows as a result of the Solar Levy cannot be construed as an injury for which any compensation is due.336\n\nResponse, para. 64, *citing* Partial Award, para. 451; Rejoinder, para. 35.\n\nResponse, para. 63.\n\nResponse, para. 64.\n\n313.\n\n*First*, relying on the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision*,* as well as other decisions of investment tribunals, the Respondent submits that reparation under the international standard is due only to the extent necessary to \"re-establish the situation which would, *in all probability*, have existed if the [unlawful State] act had not been committed\" which, in the Respondent's view, means that the Tribunal must assess the situation if the Solar Levy had not been enacted.337 Therefore, the Respondent contends that situations in which the State would have enacted different corrective measures that would have reduced the level of cash flows to the Claimants' PV plants in the same or similar ways as the Solar Levy must be taken into account.338\n\nResponse, paras. 65-68, *citing* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent's argument that there is no compensable injury to be unfounded.\n\n318.\n\n*First*, both Parties agree, as is widely accepted in international law, that damages resulting from a breach such as that found by the Partial Award should be determined based on the principle of full reparation.349 Using the terms of the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, this means that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".350\n\nSubmission, para. 67; Response, para. 65.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, p. 47 (**Ex. CLA-118**).\n\n319.\n\n*Second*, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that assessing the situation which would have existed \"in all probability\", had the Solar Levy not been enacted, is not an invitation to speculate about alternative legitimate measures the Respondent might have adopted to counter the effects of the solar boom.351 The Tribunal also agrees with the Claimants that such but-for scenario should be one in which the Respondent adopted lawful measures. That is, measures that would not have violated the commitment embedded in Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion.352\n\nReply, para. 321.\n\nReply, para. 323.\n\n320.\n\n*Third,* such speculation is not needed in the present case. The Partial Award already established that there was only one exception under which the minimum level of revenue that the Respondent undertook to guarantee could be legitimately reduced. That is, the \"review and control under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission\":\n\n419. The Tribunal concludes that Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion amounts to an intrinsic guarantee of stability, in terms of both the level of support and the time period over which the guarantee is intended to be in force. It also cannot be seriously disputed that the stability of the regulatory framework is one of the elements governed by the FET obligation in Article 10 of the ECT; indeed, Article 10 specifically mentions stability as one of the relevant elements, providing that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.\" In the present case, the Respondent not only had an obligation under Article 10 of the ECT to \"encourage and create stable \u2026 conditions for Investors\" **it specifically undertook to guarantee a minimum level of revenue for a period of fifteen, later twenty years, subject only to review and control under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission**.353\n\nPartial Award, para. 419 [emphasis added].\n\n321.\n\nAs shall be seen, the Partial Award's recognition of the European Commission's role to \"review and control\" State aid assumes importance when applying the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case's \"in all probability\" analysis. The Tribunal rejects various of the Respondent's arguments aimed at reducing or even eliminating an award of damages, but it has accepted the assertion that there was a legitimate policy issue facing the Czech Republic as to the continued sustainability of the PV segment of the RES sector. Of particular relevance to the present analysis is the fact that the evidence shows that the Respondent concluded that the regime could not continue in its then-present state without recourse to State financial resources. It follows that in the but-for scenario, the required direct State aid would increase the likelihood of the Commission exercising its review and control function (as indeed it did when the revised RES regime was notified to it). Accordingly, in the present phase of the proceeding, the Tribunal must consider whether, based on the evidence available, a reduction of the PV plants' cash flows would still have happened \"in all probability\", by virtue of the \"review and control under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission\". This is consistent with paragraph 505 of the Partial Award, where the Tribunal indicated that \"the relevance of the EU State aid rules and of the Commission's decisions, to the extent not already addressed above, will also be addressed\" in the current stage.354\n\nPartial Award, para. 505. The Tribunal has not found it necessary to decide the much-contested point as to whether EU State aid law forms part of the applicable law for the purposes of this arbitration or whether EU rules on State aid and the Commission's enforcement thereof is simply part of the factual matrix of the case. In the Tribunal's view, any EU investor making an investment in another EU country must be taken to be aware of the possibility of EC intervention in any incentive regime such as the Czech Republic's RES regime. In that respect, the State aid issue must be taken into consideration in the but-for analysis.\n\n322.\n\n*Fourth*, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's view that the PV plants' cash flows would have been reduced in the but-for scenario due to the levels of revenue deemed acceptable to the Commission under EU State aid rules, as explained in detail in Section V.F.3 below. However, the Tribunal does not share the Respondent's view that the application of State aid rules \"would have reasonably and proportionately reduced the level of cash flows to Claimants' PV plants in the same or similar ways as the Solar Levy\".355\n\nResponse, para. 70.\n\n323.\n\nAs explained in greater depth in Section VII.F.1 below, the evidence on the record shows that a reduction of the PV plants' cash flows under EU State aid rules would not have had the same effect as the Solar Levy. Consequently, in the but-for scenario, the lower cash flows are a compensable injury, albeit not one of the magnitude argued by the Claimants. EU State aid rules as applied by the Commission thus affect the quantum of the monetary relief owed to the Claimants, but not the Claimants' entitlement to such relief *per se.*\n\n324.\n\nAs to the alleged increase in the perception of risk following the imposition of the Solar Levy, the Tribunal considers the risk of losing the benefits of the RES scheme already existed, given that the level of revenue of the PV plants could have been reduced by virtue of EU State aid rules. This point is also explained in greater detail in Section V.F.3 below.\n\n**D. Assumption of Risks**\n--------------------------\n\n325.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal held that:\n\n(a) section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion contains an \"intrinsic stabilization guarantee\", which includes \"the stability of the regulatory framework\";356\n\n(b) the Claimants \"could thus continue to rely on Section 6(1)(a)(2) and to legitimately expect that the investments they would be making in 2009 and 2010 would be entitled to the level of the RES support fixed by ERO for these two years\", notwithstanding \"the fact that the Claimants were aware, as of summer 2009, that the solar boom was creating a policy issue for the Government that would likely lead to changes in the FiT\";357 and\n\n(c) the imposition of the Solar Levy was a breach of this guarantee in violation of the Respondent's FET obligations in Article 10 of the ECT.358\n\nPartial Award, paras. 416, 419.\n\nPartial Award, para. 427.\n\nPartial Award, para. 428.\n\n326.\n\nThe Tribunal however deferred to this phase of the proceedings the issue of:\n\nwhether the fact that a great bulk of the Claimants' total installed photovoltaic electricity generation capacity was installed in 2009 and 2010, when the \"solar boom\" was already emerging as a legitimate policy issue in the Czech Republic, has any impact on the Claimants' claims, in relation to quantum.359\n\nPartial Award, para. 505. *See also* Partial Award, para. 428.\n\n327.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Tribunal's question above relates to risk allocation, \"specifically on whether Claimants' damages should be reduced to account for hypothetical adverse regulatory risk that Claimants perceived at the time of their decisions to invest in the Czech Republic\".360 In this regard, the Claimants submit that their damages should not be reduced, because (i) as a matter of law, the Claimants should not bear the risk of the Respondent's unlawful actions; and (ii) in any event, they did not perceive any significant regulatory risk at the time of their investments.\n\nSubmission, para. 203.\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees, arguing that the Claimants must have perceived and must bear the risk that (i) the Czech Republic would enact certain measures to address the consequence of the solar boom; and (ii) such a measure could affect the revenues of the Claimants' PV plants.\n\n329.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to account for the risk of regulatory changes that the Claimants could have perceived affecting their PV plants, the Parties concur that the Tribunal would need to determine the following dates:\n\n(a) the \"cut-off date\" the Claimants are deemed to have known the serious consequences of the solar boom and thus assumed the risk of potential regulatory changes that could affect their PV plants;\n\n(b) the date at which the Claimants assumed the risk of regulatory changes with respect each of the Claimants' PV plants; and\n\n(c) the impact on quantum of excluding from damages assessment the plants with respect to which the Claimants are deemed to have assumed the risk.361\n\nResponse, para. 251; Reply, para. 133.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their damages should not be reduced on the basis that the Claimants assumed the risk of a material regulatory change that could impact the profitability of the PV plants for the following two reasons: (i) the Claimants should not bear the risk for the Respondent's unlawful act, such as the Solar Levy; and (ii) in any event, the Claimants' investments in the Czech PV market were the product of sound business judgments after conducting appropriate due diligence.362\n\nSubmission, para. 204; Reply, para. 99.\n\n**(a) The Claimants must not bear the risk of the Respondent's unlawful act**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nAs a matter of international law, the Claimants argue that they cannot be made to bear the risk of an illegal measure enacted by the Respondent by reducing their damages to account for that risk.363 As observed by other investment tribunals, any reduction in damages in this regard, the Claimants submit, would violate the principle of full reparation because damages would not \"as far as possible wipe out all the consequences\" of the Solar Levy.364\n\nSubmission, paras. 205-206; Reply, para. 105. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 9:20-10:4, 15:18-20, 17:19-20:18.\n\nSubmission, paras. 206-208, *citing* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

Reply, paras. 114-115.\n\n336.\n\nIn respect of the timing of risk assessment, the Claimants submit that the perception of risk must be assessed at the time of the Claimants' acquisition of shareholdings in Energy 21, and granting of financing to it, because those shareholdings and financing qualify as protected investments under the applicable treaties.372 As such, the Claimants consider that the relevant dates for the assessment of risk perception are: (i) 20 May 2008 for GIHG; (ii) 18 December 2009 for Natland Investment and Natland Group; and (iii) 11 May 2010 for Radiance.373\n\nReply, para. 117.\n\nReply, para. 119.\n\n337.\n\nConversely, the Claimants reject the Respondent's focus on the timing of Energy 21's PV projects on the grounds that (i) the Claimants' investments in Energy 21 were made in reliance on the guarantee of the fixed FiT set out in Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion, which was \"intended to provide the requisite business certainty to investors precisely as to the future developments of their RES projects\"; and (ii) the legal framework applicable to PV plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010 did not change between the Claimants' investments in Energy 21 until the completion of all PV projects relevant to this dispute.374\n\nReply, para. 118.\n\n338.\n\nRecalling the Partial Award's finding that \"until the fall of 2010, there was no indication that the impending regulatory changes would affect plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010\", the Claimants contend that the risk of retrospective changes to the regulations was not foreseeable to each Claimant at the relevant dates identified above.375\n\nSubmission, paras. 212-214, *citing* Partial Award, para. 426;

Cut-off dates\n----------------\n\n343.\n\nAmong the four cut-off dates proposed by the Respondent, the Claimants argue that only the date on which the Czech Government approved Act 402/2010 and introduced the Solar Levy (i.e., 9 November 2010) faithfully represents the moment when they could have perceived a risk of exposure to adverse regulatory changes that would affect their PV plants.387 For the Claimants, the 9 November 2010 cut-off date is the only date which accords with the Partial Award's conclusion that there was no indication of possible regulatory change that would affect the Claimants' 2009 and 2010 plants until \"the fall of 2010\".388\n\nReply, paras. 136-137; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 30:6-25; 2022 Hearing, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 38.\n\nPartial Award, para. 426; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 30:7-13.\n\n344.\n\nAs to the Respondent's preferred cut-off date of 24 August 2009, the Claimants contend that a one-page press release issued from the Ministry of Industry and Trade containing the Ministry's proposal to amend the Act on RES Promotion, in particular, by repealing the 5% Limit as of 1 January 2010, cannot be considered a sufficient indication based on which the Claimants could have perceived a risk of potential regulatory changes affecting their PV plants.389 The Claimants add that the statements by government officials before and after the press release did not provide clear indications on the amendments and their timeline to suggest that the changes to the FiT would affect the Claimants' PV plants, neither those to be commissioned in 2010 nor *a fortiori* those that were being built for connection in 2009.390\n\nReply, paras. 140-141, *referring to* Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bartovsk\u00fd, \"Ministry of Industry and Trade will Equalize the Support of Renewable Energy Sources\", , 24 August 2009 (**Ex.

Relevant moment\n-------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's suggestion that the \"relevant moment\" after which it would be unreasonable to abandon a PV project in light of the stage reached by it, would be the date of commissioning.398 For the Claimants, adopting the date of commissioning (or the ERO License) as the relevant moment would be the same as requiring the full completion of the plants before the cut-off date because, alternatively, the Claimants would \"simply have put a stop to their investment in a certain PV plant (and are entitled to zero damages for the plant)\" after the cut-off date despite having completed the necessary licensing and construction-related steps.399\n\nReply, paras. 163, 165.\n\nReply, paras. 166-168, 171.\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimants instead consider the date of the commencement of the construction works or, alternatively, the date before which construction could not legally have started,400 to be the appropriate \"relevant moment\", as it takes account of the various licensing processes and the important economic resources that have already been committed to the project before the beginning of the plant's construction.401\n\nWhile the Claimants note that the precise date of the beginning of the works can be known, they agree to look at the date before which construction could not legally have started as suggested by the Respondent. According to the Claimants, this date is determined as the latest between (i) the date of the construction permit, zoning decision or public law contract with the local authority; and (ii) the date of commencement of the works indicated in the EPC contracts. *See* Reply, paras. 175-176.\n\nReply, paras. 172-174.

The Claimants' PV plants that fall beyond the cut-off date\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the number of PV projects and their aggregate capacity in MW whose construction works commenced beyond the cut-off date, as well as the Respondent's alternative cut-off dates, are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Relevant event Cut-off date** | **Commencement of the constructions works** |\n| **9 November 2010402** | 0 plants |\n| **27 August 2010403** | 3 plants (7 MW) |\n| **17 March 2010404** | 11 plants (30.3 MW) |\n| **24 August 2009405** | 19 plants (38.3 MW) |\n\nThis corresponds with the public revelation that the Respondent was implementing the Solar Levy. *See* paragraph 175 of the Final Award.\n\nThis corresponds with the announcement of then Prime Minister Petr Ne\u010das regarding the halting of PV development. *See* paragraph 365 of the Final Award.\n\nThis corresponds with the adoption by the Chamber of Deputies of Act No. 137/2010, which repealed the 5% Limit. *See* paragraph 364 of the Final Award.\n\nThis corresponds with a proposal by the Ministry of Industry and Trade to amend the Act on RES Promotion, in particular, by repealing the 5% Limit. *See* paragraph 344 of the Final Award.\n\n352.\n\nThe impact on quantum of the above analysis is discussed in Section VII.B.1(f) below in the context of whether any reduction of damages is warranted.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants are not entitled to damages in respect of plants in which they invested with knowledge of the consequences of the solar boom.406 In this respect, the Respondent underscores that the Tribunal's findings that the Respondent breached its treaty obligations do not imply that an investor could not have assumed any risk whatsoever nor can it ever assume the risk of a treaty violation as a matter of law.407\n\nResponse, para. 240.\n\nRejoinder, para. 51.\n\n354.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that no risk should be allocated to the Claimants, because, for the Respondent, the evidence confirms that the Claimants were aware, or at a minimum, should have been aware of a risk that regulatory changes could have an impact on their 2009 and 2010 PV plants.408\n\nRejoinder, para. 52.\n\n**(a) Investment treaties cannot be used as insurance policies against business risks**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nAs observed by investment tribunals, the Respondent posits that \"[investment treaties] are not insurance against business risk\" or against \"bad decisions\".409 Nevertheless, the Respondent argues that the Claimants, despite being fully aware that further investments in the Czech PV industry were deemed undesirable, \"hoped that the Czech Republic would allow the misaligned regulatory regime to persist into 2010, and they did so in the context of threats of arbitration in relation to the corrective measures proposed in 2009\".410 Such \"misuse of investment treaties\", in the Respondent's view, exacerbated the solar boom, which in turn forced the Czech Republic to impose the Solar Levy in 2010.411\n\nResponse, para. 243, *citing* MTD Equity Sdn.

Cut-off dates\n----------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimants' assertion that no risk of a regulatory change affecting the solar plants could have been perceived until 9 November 2010.425 In the Respondent's view, the Claimants conflate the perception of risk, in essence the possibility of adverse regulatory changes, with knowledge.426 In this respect, the Respondent emphasizes that there were multiple signs in 2009-2010 that the Czech Government could realistically introduce measures affecting the existing solar plants.427 The Respondent considers that the fact that different views existed in relation to the growth of the solar industry in 2009-2010 is indeed a \"sign of uncertainty (and a measure of risk)\".428\n\nRejoinder, para. 133.\n\nRejoinder, para. 134(a)-(b).\n\nRejoinder, para. 134(d)-(g).\n\nRejoinder, para. 134(c).\n\n363.\n\nAccordingly, for the Respondent, the appropriate cut-off date upon which the Claimants should be deemed to have known the serious consequences of the solar boom is 25 August 2009, i.e., the date the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a press release discussing the negative developments in regards to the PV plants.429 Noting that the press release and other media reports reflecting the technical, financial, and socio-economic consequences of the solar boom were widely publicized, the Respondent argues that the \"Claimants were not just contributing to the solar boom, with full knowledge of its consequences, but also assumed the risk of an adverse regulatory measure\".430\n\nResponse, para. 255, *referring to* Tom\u00e1\u0161 Bartovsk\u00fd, \"Ministry of Industry and Trade will Equalize the Support of Renewable Energy Sources\", , 24 August 2009 (**Ex.

Plant-specific dates\n------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the appropriate dates to be used for the purpose of determining whether a PV plant falls beyond the cut-off date is the date of commissioning because, in its view, such date represents the moment when the investor has obtained a right to the FiT.439 As such, according to the Respondent, \"[a]n investor who considers that a measure has rendered non-viable its yet-to-be commissioned plant\" is not entitled to the full expectation value of damages.440 While the investor could, at most, be entitled to recovery of the sunk investment costs made in reliance on the pre-existing regime, the Respondent notes that the Claimants did not file a claim for the recovery of sunk cost in regard to their PV plants.441\n\nResponse, para. 270. *See also* Rejoinder, para. 135(b).\n\nResponse, para. 270.\n\nRejoinder, para. 135; Rejoinder, para. 135(a).\n\n369.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a plant is commissioned when the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) a plant operator has received the ERO license for the plant; and (ii) the first parallel connection to the grid has taken place.442 In the absence of information regarding the latter,443 the Respondent asserts that the dates of the ERO licenses, being the earliest dates when commissioning could have potentially taken place, have been adopted in Mr Peer's calculations of impact on damages.444\n\nResponse, para. 272.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimants did not produce documents that would allow the Tribunal to confirm the exact dates on which each plant was commissioned. *See* Rejoinder, para. 135(c).\n\nResponse, paras. 273-274.\n\n370.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent proposes to use the date of the commencement of construction, or rather \"the date before which construction could not have legally started\", to determine whether a PV plant falls beyond the cut-off date.445 Taking the \"conservative approach\", the Respondent (i) accepts the Claimants' assertion that construction works for three of the plants commenced on the basis of a verbal agreement before the date of the relevant EPC contract (and thus not taking into account the relevant EPC contract dates); and (ii) in the case of the plants that were constructed in stages, uses the date relating to the first stage of construction.446\n\nResponse, paras. 275-276 [emphasis added by the Respondent].\n\nResponse, para. 277.\n\n371.\n\nBased on the foregoing, Mr Peer calculates the impact on damages of excluding the PV plants falling outside the cut-off date as discussed in Section VII.B.2(c) below.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent's argument regarding an alleged assumption of risks by the Claimants to be unfounded.\n\n373.\n\n*First*, as a matter of principle, the Tribunal agrees that investment treaties are not insurance policies against business risks.447 However, this commonly accepted position does not mean that investors must bear the risk that the treaty may be breached, nor that they must internalize the damages resulting from such breach. Not every government decision that affects an investment will amount to a treaty breach. But in those cases where a breach has been found to exist (as in the present case), \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\"448 (leaving aside for present purposes the principle of contributory fault, which Respondent has invoked as the basis of a separate argument, analyzed in Section V.E.3).\n\nResponse, para. 243, *citing* *MTD Equity and MTD Chile v.

These decisions do not support the Respondent's position.\n\n375.\n\nFor instance, in *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. And MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, the tribunal asserted: \"The BITs are not an insurance against business risk and the Tribunal considers that the Claimants should bear the consequences of their own actions as experienced businessmen\".449 Nevertheless, this assertion was not made as a justification to deny monetary relief for a proven treaty breach, as sought by the Respondent's argument in the present case. It was an argument for the conclusion that no breach (in that case, the alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment required by Article 2(2) of the Malaysia-Chile BIT) had existed in the first place.450\n\n*MTD Equity and MTD Chile v. Republic of Chile,* para. 178 (**Ex. CLA-51**).\n\n*MTD Equity and MTD Chile v. Republic of Chile*, para. 167 (**Ex. CLA-51**).\n\n376.\n\nIn *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v. Republic of Peru,* the tribunal held that: \"no investment treaty is an insurance or guarantee of investment success, especially when the investor makes bad business decisions\".451 However, this assertion was not made to deny compensation to the investor despite the existence of a treaty breach either. It was an argument for the conclusion that \"it is not true that there was an expropriation\" (i.e., there was no breach of Article 5(2) of the France-Peru BIT), given the \"repeated non-compliance with the banking regulations\" which rendered the investment's \"intervention and subsequent dissolution and liquidation inevitable\".452\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose v. Republic of Peru*, para. 478 (**Ex. RLA-343**).\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose v. Republic of Peru*, para. 478 (**Ex. RLA-343**).\n\n377.\n\nLikewise, the tribunal in *UAB E Energija v. Republic of Latvia* considered the investor's assumption of risk as a reason to conclude that the host State had not breached the applicable treaty.453 This is certainly not the Claimants' case, where the Partial Award already found Respondent to be liable for breaching Article 10 of the ECT, Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT, and Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT.\n\n*UAB E Energija v. Republic of Latvia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/33, Award, 22 December 2017, paras. 848-854 (**Ex. RLA-342**).\n\n378.\n\n*Third*, the Partial Award has already established that the Claimants were entitled to act upon the assumption that the intrinsic stability guarantee would be applied to all PV plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010 (with the only legitimate exception being the review and control under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission). As held in paragraph 427 of the Partial Award:\n\n427. The Tribunal concludes that, in the circumstances, as there was no indication at the time that the level of RES support would be reduced for plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010, the fact that the Claimants were aware, as of summer 2009, that the solar boom was creating a policy issue for the Government that would likely lead to changes in the FiT, cannot affect the stability guarantee in Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion. The Claimants could thus continue to rely on Section 6(1)(a)(2) and to legitimately expect that the investments they would be making in 2009 and 2010 would be entitled to the level of RES support fixed by ERO for these two years. Consequently the Respondent's decision in December 2011 to amend Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion so as to lift the stability guarantee for investments made in 2010 and 2011 must be considered incompatible with the intrinsic stabilization guarantee in Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act and therefore in breach of its obligation to treat the Claimants in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with Article 10 of the ECT. The fact that the Czech Republic was led by a caretaker government during the period May 2009 to July 2010 cannot change the outcome of the analysis. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that taking of measures to address the solar boom would have been considered \"politically or ideologically polarizing proposals\" and thus outside the remit of the caretaker government.454\n\nPartial Award, para. 427.\n\n379.\n\nIf the Claimants were entitled to rely on the intrinsic stability guarantee, it cannot be held that they assumed the risk that such guarantee would be breached, even with regards to the PV plants commissioned in late-2010. Such is precisely the point of the guarantee: that investors can trust in the host State's word that certain rules will not be modified. And the guarantee is that, if such rules are modified, the investor will have the right to be compensated for the damages caused by said modification. The fact that the Solar Levy pursued a legitimate goal \u2013 which is the reason why the Partial Award concluded it did not violate the non-impairment standard under the ECT455 \u2013 does not change this conclusion.\n\nPartial Award, para. 451.\n\n380.\n\n*Fourth,* the conclusion that the Claimants did not assume the risk of a treaty breach (such as the enactment of policy responses *contrary* to the intrinsic stability guarantee of Article 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion) does not mean that they did not assume the risk of regulatory changes that are *consistent* with such guarantee. Such policy response would have been the review and control of the PV plants' level of revenue under State aid rules applied by the Commission, a risk of which the Claimants could have been aware since 2008, as explained in Section V.E.3.\n\n381.\n\nNevertheless, even in such but-for scenario, the PV plants would still have obtained higher cashflows than they did under the Solar Levy, as explained in Section VII.F.1 below. Consequently, the fact that Claimants assumed the risk that this review and control could take place and reduce the PV plants' cashflows does not in itself deprive Claimants of their entitlement to monetary relief.\n\n**E. Contributory Fault**\n-------------------------\n\n382.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Tribunal's findings summarized in paragraphs 325-326 above raise the doctrine of contributory fault and the question of whether the Claimants' contribution to the solar boom serves as a bar to any monetary relief, which the Respondent answers in the affirmative.\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the concepts of assumption of risk and contributory fault overlap. They submit that the Respondent's defense on contributory fault is a \"meritless attempt to duplicate hypothetical grounds\" for the reduction of the Claimants' damages.456 In any event, the Claimants argue that the defense on contributory fault fails, because the Claimants did not engage in any willful or negligent conduct as their investments were the result of sound business judgements.\n\nReply, para. 78.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nConsidering that the Tribunal has already found that, notwithstanding their awareness of the impending changes in the RES support, \"the Claimants went on to substantially invest in solar energy production\"457 and thus \"contribut[ed] to the solar boom\" and that the issue of such contribution \"is relevant to the issue of quantum\", the Respondent submits that the Claimants' willful contribution to the solar boom \"provoked\" the Czech Republic to enact the Solar Levy that allegedly caused loss to the Claimants.458 Therefore, in accordance with the Articles on State Responsibility, the Respondent asserts that such willful actions bar any award of compensation under the doctrine of contributory fault.459\n\nResponse, para. 249.\n\nResponse, paras. 76-78, *citing* Partial Award, para. 428; *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimants that the Tribunal's findings in paragraph 428 of the Partial Award can only be construed as implicating the doctrine of assumption of risk. *See* Rejoinder, para. 46.\n\n385.\n\nIn support of its contention, the Respondent notes that the Claimants lobbied the Czech Government and threatened arbitrations in 2009, caused a delay in the Government's decision \"to enact the very corrective measure that Claimants now say that the Government should have adopted\", took advantage of the subsidiary in late 2009 and 2010, and aggravat[ed] the solar boom which led the Czech Republic to enact corrective measures, including the Solar Levy.460\n\nResponse, para. 78. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 123:14-125:12, 133:8-17.\n\n386.\n\nContrary to the Claimants' assertion, the Respondent argues that unlawful conduct by the Claimants need not exist for the doctrine of contributory fault to be triggered; rather, it requires only willful or negligent conduct on the part of the investor, which the Respondent has established in this case.461 The Respondent, in this regard, clarifies that it is not calling on the Claimants to bear the cost of the solar boom in its entirety nor was that the implication of the Solar Levy.462\n\nRejoinder, para. 41.\n\nRejoinder, para. 44.\n\n387.\n\nAs to the Claimants' argument that their contribution to the solar boom was negligible, the Respondent points to the Claimants' own assertions that Energy 21 was a major player in the Czech solar sector and that Energy 21 had constructed certain PV plants for \u010cEZ.463\n\nRejoinder, paras. 43-44, *referring to* Reply, para. 75.\n\n388.\n\nNoting that investment tribunals have wide discretion to consider a claimant's contribution to its injury when assessing damages, the Respondent submits that account should be taken of the Claimants' willful contribution to the solar boom in accordance with the Articles on State Responsibility and, as a result, bar the Claimants from recovering any damages.464\n\nReply, para. 76, *referring to* Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission, United Nations, Article 39 (**Ex**. **RLA-243**) (hereinafter \"**Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts**\").\n\n**2. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nThe Claimants do not consider that the observations in the Partial Award to the effect that the Claimants commissioned PV plants in 2009 and 2010 when the solar boom was \"already emerging as a legitimate policy issues in the Czech Republic\" constitute a legal finding of contributory fault on the part of the Claimants.465 Moreover, the Claimants maintain that none of the requirements is satisfied in the present case to establish contributory fault in accordance with Article 39 of the Articles on State Responsibility.466\n\nReply, para. 318, *citing* Partial Award, para. 505. *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 91:16-92:1, 93:2-22.\n\nReply, paras. 81-82. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 10:21-24, 27:1-29.2.\n\n390.\n\n*First*, unlike the cases cited by the Respondent, which concerned a variety of unlawful conduct on the part of the investors, the Claimants submit that they did not engage in willful or negligent conduct to trigger the Czech Republic to introduce the Solar Levy.467 Rather, the Claimants consider that their conduct \"ha[d] always been reasonable\" by carrying out proper due diligence and they had engaged in business in line with industry standards.468\n\nReply, paras. 83-84, *referring to* *Veteran Petroleum Limited v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Respondent's argument regarding the alleged contributory fault by the Claimants to be unfounded.\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the Claimants \"aggravated the solar boom and provoked the Czech Republic into enacting corrective measures, including the Solar Levy\" and, thus, should be denied damages (or have them greatly reduced) based on the doctrine of contributory fault.474 However, contributory fault requires a willful or negligent conduct by the entity which seeks reparation, defined as a \"lack of due care for its property or rights\".475 The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants acted in such way in the present case.\n\nResponse, para. 78.\n\nDraft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful ActsCommentary to Article 39 (**Ex. RLA-243**); *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award,7 February 2017, para. 576 (**Ex. CLA-229**) (hereinafter \"***Burlington v. Ecuador***\"); *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Award,27 September 2017, para. 1192 (**Ex. RLA-320**); *Copper Mesa Mining Corporation v. Republico of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2012-2, Award, paras. 6.91-6.92 (**Ex. CLA-267**).\n\n395.\n\nThe Respondent is right to point out that the Partial Award concluded that the Claimants were aware that the solar boom created a policy issue that the government needed to solve.476 However, the Partial Award also found that the Claimants could not foresee that, as part of the solution, the Solar Levy would affect plants commissioned before 2011:\n\n426. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that during this period when the solar boom was debated within and outside the Czech Government, the Claimants continued to invest in new plants. Based on the evidence before the Tribunal, of the 31 plants directly or indirectly owned by the Claimants, for nine plants an EPC contract was concluded in 2009 and for twelve plants such a contract was concluded in 2010. In other words, the Claimants concluded a contract for the engineering, procurement and construction of 21 out of the 31 plants during a period when the drastic increase in the development of the photovoltaic power had already emerged as a policy issue in the country, given its potential impact on consumer prices and the State's treasury. At the same time, it is also clear from the evidence that, until the fall of 2010, there was no indication that the impending regulatory changes would affect plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010. The Tribunal also notes that the timing of the Claimants' investments coincided with the rapid fall in the cost of solar panels, as a result of market developments, spurred mainly by cheap imports from Asia.\n\n427. The Tribunal concludes that, in the circumstances, as there was no indication at the time that the level of RES support would be reduced for plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010, the fact that the Claimants were aware, as of summer 2009, that the solar boom was creating a policy issue for the Government that would likely lead to changes in the FiT, cannot affect the stability guarantee in Section 6(1)(a)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion.477\n\nPartial Award, para. 427.\n\nPartial Award, paras. 426-427.\n\n396.\n\nIf the Claimants did not know \u2013 and could not have known \u2013 that the Solar Levy would be applied to the PV plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010, it cannot be said that they \"knowingly invested into a bubble\" and \"cannot now claim they were surprised when the Government took steps to mitigate the negative effects of that bubble\", as the Respondent avers.478 Nor can the Tribunal agree that the \"Claimants must have known (or at least should have known) that the Government might ultimately ask the \"last chance rush\" solar investors to bear some part of the burden of mitigating the negative consequences of the solar boom\".479\n\nResponse, para. 247.\n\nResponse, para. 245.\n\n397.\n\nAs the Partial Award concluded, the information available at the time indicated that any reform of the existing RES scheme would be applied to PV plants commissioned from 1 January 2011 onwards480 and the Claimants could \"legitimately expect that the investments they would be making in 2009 and 2010 would be entitled to the level of RES support fixed by ERO for these two years\".481 Acting upon such expectation cannot be considered to reflect a \"lack of due care\" by the Claimants towards their own property or rights, but a reasonable act within the rules that the Respondent had laid out. Thus, the investments made in 2009 and 2010 were made under \"the rules of the game\" and therefore fall within the scope of the guarantee granted by the Respondent. This was already clearly established in the Partial Award.\n\nPartial Award, paras. 424-425.\n\nPartial Award, para. 427.\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the Claimants acted with \"extreme haste and carelessness in their rush to complete their solar projects by the end of each respective calendar year and especially by the end of 2010\".482 However, there is no causal link between the Claimants' rush and the Respondent's breach of the applicable treaties, nor between the former and the damages pursued in the current stage. Acting legitimately under the guarantee granted cannot be considered a willful or negligent contribution to the unlawful act. The Solar Levy was not a response to the Claimants' rush, nor were the damages pursued for the PV plants commissioned in late-2010 a consequence of their commissioning date. It was solely a result of the Respondent's decision to apply the modifications to the RES scheme to plants commissioned before 1 January 2011. In fact, the Parties have not disputed that the PV plants commissioned in late-2010 did go into operation and produce solar energy, as sought by the Act on RES promotion, before the Respondent chose to change its policy stance.\n\nRejoinder, para. 54.\n\n399.\n\nConsequently, as explained in paragraph 380 above, the only risk assumed by the Claimants when investing was the review and control of the Act of RES promotion under EU State aid rules. Their decision to further their investment, even in late-2010, cannot be considered a negligent or willful contribution to the damages suffered as a consequence of the Solar Levy.\n\n400.\n\nIn any event, even assuming that negligence or willful misconduct by the Claimants did exist, in the Tribunal's view, it cannot, by its mere existence, fully deprive the aggrieved party of its entitlement to monetary relief, as the Respondent contends. It is only a factor that may be considered to reduce the quantum to be paid.483\n\nBrigitte Stern, *Le pr\u00e9judice dans la th\u00e9orie de la responsabilit\u00e9 internationale*, p. 326 (**Ex. RLA-372**). In fact, none of the cases cited by Respondent in support of its argument was the investor fully deprived of monetary relief. See: *Occidental Petroleum v. Republic of Ecuador*, para. 687 (**Ex. RLA-336**); *Veteran Petroleum Limited v. Russia*, para. 1637 (**Ex. CLA-18**).\n\n**F. EU State AID Rules**\n-------------------------\n\n401.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal deferred the question of the relevance of EU State aid rules and the Commission's decisions assessing the compatibility of the Czech RES Support scheme with EU State aid rules, in the context of quantum, to the current stage of the proceedings.484\n\nPartial Award, para. 505.\n\n402.\n\nFor the Claimants, both EU State aid rules and the Commission's decisions relating thereto are irrelevant for the determination of their damages, because (i) EU law is only relevant as a fact and is not part of the legal framework of this arbitration; (ii) even assuming that EU law were part of the applicable law, EU State aid rules would not justify a refusal to issue an award for damages in the Claimants' favor; and (iii) any conflict between the ECT and EU State aid rules would be resolved in favor of the ECT.\n\n403.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent submits that EU State aid law is part of the legal framework of this arbitration and, as a result, precludes the Claimants receiving, by way of an award for damages, compensation for amounts that they would not have been entitled to receive pursuant to EU State aid law rules.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n404.\n\nAt the outset, the Claimants submit that EU State aid rules are irrelevant for the determination of their damages claim.485 The Claimants argue that the Respondent's defense relating to EU State aid must be rejected because, in their view, it aims to re-litigate the finding of the Partial Award that the Solar Levy violated the FET standard.486 Moreover, the Respondent's argument that an award of damages in favor of the Claimants would be prohibited by EU State rules, the Claimants assert, \"is essentially an attempt to plead (or re-plead, this time from the perspective of EU law) the compatibility of the Solar Levy with the guarantee of stability of Section 6(1)(b)(2)\" of the Act on RES Promotion.487 The Claimants instead insist that the Partial Award necessarily implies that EU law is treated as fact.488 It follows therefrom, the Claimants argue, that the finding that EU law is to be treated as a fact becomes *res judicata* at this present phase of the proceedings.489\n\nSubmission, para. 224.\n\nReply, paras. 192, 194, *referring to* Partial Award, paras. 416, 419-420.\n\nReply, para. 199.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 36:20-39:2.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 97:19-98:14, 102:3-9. *See also* 2022 Hearing, Claimants' Responses to Tribunal's Questions, 25 May 2022, pp. 20-21.\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimants take issue with the Respondent's request that the Tribunal determine the amount of damages owed to the Claimants (quantifying them at zero) not by reference to the amount guaranteed under Section 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion, but by reference to the level of FiT allegedly permitted under EU State aid rules.490 Yet, in light of the Tribunal's finding that Section 6(1)(b)(2) contains a guarantee of stability protected under the FET standard, the Claimants consider that \"any attempt to invoke EU State aid law to frustrate [this] guarantee is foreclosed\".491\n\nReply, para. 196.\n\nReply, paras. 197-198, *citing* Partial Award, para. 419.\n\n406.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, contrary to what the Respondent alleges, contemporaneous documents show that the Commission was aware of the RES scheme and that the \"review and control\" of the Czech RES scheme without the Solar Levy did in fact take place.492 The Claimants further emphasize that the Commission never took issue with the original 2009 and 2010 FiT, despite having had multiple opportunities to do so since 2003.493 Therefore, in the Claimants' view, \"it is not for the Arbitral Tribunal (let alone the Czech Republic) to second-guess how the [Commission] would have applied the rules on State aid if it had further investigated the original 2009 and 2010 FiT\".494\n\nReply, paras. 206-210, *citing* Partial Award, para. 419. *See* Letters from the Czech Society of Wind Energy and the European Association for Renewable Energies EUROSOLAR respectively to Mr Monti and Mr Loyola de Palacio, 16 December 2003 (**Ex.

Spain*, the Claimants submit that EU State aid rules are irrelevant as part of the legal framework of this case because the Claimants in this arbitration are \"not asserting a right to State Aid under EU law\", but rather a right to compensation arising from the Respondent's breach to accord FET to the Claimants pursuant to the ECT and the BITs.495 Therefore, EU State aid law, the Claimants assert, is only relevant as part of the factual matrix of this case, particularly, to consider whether, as a matter of fact, the State aid rules had an impact on the Claimants' expectations at the time of their investments, i.e., \"whether [the] Claimants did or could perceive an incompatibility of the original 2009 and 2010 FiT with EU State aid law and whether and how that impacts on quantum\".496\n\nSubmission, paras. 224-225, *citing* *9REN Holding S.\u00e0.r.l. v.

If it has not been pre-approved, then it is *per se* unlawful. This is distinct from the issue of whether the state aid is substantively compatible or incompatible with the common market.

CLA-264**).\n\n449.\n\nAs such, even if the Tribunal were to agree with the Claimants that EU State aid rules did not preclude an award of damages in these proceedings, the Respondent argues that this \"does not obviate the fact that an award would be subject to a State aid compatibility assessment\" and would trigger the question of enforceability of the award.574 In this respect, the Respondent notes that so long as the Claimants are in business anywhere in the EU, an award of damages as compensation for the Solar Levy would constitute improper State aid.575 According to the Respondent, enforcing the award outside the EU would also be difficult, since the courts in non-EU countries would need to \"order an EU Member State to pay an EU business an award that is contrary to EU law\".576\n\nRejoinder, para. 109.\n\nResponse, paras. 153-154.\n\nRejoinder, para. 110.\n\n450.\n\nThe Respondent further rejects the Claimants' reliance on *9Ren Holding v. Spain*, arguing that the determination of whether an award of damages constitutes State aid does not arise out of question whether the Claimants submitted claims under EU law or invoked a \"right to State aid\".577 Rather, it concerns the question of whether an arbitral award, in practice, would result in granting an amount that would be equivalent to a State aid subsidy.578\n\nRejoinder, paras. 105-106, *citing* *9REN Holding S.\u00e0.r.l. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nAs noted previously, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that EU State aid rules are a factor to be considered in the context of quantum that limits the cash flows that the PV plants would have obtained, in all probability, absent the imposition of the Solar Levy. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers the Respondent's argument to go too far insofar as it purports to deny the Claimants any reparation at all.\n\n453.\n\n*First*, the Partial Award already held that EU State aid rules are relevant to the controversy. Both the level of support and the period of time over which the guarantee was to be in force had to be respected by the Respondent, with the only possible exception being the review and control of the original RES scheme under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission.581 The question left to be determined in the current stage is whether, for the purposes of quantum, such review and control would have taken place absent the Solar Levy, and were it the case, what would have been its economic consequences.\n\nPartial Award, para. 419.\n\n454.\n\n*Second*, the Tribunal considers that, in the but-for scenario, the Commission would have \"in all probability\" considered the original RES scheme as State aid.\n\n455.\n\nIt is true, as the Claimants have noted, that the Respondent failed for many years to notify the original RES scheme to the Commission, in order for the latter to qualify it as State aid and evaluate its compatibility under EU State aid rules.582 However, in this respect, the Respondent seems only to have acted consistently with the approach then being taken by the ECJ. In 2001, in the *PreussenElektra* case, the ECJ held that obligatory purchases on the part of energy companies did not qualify as State aid under EU law:\n\nIn this case, the obligation imposed on private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources at fixed minimum prices does not involve any direct or indirect transfer of State resources to undertakings which produce that type of electricity.\n\nTherefore, the allocation of the financial burden arising from that obligation for those private electricity supply undertakings as between them and other private undertakings cannot constitute a direct or indirect transfer of State resources either.\n\nIn those circumstances, the fact that the purchase obligation is imposed by statute and confers an undeniable advantage on certain undertakings is not capable of conferring upon it the character of State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe answer to the first question referred must therefore be that a statutory provision of a Member State which, first, requires private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, distributes the financial burden resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private electricity network operators, does not constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.583\n\nReply, para. 251.\n\nCase C-379/98 *PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG,* ECLI:EU:C:2001:160, paras. 59-61, 66 (**Ex. CLA-1**).\n\n456.\n\nHowever, this position was clarified over a period of years, both *before and after* the enactment of the Solar Levy. For instance, in the *Essent Netwerk Noord BV* case, decided in 2008, the ECJ held that the approach established in the *PreussenElektra* case did *not* apply to cases where purchasing obligations were financed by compulsory charges to consumers. As the ECJ stated:\n\nAs regards the first condition [intervention by the State or through State resources], it is necessary to ascertain whether the amounts paid to SEP constitute intervention by the State or through State resources.\n\nArticle 9 of the OEPS provides for the payment to the designated company, namely SEP, of NLG 400 million and for the payment of the excess of the charge received to the Minister, who must set that amount aside for the purpose of defraying the costs referred to in Article 7 of the OEPS \u2014 which will not, however, enter into force \u2014 namely the non-market-compatible costs associated with urban heating and the Demkolec coal gas plant. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that those amounts have their origin in the price surcharge imposed by the State on purchasers of electricity under Article 9 of the OEPS, a surcharge with regard to which it has been established, in paragraph 47 of this judgment, that it constitutes a charge. Those amounts thus have their origin in a State resource.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nLikewise, the measure in question differs from that referred to in Case C-379/98 *PreussenElektra* [2001] ECR I-2009, in which the Court held, at paragraph 59, that the obligation imposed on private electricity supply undertakings to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources at fixed minimum prices did not involve any direct or indirect transfer of State resources to undertakings which produced that type of electricity. In the latter case, the undertakings had not been appointed by the State to manage a State resource, but were bound by an obligation to purchase by means of their own financial resources.\n\nIf follows from all those points that the amounts paid to SEP constitute intervention by the\n\nState through State resources.584\n\nCase C-206/06 *Essent Netwerk Noord* ECLI:EU:C:2008:413, paras. 65-66, 74-75. (**Ex. RLA-66**), *citing* Case C-379/98 *PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG*, ECLI:EU:C:2001:160, para. 59 (**Ex. CLA-1**).\n\n457.\n\nThis was reaffirmed in cases following the Solar Levy. For instance, in *Association Vent De Col\u00e8re! and others,* the ECJ held:\n\nAs regards, in the second place, the condition that the advantage must be granted directly or indirectly through State resources, it is to be recalled that measures not involving a transfer of State resources may fall within the concept of aid [\u2026].\n\nThe concept of 'intervention through State resources' is intended to cover, in addition to advantages granted directly by the State, those granted through a public or private body appointed or established by that State to administer the aid [\u2026].\n\nThe Court has also held that Article 107(1) of the TFEU covers all the financial means by which the public authorities may actually support undertakings, irrespective of whether or not those means are permanent assets of the public sector. Therefore, even if the sums corresponding to the measure in question are not permanently held by the Treasury, the fact that they constantly remain under public control, and therefore available to the competent national authorities, is sufficient for them to be categorised as State resources [\u2026].\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe Court has held that funds financed through compulsory charges imposed by the legislation of the Member State, managed and apportioned in accordance with the provisions of that legislation, may be regarded as State resources within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU even if they are managed by entities separate from the public authorities [\u2026].585\n\nCase C-262/12 *Association Vent De Col\u00e8re!* ECLI:EU:C:2013:851, paras. 19-21, 25 (**Ex. RLA-67**).\n\n458.\n\nConsequently, at the time that the Solar Levy was imposed, as EU investors who must be taken to have been aware of the existence of EU State aid law and the fundamental objective of avoiding distortions in the internal market of the European Union, the Claimants reasonably could have expected that the original RES scheme could sooner or later be considered to be State aid. This would entail that the scheme would be subject to review and control by the Commission.\n\n459.\n\n*Third*, even assuming that the Claimants could not reasonably perceive the risk that the original RES scheme could be qualified as State aid, the evidence is that the alternatives to the Solar Levy would have required State resources to finance the FiT. In this respect, the Claimants themselves have averred:\n\nMoreover, the Solar Levy was only one possible option to offset a portion of the State funds intended to subsidize RES energy in place of electricity users. As [the] Respondent acknowledges, other options considered were \"a VAT hike; increased taxation of large businesses; increased energy taxes; borrowing funds from the pension reform scheme; taxation of banks; use of the EU's Emission's Trading System funds; an asset tax per KW of installed capacity; a government loan\" and so on. It follows that there is no necessary link between [the] Claimants' alleged contributory conduct and the Solar Levy, which [the] Respondent introduced at its own discretion.586\n\nReply, para. 89.\n\n460.\n\nThe fact that the alternatives to the Solar Levy would have included the direct use of State resources to finance the PV plants' level of revenue guaranteed by Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on RES Promotion confirms that review and control under State aid rules would \"in all probability\" have occurred, even absent the Respondent's breach. The Claimants' reparation cannot be quantified without considering the fact of EC supervision as part of the but-for scenario. This is precisely the analysis that the Partial Award required the Tribunal to carry out in this stage.\n\n461.\n\n*Fourth*, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent that the latter implies that Claimants should be awarded zero damages. This would only be the case if it were assumed that the Commission would, \"in all probability\", have declared the RES scheme to be either unapproved or incompatible State aid. However, the evidence on the record suggests that that would not have been the case in the but-for scenario.\n\n462.\n\nAs to the lack of approval, it is true that the original RES scheme was never approved by the Commission. This has already been discussed above at paragraphs 442 to 444 of the Final Award. To the extent that the Respondent wrongly or incorrectly chose not to notify it as State aid, despite that being its obligation under EU State aid rules, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Respondent cannot rely on its own failure to submit its policy for consideration before the Commission in order to avoid full reparation.587\n\nReply, para. 256.\n\n463.\n\nAs to the incompatibility, although the Commission never reviewed the original RES scheme, it did review the amended RES scheme, and in doing so, arrived at the conclusion that it was compatible State aid. The reason for this finding was that investors were provided levels of return \"in line with [those] similar photovoltaic installations under similar conditions observed in other EU Member States\",588 with the PV plants analyzed by the Commission having an IRR ranging from 6.3% to 8.4%.589 These calculations were, of course, performed with the Solar Levy in place.\n\nDecision, para. 117 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\nDecision, Table 3 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n464.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this decision to be both illustrative and useful in determining the appropriate parameters for evaluating the impact of the State aid rules on the determination of damages. In employing the Commission's analysis as a guide to calculating damages, the Tribunal is not to be taken as seeking to usurp the Commission's exclusive right to apply State aid rules. Rather, in discharging its duty to render an award, the Tribunal has carefully taken note of the range of returns calculated by the Commission for the RES sector as a whole, and for the PV segment generally, and it has sought to apply them to the specific circumstances of the PV plants at issue in this case.\n\n465.\n\nThe Commission's decision over what it deemed reasonable for the modified RES scheme is thus a highly relevant fact that affects the determination of quantum. The Commission made an *ex ante* analysis of a proposed measure to determine whether, in general, it had an adverse effect on the common market. In so judging, the Commission's analysis was based on *average ranges of performance of the industry*, while in the present case, Tribunal must make *a plant-by-plant analysis* to determine the Solar Levy's effect on the Claimants' specific investments. Thus, when assessing the reasonableness of the damages sought, the Tribunal must seek to ensure that the Award does not affect the essence of the State aid rules application, namely, preventing the common market from being distorted.\n\n466.\n\nTurning to the *ex ante* analysis performed by the Commission, this employed available information based on aggregate data and averages of certain industries and market conditions. But in the real world, there may be particular plants that, due to their specific conditions, may have cash flows greater than those anticipated in the *ex ante* evaluation. This does not make the plants' financial performance illegal *per se*. Thus, the possibility of certain plants producing higher cash flows does not automatically preclude those cash flows from being compensated, so long as they reasonably relate to the criteria established by the Commission, having regard to the circumstances under evaluation.\n\n467.\n\nThe Respondent has asserted that \"[e]ach of [the] Claimants' plants met or exceeded the rates of return approved by the Commission's decision\".590 However, that is not the case. As shown in Mr Peer's Second Report, after the Solar Levy, some of the Claimants' PV plants' IRRs dropped down to (or even below) 8.4%:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Results of the simple payback and rate of return calculation - Claimants' inputs |\n| **Scenario** | **Simple Payback (years)** | **Rate of Return (Zero NPV)** (%) |\n| FRO reference plant 2008 | 11.5 | 6.2% |\n| PVP Div\u010dice - Supplemental calculation | 8.5 | 10.3% |\n| PVP Velk\u00fd Karlov- Supplemental calculation | 8.1 | 11.0% |\n| PVP Krhovice - Supplemental calculation | 7.3 | 12.6% |\n| PVP Jaroslavice - Supplemental calculation | 8.2 | 10.8% |\n| PVP Hr\u00e1dek - Supplemental calculation | 7.9 | 11.3% |\n| PVP Vojkovice - Supplemental calculation | 7.6 | 12.0% |\n| ERO reference plant 2009 | 11.0 | 7.0% |\n| PVP Protiv\u00edn - My First Report | 10.1 | 8.1% |\n| PVP \u010cesk\u00e9 Velenice - My First Report | 10.0 | 8.2% |\n| PVP Liten\u010dice - My First Report | 8.7 | 10.3% |\n| PVP Jaroslavice II - My First Report | 8.9 | 10.0% |\n| PVP Milovice I - My First Report | 7.1 | 13.8% |\n| PVP Hru\u0161ovany - My First Region | 9.9 | 8.4% |\n| PVP Chropyn\u011b - My First Report | 8.5 | 10.6% |\n| PVP Ur\u010d\u00edce - My First Report | 9.8 | 8.5% |\n| PVP Rozvadov - My First Report | 7.4 | 13.0% |\n| PVP Micmanice - My First Report | 7.8 | 12.0% |\n| PVP Velk\u00e1 nad Veli\u010dkou - My First Report | 9.8 | 85% |\n| PVP Ur\u010dice 2 - My First Report | 8.2 | 11.3% |\n| PVP Netolice - My First Report | 8.2 | 11.2% |\n| ERO reference plant 2010 | 9.9 | 8.4% |\n| PVP Milovice l - My First Report | 7.8 | 12.0% |\n| PVP Blatn\u00e1 - Supplemental calculation | 7.3 | 12.8% |\n| PVP Bojkovice - Supplemental calculation | 9.2 | 9.2% |\n| PVP Rozvadov IIA - Supplemental calculation | 8.2 | 11.0% |\n| PVP D\u0159inov - My First Report | 8.5 | 10.4% |\n| PVP \u0160t\u00edtary - My First Report | 8.3 | 10.9% |\n| FVP Tasov - My First Report | 9.2 | 9.2% |\n| PVP Prav\u010dice - My First Report | 9.3 | 9.0% |\n| PVP Ur\u010dice IV - My First Report | 9.3 | 9.1% |\n| PVP Dr\u017eovice - My First Report | 10.8 | 7.0% |\n| PVP Jaro\u0161ov - My First Report | 10.7 | 7.1% |\n| PVP Str\u00e1\u017e - My First Report | 9.1 | 9.3% |\n\nSource: KPMG calculation (Appendix 3 to this report and Appendix 4 to My First Report)591\n\nResponse, para. 133.\n\n**RER-Peer-2**, Table 2.\n\n468.\n\nHad the Solar Levy not been imposed, the ` of such PV plants would not have fallen below 8.4%. This can be verified in Mr Peer's estimations of the effect of incorporating the Solar Levy on cashflows, considering a referential plant according to the ERO methodology. It is worth noting that the Commission also took the ERO methodology as a reference in its estimates.

Not included in the aggregate IRR figures.* 592\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 4.7.\n\n469.\n\nIn other words, even assuming 8.4% as a \"ceiling\" for the IRR that the Claimants\u2019 PV plants could lawfully have achieved in the but-for scenario, some reparation must be awarded to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed\"593 had the Solar Levy not being enacted by the Respondent. Otherwise, the effect of the Solar Levy over the PV plants that had their IRRs reduced even below 8.4% would not be compensated.\n\nReply, para. 317, *citing* *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, p. 47 (**Ex. CLA- 118**).\n\n470.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the analysis performed by the Commission did not conclude that the 6.3% to 8.4% range was the only acceptable range The decision regarding the amended RES scheme did not discard any and all IRRs above 8.4% as \"unreasonable\". Inasmuch as the Claimants\u2019 IRRs were \"in line with levels of return of similar photovoltaic installations under similar conditions observed in other EU Member States\",594 the Claimants could still have reasonably expected such IRRs to be approved by the Commission, even if the RES scheme was submitted for review as State aid. That is so because \"similar\" does not mean \"identical\".\n\nDecision, para. 117 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n471.\n\nAs a consequence, the plant-by-plant analysis to determine the Claimants\u2019 reparation must consider that there are specific factors that may affect each plant and distinguish them from those considered by the Commission\u2019s range. Such a range establishes a relevant reference, but not a strict limit. And, as shown by the numbers provided by Mr Edwards and Mr Peer, each plant had a different IRR, based on specific factors involving the design and operational efficiencies of each plant.\n\n472.\n\nFor example, in the present case, it is worth noting that the Commission\u2019s range was based on a sample of PV plants that included a service life of 15 to 20 years:\n\n**Table 1: Service life of renewable installations**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Technology Type | Service life in years |\n| Hydro | 30 |\n| Photovoltaic | 20' |\n| Wind | 20 |\n| Biogas | 20' |\n| Biomass | 20 |\n| Geothermal | 20 |\n\n1class=font12>15 years for installations commissioned by 31.12.2007595\n\nDecision, Table 1 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n473.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 PV plants, on the other hand, had a service life ranging from 20 to 21 years,596 thus rendering them not exactly similar (clearly not identical) to the plants on which the Commission\u2019s range was based. As a consequence, in the but-for scenario, it would be reasonable to assume that a higher IRR would have been acceptable in their specific cases, since a longer service life would probably have resulted in somewhat higher cash flows.\n\nAs shown by the number of years considered by Mr Edwards and Mr Peer in order to calculate the PV plants' cash flows. *See* Cash flow impacts of the Amending Measures, Cash flow impact of Measures (**Ex. JER-1**).\n\n474.\n\nConsequently, the EU State aid rules as applied by the Commission are relevant and of significant weight, because the Commission specifically turned its mind to the Czech RES framework, but they would not have the effect of reducing the Claimants' damages to zero. Depending on the IRR that would have been reasonable in the but-for scenario, their only effect would be to reduce the reparation's quantum, under a reasonableness analysis considering the specific circumstances of each case, which will be discussed in Section VII.F below.\n\n475.\n\nFinally, as to the Respondent's argument that the Final Award in itself could be qualified as unlawful State aid if damages were awarded to the Claimants, the Tribunal considers that this argument also presumes that the quantum of any reparation will be found to be incompatible with the EU common market*.* In the Tribunal's view, this should not be the case, as its assessment of such quantum has been conducted with the range of reasonability established by the European Commission in its decision regarding the modified RES scheme in mind, having regard to any relevant differences stemming from the specific characteristics of the Claimants' PV plants based on available information.\n\n**VI. CAUSATION**\n-----------------\n\n476.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the question of whether causation is established. The Claimants argue that there is a link between the Respondent's unlawful conduct in the form of the Solar Levy and the Claimants' losses. For its part, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to establish a causal link between the Solar Levy and the supposed losses in light of prior findings of the Tribunal in the Partial Award.\n\n**A. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimants submit that they have proven factual causation by establishing that the Solar Levy, which was held to be unlawful in the Partial Award, caused the claimed losses.597 The Claimants maintain that the Solar Levy diminished the FiTs that were expected from the electricity produced by the PV plants and, therefore, negatively affected the Claimants' investments.598\n\nSubmission, para. 64.\n\nSubmission, para. 64.\n\n478.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants posit that they have established legal causation, which requires a link between the host State's unlawful act and the foreseeable loss.599 In this respect, the Claimants emphasize that it is \"obvious (not just foreseeable) that a reduction of the FiT causes a loss to the company that owns the PV plants, and therefore to the investor that invests in that company\".600\n\nSubmission, para. 64.\n\nSubmission, para. 65.\n\n479.\n\nAddressing the Respondent's reliance on certain findings in the Partial Award, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal did not inquire about questions pertaining to causation.601 Rather, they take the view that the Tribunal's comments, in particular those contained in paragraph 428 of the Partial Award, could only be construed as concerning issues of regulatory risk.602\n\nSubmission, para. 64.\n\nReply, paras. 4, 8, 78.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing damages, the Respondent submits that it is necessary for the Claimants to establish causation in accordance with Article 39 of the Articles on State Responsibility and in light of the findings in paragraph 428 of the Partial Award that the Respondent's act was at the same time both (i) a treaty violation, and (ii) a reasonable response to the solar boom to which the Claimants themselves had contributed.603\n\nRejoinder, paras. 35-36. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 113:21-114:8.\n\n481.\n\nAs explained in the context of its contributory fault defense,604 the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that the Respondent alone is to blame for the solar boom.605 In particular, the Respondent maintains that the decision to delay the repeal of the 5% Limit was made at the request of the investors (which included the Claimants) and clarifies that the objective of the deferral was \"to avoid the threat to the projects which [were] already under way or [were] sufficiently prepared\", as announced by the Minister of Industry and Trade.606\n\n*See* Section V.E.1 above.\n\nRejoinder, para. 38. *See* Section V.E.1 above.\n\nRejoinder, para. 38, *citing* Press Conference Following the Government Session, 16 November 2009, p. 1 (**Ex. C-324**).\n\n482.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that the question of causation was never raised by the Tribunal in the Partial Award and that paragraph 428 of the Partial Award could only be interpreted as an issue of regulatory risk.607 In the Respondent's view, there can be numerous ways of interpreting the said paragraph, especially when the Claimants themselves have conceded that \"the concepts of contributory fault and assumption of risk overlap\".608\n\nRejoinder, para. 46.\n\nRejoinder, para. 46, *citing* Reply, para. 79.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that causation should be defined in line with the analysis of the Respondent's objections to the Claimants' entitlement to monetary relief, explained in Section V above.\n\n484.\n\nAs explained previously, the Claimants cannot be said to have caused the damages through their contribution to the solar boom. The Partial Award found that, based on the Respondent's conduct, the Claimants \"could thus continue to rely on Section 6(1)(a)(2) [of the Act on RES Promotion] and to legitimately expect that the investments they would be making in 2009 and 2010 would be entitled to the level of RES support fixed by [the] ERO for these two years\".609 If such expectation was legitimate, they cannot be called to bear part of the cost of the Respondent's breach.\n\nPartial Award, para. 427.\n\n485.\n\nNevertheless, this is without prejudice to the Tribunal's finding regarding the relevance of EU State aid rules as applied by the Commission, which in all probability would have limited the level of revenue of the Claimants' PV plants in the but-for scenario. The impact of this factor on quantum is explained in Section VII.F below.\n\n**VII. THE CLAIMANTS' DAMAGES**\n-------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nIn the current phase of the proceedings, the Claimants rely on reports prepared by Mr Richard Edwards, who replaced Mr Geoffrey Senogles, the Claimants' original quantum expert.610 While Mr Edwards employs the same but-for approach as Mr Senogles, he puts forward a different valuation methodology, namely, by (i) using the SPVs, not the PV plants, as the subject of the valuation; (ii) adopting two valuation dates to assess separately the impact of the Solar Levy and its prolongation on both the cash flows and the investors' perception of the risk of investing in the PV market; (iii) relying on contemporaneous forecasts that either were available or could have been available at the valuation dates; and (iv) using two different weighted average costs of capital (the \"**WACC**\") in calculating the fair market value (the \"**FMV**\") of the Claimants' investments in the Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios.611\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr Senogles left his firm Charles River Associates in March 2018 and thus could no longer serve as an expert in this matter. *See* Submission, para. 5.\n\nSubmission, paras. 94-95, 97, 99-100.\n\n487.\n\nFurther, Mr Edwards considers certain transactions entered into in relation to the Claimants' investments to be reliable evidence of the value of such investments in Energy 21, given that they took place at different points in time relevant for valuation purposes.612\n\nSubmission, paras. 91-92.\n\n488.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Claimants' \"ever-evolving position\" on the appropriate method of quantifying damages.613 The Respondent also criticizes Mr Edwards' valuation methodology, in particular, the use of different discount rates in different scenarios and his reliance on an array of assumptions, which, in the Respondent's view, are unsupported by contemporaneous evidence and are inconsistent with the Partial Award.614 Instead, the Respondent submits that its quantum expert, Mr Michael Peer, presents a \"simple and intuitive\" assessment by calculating the total impact of the Solar Levy on the PV plants' cash flows and discounting it to a single valuation date.615 In any event, the Respondent maintains that the Claimants should not be awarded any compensation for failing to discharge their burden of proof.\n\nResponse, paras. 207-210.\n\nResponse, para. 204.\n\nResponse, para. 205.\n\n**A. Valuation Methodology**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n489.\n\nThe Claimants assert that they and Mr Edwards employ the but-for approach to calculate the Claimants' damages in line with the practice adopted in investment treaty arbitration.616 Accordingly, in assessing the diminution in the FMV of the Claimants' investments in Energy 21 as a result of the Solar Levy, Mr Edwards adopts the following methodology. First, he assesses the FMV that the Claimants' investments would have had on the valuation date, had the Respondent not introduced the Solar Levy (the \"**Counterfactual Scenario**\").617 Second, he assesses the FMV of the Claimants' investments as at the valuation date, taking into account the Solar Levy (the \"**Actual Scenario**\").618 Finally, he calculates the difference between the values in the two Scenarios, this being the quantum of damages awardable to the Claimants as an amount equivalent to the loss suffered by the Claimants' investments as a result of the Solar Levy.619\n\nSubmission, paras. 70, 72.\n\nSubmission, para. 78; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 11:12-19.\n\nSubmission, para. 78; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 11:12-19.\n\nSubmission, paras. 74, 79; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 3.3, 3.12; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 11:24-12:2.\n\n490.\n\nConsidering that the Claimants' financial position \"can be thought of as the FMV (fair market value) of their indirect investments in Energy 21 SPVs that owned and operated the PV plants\", Mr Edwards takes the SPVs, which were fully owned by Energy 21, as the subject of the valuation, because the impact on each SPV's financial performance is \"reflected (in full) in the value of Energy 21\".620 In other words, he calculates the diminution of the FMV of Energy 21 caused by the Solar Levy (i.e., the Claimants' direct investment) by assessing the difference in FMV of the SPVs (i.e., the Claimants' indirect investments).621 This is appropriate, according to Mr Edwards, because it is the SPVs\u2014the legal entities that own the assets and equipment that make up the plants\u2014that received the FiT, not the PV plants themselves.622\n\nSubmission, paras. 81-83, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 3.5, 3.7-3.8.\n\nSubmission, para. 82.\n\nReply, para. 418; **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 3.12.\n\n491.\n\nMr Edwards rejects the Respondent's argument that such calculations would include irrelevant items, including subsidiaries of Energy 21 other than the SPVs, given that the forecasts on which he relies as at the valuation dates refer only to the SPVs.623\n\nReply, para. 419; **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 3.11.\n\n492.\n\nMr Edwards uses two valuation dates to account for the dates on which the Solar Levy affected the expectations as to the future cash flows of the PV plants:624\n\n(a) 1 January 2011 for the effects on the FMV of the SPVs caused by the initial Solar Levy, which applied at a rate of 26% from 2011 to 2013 to PV plants commissioned in 2009 and 2010; and\n\n(b) 1 January 2014 for the effects on the FMV of the SPVs caused by the prolongation of the Solar Levy, which applied at a rate of 10% from 2014 onwards to PV plants commissioned in 2010.625\n\nSubmission, para. 85. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 69:4-8; Day 2, p. 11:2-11.\n\nSubmission, para. 86; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 3.13-3.16.\n\n493.\n\nFor Mr Edwards, using two valuation dates reflects the fact that both the initial Solar Levy of 2011 and its prolongation of 2014 were brought about by \"separate pieces of legislation that took effect at different times\".626\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 69:8-10; Day 2, pp. 29 *et seq*.\n\n494.\n\nMr Edwards applies the discounted cash flow (the \"**DCF**\") approach, which consists of estimating the SPVs' cash flows as at both valuation dates and discounting them at a cost of capital (WACC).627 Mr Edwards takes the position that the DCF method is also \"particularly suitable\" in the present circumstances, because its flexible nature allows account to be taken of the specific characteristics of each PV plant and because the inputs in the case of PV plants, including their cash flows and related costs, are relatively predictable.628\n\nSubmission, para. 87; Rejoinder, para. 371; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 3.18. *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 68:19-69:2; Day 2, pp. 11:20-12:2, 35:9-36:1.\n\nSubmission, paras. 88-90, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 3.19-3.20.\n\n495.\n\nBased on the parameters identified above, Mr Edwards calculates the losses suffered by the Claimants as a result of the Solar Levy in the following three steps. First, he derives the SPV's cost of capital (WACC) in the Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios at both valuation dates. In respect of the 1 January 2011 date, Mr Edwards applies a different discount to each of the Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios, a decision which he justifies on the basis of needing to account for the increased regulatory risk brought about by the imposition of the Solar Levy.629 He then estimates the SPV's cash flows in each Scenario and at both valuation dates and applies those WACCs to calculate the enterprise value of the SPVs. Finally, he assesses the Claimants' losses as the difference between the SPVs' enterprise value in the Counterfactual Scenario and their enterprise value in the Actual Scenario at each of the two valuation dates.630\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 35:14-36:14.\n\nSubmission, para. 101.\n\n496.\n\nMr Edwards also takes into consideration the three transactions concerning Energy 21's shares: the 2010 Transaction, the 2011 Transaction, and the 2015 Transaction.631 According to Mr Edwards, these arm's length transactions which took place on dates close to the two valuation dates \"offer direct evidence of what independent parties were prepared to pay for the assets or shares in question\".632\n\nSubmission, para. 91; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 71:14-18; Day 2, pp. 12:10-13:1, 25:16-24, 27:17-25.\n\nSubmission, para. 92, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 3.23. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 72:25-73:18; Day 2, pp. 25:16-24, 27:17-28:9. The Respondent, by contrast, suggests that the 2011 Transaction \"does not have the hallmarks of being an arm's length third-party transaction, and therefore it can't really be used as a marker for market value\". *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 132:10-17.\n\n497.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the methodology adopted by Mr Edwards to calculate the Claimants' losses is \"anything but complex\", considering that (i) the Solar Levy changed over time; (ii) the Claimants' investments (the shareholdings in Energy 21) were the subject of the three Transactions in the relevant period; and (iii) the damages related to 10 SPVs (and 31 PV plants).633\n\nReply, paras. 368, 379.\n\n498.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants assert that the Respondent's attempt to compare \"equity values at very different points in time is not straightforward because variables independent of the Measures in question can contribute to the changes in value over time\".634 Moreover, the Claimants point out that the \"sales prices\" that the Respondent uses to make its comparison ignore the shareholder loans in Energy 21 and therefore do not reflect the \"real value\" of the Transactions.635\n\nReply, paras. 428-429, *citing* **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 4.21.\n\nReply, para. 432.\n\n499.\n\nIn particular, Mr Edwards suggests that comparing the 2010 Transaction with the 2015 Transaction would be a complex exercise, because several factors changed over that period of time, namely (i) the risk that existed at the time of the 2010 Transaction that some plants could not be connected by the end of that year had disappeared by 2015; (ii) by the time of the 2015 Transaction, it was possible to forecast the performance of the PV plants with greater confidence in light of their historical performance; (iii) in 2015, the PV plants' right to receive the FiT was five years shorter than in 2010; and (iv) the cost of capital derived from first principles had fallen considerably between 2010 and 2015.636\n\nReply, para. 437; **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 4.21.\n\n500.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the fall in cost of capital and the higher-than-expected performance of the PV plants should have led to an increase in the equity value of Energy 21, the Claimants point out that the equity value implied in the 2015 Transaction in fact declined.637 However, the Claimants note that the minor contraction in the equity value was \"due to other factors independent of the Measures\" and that the Respondent \"can certainly not benefit from the effects of those external factors to avoid paying damages\".638\n\nReply, para. 438.\n\nReply, para. 438.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the calculation of the impact of the Solar Levy on Energy 21's power plants should be \"a fairly straightforward exercise\", given that the effect of the Levy was to reduce the gross revenues of specific solar plants by 26% during the period 2011-2013 and 10% from 2014 onward.639 As such, the Respondent criticizes the Claimants' use of what it calls a \"convoluted\" damages methodology, which involves multiple discount rates in different scenarios and an array of assumptions that are not supported by contemporaneous evidence.640\n\nRejoinder, para. 113.\n\nRejoinder, para. 114; Response, paras. 211-212. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 161:14-163:14; Day 2, pp. 52:7 *et seq*.\n\n502.\n\n*First*, the Respondent takes issue with Mr Edwards' choice of identifying the value of Energy 21 (i.e., the value of the holding company), rather than the cash flows of the solar plants, as the subject of the valuation.641 By valuing the holding company's value, the Respondent contends that Mr Edwards' calculations include entities owned by Energy 21 that were not affected by the Measures and require an assessment not only of the affected cash flows of the PV plants, but also of various other financial metrics of Energy 21.642\n\nResponse, para. 215(e); Rejoinder, para. 124(e).\n\nResponse, para. 215(e); Rejoinder, para. 124(e).\n\n503.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent contests the key assumptions underlying the entirety of Mr Edwards' damages assessment, as set out in detail below in Section VII.B.2(a).\n\n504.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal decides to award the Claimants some amount of compensation, the Respondent submits that it should rely on the simple quantification method present by Mr Peer.643 According to Mr Peer, the financial impact of the Solar Levy on the Claimants' PV plants can be assessed by, first, calculating the total amount of the Solar Levy to be paid by each of the Claimants' 2009 and 2010 plants over the duration of the RES support scheme and, second, discounting the total amount to the valuation date of 1 January 2011 using a single discount rate.644 The resulting figure, Mr Peer explains, represents the \"theoretical maximum damages, before taking account of any of the [Respondent]'s legal arguments for why no damages should be due in the circumstances of this case\".645\n\nResponse, para. 233; Rejoinder, para. 126.\n\nResponse, para. 233.\n\nResponse, para. 236, *citing* **RER-Peer-4**, para. 5.1.1.\n\n505.\n\nIn support of Mr Peer's methodology, the Respondent submits that Mr Peer's assessment would allow the Tribunal easily to assess the impact of the Solar Levy on each individual solar plant.646 Specifically, the Respondent asserts that Mr Peer's plant-specific calculations would allow the Tribunal to deduct from the damages assessment any solar plants falling beyond a particular cut-off date.647\n\nResponse, para. 237. *See* **RER-Peer-4**, p. 42, Table 5.\n\nResponse, para. 238.\n\n506.\n\n*Third*, the Respondent contends that the use of a single valuation date is consistent with the findings in the Partial Award, in which the Tribunal found that a single measure had contravened international law, namely, the introduction of the Solar Levy, which was defined as \"[a] levy imposed on revenue of solar installations [\u2026] for a period of three years for installations commissioned in 2009 and 2010, *and extended*, in reduced form, for installations commissioned in 2010\".648 In any event, Mr Peer opines that his final damages figure would not significantly change even if he were to use two valuation dates.649\n\nRejoinder, para. 128, *citing* Partial Award, page vii (definition of \"Solar Levy\") [emphasis added by the Respondent].\n\n**RER-Peer-5**, para. 6.2.4.\n\n507.\n\n*Finally*, the Respondent objects to Mr Edwards' reliance on the 2011 Transaction, because, in its view, the 2011 Transaction \"does not have the hallmarks of being an arm's length third-party transaction\".650 According to the Respondent, the sellers (GIGH and Natland Investment) and the buyer (Radiance) were already existing joint shareholders in Energy 21, and thus could not be considered entirely independent from each other.651 In addition, Mr Peer observes that the manner in which the proceeds of the 2011 Transaction were distributed, as well as the \"inappropriately low earn-out\" agreement, are matters, which raise further doubts as to the reliability of the 2011 Transaction as a proxy for the value of Energy 21.652\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 132:10-17. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 7:13 *et seq*.\n\nResponse, para. 215(b); Rejoinder, para. 124(b). *See* **RER-Peer 4**, paras. 3.4.10-3.4.13.\n\nRejoinder, para. 124(b), *citing* **RER-Peer-5**, paras. 3.4.14-3.4.15.\n\n**B.

The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) WACCs in the Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nMr Edwards determines the SPVs' cost of capital (WACC) at each valuation date (i.e., 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014) for both Actual Scenario and Counterfactual Scenario by taking into account two components:653\n\n(a) WACC implicit in the 2010, 2011, and 2015 Transactions, which is 8.4%, 11.0% and 9.0% respectively;654 and\n\n(b) WACC derived from \"first principles\", based on the finance theory, on the dates of those Transactions, which is 6.3%, 6.3% and 4.5% respectively.655\n\nSubmission, para. 103.\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.4-4.12; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 14:2-4; 2022 Hearing, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 119.\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, para. 4.13. Unlike Mr Peer's theoretical WACCs, Mr Edwards does not include a size premium in his calculations, noting that smaller companies do not necessarily generate higher returns than larger companies. *Compare* **CER-Edwards-2**, paras. 4.49-4.52 *with* **RER-Peer-4**, paras. 3.5.1-3.5.12.\n\n509.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the comparison of these WACC figures allows Mr Edwards to determine the impact of the Measures (i.e., collectively, the Solar Levy, the Income Tax Holiday, and the Original Depreciation Provisions) on the Claimants' investments and whether the change in the WACC would be attributable to the perception of regulatory risk due to the Measures.656 Indeed, Mr Edwards finds that there is an observable uplift in the WACC after the 2010 Transaction in both the 2011 and 2015 Transactions,657 which, in his view, confirms that the Solar Levy lowered investor confidence in the Czech Republic.658\n\nSubmission, paras. 105, 110.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 73:10-13; Day 2, pp. 14:15-18; 14:25-15:13; 2022 Hearing, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 119; 2022 Hearing, Mr Edwards' Presentation, slides 4-6.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 73:14-18; 2022 Hearing, Claimants' Opening Presentation, slide 119.\n\n510.\n\nWith respect to the 2010 Transaction, Mr Edwards submits that the 2.1% uplift in the WACC (8.4%-6.3%) could be attributable to the technological risk associated with the fact that, in May 2010, it was unclear how PV plants would perform in the Czech Republic's weather conditions.659 Conversely, he does not consider that the uplift reflects a risk perceived by the parties involved in the 2010 Transaction that the Czech Republic would introduce regulatory measures affecting the PV plants already connected to the grid and those to be connected by the end of 2010, as demonstrated in the presentations prepared by MEP.660 According to the Claimants, Mr Edwards' position that no regulatory risk was perceived by the Claimants at the date of the 2010 Transaction is consistent with the findings in the Partial Award.661\n\nSubmission, para. 107; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.17-4.20.\n\nSubmission, para. 108; Reply, para. 414; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.21-4.22. The Claimants also highlight the findings of the Partial Award that no regulatory risk of retrospective changes could have been perceived at the time of the 2010 Transaction. *See* Submission, para. 109, *referring to* Partial Award, para. 426.\n\nReply, para. 424, *referring to* Partial Award, para. 426.\n\n511.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that he failed to consider that the final price of the 2010 Transaction was adjusted to take into account the actual PV capacity that Energy 21 installed by the end of 2010, Mr Edwards clarifies that the 8.4% WACC implicit in the 2010 Transaction is based on the fact that MEP attributed a value of EUR 4.0 million to each MW of the PV plants that Energy 21 already had in operation.662 Therefore, this value, Mr Edwards asserts, is unaffected by the price adjustment, which only related to the plants to be connected in 2010.663\n\nReply, para. 407;

**CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.23-4.24; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 14:15-24 (*e.g.*, \"[w]hat we observe in the transactions is a pretty sharp increase in the cost of capital from 8.4% to 11% that coincides with the imposition of the First Solar Levy\"). *See also* Partial Award, paras. 103-104.\n\nReply, para. 409.\n\n513.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Edwards takes the position that the 2.4% premium applied in the 2015 Transaction is attributable to the Measures, explaining that, contrary to his expectation that the 2015 Transaction would be based on a WACC of 6.6% in view of the 1.8% decrease in the cost of capital in the first principles analysis (6.3%-4.5%), the WACC implicit in the 2015 Transaction was 9.0%.666 The 0.2% decrease from 2011, Mr Edwards adds, was not due to a reduced perception of regulatory risk, but possibly to the decline in bond yields and interest rates.667\n\n9.0% - 6.6% = 2.4%. *See* Submission, paras. 112-113; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 4.24.\n\nSubmission, paras. 113-114; Reply, para. 416; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.27-4.29.\n\n514.\n\nBased on these conclusions, Mr Edwards arrives at a WACC applicable in the Actual Scenario as at 1 January 2011 of 11.1%.668 The figure is derived by adding 0.1% to the WACC implicit in the 2011 Transaction (11.0%) in view of the fact that the cost of capital based on first principles on this date is 6.4%, which is 0.1% higher than the cost of capital of 6.3% derived from finance theory as at the date of the 2011 Transaction (i.e., 4 August 2011).669\n\nSubmission, para. 116;

Mr Edwards notes that the levy was set at 26% of FiT revenue, applicable from 2011 to 2013. *See* **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 5.9, *referring to* Partial Award, para. 126.\n\n528.\n\nAfter deriving a total undiscounted cash flow of CZK 10,029.3 million for the Actual Scenario at 1 January 2011 based on the estimates provided in the 2011 Forecasts,696 Mr Edwards applies the 11.1% WACC and obtains CZK 4.053.2 million as the enterprise value of the SPVs for the Actual Scenario as at 1 January 2011.697 Mr Edwards highlights that this value is only CZK 239.7 million lower than the value at which Energy 21 was actually sold *via* the 2011 Transaction, only a few months later in the same year.698\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, para. 5.23.\n\nSubmission, para. 131; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 5.24.\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 5.26-5.29.\n\n529.\n\nTo assess the enterprise value in the Counterfactual Scenario as at 1 January 2011, Mr Edwards assumes a hypothetical situation in which the initial Solar Levy was not introduced, but the Income Tax Holiday was repealed and the Original Depreciation Provisions were modified.699 In doing so, he relies on the same 2011 Forecasts, but increases the revenues for the PV plants put into operation in 2009 and 2010 by an amount equal to the Solar Levy subtracted in the Actual Scenario.700\n\nSubmission, para. 133; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 6.1.\n\nSubmission, para. 134; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 6.3.\n\n530.\n\nBased on these inputs, Mr Edwards obtains a total undiscounted cash flow of CZK 10,419.2 million, to which he applies the 9.1% WACC and reaches CZK 4,976.9 million as the enterprise value of the SPVs for the Counterfactual Scenario as at 1 January 2011.701\n\nSubmission, paras. 135-136; **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 6.4-6.5.\n\n531.\n\nAs for the enterprise value as at 1 January 2014, Mr Edwards conducts a similar exercise by relying on (i) a technical due diligence report prepared by OST Energy for Energy 21 in May 2014 (the \"**OST Due Diligence Report**\"), which contains, *inter alia*, the electricity generation forecast of Energy 21's PV plants to estimate revenues; and (ii) a spreadsheet containing the cash flow forecasts of the same PV plants from September 2015 onward (the \"**E21 Business Model**\") to estimate costs expected as at 1 January 2014.702\n\nSubmission, paras. 137-141, *referring to* Due diligence report prepared by OST Energy in May 2014 (**Ex.

CZK 923.6 million = CZK 4,976.9 million \u2013 CZK 4,053.2 million.\n\nSubmission, para. 150; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 9.3.\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 9.4-9.5. Mr Edwards notes that this assessment is conservative as he adopts an assumption that the technological risk remained stable until the 2015 Transaction. Had he had not done so, the increase in WACC attributable to the Solar Levy would have increased, and so would have the Claimants' damages. *See* **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.17-4.20, 9.3.\n\n538.\n\nAs at 1 January 2014, the Claimants submit that the diminution in the SPVs' enterprise value caused by the prolongation of the Solar Levy is CZK 319.6 million.714 When this amount is multiplied by 94.3825%, i.e., the Claimants' shareholding in Energy 21 as at 1 January 2014, the effective loss suffered by the Claimants, the Claimants assert, is equivalent to CZK 301.6 million.715 As opposed to the losses caused at the first valuation date, the Claimants contend that the losses suffered at this second valuation date \"depend[] exclusively on the impact of the prolonged Solar Levy on the PV plants cash flows\".716 This is because, as observed by Mr Edwards, the risk perception in the Czech PV market was not altered by the prolongation of the Solar Levy and, as a result, the WACC in the Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios at this valuation date remained identical.717\n\nSubmission, para. 152.\n\nSubmission, para. 152; **CER-Edwards-1**, para. 9.6.\n\nSubmission, para. 152.\n\nSubmission, para. 152; **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 9.8.\n\n539.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Claimants submit that the total losses suffered by them on both valuation dates amount to CZK 1,179.1 million.718\n\nSubmission, para. 153. CZK 1,179.1 million = CZK 877.5 million + CZK 301.6 million.\n\n**(e) Allocation of the damages among the Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nAs the final step, Mr Edwards allocates the total losses on a *pro rata* basis according to the shareholding of each Claimant as at each valuation date.719\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, para. 9.10.\n\n541.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimants recall that, as at 1 January 2011, the Claimants had (i) 52.42% shareholding in Radiance; (ii) 22.50% shareholding in GIHG; and (iii) 20.08% shareholding in Natland Investment (now NIG) and, indirectly, Natland Group (now Capamera).720 As at 1 January 2014, the only Claimant owning a shareholding in Energy 21 was Radiance which, as a result of the 2011 Transaction, came to own 95% of the shares (to be reduced to 94.3825% due to the option exercised by DCEMF Mezzanine).721\n\nSubmission, para. 155.\n\nSubmission, para. 155.\n\n542.\n\nAccordingly, Mr Edwards allocates the losses as follows:722\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **1 Jan 2011** | **1 Jan 2014** | **Total** |\n| **GIHG** | **207.8** | **-** | **207.8** |\n| **Natland** | **185.5** | **-** | **185.5** |\n| **Radiance** | **484.2** | **301.6** | **785.8** |\n| **Total** | **877.5** | **301.6** | **1,179.1** |\n\n**CER-Edwards-1**, para. 9.10, Table 9-4.\n\n543.\n\nAddressing the Respondent's argument that Radiance should not be awarded damages in connection with the shares in Energy 21 in the context of the 2011 Transaction, the Claimants submit that Radiance's decision to acquire an additional 42.6% of Energy 21 was a \"sound business decision which also allowed to mitigate the damages deriving from the Respondent's unlawful measures\".723 According to the Claimants, there was only a remote risk of the implementation of further retrospective measures at the relevant time.724 Additionally, the Claimants explain that, Radiance, as the only shareholder with significant financial resources, was prompted to acquire the shares of Natland Energy Investment and GIHG to cope with the financial situation stemming from the introduction of the Solar Levy and the consequent reduction of the cash flow, which put at risk the repayment of the loans and the solvency of Energy 21.725\n\nReply, para. 340.\n\nMEP Presentation, 25 July 2011, slide 5 (**Ex.

This is because the regulatory risk perceived by the Claimants with respect to their PV plants before 9 November 2009 was \"at most, extremely limited\"; and\n\n(c) not a single PV plant commenced construction works after 9 November 2010, which would require a reduction in damages that is higher than that indicated in point (b) above.730\n\nReply, para. 185.\n\n549.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to determine that the relevant moment coincided with the date on which a PV plant obtained the ERO License, the Claimants submit that the reduction in damages for the PV plants that obtained the ERO License after the cut-off date should be equitably determined based on the following guidelines:\n\n(a) no reduction in damages for the 2009 PV plants for the reason explained in paragraph 548\n\n(a) above;\n\n(b) a very low reduction for the 2010 PV plants that obtained ERO License after the cut-off date chosen by the Tribunal, but before 9 November 2010, for the reasons explained in paragraph 548 (b) above;\n\n(c) a small reduction of the losses allocated to the 2010 PV plants that obtained an ERO License between 9 November and 14 December 2010, because until Act No. 402/2010 was enacted on 14 December 2010, the Claimants \"had no certainty that such risk [of regulatory changes affecting their PV plants] would materialize\"; and\n\n(d) a higher reduction in damages for the PV plants that obtained an ERO License between 15 December and 31 December 2010.731\n\nReply, para. 186 [emphasis added by the Claimants].\n\n550.\n\nAs to the Respondent's contention that damages should be reduced due to the Claimants' legal violations in constructing and commissioning PV plants, the Claimants recall that, in the first phase of the proceedings, the Respondent abandoned the illegality objection with respect to the plants and never claimed a reduction in damages arising from the purported illegalities.732 Therefore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's illegality claim should be dismissed in this phase of the proceedings.733 In any event, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's illegality argument lacks merit, given that the Czech authorities never questioned the plants' entitlement to FiT and the validity of the relevant ERO licenses.734\n\nReply, paras. 328-330. *See also* Rejoinder of 6 September 2016, paras. 184, 187.\n\nReply, paras. 332-335.\n\nReply, para. 334.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Flaws in the Claimants' damages analysis**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent challenges Mr Edwards' damages quantification approach on the grounds that the key assumption underlying his use of the dual WACC, namely that investors' perception of regulatory risk increased following the introduction of the Solar Levy and resulted in a higher cost of capital, is unsupported by evidence.735 According to the Respondent, the supposed increase in the perception of regulatory risk comprising a \"regulatory risk premium\"\u2014a proportion of which Mr Edwards adds to the Actual WACC\u2014is speculative, and inflates the Claimants' damages by CZK 560.1 million.736\n\nResponse, para. 218; Rejoinder, para. 116. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 163:15-164:3; Day 2, pp. 66:20 *et seq.,*123:10-20.\n\nResponse, para. 220, *citing* **CER-Edwards-1**, paras. 4.24, 4.35-4.39.\n\n552.\n\n*First*, the Respondent maintains its challenge that the \"regulatory risk\" theory advanced by Mr Edwards is not based on any contemporaneous evidence.737 Addressing the Claimants' reliance on certain contemporaneous documents to argue otherwise, the Respondent points out that those documents either do not discuss the observed increase in the cost of capital of solar plants in the Czech Republic (let alone of the Claimants' solar plants specifically) due to greater regulatory risk or cannot be considered as objective evidence, given that they were prepared by an interested party in this arbitration or were prepared with the intention of being used in this arbitration.738\n\nResponse, para. 218; Rejoinder, paras. 116, 120. *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 163:15-164:3.\n\nRejoinder, para. 119(a), *referring to* Letter from Ms Hedegaard and Mr Oettinger to Mr Kocourek, 11 January 2011 (**Ex.

**RER-Peer-4**, para. 3.4.9.\n\n**(b) Respondent's calculation of the Claimants' damages**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nAs stated above, the Respondent submits that Mr Peer presents a \"simpler, or more intuitive\" methodology to calculate the maximum theoretical damages suffered by the Claimants as a result of the Solar Levy: Mr Peer (i) calculates the total amount of the Solar Levy to be paid by each of the Claimants' 2009 and 2010 plants over the duration of the RES support scheme; and (ii) discounts the total amount to the valuation date of 1 January 2011, using a single discount rate.755\n\nResponse, para. 233.\n\n560.\n\nUsing a discount rate of 8.1%, which is lower than the rates employed by Mr Edwards in his Actual and Counterfactual Scenarios, Mr Peer derives CZK 540.1 million as at 1 January 2022, which represents the reduction in the Claimants' 2009 and 2010 solar plants due to the Solar Levy.756\n\nResponse, para. 234; **RER-Peer-4**, para. 5.2.7.\n\n561.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr Peer's maximum damages figure is equivalent to approximately 8.6% of the plants' overall FiT revenues, calculated from 2011 until the end of the PV plants' expected economic lifetime.757 As Mr Peer notes, such reduction has only a small impact on the overall IRR of the Claimants' PV plants because, following the introduction of the Solar Levy, the IRR decreased from an average of 11.6% to 9.7%.758\n\nResponse, para. 235.\n\nResponse, para. 235; **RER-Peer-4**, para. 5.3.2. *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 95:7-8.\n\n**(c) Reduction in damages**\n----------------------------\n\n562.\n\nAs discussed above in Section V.D.2, the Respondent submits that the Claimants are not entitled to damages in connection with the investments that they undertook at a time when they knew that it was likely that the Czech Government would enact measures that would have an impact on their plans to commission new solar installations.759\n\nResponse, para. 250.\n\n563.\n\nAccordingly, in order to calculate the appropriate reduction in the amount of damages, the Respondent proposes to (i) use 25 August 2009 as the cut-off date, i.e., the date as of which the Claimants are deemed to have had sufficient knowledge of the Czech Government's desire to put a stop to the solar boom; and (ii) calculate the impact of excluding from the damages assessment the plants with respect to which the Claimants are deemed to have assumed the risk of regulatory change.760 In this respect, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' suggestion that damages should be reduced in proportion to the Claimants' perception of the risk of regulatory changes, which varied over time.761 Rather, it is the Respondent's view that any plants that fall beyond the cut- off date should be excluded altogether from the damages assessment.762 The Respondent adds that a PV plant that obtained an ERO License or, alternatively, began the construction works after the cut-off date, should be excluded altogether from the damages assessment.763\n\nRejoinder, para. 129.\n\nRejoinder, para. 136.\n\nRejoinder, para. 136.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 251(c), 278.\n\n564.\n\nRejecting the Claimants' assertion that the Tribunal should reduce damages upon \"equitable\" principles, the Respondent argues that the applicable provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules expressly bar *ex aequo et bono* determinations by the Tribunal, absent an express agreement of the Parties.764\n\nRejoinder, para. 13(n).\n\n565.\n\nUsing the 25 August 2009 cut-off date, Mr Peer calculates that the Claimants' maximum theoretical damages are CZK 2,359,030.765 Mr Peer's calculations regarding the impact on quantum of excluding the plants that fall outside the cut-off date are as follows:766\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Total cash flow impact of Solar Levy** |\n|  | **Plants excluded on basis of ERO license dates** | **Plants excluded on basis of earliest possible construction commencement dates** |\n| **24 August 2009 (Ministry's press release)** | **-CZK 2,359,030** | -CZK 70,604,526 |\n| Alternative cut-off dates | 17 March 2010 | -CZK 122,139,224 | -CZK 137,414,357 |\n| 27 August 2010 | -CZK 137,414,357 | -CZK 293,115,167 |\n| 9 November 2010 | -CZK 205,914,181 | -CZK 540,143,770 |\n\nResponse, para. 278. *See also* **CER-Edwards-2**, para. 5.4, Table 6.\n\nResponse, para. 279, Figure 10.\n\n566.\n\nAs the above figures illustrate, the Respondent stresses that, depending on the cut-off date used and the method of determining the relevant solar plants, the impact of the Solar Levy on the cash flows of the Claimants' solar plants ranges from a reduction of CZK 2.4 million to CZK 540.1 million.767\n\nResponse, para. 280.\n\n567.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent avers that plants affected by legal violations which Claimants committed during the construction and commission process should be excluded from the damages calculations.768 In particular, the Respondent notes that some of the violations appear to have occurred at the very end of 2010, after the Solar Levy was announced.769\n\nResponse, para. 281. *See also* Statement of Defense, para. 200.\n\nResponse, para. 282.\n\n**(d) Radiance is not entitled to any compensation**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nNotwithstanding its primary position that no damages should be awarded to the Claimants, the Respondent submits that there are additional reasons to reject Radiance's claims for compensation in relation to the 42.6% shareholding in Energy 21 that it acquired *via* the 2011 Transaction.770\n\nResponse, para. 285.\n\n569.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Radiance knowingly assumed the risk that the increase in its shareholding in Energy 21 would be affected by both the Solar Levy and the anticipated extension of the Solar Levy.771 In this respect, the Respondent points out that Radiance's acquisition in August 2011 occurred (i) after the Solar Levy had been enacted; (ii) after Radiance had already lodged a notice of dispute with the Czech Republic; and (iii) at a time when Radiance's principals \"plainly expected further measures, including the extension of the Solar Levy\".772 According to the Respondent, Radiance's own deal documents show that such acquisition was not necessary to keep the company operating.773 The Respondent subsequently takes the view that Radiance acquired additional shares in Energy 21 \"not because it had to, but because it expected significant potential upside from doing so\".774\n\nRejoinder, para. 150.\n\nRejoinder, para. 149. *See also* Response, paras. 286-288.\n\nRejoinder, para. 152, *referring to* **CWS-Baudon-1**, Annex VI, Minutes of IAC Meeting, 14 June 2011, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, para. 152.\n\n570.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that Radiance did not suffer any injury to its increased shareholding as a result of the introduction of the Solar Levy or its extension because, according to Radiance's internal documents, Radiance purchased the shares at a discounted valuation, specifically at a 48% discount.775 In particular, with respect to the 2011 Transaction, the Respondent notes that Energy 21 shares were worth only approximately EUR 900,000 more\u2014 and not approximately EUR 15.4 million more\u2014than the sum that Radiance paid to the sellers.776\n\nIt follows therefrom, the Respondent argues, that the discounted valuation at which Radiance acquired its additional shares reflected the cost of the Solar Levy and its prolongation.777\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nResponse, para. 168, *referring to* MEP Presentation, 25 July 2011, slide 6 (**Ex.

Claimants have failed to identify any compensable injury that was caused by the Solar Levy;\n\nb. Claimants and their expert have presented an unsound damages methodology;\n\nc. the key assumption underlying Claimants' damages model (namely, that the Solar Levy created a perception of regulatory risk, which in turn increased Claimants' cost of capital) is unsubstantiated;\n\nd. Claimants' damages model does not take proper account of the Tribunal's findings in the Partial Award; and\n\ne. Claimants have not excluded from their valuation the financial impact of decisions of their own, which are not attributable to the Czech Republic (such as Claimants' assumption of risk, and Radiance's decision to acquire additional Energy 21 shares in August 2011).780\n\nRejoinder, para. 165.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 166-170, *referring to* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

Joint Expert Report**\n--------------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe Joint Expert Report sets out the Parties' quantum experts' joint comments, as well as any outstanding areas of disagreements, concerning (i) the allocation of the disputed regulatory risk uplift between the Solar Levy and the other amendments that, together with the Solar Levy, constitute the Measures;781 and (ii) the calculation of IRRs for individual PV plants.782\n\nJoint Expert Report, pp. 3-4. The Joint Expert Report uses the term 'First Solar Levy', which refers to the levy brought into effect by way of Act No. 402/2010, and not its extension that was effected by Act 310/2013.\n\nJoint Expert Report, p. 4.\n\n**1. Allocation of the regulatory risk uplift**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nIn respect of the allocation of regulatory risk uplift resulting from the Solar Levy, Mr Peer and Mr Edwards concur that \"the impact of the First Solar Levy is less than 2% larger than the impact of the other Measures\", if Mr Edwards' quantification of the valuation impact of the Solar Levy *vis-\u00e0-vis* the other of the Measures (the \"**NPV Impact Calculation**\") were to be used.783 Mr Peer and Mr Edwards, however, continue to disagree whether any allocation of the regulatory risk premium is warranted.784\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 2.3. The experts use the term \"First Solar Levy\" to refer to the levy brought into effect by way of Act No. 402/2010, and not its extension that was effected by Act 310/2013.\n\n*See* Joint Expert Report, paras. 2.4-2.5.\n\n**(a) Mr Edwards' position**\n----------------------------\n\n574.\n\nMr Edwards rejects Mr Peer's characterization of his conclusions regarding the regulatory risk premium as arbitrary and unsubstantiated, noting that, whilst Mr Peer has proposed alternative valuation methodologies, he has not performed any.785 In reference to Mr Peer's proposed \"event study\", Mr Edwards notes that neither he, nor Mr Peer has been able to conduct such an exercise, principally because there were no Czech PV plant operators with shares traded on exchanges in 2010 and 2011.786 Mr Edwards similarly rejects Mr Peer's proposal of surveying industry participants as an approach that would lack precision.787\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, paras. 5.1-5.2.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.4. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 37:22-39:1.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.6.\n\n575.\n\nMr Edwards acknowledges that the figures he shared with Mr Peer do suggest that the cash flow impact of the Solar Levy was equivalent to that of the other Measures.788 However, Mr Edwards argues that a 50:50 allocation would not properly reflect investors' perceptions of risk, because, in his view, the imposition of the Solar Levy undermined confidence in the Czech Republic's regulatory regime to a greater extent than, for instance, the repeal of the Income Tax Holiday.789\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.9.\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 2.5.\n\n576.\n\nConsequently, considering that the appropriate allocation would be \"somewhere between 50:50 and 100:0 (in favor of the Solar Levy)\", Mr Edwards opines that the 75:25 allocation (i.e., 75% to the Solar Levy and 25% to the Other Measures) is appropriate in the circumstances.790\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.10.\n\n**(b) Mr Peer's position**\n--------------------------\n\n577.\n\nMr Peer objects to Mr Edwards' approach of estimating a regulatory risk premium and therefore finds any allocation of any such uplift between the Solar Levy and the other Measures inappropriate.791 Mr Peer maintains that Mr Edwards' calculation of the uplift at 2.6% is unsubstantiated, particularly due to \"inaccurately\" derived implied discount rates from both the 2010 Transaction and the 2011 Transaction.792\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 2.4, Appendix A, para. 4.1.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.1, *referring to* **RER-Peer-4**, paras. 2.2.2(a), 2.2.6-2.2.7.\n\n578.\n\nIn any event, should the Tribunal decide that a change in the regulatory risk must be reflected in the damages assessment, Mr Peer recommends use of an \"event study\", which empirically analyzes the impact of the occurrence of an event on the value of an asset based on the assumption that \"markets are rational and the effects of events are immediately reflected in the resulting pricing\".793 Contrary to Mr Edwards' contention, Mr Peer opines that, in circumstances where no publicly listed companies exist, an event study can still be conducted by using industry surveys and/or references to a number of market transactions.794 Such a \"focused approach\", Mr Peer continues, would allow one to infer statistically how share values reacted to an event, in this case, the imposition of the Solar Levy.795\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.2. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 35:1-36:19.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.2.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, paras. 4.2-4.3.\n\n579.\n\nIn Mr Peer's view, an analysis based on an event study would address the accompanying effects of the public debate regarding the need for legislative changes that would gradually have been reflected in the market values.796 The analysis, Mr Peer adds, would show that the actual implementation of the Solar Levy would not be the decisive factor, nor would it have been an isolated factor, and it would thus address Mr Edwards' flawed assumption that regulatory risk did not emerge until 1 January 2011 with the imposition of the Solar Levy.797\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.3.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.3.\n\n580.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to allocate the purported regulatory risk uplift based on Mr Edwards' NPV Impact Calculation, Mr Peer maintains that the 75:25 allocation (i.e., 2.0 and 0.6) proposed by Mr Edwards is arbitrary.798 Instead, Mr Peer recommends that the Tribunal uses the 50:50 allocation, which would reduce the damages by CZK 210 million.799\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.4.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.5.\n\n**(c) The Claimants' position**\n-------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, Mr Peer has failed to engage constructively with the barriers that Mr Edwards cited as precluding the possibility of an event study.800 The Claimants further argue that Mr Peer has failed to indicate how, in practical terms, an event study would be conducted.801\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 12-15.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 14-15.\n\n582.\n\nThe Claimants contest Mr Peer's 50:50 allocation of the risk uplift, asserting that he did not properly engage with the factors surrounding the imposition of the Solar Levy.802 By way of example, the Claimants note that Mr Peer failed to consider that the FiT was the \"primary reason\" for which investors made investments in the Respondent's RES sector, that the Solar Levy directly affected the FiT, and that the Solar Levy, as a result, had a \"particularly destabilising\" impact on investor confidence.803\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 16-18.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 17.\n\n583.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants recommend that the Tribunal accept Mr Edwards' allocation of 75% of the regulatory risk uplift, which, they say, is consistent with contemporaneous evidence and \"reflects the investors' true perception of the uplift to regulatory risk at the relevant time\".804\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras.18-19.\n\n**(d) The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nThe Respondent echoes Mr Peer's suggestion that an event study would be an appropriate mechanism by which to assess the impact of the Solar Levy on the perception of regulatory risk in the Czech Republic.805 In the Respondent's view, the fact that Mr Edwards has raised no methodological or substantive objection to conducting an event study would suggest that Mr Edwards accepts, in principle, that an event study is an appropriate approach.806 The Respondent, however, acknowledges that there is a dearth of evidence on the record in this arbitration by reference to which any such study could be conducted.807\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 17-18.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 19.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 18.\n\n585.\n\nIn terms of the actual allocation of risk uplift, the Respondent states that regard should be had to the NPV Impact Calculation, deeming it the \"one piece of quantitative impact analysis\" presented by Mr Edwards.808 The Respondent invokes the Joint Expert Report's finding that, as per the NPV Impact Calculation, the impact of the Solar Levy was less than 2% larger than that of the other Measures.809 As such, it agrees with Mr Peer's suggestion that he would, *arguendo*, allocate the risk uplift between the Solar Levy and the other Measures on a 50:50 basis.810\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 21, *referring to* Joint Expert Report, para. 2.3.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 22.\n\n**2. IRR calculations**\n-----------------------\n\n586.\n\nAs requested by the Tribunal, Mr Edwards has calculated the IRRs for the Claimants' PV plants in three scenarios: (i) the scenario in which none of the Measures was implemented (the \"**No Measures Scenario**\"); (ii) the scenario involving only the repeal of the Income Tax Holiday and the modification of the Original Depreciation Provisions, and not the imposition of the Solar Levy (the \"**Other Measures Scenario**\"); (iii) the scenario in which all Measures were implemented (the \"**All Measures Scenario**\").811 Mr Peer, in turn, provides a set of IRR calculations for the Other Measures Scenario, the only scenario which had not been included in his prior reports.812\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 3.1.\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 1.3(a). *See* **RER-Peer-1**, para. 4.8.3, Table 5; **RER-Peer-2**, para. 2.2.10, Table 2; **RER-Peer-4**, para. 5.4.11, Table 7; Joint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.6.\n\n587.\n\nThe IRR calculations by each expert for each Scenario are as follows:813\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Mr Peer** | **Mr Edwards** |\n|  | Range: 9.9% to 17.9% | Range: 8.2% to 17.3% |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **No Measures Scenario** | Collective: 12.7% | Collective: 12% |\n| **Other Measures** | Range: | 9.0% to 15.9% | Range: 7.4% to 15.1% |\n| **Scenario** | Collective: 11.5% | Collective: 10.7% |\n| **All Measures** | Range: | 7.0% to 13.8% | Range: 6.3% to 12.7% |\n| **Scenario** | Collective: 9.8% | Collective: 9.1% |\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 3.2.\n\n588.\n\nThe outstanding disagreements regarding the experts' IRR calculations principally relate to (i) the experts' respective inclusion and exclusion of certain costs from their IRR calculations; (ii) the differing forecasts on which the experts rely in making their calculations; and (iii) the consistency in approaches to damages and IRR calculations.\n\n**(a) Mr Edwards's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n589.\n\nAccording to Mr Edwards, the difference between his and Mr Peer's IRR calculations results from three factors: (i) the inclusion of land purchase costs and estimated resale proceeds in his calculations, and Mr Peer's correlative exclusion of them; (ii) his use of the 2011 Forecasts and Mr Peer's use of his own forecasts; and (iii) the inclusion of forecasted maintenance capital expenditure in his calculations, while Mr Peer has excluded such expenditure.814\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.11.\n\n590.\n\n*First*, Mr Edwards argues that, in terms of their cost, PV plants cannot be divorced from the land on which they are situated,815 since cash flows are necessary either to purchase or lease land that is ultimately used for the operation of the PV plants.816 Although this is the approach taken by the ERO, Mr Edwards opines that excluding land costs is tantamount to excluding other elements of investment or operational costs, leading to an overstatement of the financial returns attached to any given PV plant.817\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, paras. 5.13, 5.16.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, paras. 5.13, 5.16.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.16.\n\n591.\n\n*Second*, Mr Edwards justifies the use of the 2011 Forecasts, subject to a number of small adjustments, because they were made closest in time to the construction of the PV plants.818 These early forecasts, Mr Edwards argues, best reflect attitudes at the commencement of the projects' lives and they provide a comparator with the PV plants' subsequent performance.819\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, paras. 5.17-5.22.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.17.\n\n592.\n\n*Finally*, Mr Edwards justifies his inclusion of forecasted maintenance expenditure on account of the fact that Energy 21, unlike other PV plant operators, withholds maintenance costs from operating costs.820 In Mr Edwards' view, without specifically factoring it in, forecasted maintenance expenditure \u2014 a \"real cash cost\" \u2014 would not be included in any given PV plant's financial performance calculations.821 Mr Edwards therefore concludes that Mr Peer's exclusion of maintenance costs from his own calculations has resulted in a slight overstatement of his IRRs.822\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.22.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.22.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix B, para. 5.22.\n\n**(b) Mr Peer's position**\n--------------------------\n\n593.\n\nMr Peer highlights his finding that in each of the three Scenarios, the Claimants' plants achieved an IRR of at least 7% and, therefore, fell within the range approved by the Commission.823\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.6.\n\n594.\n\nTo the extent that his IRR calculations differ from those of Mr Edwards, Mr Peer notes that Mr Edwards' methodology departs from that of the ERO.824 Specifically, he disagrees with Mr Edwards' inclusion of the costs associated with land for each PV plant.825 Likewise, Mr Peer states that Mr Edwards includes forecast maintenance capital as a separate item in his calculations, which does not feature in the ERO's own methodology.826\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, paras. 4.8-4.9.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, paras. 4.8-4.9, *referring to* **RER-Peer-4**, para. 4.5.2.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.10.\n\n595.\n\nSeparately, Mr Peer finds that Mr Edwards' approaches to IRR calculations and the calculation of damages are inconsistent.827 For instance, he states that Mr Edwards employs a different set of inputs for both his IRR and damages calculations, resulting in a lower IRR and higher damages calculation.828 In a similar vein, Mr Peer notes that Mr Edwards' damages calculations relied upon various sales forecasts, whereas his IRR calculations did not, thus in turn lowering the IRR figures that he proffers.829\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, paras. 4.11, 4.13.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.11.\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.13.\n\n596.\n\nLastly, Mr Peer asserts that there is a number of other general discrepancies between his and Mr Edwards' approaches, such as a difference in their forecasts of the timing of the initial capital expenditure and of the timing for the cash flows each year.830\n\nJoint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.15.\n\n**(c) The Claimants' position**\n-------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nThe Claimants submit that an IRR analysis is irrelevant both for the purposes of a damages assessment and in relation to any outstanding State aid issues.831\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 23-30.\n\n598.\n\nIn terms of damages, the Claimants argue that an IRR analysis is irrelevant in light of the Tribunal's findings in the Partial Award.832 Unlike in a number of earlier cases involving RES and IRR analyses, the Claimants assert that this Tribunal found that investors were entitled to stable subsidies.833 The Claimants further note that the Partial Award did not contain instructions to the Parties to produce an IRR analysis for the purposes of this phase of proceedings.834\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 25.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 25.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 25.\n\n599.\n\nIn terms of State aid issues, the Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that an IRR analysis leaves the Claimants with zero damages under EU State aid.835 In particular, the Claimants consider that the Respondent's argument is predicated on the wrongful assumption that EU law is part of the legal framework in this case.836\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 26.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 27. *See* paragraphs 407-411 above.\n\n600.\n\nThe Claimants criticize Mr Peer's decision to exclude both land purchase costs and maintenance capital expenditure from his results, because, according to the Claimants, they are costs that are \"intrinsic to the investment\", without which, \"no sensible return on investment can be calculated\".837\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, paras. 36-37, 40, 50.\n\n601.\n\nIn respect of land purchase costs, the Claimants assert that the ERO's modeling was intentionally notional and, therefore, excluded plant-specific information, such as land costs, to set FiTs for PV plants across the whole Czech Republic.838 This, the Claimants contends, does not need to be mirrored when considering actual, operational plants, such as those that form part of Energy 21's portfolio.839 The Claimants echo Mr Edwards' position that land is an \"unavoidable\" part of an investment into a PV plant which must be included in a true IRR calculations.840 As such, the Claimants take the view that it is appropriate to reflect both land costs and land receipts in the IRR calculations.841\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\n602.\n\nFurther, the Claimants argue that Mr Peer is not consistent or coherent in applying the ERO's approach.842 In particular, the Claimants note that whilst Mr Peer excludes land purchase costs from his calculations, he includes land leasing costs, even though there is no rational basis to distinguish between the two.843\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 39.\n\n603.\n\nAs to Mr Peer's exclusion of maintenance capital expenditure from his calculations, the Claimants reiterate that the ERO's notional approach, upon which Mr Peer bases his decision, is not necessarily appropriate in these circumstances.844 In addition, the Claimants outline that the ERO, in any case, included maintenance capital expenditure in a separate category of operational costs, whereas Mr Peer excludes this cost altogether from his calculations.845\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 40.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 40.\n\n604.\n\nNoting that the 2011 Forecasts were \"actual contemporaneous forecasts used by investors at the relevant time\", the Claimants argue that the 2011 Forecasts provide the \"best evidence\" of predicted performance as at the date when the Measures came into effect.846 The Claimants also dismiss the materiality of any inconsistency between the forecasts Mr Edwards used for damages calculations and the 2011 Forecasts, suggesting that a damage valuation is a different exercise to an IRR calculation and that, in any case, the differences cited by Mr Peer are minimal.847\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 41.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 42, *referring to* Joint Expert Report, Appendix A, paras. 4.11-4.12.\n\n605.\n\nIn response to Mr Peer's criticism that Mr Edwards uses different sales forecasts for his IRR and damages calculations,848 the Claimants posit, *inter alia*, that forecasts made during the projects' infancy should be used, because any performance thereafter was at the investor's risk849 and that, from an economic perspective, attributing impact to the Solar Levy and the other Measures requires the use of forecasts made close to their imposition.850 In fact, the Claimants aver that Mr Peer incorrectly presents Mr Edwards' approach, neglecting the fact that he uses sales forecasts only when calculating damages from the Solar Levy's prolongation, and not those associated with its initial introduction.851\n\n*See* paragraph 595 above.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 43(i).\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 43(ii).\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 43(iv).\n\n606.\n\nAnalyzing both sets of IRRs, the Claimants conclude that some of Mr Peer's figures do not support the Respondent's broader contentions.852 For instance, Mr Peer places the IRR of PV plants in 2010 in the No Measures Scenario at 12.7%, a figure lower than the IRR for several individual plants after the implementation of the Measures.853 According to the Claimants, this runs contrary to the Respondent's narrative that the Measures generally shifted IRRs for PV plants from an unacceptable to an acceptable level.854\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 47.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 47.\n\nClaimants' Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 47.\n\n**(d) The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the IRR calculations are relevant in this arbitration, invoking, *inter alia*, the Commission's decision to approve the Subsidies on the condition that the solar plants' returns fell within a specified range of acceptable rates of 6.3% to 8.4%.855\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 6(e), *referring to* Decision (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n608.\n\nThe Respondent points out that a significant level of consensus exists between the figures of the two experts.856 For instance, it highlights both experts' agreement that in the All Measures Scenario, Claimants' PV plants achieve returns of 6.3%, which is within the range of returns approved by the Commission.857 Similarly, it points to the experts' estimates of the Solar Levy's impact on the plants' IRRs, noting that for the 2009 PV plants, both experts forward identical estimates of 1.00%, whereas for 2010 PV plants, the experts propose near-identical figures of 2.4% and 2.5%.858\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 9(a), *referring to* Joint Expert Report, Appendix A, 4.16.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 9(b). Mr Peer places the impact at 2.4%, whereas Mr Edwards calculates it at 2.5%.\n\n609.\n\nThe Respondent attributes the differences between the experts' IRR calculations to Mr Edwards' decision to include both land purchase costs and forecast maintenance capital expenditure in his calculations, which, it notes, is inconsistent with the ERO's methodology.859 Likewise, the Respondent echoes Mr Peer's finding that Mr Edwards' IRR calculations rely on different inputs to those which were used in his damages calculations.860 The Respondent queries Mr Edwards' decision not to present updated damages calculations using the new inputs; had that been done, it would have reduced his estimates of loss.861\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 10.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 11, *referring to* Joint Expert Report, Appendix A, para. 4.11.\n\nRespondent's Submission on the Joint Expert Report, para. 12.\n\n**D. Tax Gross-UP**\n-------------------\n\n610.\n\nAs indicated above, Natland Investment and Natland Group seek compensation collectively for the amount of damages in this arbitration in respect of their 20.08% interest in Energy 21.862 In the event the compensation for the losses that Natland Investment and Natland Group are claiming collectively is paid to Natland Investment, the Claimants submit that Natland Investment would suffer a further significant head of damages represented by the adverse tax consequences pursuant to Dutch law. Accordingly, such additional head of damages, the Claimants argue, must be compensated in accordance with the principle of full reparation.\n\n*See* Section V.B above.\n\n611.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees, arguing that international law does not support the award of tax gross-ups and that any alleged adverse tax consequences are speculative and would arise from Natland Investment's own choices and, therefore, they are not attributable to the Respondent.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nThe Claimants submit that an award of damages issued in Natland Investment's favor would be subject to Dutch corporate income tax pursuant to Section 22 of the Dutch Corporate Income Tax Act (the \"**CITA**\"): the amount awarded in this arbitration up to EUR 245,000 would be taxed at 15%, while any sum over and above that amount would be taxed at 25%.863 This is because, according to the Claimants, the arbitral award in Natland's favor would not qualify for the exemption laid down in Section 13(1) of CITA, which provides that \"benefits arising from a participation [\u2026] relating to the acquisition or disposal of that participation\" are tax-exempt insofar as a causal link exists between those benefits and the participation.864 As explained by Mr Opmeer, this participation exemption aims to avoid the risk of double taxation of the same profit within a corporate structure by \"exempting from taxation the profit deriving from the parent company's participation in the subsidiary at the parent company level\" such that \"the profit is tax only at the subsidiary level\".865\n\nSubmission, para. 165; **CER-Opmeer-1**, p. 4. *See* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 78:11-20.\n\nSubmission, para. 160; **CER-Opmeer-1**, p. 5.\n\nReply, para. 458; **CER-Opmeer-2**, para. 5.\n\n613.\n\nAbsent the Solar Levy, the Claimants assert that the dividends and the proceeds derived from the sale of the shares in Energy 21, which Natland Investment would have received, would have been exempt from Dutch corporate income tax, because \"a causal link would have undoubtedly existed between them and Natland Investment's participation in Energy 21\".866 Conversely, the Claimants contend that a compensation award in favor of Natland Investment would not be covered by the participation exemption in Section 13(1) of CITA for the following reasons:\n\n(a) there is \"no risk of double taxation\", because Natland Investment is the only entity to receive compensation;867 and\n\n(b) the causality requirement between the benefit and the parent company's shareholding in the subsidiary is not met, because the compensation awarded to Natland Investment is not derived from Natland Investment's shareholding in Energy 21, but rather it is \"a direct consequence of the Czech Republic's breach of its international law obligations\".868\n\nSubmission, para. 161.\n\nReply, para. 461, *citing* **CER-Opmeer-2**, para. 24.\n\nSubmission, para. 163; Reply, para. 461, *citing* **CER-Opmeer-2**, para. 25. See also Reply, paras. 459-460.\n\n614.\n\nAs such, the Claimants take the view that the loss of the favorable tax treatment in the Netherlands is one of the consequences that the Claimants suffered from the introduction of the Solar Levy, for which the Respondent must compensate Natland Investment under international law.869\n\nSubmission, para. 166.\n\n615.\n\nEven if Natland Investment and E21 Holding could have concluded a price adjustment agreement at the time of the sale of Natland Investment's shareholding in Energy 21 in order to shield a possible arbitral award from negative tax consequences in the Netherlands,870 such an agreement, the Claimants posit, would have merely shifted the adverse tax consequences to which the compensation award would be subject in the Netherlands from Natland Investment to Radiance, given that Radiance wholly owns E21 Holding.871 Therefore, for the Claimants, the hypothetical price adjustment agreement does not change the fact that, absent the Solar Levy, no adverse tax consequences would have existed for either Natland Investment or Radiance.872\n\nThe Claimants note that, in the absence of any indication as to the type of agreement Natland Investment and Energy 21 could have concluded, as well as its terms and its effects on the tax regime applicable to the compensation award, the Respondent cannot escape its international law obligation to make the Claimants \"whole\" based on a \"completely hypothetical scenario\". *See* Reply, para. 451.\n\nReply, paras. 453-454.\n\nReply, para. 455.\n\n616.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, contrary to the cases relied upon by the Respondent in which the tribunals dismissed an award of tax gross-ups, they have discharged their burden of establishing that an arbitral award in Natland Investment's favor would necessarily be taxed in the Netherlands, as well as the tax rate applicable to the compensation award pursuant to Dutch law.873\n\nReply, paras. 443-448, *referring to* *Mobil Investments Canada Inc. and Murphy Oil Corporation v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n619.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that Natland Investment is entitled to a tax gross-up under international law.876 Pointing out that the Claimants have failed to identify a single investor-State tribunal that has made such an award, the Respondent asserts that tribunals have rejected tax gross-up requests as a matter of law and international arbitration practice, rather than because a claimant had failed to carry its burden of proof.877\n\nResponse, para. 289. *See generally* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 152:19-156:13.\n\nRejoinder, para. 160.\n\n620.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Solar Levy was the actual cause of any adverse tax consequences that may accrue to Natland Investment in the Netherlands.878 In this respect, the Respondent highlights the concession made by the Claimants and Mr Opmeer that Natland Investment could have entered into a price adjustment agreement with E21 Holding that would have removed completely the possibility of negative tax consequences in the Netherlands.879 Considering the timing of the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent avers that \"[Natland Investment] should have been fully aware of the possibility that a tribunal could eventually issue an award of damages in its favor, relating to its shareholding in Energy 21\".880 As such, any allegedly adverse tax consequences that may accrue to Natland Investment in the Netherlands, the Respondent argues, would be attributable to Natland Investment's \"own choices and (in)actions\", not to any conduct by the Respondent.881\n\nResponse, para. 293; 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 155:18-156:5.\n\nResponse, para. 293. Given this concession, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion that it bears the burden of establishing the type of agreement that Natland Investment could have concluded to avoid such consequences. *See* Rejoinder, para. 162. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 155:18-24.\n\nResponse, para. 293.\n\nResponse, para. 293; Rejoinder, para. 155(b).\n\n621.\n\nFor the Respondent, the request for a tax gross-up is speculative, because \"the Dutch tax authority could plausibly find that an award [in favor of Natland Investment], in fact, qualifies as 'benefits arising from a participation', and therefore is exempt from taxes in the Netherlands\".882 This would be more likely, the Respondent continues, if the award expressly stated that the damages had been calculated on the basis of the loss in the value of Natland Investment's shareholding in Energy 21.883 In fact, the Respondent notes that Dutch case law and practice suggest that an award of compensation would be exempt from taxes in the Netherlands pursuant to the participation exemption in Section 13(1) of CITA.884\n\nResponse, paras. 294, 296. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 154:17-23.\n\nResponse, para. 296.\n\nRejoinder, para. 161; Expert Report of Professor Stef van Weeghel, 20 April 2022 (hereinafter \"**RER-van Weeghel**\"), paras. 17(a), 18, 26-33, 43.\n\n622.\n\nAs to the Claimants' request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay an unquantified amount in light of the uncertainties and complexities in tax obligations, the Respondent considers that such proposal would be unworkable, because:\n\n(a) it would render the specific amounts in the award indeterminate and thus likely unenforceable;\n\n(b) it would disincentivize Natland Investment from seeking potentially applicable offsets that could minimize its tax liability in the Netherlands; and\n\n(c) here would be no mechanism for the Czech Republic to ensure whether Natland Investment has availed itself of all of its rights under Dutch law to limit the amount of its tax liability (if any).885\n\nRejoinder, para. 157.\n\n623.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, any tax liability by a claimant in its home jurisdiction would not be a proximate consequence of any act or omission by the respondent State.886 In this respect, the Respondent contends that tribunals have consistently declined to order tax gross-ups in relation to taxes payable in a jurisdiction other than the respondent State.887 Therefore, the Respondent maintains that there is no basis in international law for the Tribunal to order the Respondent to offset the cost of Natland Investment's potential tax bill to another sovereign.888\n\nRejoinder, para. 163.\n\nResponse, para. 292, *referring to* *Mobil v.

Interest**\n---------------\n\n624.\n\nShould damages be awarded, the Parties agree that the pre-award interest should be calculated as of 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2014, i.e., the dates on which the Respondent respectively introduced the Solar Levy.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent submits that no interest is warranted, because the Claimants are not entitled to any damages in this arbitration.910 Even if the Tribunal were to award damages, the Respondent argues that interest should not be awarded on the terms proposed by the Claimants.911\n\nResponse, para. 298.\n\nResponse, para. 298.\n\n**(a) Pre-award interest**\n--------------------------\n\n635.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the appropriate pre-award interest rate should be calculated based on the six-month PRIBOR, i.e., an average rate at which banks are willing to lend Czech Koruna to other banks, for the following reasons.912\n\nResponse, para. 300.\n\n636.\n\n*First*, the Respondent submits that the appropriate interest should be \"risk-free\", because interest is not intended to compensate a claimant for a risk that it did not bear.913 Considering that the yield on the Czech zero-coupon bond includes a premium over the risk-free rate to compensate for the *ex ante* risk of sovereign default and that the Claimants have not borne such a risk in connection with the damages they seek in this arbitration, the Respondent argues that the interest-rate benchmark proposed by the Claimants would be inappropriate.914\n\nResponse, para. 302.\n\nResponse, para. 302.\n\n637.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent contends that the six-month PRIBOR rate aligns with the guidance offered by the ECT and the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT.915 Noting that the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT directs the States to pay interest based on the six-month LIBOR in cases of expropriation, the Respondent observes that such a rate is instructive, because it reflects a considered view that an established interbank offered rate is an appropriate \"risk-free\" interest rate for damages arising from certain treaty violations by the host State under the BIT.916\n\nResponse, para. 303.\n\nResponse, paras. 303-304, *referring to* Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT, Art. 5.1 (**Ex. C-2**); Rejoinder, para. 142.\n\n638.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Claimants are requesting damages denominated in Czech Koruna and that the Claimants intended to be, and were, short-term investors, the Respondent submits that an interest rate based on the six-month PRIBOR fixed as of the date of the applicable treaty violation (i.e., 1.56% in January 2011 and 0.48% in January 2014) would be reasonable.917 In support of its contention, the Respondent points out that investment tribunals have often adopted interbank offered rates, including six-month rates, as the appropriate interest rate.918\n\nResponse, para. 305.\n\nResponse, para. 304, *referring to* *BayWa r.e. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa r.e. Asset Holding GmbH v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/16, Award, 25 January 2021, paras. 62, 76 **(Ex. RLA-340**) (hereinafter \"***BayWa v. Spain***\"); Cube Infrastructure v. Spain, paras. 536-539 (**Ex. CLA-263**).\n\n639.\n\n*Third*, the Respondent asserts, \"considerations of fairness\" must be applied when the Tribunal exercises its judgment in setting interest rates based on the circumstances of the case.919 Therefore, in the Respondent's view, it would not be fair to apply the inflated interest rate proposed by the Claimants (i.e., nearly nine times the relevant six-month LIBOR) in circumstances in which a significantly lower rate would have applied if the Respondent had engaged in expropriation, which is \"a more egregious act\" than the regulatory FET violation found in this case.920\n\nResponse, para. 301(ii)-(iii), *citing* *CDSE v. Costa Rica*, para. 103 (**Ex. RLA-334**).\n\nResponse, para. 306; Rejoinder, para. 143.\n\n640.\n\n*Lastly*, the Respondent denies that it was enriched by the Solar Levy, given that the Solar Levy \"*reduce*[d] revenue outflow as opposed to raising revenue for the State\" as found by the Tribunal in the Partial Award.921 Even assuming *arguendo* that the reduction in the revenue could be characterized as enrichment, such reduction, according to the Respondent, was \"a reasonable, proportionate, and justified measure to mitigate the serious consequence of the solar boom, and to reduce the burden of such boom on electricity consumers\".922 Conversely, the Respondent takes the view that the Claimants would be unjustly enriched if they were to be granted an award of damages with an inflated interest rate that reflects a risk that they did not bear.923\n\nRejoinder, paras. 139-140, *citing* Partial Award, para. 257 [emphasis in original].\n\nRejoinder, para. 140.\n\nRejoinder, para. 141.\n\n641.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that other tribunals in RES cases found it appropriate to award interest based on the host-State's sovereign bond rate (or an interbank rate plus a premium) does not indicate that the Tribunal in this arbitration must follow the same approach, where doing so would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this particular case.924\n\nResponse, para. 301(ii); Rejoinder, fn. 494.\n\n**(b) Post-award interest**\n---------------------------\n\n642.\n\nThe Respondent argues that post-award interest should be calculated based on the same rate as the pre-award interest rate.925 This is because \"interest has [a] purely compensatory, not punitive function\".926\n\nResponse, para. 310.\n\nResponse, para. 309, *citing* S. Ripinsky and K Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law*, *Interest*, (2016), p. 363 (**Ex. CLA-244**).\n\n643.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants have failed to substantiate why the Tribunal should deviate from the \"norm\" in investor-State arbitration of awarding a single rate for pre- and post-award interest.927 In this respect, the Respondent submits that the post-award interest at the same rate as pre-award interest would serve as sufficient incentive for the Respondent to comply promptly with any award of damages.928 A party's anticipated pursuit of lawful post-award relief, the Respondent further asserts, does not constitute a valid basis for penalizing that party through an award of enhanced post-award interest.929\n\nResponse, para. 309; Rejoinder, paras. 145, 148.\n\nResponse, para. 310; Rejoinder, para. 146.\n\nResponse, para. 310; Rejoinder, para. 147.\n\n644.\n\nThe Respondent adds that an enhanced post-award interest rate would be inconsistent with Article 26(8) of the ECT, which provides only that an arbitral award \"may include an award of interest\", not multiple awards of interest.930\n\nResponse, para. 311 [emphasis added by the Respondent].\n\n**F. The Tribunal's Analysis on Quantum**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Valuation Methodology, Quantification, and Damage Allocation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nAs explained in paragraph 318, both Parties agree, as is widely accepted in international law, that damages resulting from the breach found by the Partial Award should be determined based on the principle of full reparation.931 Using the terms of the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case, this means that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".932\n\nSubmission, para. 67; Response, para. 65.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, p. 47 (**Ex. CLA-118**).\n\n646.\n\nThis means that, in order to establish the quantum of any compensation for the Respondent's breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal must first assess the situation which would have existed \"in all probability\", had the Solar Levy not been enacted. In doing so, the Tribunal must also consider the lawful measures that could have affected the minimum level of revenue that the Respondent undertook to guarantee.\n\n647.\n\nIn Section V.F.3, the Tribunal has explained that this specifically refers to the \"review and control under EU State aid rules applied by the Commission\"933 that could still have happened in the but-for scenario. In this regard, the Tribunal has concluded that (i) in the but-for scenario, the Commission would have \"in all probability\" considered the original RES scheme as State aid and (ii) the Claimants, as EU investors, could and should have known this.\n\nPartial Award, para. 419.\n\n648.\n\nThe Tribunal had already held that this conclusion did not imply that the Claimants should be awarded zero damages.934 The evidence on the record suggests otherwise, since (i) the Commission, while reviewing the amended RES scheme, concluded that it was compatible State aid under the consideration that an IRR provided to the investors ranging from 6.3% to 8.4% was reasonable;935 (ii) the Solar Levy had the effect of reducing the IRR of certain PV plants even below 8.4%; and (iii) the Commission could have deemed, for example, a higher IRR as reasonable, considering the longer service life of the PV plants.\n\n*See* Section V.F.3.\n\nDecision (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n649.\n\nBoth Parties agree, up to a certain point, that the but-for approach is an appropriate methodology to establish the quantum of the compensation that the Claimants should be awarded. However, neither has included in its calculation the impact of the Commission's review and control under State aid rules that, in the Tribunal's view, was more likely than not to have occurred, had the Solar Levy not been imposed.\n\n650.\n\nAs a consequence, using the Tribunal's discretion to determine the quantum of the damages under the widely accepted full reparation principle, the Tribunal will calculate the amount of the compensation considering the data provided by the Parties and the Commission's review and control that would, \"in all probability\", have occurred in the but-for scenario.\n\n651.\n\nThe Tribunal's discretion when quantifying damages is illustrated in the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* case itself, where the Court was faced with the difficult task of an intricate valuation of complex facts:\n\nThe Court does not fail to appreciate the difficulties presented by these two questions, difficulties which are however inherent in the special case under consideration, and closely connected with the time that elapsed between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with which the factory is concerned. **In view of these difficulties, the Court considers it preferable to endeavor to ascertain the value to be estimated by several methods, in order to permit a comparison and if necessary, of completing the results of the one by those of the others. The Court, therefore, reserves every right to review the valuations referred to in the different formulae; basing itself on the results of the said valuations and of facts and documents submitted to it**, it will then proceed to determine the sum to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the legal principles set out above.936\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, pp. 53-54 (**Ex. CLA-118**) [emphasis added].\n\n652.\n\nThe approach adopted in *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* has been reaffirmed by several tribunals over the years. For example, the *Burlington v. Ecuador* tribunal made express reference to the case:\n\n329. The *Chorz\u00f3w* case settled thereafter, with the result that we do not know how the Court would have determined the amount of damages. However, three fundamental conclusions can be drawn from the Court's ruling: (i) under the full reparation principle, damages should be a substitute for restitution that has become impossible; (ii) because damages must replace restitution, they should be valued on the date on which compensation is awarded; and (iii) **tribunals have full discretion to assess the valuations for purposes of determining the amount to be awarded**.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n453. In addition, it is well established that, once the existence of damage is established, the Tribunal has wide discretion to determine its quantum. The Tribunal is satisfied that using the current functionalities contained in the Updated Model allows it to quantify Burlington's losses with reasonable certainty, even if it defers the starting date of new drilling to September 2009. Specifically, the Tribunal has considered that the deferral of the start of new drilling shifts the cash flows resulting from new wells forward approximately 1.5 years (from January 2008 to September 2009).937\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, paras. 329, 453 (**Ex. CLA-229**) [emphases added].\n\n653.\n\nAnother example is found in *Masdar v. Spain*, a case also involving a breach of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT, where the tribunal held:\n\n578. In this regard, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's criticism of Brattle's two-step income-based calculation involving reliance on actual data and assumptions for the measurement of the (undiscounted) Lost Historical Cash Flows and the Lost Future Cash Flows. As discussed above, the full reparation standard is intended to put the injured party in the position in which it would have found itself, but for the wrongful act. **As other tribunals have found**, and as Claimant submitted in its Memorial, **to fulfil that aim, tribunals enjoy a wide margin of discretion as to which valuation method they adopt to quantify the compensation due to the injured party**. In the view of the Tribunal, Brattle's approach of using ex post information to calculate Lost Historical Cash Flows and ex ante information to calculate Lost Future Cash Flows is appropriate [\u2026].938\n\n*Masdar v. Spain*, para. 578 (**Ex. CLA-230**) [emphases added].\n\n654.\n\nThis Tribunal's discretion does not extend to permit the award of something other than full compensation based on \"equitable\" principles. In *ESPF v. Italy*, the tribunal expressly denied this possibility:\n\n858. [\u2026] The Tribunal understands the Respondent's position to be that since the measures did not completely wipe out the value of the Claimants' Investments and, in fact, the Investments continued to be profitable after the measures, which were passed for a public purpose, the Tribunal should award the Claimants something less than full compensation. This is contrary to the fundamental customary international principle of full compensation for wrongful acts. **The Tribunal's discretion in estimating the amount of damages needed to provide full compensation does not extend to awarding damages that amount to less than full compensation**.939\n\n*ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH, ESPF Nr. 2 Austria Beteiligungs GmbH, and InfraClass Energie 5 GmbH & Co. KG v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/5, Award, 14 September 2020, para. 858 (**Ex. CLA-232**) [emphasis added].\n\n655.\n\nThe Tribunal thus agrees with the Respondent's assertion that it cannot engage in an *ex aequo et bono* determination.940 The use of discretion does not mean an exercise of judgement without rational foundations and analysis.\n\nRejoinder, para. 13(n).\n\n656.\n\nIn order to establish the quantum of the compensation considering the \"review and control\" that would have happened \"in all probability\" in the but-for scenario, the Tribunal will apply the following steps:\n\n(a) determination of an IRR that, on average, and under the specific circumstances of the case, would \"in all probability\" have been deemed reasonable under State aid rules;\n\n(b) identification of those PV plants which had a lower IRR than that determined in the previous step (a) as a consequence of the Solar Levy;\n\n(c) estimation of the cash flows that would have guaranteed the PV plants an IRR without the impact of the Solar Levy, but considering the IRR determined in the first step as a \"ceiling\" (Counterfactual Scenario);\n\n(d) estimation of the difference between the cash flows determined in the previous step (c) and the projected cash flows with the application of the Measures (Factual Scenario) for each period; and\n\n(e) estimation of the present value of the difference previously calculated, considering the applicable cost of capital at each Valuation Date.\n\n657.\n\nFor the *first step*, as explained in Section V.F.3, the Tribunal considers that in the but-for scenario, having regard to the specific circumstances of the Claimants' PV plants, it would be reasonable to assume that a somewhat higher average IRR would have been acceptable to the European Commission, so far as those PV plants were concerned.\n\n658.\n\nThe Commission's decision on the amended RES scheme considered that an IRR ranging between 6.3% and 8.4% was reasonable, because it was \"in line with similar photovoltaic installations under similar conditions observed in other EU Member States\".941 In the particular case of PV plants, as previously observed, the Commission considered several plants with a service life of 15 years, as noted in the footnote to Table 1:942\n\n**Table 1: Service life of renewable installations**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Technology Type | Service life in years |\n| Hydro | 30 |\n| Photovoltaic | 201 |\n| Wind | 20 |\n| Biogas | 20' |\n| Biomass | 20 |\n| Geothermal | 20 |\n\nDecision, para. 117 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\nDecision, Table 1 (**Ex. R-367**).\n\n*WA Investments* \u2013 *Europa Nova Ltd. (Cyprus) v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-19; *Voltaic Network GmbH v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-20; *Photovoltaik Knopf Betriebs GmbH v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-21; *I.C.W. Europe Investments Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-22.\n\n659.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 PV plants, however, had a service life ranging from 20 to 21 years.943 As such, following the economic principle that projects with a longer service life tend to enjoy a higher profitability, the Tribunal considers that a higher IRR range would have been deemed reasonable by the Commission in the but-for scenario.\n\nAs shown by the number of years considered by Mr Edwards and Mr Peer in order to calculate the PV plants' cash flows. *See* Cash flow impacts of the Amending Measures, Cash flow impact of Measures (**Ex. JER-1**).\n\n660.\n\nIn order to estimate this range, the Tribunal takes into consideration how much an IRR can increase when comparing a 15-year project to a 20-year project. The following example shows how much this IRR can vary:\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//65f8bd8f4910b0c56d01a8139f3b161cc069a7d4.jpeg)\n\nNote 1: IRR estimate assumes the following: (i) project will continue to receive the same cash flow during the following years; (ii) project receives constant annual payments proportional to the investment and the expected IRR of the initial project; and, (iii) investment levels remain constant given the change in service life.\n\nNote 2: Conclusions remain constant despite some change in the level of initial investment in both service life scenarios.\n\n661.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this does not mean that this example of a 10.3% IRR would have necessarily been considered reasonable by the Commission under State aid rules. The Tribunal prefers to take a conservative approach for the following reasons: (i) the Commission's decision on the amended RES scheme also analyzed some RES installations with a service life of 20 years; (ii) the Commission's decision considered some exceptions that exceeded the range; and (iii) the but-for analysis is an \"in all probability\" one.\n\n662.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that an IRR of 9.4% for the Claimants' PV plants is a reasonable and conservative parameter for the but-for scenario.\n\n663.\n\nFor the *second step*, the Tribunal will primarily rely on the conclusions submitted by Mr Edwards and Mr Peer in their Joint Expert Report, which the Tribunal found to be of considerable assistance on this key issue. The following table drawn from their report summarizes the IRR calculations presented for each individual PV plant requested by the Tribunal and their respective cash flows:944\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Mr Peer** | **Mr Edwards** |\n| **No Measures Scenario** | Range: 9.9% to 17.9% | Range: 8.2% to 17.3% |\n| Collective: 12.7% | Collective: 12% |\n| **Other Measures Scenario** | Range: 9.0% to 15.9% | Range: 7.4% to 15.1% |\n| Collective: 11.5% | Collective: 10.7% |\n| **All Measures Scenario** | Range: 7.0% to 13.8% | Range: 6.3% to 12.7% |\n| Collective: 9.8% | Collective: 9.1% |\n\nJoint Expert Report, para. 3.2.\n\n664.\n\nRegarding the experts' disagreements, the Tribunal considers that Mr Edwards' approach is more reliable, insofar as (i) it includes relevant expenses such as the \"land purchase costs\" and \"maintenance capital expenditure\", which preclude an overestimation of financial returns, and (ii) it is based on evidence produced at the time of the events (the 2011 Forecasts).945\n\nJoint Expert Report, Annex B, paras. 5.11-5.22.\n\n665.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal identifies the following sixteen PV plants as those that had their IRRs drop below 9.4% due to the Measures:\n\nNote: IRR values correspond to the estimated IRR in the All amending measures scenario shown in Exhibit JER-002946\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//a1daa928d7196af5a38cf5cb7e56940da2e70a58.jpeg)\n\nCalculations of IRRs, All amending measures (**Ex.

In this part of the analysis, the Tribunal considers a 9.4% IRR to be a reasonable \"ceiling\", as explained in the *first step*. As a consequence, if any PV plant would have had an IRR higher than 9.4% in the Other Measures Only Scenario, the Tribunal treats it as if it were 9.4% (as shown on the following chart):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| PV Plant | Factual IRR (All amending measures) | Counterfactual IRR (9.4% or Other measures only) |\n| 39\\_Drzovice | 6.3% | 8.3% |\n| 8\\_Ceske Velenice | 6.7% | 7.4% |\n| 42\\_Jarosov | 7.1% | 9.3% |\n| 82\\_Rozvadov\\_ll\\_A | 7.2% | 9.2% |\n| 5\\_Tasov | 7 7% | 9.4% |\n| 4\\_Velka nad Velickou | 7.8% | 8.7% |\n| 38\\_Urcice\\_IV | 7.9% | 9.4% |\n| 3\\_Protivin | 8.0% | 8.9% |\n| 26\\_Urcice | 8.1% | 9.1% |\n| 74\\_Pravcice | 8.3% | 9.4% |\n| lOLitencice | 8 5% | 9.4% |\n| 11\\_Hrusovany | 86% | 9.4% |\n| 40\\_Bojkovice | 8 7% | 9.4% |\n| 20\\_Dr\u012bnov | 8 9% | 9.4% |\n| 28\\_Stitary | 9.0% | 9.4% |\n| 7\\_Jaroslavice\\_ll | 9 3% | 9.4% |\n\nNote: Also shown in the sheet labeled as \"Table 1\" in the Final Award's Appendix\n\n668.\n\nIn order to estimate the amounts for this Counterfactual Scenario, as explained below in para. 670, the Tribunal has made its calculations based on the data provided by Mr Edwards.948 Specifically, the Tribunal has adjusted the cash flows shown in Mr Edwards' spreadsheet, so that the resulting IRR for each PV plant corresponds to the IRR portrayed in the previous chart.949\n\nCalculations of IRRs (**Ex. JER-002**).\n\nTo estimate the adjusted cash flow, the Tribunal has multiplied all the cash flows from the \"All measures scenario\" with a numerical factor necessary for the IRR to result in 9.4%. This numerical factor was estimated using Microsoft Excel's Goal Seek function.\n\n669.\n\nThe following chart provides an example of how this method was applied to each of the sixteen PV plants:\n\n![](https://img.jusmundi.com/image//882da0b67044fb99f22a5ddb893cc264a8100861.jpeg)\n\n670.\n\nThe Tribunal's calculations of the counterfactual scenario of each plant are summarized in the following table (by aggregating the cash flows for the periods contained in each Valuation Date, expressed in CZK million):\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **PV Plant** | **1st Valuation Date (2011-2013)** | **2nd Valuation Date (2014-end)** |\n| 3\\_Protiv\u00edn | 91.92 | 499.59 |\n| 8\\_\u010cesk\u00e9 Velenice | 39.42 | 216.52 |\n| 26\\_Ur\u010dice | 27.84 | 152.17 |\n| 82\\_Rozvadov\\_II\\_A | 19.04 | 111.18 |\n| 4\\_Velk\u00e1 nad Veli\u010dkou | 9.85 | 51.10 |\n| 5\\_Tasov | 70.88 | 512.22 |\n| 74\\_Prav\u010dice | 66.32 | 478.76 |\n| 38\\_Ur\u010dice\\_IV | 68.00 | 489.21 |\n| 39\\_Dr\u017eovice | 81.50 | 480.22 |\n| 42\\_Jaro\u0161ov | 46.65 | 274.18 |\n| 10\\_Liten\u010dice | 18.21 | 138.35 |\n| 11\\_Hru\u0161ovany | 51.58 | 386.46 |\n| 40\\_Bojkovice | 84.50 | 606.97 |\n| 20\\_D\u0159\u00ednov | 50.38 | 363.09 |\n| 28\\_\u0160t\u00edtary | 57.35 | 414.49 |\n| 7\\_Jaroslavice\\_II | 10.93 | 82.65 |\n\nNote 1: Amounts shown are the simple sum of the cash flows within each scenario.

This is the result of adding the differentiated cash flows for each Valuation Date (CZK 99.41 million plus CZK 164.24 million).\n\n674.\n\nThe method followed by the Tribunal renders most of the remaining disagreements between the Parties on methodology without any effect on the quantum. However, the Tribunal considers that it is still important to refer to three points of discussion: (i) the reduction of damages; (ii) the use of two Valuation Dates; and (iii) the use of a different WACC between the factual and counterfactual scenarios.\n\n675.\n\nAs to the Respondent's argument that the Claimants are not entitled to damages in connection with the investments that they undertook at a time when they knew that it was likely that the Czech Government would enact measures that would have an impact on their plans to commission new solar installations, the Tribunal has already explained in Sections V.D.3 and V.E.3 that the Claimants cannot be deprived of compensation under the \"assumption of risk\" and \"contributory negligence\" argument.\n\n676.\n\nRegarding the use of two Valuation Dates, the Tribunal notes that the Partial Award defined the Solar Levy as the \"levy imposed on revenue of solar installations, introduced by Act No. 402/2010 Coll. for a period of three years for installations commissioned in 2009 and 2010, and extended, in reduced form, for installations commissioned in 2010 by Act No. 310/2013\".951\n\nPartial Award, p. vii.\n\n677.\n\nConsidering this definition, the Partial Award then established that \"the imposition of the Solar Levy constituted a breach of the Respondent's FET obligation in Article 10 of the ECT\";952 \"the imposition of the Solar Levy is in breach of the Respondent's obligation under Article 2(2) of the Cyprus-Czech Republic BIT to accord Natland Group fair and equitable treatment\";953 and \"the imposition of the Solar Levy constitutes a breach of the Respondent's obligation under Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT to accord Natland Investment fair and equitable treatment\".954\n\nPartial Award, para. 428.\n\nPartial Award, para. 432.\n\nPartial Award, para. 437.\n\n678.\n\nIn other words, the Partial Award concluded that both the introduction of the Solar Levy by Act No. 402/2010 and its extension by Act No. 310/2013 constituted breaches of the Respondent's international obligations. As such, in the Tribunal's view, in order to establish a full reparation, it is necessary to assess how each of these acts has, independently, affected the Claimants' investments.\n\n679.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr Peer accepted that \"the first and second solar levies were two separate pieces of legislation and that they covered time periods that were mutually exclusive\".955 Consequently, as it was expressed during the Hearing, \"if there are two breaches, there will be two separate calculations\".956\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 166:16-23.\n\n2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 169:9-10.\n\n680.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it is necessary to establish the quantum of the compensation considering the effects on each Valuation Date, as it has done *supra*.\n\n681.\n\nNonetheless, in relation to the use of a different WACC between the Factual Scenario and the Counterfactual Scenario, the Tribunal notes that there is also a risk of double counting.\n\n682.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that it is necessary to consider a different WACC for each scenario at the first Valuation Date, because that is the only way to consider the impact of the variation of the perception of risk, which would also be a consequence of the Respondent's breach. However, the Claimants have failed to assess the perception of risk regarding the Commission's control and review that would have \"in all probability\" happened in the but-for scenario.\n\n683.\n\nIn consequence, the Tribunal cannot establish a concrete difference in the perception of risk on each scenario and, if it exists, how much of it can be attributed to the Respondent's breach. Therefore, the Tribunal does not apply a different WACC between the Factual and Counterfactual scenarios.\n\n684.\n\nFinally, as to the damage allocation, following the Claimants' view, the Tribunal should consider (i) the Claimants' effective shareholding in Energy 21 at the relevant periods of time, and (ii) that, in all probability, the PV plants would have obtained a higher IRR amounting to CZK 263.65 million (this is the result of adding the differentiated cash flows for each Valuation Date, CZK 99.41 million for the First Valuation Date plus CZK 164.24 million for the Second Valuation Date).\n\n685.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal allocates the amount calculated for the period 2011-2013 to Radiance (52.42%), GIGH (22.50%) and Capamera (20.08%) *pro rata*. For the period after 2014, considering its 94.3825% shareholding in Energy 21, compensation is allocated to Radiance :\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Present value of difference** | **(CZK millions)** |\n| 2011-2013 |  |\n| Radiance | 52.11 |\n| GIHG | 22.37 |\n| Capamera | 19.96 |\n| 2014-end |  |\n| Radiance | 155.02 |\n\nNote: Values are shown in the sheet labeled as \"Table 5\" in the Final Award's Appendix.\n\n686.\n\nThis leads to a total, considering the compensation to the three Claimants for the two Valuation Dates, of CZK 249.46 million.\n\n**2. Tax Gross-up**\n-------------------\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants have not identified a single case in which tax gross-up was awarded, whereas the Respondent has identified at least three cases in which the tribunal specifically denied such an award.\n\n688.\n\nIn *Mobil Investments v. Canada*, the tribunal denied the tax gross-up request, because \"it was not aware of a requirement under international law to gross up compensation as a result of tax considerations\".957\n\nResponse, para. 292, *citing* *Mobil v. Canada*, para. 485 (**Ex. RLA-17**).\n\n689.\n\nIn *CSOB v. Slovakia*, the tribunal also denied the tax gross-up request, explaining that \"[i]ncome taxes are an act of government ('*fait du prince*') that are unrelated to the obligation of one party to fully compensate the other party for the harm done\".958 A similar approach was taken by the tribunal in *Rusoro Mining v. Venezuela*.959\n\nResponse, para. 292, *citing* CSOB v. Slovakia, para. 367 (**Ex. RLA-363**).\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, 22 August 2016, para. 854 (**Ex. RLA-364**).\n\n690.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal finds that, even if a tax gross-up could be recognized as part of the damages, Natland Investment's actions could have avoided the tax implications by including this factor in the sale of its shareholding on 4 August 2011. As the Claimants acknowledge, \"[t]he situation could have been different [\u2026] if at the time of the sale of Natland Investment's participation in Energy 21 a price adjustment had been agreed with the buyer (E21 Holding) concerning potential prospective claims\".960\n\nSubmission, para. 164, *referring to* **CER-Opmeer**, pp. 5-6.\n\n691.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's view that the Claimants have not established with sufficient certainty that a damages award in favor of Natland Investment (now NIG) would, in fact, be taxed in the Netherlands, considering that there is also the possibility for it to be exempted under Section 13(1) of CITA.961\n\nRejoinder, para. 161; **RER-van Weeghel**, paras. 17(a), 18, 26-33, 43.\n\n692.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Claimants have failed to meet their burden of proof and, as a consequence, it denies the tax gross-up request. This conclusion, however, does not change the fact that the Tribunal has established that the compensation awarded must only be paid to Capamera, as explained in paragraphs 304 and 305.\n\n**3. Interest**\n---------------\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that the Respondent has not questioned the Claimants' assertions that interest should be compounded on an annual basis. The Tribunal thus understands that both Parties agree on this matter, which is aligned with international practice.962\n\n*See* *Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. et al. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, para. 16.26 (**Ex. CLA-129**); *Foresight v. Spain*, para. 544, (**Ex. CLA-237**); *Masdar v.

CLA-248**); Caratube v. Kazakhstan, para. 1226 (**Ex. RLA-320**).\n\n694.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree on (i) the applicable interest rate and (ii) whether the Tribunal should award higher post-award interest.\n\n695.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the pre-award interest rate should be based on the yield of a zero-coupon bond issued by the Czech Republic at each of the two Valuation Dates proposed.963 Specifically, the Claimants posit that the Tribunal should consider the 12-year yield for the first Valuation Date (1 January 2011) and the 9-year yield for the second Valuation Date (1 January 2014), because that is the approximate period of time that would have elapsed between each Valuation Date and the final Award. In practical terms, this means a 3.975% interest rate as at 1 January 2011 and a 2.266% interest as at 1 January 2014.\n\nSubmission, paras. 173-175.\n\n696.\n\nIn support of this argument, the Claimants have referred in particular to recent arbitral decisions in RES cases which adopted this approach: (i) *Masdar v. Spain*, where the tribunal applied a pre-award interest rate of 0.906% based on the yield on 3-year Spanish government bonds;964 (ii) *Antin v. Spain*, where the tribunal applied an interest rate of 2.07% based on the yield on 10-year Spanish bonds;965 (iii) *SolEs v. Spain*, where the tribunal applied an interest rate of 1.74% corresponding to the mean average of the yields on Spanish 10-year Treasury Bills;966 (iv) *RWE v. Spain*, where the tribunal applied an interest rate of 2.07% based on the return on Spanish 10-year bonds;967 and several more.968\n\n*Masdar v. Spain*, para. 665 (**Ex. CLA-230**).\n\n*Antin v. Spain*, para. 733 (**Ex. CLA-189**).\n\n*SolEs v. Spain*, para. 558 (**Ex. CLA-235**).\n\n*RWE v. Spain*, para. 133 (**Ex. CLA-245**).\n\nReply, para. 476. *See also* 2022 Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 76:20-22.\n\n697.\n\nComplementarily, the Claimants also rely on recent cases where the tribunal adopted an interbank rate increased by a premium: (i) *ESPF v. Italy*, where the tribunal applied the 12-month Euribor rate, plus 4.0%; (ii) *CEF Energia BV. V. Italy*, where the tribunal applied the annual LIBOR rate, plus 2%; and (iii) *Greentech v. Italy*, where the tribunal applied the annual LIBOR, plus 2%.\n\n698.\n\nThe Respondent, however, posits that the Tribunal should adopt interbank offered rates, as the tribunals did in *BayWa v. Spain* and *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*.969 Specifically, according to the Respondent, the interest rate should be based on the 6-month PRIBOR fixed as at each Valuation Date (i.e., 1.56% in January 2011 and 0.48% in January 2014).970\n\nResponse, para. 304, *referring to* *BayWa v. Spain*, paras. 62, 76 **(Ex. RLA-340**); *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*, paras. 536-539 (**Ex. CLA-263**).\n\nResponse, para. 305.\n\n699.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimants have established that the current approach followed by tribunals in similar cases is to apply pre-award interest in a rate varying from 0.9% to more than 4%, either by applying the yield on the host State's bonds or an interbank rate with a premium.\n\n700.\n\nUnder this premise, the Tribunal finds it most appropriate to apply an interest rate similar to the yield of the Czech Republic's bonds. In particular, considering that almost 13 years have passed since 1 January 2011 (First Valuation Date), and that almost 10 years have passed since 1 January 2014 (Second Valuation Date), the Tribunal grants pre-award interest at the rates proposed by the Claimants on each Valuation Date. That is 3.975% for the First Valuation Date, to be compounded annually, and 2.266% for the Second Valuation Date, also to be compounded annually. As of 15 December 2023, an application of these interest rates on the difference previously calculated in Section VII.F.1, translates into the following compensation for each of the Claimants:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Present value of difference** | **Interests** | **Total amount (in CZK MM)** |\n| 2011-2013 |  |  |  |\n| Radiance | 52.1089 | 34.2470 | 86.3559 |\n| GIHG | 22.3665 | 14.6997 | 37.0662 |\n| Capamera | 19.9608 | 13.1187 | 33.0795 |\n| 2014-end |  |  |  |\n| Radiance | 155.0242 | 38.6254 | 193.6496 |\n\nNote: Values are shown in the sheet labeled as \"Table 6\" in the Final Award's Appendix.\n\n701.\n\nThis leads to a total, considering the compensation to the three Claimants, including pre-award interest, of CZK 350.1512 million.\n\n702.\n\nRegarding post-award interest, the Claimants acknowledge that tribunals do not always award a higher post-award interest rate and that \"there is no usual practice among investor-State tribunals\".971\n\nSubmission, paras. 191-194; Reply, para. 492.\n\n703.\n\nNevertheless, the Claimants cite several recent cases where the tribunals increased the rate for post-award interest: (i) *Eiser v. Spain* where the tribunal increased the interest rate from 2.07% to 2.50%, (ii) *Masdar v. Spain* where the tribunal increased the interest rate from 0.906% to 1.6%; (iii) *Foresight v. Spain* where the tribunal increased the interest rate from 1.4% to 3.5%; (iv) *Watkins v. Spain* where the tribunal increased the interest rate from 1.16% to 2.16%; (v) *Costa Rica v. Nicaragua,* where the tribunal increased the interest rate from 4% to 6%.972 Additionally, the Claimants cite scholarly support for this approach.973\n\nSubmission, paras. 188-189, *referring to* *Eiser v. Spain*, para. 478 (**Ex. CLA-238**); *Masdar v. Spain*, para. 665 (**Ex. CLA-230**); *Foresight v. Spain*, para. 546 (**Ex. CLA-237**); *Watkins v. Spain*, paras. 746-747 (**Ex. CLA-233**); *Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua)*, paras. 153-155 (**Ex. CLA-254**); Reply, paras. 492-493.\n\nSubmission, para. 190, *citing* I. Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law*, (2017), para. 6.262 (**Ex. CLA-243**); Reply, para. 493, *referring to* S. Ripinsky and K. Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law*, (2016), pp. 388-389 (**Ex. CLA-244**).\n\n704.\n\nIn summary, in the cases cited by the Claimants, the tribunals have increased the post-award interest rate in a range varying from 0.43% to 2.1%. Accordingly, the Claimants request a post-award interest augmented by 2%.\n\n705.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, however, a higher post-award interest would constitute a punitive action that is not permitted under the full reparation principle.\n\n706.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, that contention is not entirely correct. As stated by the tribunal in *Watkins v. Spain*, \"awarding post-award interest serves the purpose of incentivizing compliance with the *terms* of the Award as expediently as possible\".974\n\n*Watkins v. Spain,* paras. 746-747 (**Ex. CLA-233**).\n\n707.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this approach. It considers that the circumstances of this case justify the application of an increased rate of post-award interest. In particular, the Tribunal observes that more than 12 years have passed since the Claimants filed for arbitration. It is in the interests of both Parties that this lengthy proceeding be brought to an end.\n\n708.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal considers that an increase of 2% over the pre-award interest rate would be excessive. The Tribunal grants an increase of 1.5% over the pre-award interest rate as post-award interest, which will also be compounded annually since the issuance of this Award.\n\n**VIII.

They submit that \"costs\" includes the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the PCA and the experts, as well as the Parties' costs of legal representation and assistance.977 Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules then provides that the default rule for non-legal costs, which excludes the cost of legal representation and assistance, is that they are borne by the unsuccessful party, but the Tribunal is permitted to adopt a different approach if it considers it reasonable based on the \"circumstances\" of the case.978 For legal costs, under Article 40(2) the Tribunal is granted broader discretion to apportion them in a reasonable manner having regard to the circumstances of the case.979\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 6.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 7.\n\n**(a) The Claimants' entitlement to all costs of the** ***merits*** **phase**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n712.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, on the merits, they prevailed on the most damaging of the challenged measures, namely, the imposition of the Solar Levy.980 Therefore, the Claimants must be deemed to be the successful party under Article 40(1).981\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 11.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 11.\n\n713.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that the \"circumstances\" of the case, including (a) the Parties' conduct throughout the proceedings and (b) the complexity of the matter, warrant the application of the \"costs follow the event\" principle to both non-legal and legal costs.982\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 12, *citing* *Eli Lilly and Company v.

CLA-167**).\n\n714.\n\nAs to the Parties' conduct, the Claimants submit that all of their claims have been *bona fide*, that they endeavored to obtain an expeditious and cost-effective adjudication of the dispute, and that they adopted a proactive and cooperative approach towards the Respondent and the Tribunal.983 In contrast, the Respondent has attempted to delay and hinder the adjudication, such as through: (i) demanding bifurcation of the proceedings; (ii) deliberately provoking the European Commission's investigation into the Incentive Regime, resulting in both Parties having to devote considerable time and expense to State aid law, after which, and before the hearing of the merits, the European Commission's Decision debunked the Respondent's position and required the Parties to submit further *ad hoc* briefs; and (iii) failing to make one of its experts, Mr Radek Hal\u00ed\u010dek available for the hearing on the merits, thus requiring his report to be struck from the record.984\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 13.\n\nClaimants' Submissions on Costs, paras. 14-16.\n\n715.\n\nAs to the complexity of the matter, the Claimants argue that the factual and legal issues disputed by the Parties in the merits phase were novel and complex and that the Respondent was better placed to address them, because (i) the Claimants bore the burden of proof on most issues; and (ii) certain matters potentially raised issues of Czech law.985\n\nClaimants' Submissions on Costs, para. 17.\n\n716.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's argument that the Claimants should be denied recovery of their costs due to the cost-sharing provisions of the Funding Agreement, the Claimants note that: (i) they are claiming exclusively the costs incurred in connection with this arbitration; (ii) what they will do with any proceeds of the award is irrelevant to the issue of the Tribunal's determination of the allocation of costs.986\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 33.\n\n**(b) The Claimants' entitlement to all costs of the** ***quantum*** **phase**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n717.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, on the basis that the Tribunal will agree with their position on quantum, they should be awarded all costs of the *quantum* phase in accordance with the \"costs follow the event\" rule.987\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 18.\n\n718.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to award damages significantly lower than the sums claimed, the Claimants argue that they should nonetheless be awarded *all* costs incurred in the quantum phase, based on the Parties' conduct. As to their own conduct, the Claimants note that they submitted *bona fide* claims, and strictly complied with the Tribunal's directions.988\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 20.\n\n719.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimants allege that the Respondent attempted to use the *quantum* phase to re-argue issues conclusively decided in the Partial Award.989 In particular, the Claimants argue that the Respondent (i) raised the *Achmea* Objection as an attempt to reverse the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction in the Partial Award, resuscitating arguments it had abandoned in the merits phase;990 (ii) disregarded the finality of the Partial Award by ignoring various of the Tribunal's findings, suggesting cut-off dates, applicable laws and arguments that had previously been dismissed by the Tribunal;991 and (iii) raised frivolous objections, such as concerning the Funding Agreement*\u00b8* repeatedly dismissed by the Tribunal,992 and the \"Capamera issue\", objecting to the Claimants' request to amend the caption of the case, an objection which the Claimants argue was wrong in law and devoid of practical significance.993\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 22.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 23.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 24, *citing* Procedural Order No. 12, 30 June 2022, paras. 3.14-3.19, Procedural Order No. 13, 25 October 2022.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 25.\n\n**(c) The Claimants' entitlement to certain other costs**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n720.\n\nIf the Tribunal decides not to award Claimants at all, or only in part, the Claimants submit they should nonetheless be awarded the following legal costs:\n\n(i) EUR 17,829.97 relating to the Respondent's challenge of Mr Beechey, dismissed by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.994\n\n(ii) At least EUR 50,000.00 relating to the Respondent's *Achmea* Objection, declared inadmissible by this Tribunal.995\n\n(iii) At least EUR 7,000.00 relating to the Respondent's applications concerning the Funding Agreement, which the Claimants allege were dismissed twice as irrelevant.996\n\n(iv) At least EUR 25,000.00 relating to the Respondent's objection on the \"Capamera issue\", on the basis that it has no practical impact on the Claimants' claims.997\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 28, *citing* p. 3 of Claimants' Schedule of Costs, Stockholm Chamber of Commerce's letters to the Parties of 26 October 2018 and 9 November, 2018.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 28, *citing* Decision on the admissibility of the Achmea Objection of 22 July 2021, para. 85.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 28, *citing* Procedural Order No. 12, 30 June 2022, paras. 3.14-3- 19, Procedural Order No. 13, 25 October 2022.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 28.\n\n721.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that for items (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, they should also be awarded the corresponding non-legal costs, which would mean reimbursing the Claimants a portion (not lower than 20%) of the advances they paid to the PCA for the quantum phase.998\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, para. 29.\n\n**B.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Tribunal's authority to decide the allocation of costs between the Parties is established in\n\nArticles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules:\n\nArticle 38\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The terms \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\nArticle 40\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n3. When the arbitral tribunal issues an order for the termination of the arbitral proceedings or makes an award on agreed terms, it shall fix the costs of arbitration referred to in article 38 and article 39, paragraph 1, in the text of that order or award.\n\n4. No additional fees may be charged by an arbitral tribunal for interpretation or correction or completion of its award under articles 35 to 37.\n\n729.\n\nPursuant to Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. Both Parties have advanced USD 820,000.00 for a total of EUR 1,640,000.00.\n\n730.\n\nAs to Articles 38(a), (b), and (c), according to paragraph 11 of the Terms of Appointment, each member of the Tribunal shall be remunerated at the rate of USD 650 per hour for all work carried out in connection with the arbitration, and shall be reimbursed for all disbursements and charges reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration, including but not limited to travel expenses, telephone, fax, delivery, printing, and other expenses. Based on these rates, the fees of the members of the Tribunal are as follows: USD 104,162.50 for Mr John Beechey, USD 293,150.00 for Mr J. Christopher Thomas KC, and USD 296,920.00 for Professor Alfredo Bullard. The fees of the former members of the Tribunal are as follows: USD 125,970.00 for Mr Gary Born and USD 289,685.50 for Dr Veijo Heiskanen. The travel and other expenses of the Tribunal amount to USD 34,258.48. The PCA's fees and expenses for registry services, which were paid in accordance with the PCA's Schedule of Fees, amount to USD 220,000.00, and the PCA's expenses amount to USD 3,783.12. Other costs incurred (including costs of court reporting, IT/AV support, catering, courier services, hearing venue services, office supplies and printing, telecommunications, and banking services) amount to USD 192,161.07\n\n731.\n\nAccordingly, the costs of the arbitration (excluding the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties under Articles 38(d) and (e)) amount to USD 1,560,090.67, which leaves an unused balance of USD 79,909.33. The PCA shall reimburse the unexpended balance of the deposit to the Parties in equal shares of USD 39,954.66 and will provide the Parties with a statement of account in due course after the issuance of this Final Award.\n\n732.\n\nArticle 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that \"the cost of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party.\" Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"the tribunal shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs\".\n\n733.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, pursuant to Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal determines that the amount of costs for legal representation and assistance claimed by the Parties is reasonable.\n\n734.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent shall bear all the costs and expenses it incurred for its defense, as well as its share of the costs of the arbitration proceeding. The Tribunal also considers that Respondent shall reimburse to the Claimants 75% of Claimants' legal costs (75% of EUR 9,042,753.18, i.e., EUR 6,782,064.88) \u2013 an amount which the Tribunal views as reasonable and proportionate considering the complexity of the dispute \u2013 and 100% of the Claimants' share of the arbitration costs (i.e., USD 780,045.34).\n\n735.\n\nAlthough the Claimants' Submission on Costs includes a request that Respondent reimburse the costs resulting from specific phases of the arbitration, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to allocate costs based on the global amount of legal and arbitration costs incurred by the Parties. In consequence, there is no need to decide costs on a phase-by-phase basis.\n\n736.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision is based on the fact that the Claimants were successful in establishing (i) the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the case (and in so doing, they succeeded in the face of several different objections); (ii) breaches of the BIT's fair and equitable treatment standards; and (iii) their entitlement to an award of damages. Furthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that several procedural incidents caused by the Respondent (such as the challenge of Mr Beechey, the *Achmea* Objection, and the requests regarding the Claimants' financial agreement \u2013 including the request to reconsider the Tribunal's decision on the matter taken in Procedural Order No. 12, purporting to relitigate the question with substantially the same arguments) proved ultimately to be unfounded or immaterial for the decision to be adopted in the Final Award. They increased the complexity of the dispute and the resources it demanded.\n\n737.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has also borne in mind that the Claimants have not been entirely successful. Some of their claims were dismissed by the Partial Award (on either jurisdictional grounds or on the merits), and the quantum of reparation established by the Tribunal has fallen below that which the Claimants had requested. As noted in paragraph 269 above, the Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate to award the Claimants all of their legal costs due to the lack of transparency regarding the merger of Natland Group into Capamera and its impact on the proceeding.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent's objection regarding the fact that the Claimants have agreed to split the costs of the arbitration with certain non-parties has no relevance for its decision on cost allocation. Inasmuch as the Claimants are only being awarded the reimbursement of the costs incurred by them in this proceeding and not, for instance, the costs of other arbitrations, the present decision on cost allocation is in line with Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**IX. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n739.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimants' request to amend the case caption to reflect the new name of Natland Group (Capamera) resulting from a merger is granted.\n\n(b) The Respondent's objections to NIG's and Capamera's grounds for their claims deferred to this phase of the proceedings are dismissed.\n\n(c) The Respondent is ordered to pay compensation to the Claimants for the losses caused to them as a result of the breach declared by the Partial Award, in an amount of CZK 350.1512 million (inclusive of pre-award interest), apportioned among the Claimants as follows:\n\n(i) CZK 37.0662 million to GIGH.\n\n(ii) CZK 33.0795 million to Capamera.\n\n(iii) CZK 280.0055 million to Radiance.\n\n(d) The Respondent is ordered to pay to the Claimants post-award interest on the compensation awarded under (c) above, from the date of the Final Award until the payment of the amounts awarded, which shall accrue at 1.5% above the relevant pre-award interest rate, compounded annually, that is:\n\n(i) 5.475% on CZK 37.0662 million awarded to GIGH.\n\n(ii) 5.475% on CZK 33.0795 million awarded to Capamera.\n\n(iii) 5.475% on CZK 86.3559 million awarded to Radiance for the period from 1 January 2011 (First Valuation Date) to 31 December 2013.\n\n(iv) 3.766% on CZK 193.6496 million awarded to Radiance for the period from 1 January 2014 (Second Valuation Date) to the issuance of the Final Award.\n\n(e) The Respondent is ordered to reimburse the Claimants EUR 6,782,064.88 for the costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution of their claims in this proceeding, as well as USD 780,045.34 for the costs of the arbitration.\n\n(f) All other claims for relief of both Parties are dismissed.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: Geneva\n\nSigned, this 15th day of December 2023,"}]}
