PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 September 2021, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum (hereinafter the \"**Decision**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Kingdom of Spain (the \"**Respondent**\") submitted a request entitled *\"Respondent\u2019s Petition of Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits on the basis of the CJEU Decision in the Case C-741/19, Republic of Moldova, ECLI:EU:C:2021:655\"* to declare the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction for this case (the \"**First Request for Reconsideration**\"), along with a Consolidated List of Legal Authorities, and legal authorities RL-0151 to RL-0184. The decision mentioned involved the case *Republic of Moldova v Komstroy LLC* (the ***\"Komstroy*** **Judgment**\").1\n\n**RL-0151**, European Union Court of Justice Judgment of 2 September 2021 in the case C-741/19, *Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC**.*\n\n3.\n\nOn November 12, 2021, Infracapital F1 S.\u00e0.r.l. and Infracapital Solar B.V (\"**Claimants**\") submitted their response, entitled *\"Claimants\u2019 Response to Respondent\u2019s Petition for Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits'\",* along with an Index of Legal Authorities submitted with Claimants\u2019 response, and legal authorities CL-213 to CL-226.\n\n4.\n\nOn 1 February 2022, the Tribunal issued the Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits (the \"**First Decision on Reconsideration**\") whereby, for the reasons stated therein, the Tribunal rejected the First Request for Reconsideration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 24 June 2022, Respondent submitted a request entitled *\"Respondent\u2019s Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal\u2019s Decisions of 13 September 2021 and 1 February 2022 on the basis of The Green Power Award\"* to declare the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction for this case (the \"**Second Request for Reconsideration**\"), along with a Consolidated List of Legal Authorities, and legal authorities RL-0186 to RL-0187. The decision mentioned involved the award rendered in the case *Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito APS v. Kingdom of Spain* (the ***\"Green Power*** **Award**\").2\n\n**RL-0186** *Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito v. Kingdom of Spain,* SCC-2016/135, Award, 16 June 2022 (\"***Green Power*** **Award**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 June 2022, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit any comments to the Second Request for Reconsideration by 25 July 2022.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 July 2022, Claimants submitted their response entitled \"*Claimants\u2019 Response to Respondent\u2019s Comments on Respondent\u2019s Second Request for Reconsideration\"* (hereinafter \"**Claimants\u2019 Response**\").\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. R****espondent****\u2019****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nRespondent submitted the Second Request of Reconsideration in respect of (a) the Decision and (b) the Decision on the First Request for Reconsideration which, in Respondent\u2019s view, should be reconsidered on the basis of the similarities of this case and the *Green Power* case because, in both instances, the Claimants are companies from EU Member States (Luxembourg and Netherlands in this case, whereas Denmark in the *Green Power* case) whose claim was directed against another EU Member State (Kingdom of Spain).\n\n9.\n\nRespondent argues that the recent *Green Power* Award calls into question the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the intra-EU jurisdictional objection, and insists on the relevance of the dispute between an investor of an EU Member State and a Member State of the European Union, and consequently the relevance of European Union law, its fundamental principles and characteristics, to the dispute and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.3\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 25.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal can reconsider the Decisions when ... *in view of new evidence the content of those Decisions could certainly be affected\",*4 and argues that decisions rendered in an arbitration proceeding prior to an award do not constitute *res judicata* in such a way as to prevent the Tribunal from reviewing it, in view of new evidence submitted to it after the date of its Decision.5\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 24.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 23.\n\n11.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent draws support from the *Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO* Award,6 where the tribunal indicated that: *\"Decisions of tribunals are of course binding within the scope of the proceedings, but this does not make them res judicata. That is so with procedural orders and provisional measures as pointed out earlier. An essential feature of res judicata is that the judgment in question produces effects on the parties outside the proceedings in which it is granted. But decisions of tribunals only have effect within the proceedings until they have been incorporated into the final award*\".7\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 23 and 24, citing **RL-0187** *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20), Award, 12 September 2016, (\"***Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO*** **Award**\") \u00b6 313 Note: Although Respondent attached as an exhibit to its Second Request for Consideration the *Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO* Award, it was originally introduced by Claimants into the record as **CL-213**).\n\n**RL-0152**, *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20), Decision on the Application of Annulment, 22 August 2018, (\"***Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO,*** **Decision on Annulment**\") \u00b6 319.\n\n12.\n\nFurther, Respondent cites \"reasons of efficiency and procedural economy\" for allowing a tribunal to reconsider previously adopted decisions as stated by the *Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO* tribunal:8 \"*[...] The Tribunal also takes the view that exercising a power to reopen in certain limited circumstances has practical advantages.* *It avoids having the Tribunal decide issues on the merits on the basis of a decision which has been seriously called into**question, and then have the parties wait until the whole matter has been included in its**final award before having its decision reopened or subject to annulment, thus potentially wasting the time and expense that has been incurred since the Tribunal**became aware that its decision could be called into question**. Efficiency grounds alone suggest that there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has made.\"*9 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO Award,* \u00b6 320.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 24, citing **RL-0187** *Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO Award,* \u00b6 320.\n\n13.\n\nRespondent indicates that the *Green Power* tribunal found by unanimity that it lacked jurisdiction to hear a dispute involving European law - such as is the case of a claim based on the ECT- brought by a European investor against a European State regarding subsidies to the renewable energy producers which are according to EU Law state aid (i.e., a basic and fundamental institution of EU Law), and adds that the conclusion of such tribunal was ... *reached on the understanding that accepting its jurisdiction would violate European Union law and the autonomy of that body of law, to which both parties to the arbitration are subordinate\".*10\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 7.\n\n14.\n\nRespondent summarizes the findings of the *Green Power* Award:\n\na) The tribunal analysed the intra-EU objection raised by Spain in its *ratione personae* and *ratione voluntatis* aspects and, in relation to the latter, the tribunal analysed the absence of consent to arbitrate intra-EU disputes and the absence of such consent to arbitrate intra-EU disputes under the ECT;\n\nb) The *Green Power* tribunal clarified that this question cannot be analysed only from the perspective of what it deems as \"rigid\" categories of European law or public international law, as it could lead to the exclusion of rules *en bloc*, and hence, the tribunal must determine whether Article 26 ECT can operate in the \"complex relations between Spain and Denmark\"11;\n\nc) According to Respondent, the *Green Power* tribunal gives particular relevance to the fact that in accordance with Article 1.3 ECT the European Union has the character of a REIO based, *inter alia*, on an economic integration agreement as foreseen in Article 25 ECT. Since the EU has always been based on an economic integration agreement the Tribunal cannot follow the argument of the claimants in that case in the event that a disconnection clause was necessary.12\n\nd) Respondent argues that the *Green Power* tribunal concluded that Article 1.3 ECT both entails a recognition by all contracting states of the transfer of competences between Member States and the Union, and expressly recognizes the \"binding\" character of decisions of the Union institutions on the Member States in matters governed by the ECT, which includes both State aid issues and the recognition of the inter-se applicability of the provisions of Article 344 TFEU.13\n\ne) According to Respondent, the *Green Power* tribunal identified three \"powerful grounds\" in favor of the application of *Achmea*: (i) it is clear that in *Achmea* the CJEU, sitting as Grand Chamber, clarified that EU Law was to be applied in order to address the validity of offers to arbitrate intra-EU disputes;14 (ii) *Achmea* also explained that Articles 267 and 344 TFUE, upon proper interpretation, are incompatible with intra-EU arbitration clauses, regardless of whether they are referred to a State-State dispute or an investor-State dispute, and regardless of whether they are entailed in a bilateral treaty or a multilateral one;15 and (iii) *Achmea* also highlighted the relevance of the \"rationale\" behind its conclusions which is the autonomy of EU Law.16\n\nf) Respondent further indicates that the *Green Power* tribunal concludes that, since *Achmea,* the interpretation of the CJEU has been crystal clear, but that notwithstanding, if there might be some doubts, the interpretation is even clearer since *Komstroy*. Citing the *Green Power* tribunal, \"*since Komstroy there should be no doubts so as to the lack of jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals to hear intra-EU disputes. The Tribunal agrees with the Kingdom of Spain that paragraph 66 of the Komstroy ruling is uncontestable*.17\n\ng) In light of such reasons, Respondent adds, the *Green Power* tribunal upheld the intra-EU *ratione voluntatis* jurisdictional objection raised by Respondent and declared that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case.18\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 9, citing **RL-0186** *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 170.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 11, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 352.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 11, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 355.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 422\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 424-425\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 426 et seq.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 15, citing *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 438.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 19.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent contends that the *Green Power* tribunal explained that this analysis is not an issue of *lex arbitri* and hence this approach is also applicable to ICSID cases that are analogous.19\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 20.\n\n16.\n\nRespondent concludes that this Tribunal should reconsider the Decisions in light of the *Green* Award where the tribunal declared the lack of jurisdiction to hear an intra-EU dispute after having performed *an in-depth analysis of the nature and status of the Parties in dispute (i.e., a European investor vs. an EU Member State) as members of a REIO such as the European Union and the value that this has for purposes of the ECT*\".20\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 26.\n\n**B. C****laimants****\u2019 P****osition**\n--------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn essence, Claimants believe the Second Request for Reconsideration submitted by Respondent falls short of the legal standard established by this Tribunal in the Decision on the First Request for Reconsideration as it fails to engage with the Tribunal\u2019s findings, and consequently Spain\u2019s Second Request for Reconsideration should be promptly dismissed,21 specifically requesting the Tribunal to:\n\n(a) dismiss Respondent\u2019s Second Request for Reconsideration;\n\n(b) confirm that the Decision stands in its entirety, and that the *Green Power* Award would have no influence on the outcome of the Decision; and\n\n(c) order Respondent to cover the costs incurred by the Claimants in responding to the Second Request for Reconsideration.22\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 22.\n\n18.\n\nClaimant\u2019s position is addressed in two fronts:\n\n(a) The legal standard set out by the Tribunal means that decisions can be reconsidered but *only* under exceptional circumstances; and\n\n(b) The *Green Power* Award does not warrant reconsideration of the Decision.\n\n**The legal standard set out by the Tribunal: decisions can be reconsidered but** ***only*** **under exceptional circumstances**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nClaimants recall that the Tribunal found that it has the authority to re-examine its Decision but that any reconsideration exercise should be strictly limited to the revision mechanism established by Article 15 of the ICSID Convention for the review of awards and, further, that under Article 51, an award can be reviewed upon \"*the discovery of some fact of such nature as decisively to affect the award\"* and *\"provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and the applicant, and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence\"*.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 5, making reference to the First Decision on Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 86, 87 and 94.\n\n20.\n\nThus, Claimants contend that Respondent is required to demonstrate in its Second Request for Reconsideration, that the *Green Power* Award constitutes: (a) the discovery of a fact; (b) that the fact was unknown to the Tribunal - and that that lack of knowledge [of Respondent] was not the result of negligence; and (c) that the new fact would have decisively affected the Decision.24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 6.\n\n21.\n\nIn connection with the first element, Claimants contend that the *Green Power* Award would qualify as a \"new fact\", since the Tribunal has found that new facts are not strictly limited to factual issues but also involve issues of law. Regarding the second, Claimants agree that it is clear that the *Green Power* Award did not exist at the time of the Decision, and therefore amounts to a newly discovered fact.25\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 7.\n\n22.\n\nIt is with respect to the third element [that the new fact would have decisively affected the Decision] that, according to Claimants, Respondent fails. This follows, because Respondent must demonstrate that that the *Green Power* Award constitutes a legal development of such decisive nature, that it would have led the Tribunal to a different conclusion on jurisdiction, had it been available to the Tribunal at the time of the Decision, and Claimants contend that Respondent made no effort to explain in the Second Request for Reconsideration how the *Green Power* Award meets the standard.26\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 8.\n\n**The** ***Green Power*** **Award does not warrant reconsideration of the Decision.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimants start by arguing that the *Green Power* Award was rendered in an arbitration brought under the SCC Rules and seated in Stockholm which, according to the *Green Power* tribunal, attracted the application of the *lex loci arbitri,* including EU law, to the assessment of jurisdiction.27 Further, Claimants contend that the tribunal in *Green Power* emphasized throughout its award that there is a *\"significant difference\"* between non-ICSID arbitrations such as those under the SCC Rules and ICSID arbitrations.28 The *Green Power* tribunal found that ICSID arbitrations do not have a legal seat and, therefore, to assess jurisdiction, ICSID tribunals do not apply the *lex loci arbitri,* but rather the ICSID Convention and the relevant treaty, and therefore specifically distanced itself from ICSID arbitration and from the findings made by this Tribunal in particular in its Decision.29\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 11, making reference to *Green Power* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 160-166.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 11, making reference to *Green Power* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 160-162, 175 and 439-441, and footnote 171.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 11, making reference to *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 439, where the tribunal stated: \"... [The *Infracapital v Spain* and *Sevilla Beheer v Spain*] cases are ICSID arbitrations and, as a result, the reasoning did not take into account the relevance for jurisdictional matters of the applicable law attracted by the selection of the seat in an EU Member State [...] Unlike the tribunals in *Infracapital v Spain* and *Sevilla Beheer v Spain*, this Tribunal considers that EU law is part of the law applicable to the determination of jurisdiction. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers the reasoning of those ICSID tribunals on this issue inapposite for the present purposes\". (Emphasis in the quote by Claimants).\n\n24.\n\nClaimants also contend that Respondent itself pleaded that the fact that it was an arbitration conducted under the SCC Rules, seated in Sweden, distinguished it *\"from other arbitration proceedings ... governed by the ICSID Convention and not subject to the domestic* lex arbitri *of the seat in an EU Member State\"* and that *\"ICSID awards* [were] *therefore less relevant for the present proceedings*\"30 In Claimants\u2019 view, Spain cannot now argue that this Tribunal should reconsider its finding on jurisdiction because of the *Green Power* Award.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 12, making reference to *Green Power* Award, \u00b6 137.\n\n25.\n\nClaimants argue that, even though Respondent claims that the fact that the arbitration was seated in an EU Member State was not *\"decisive* [to the tribunal] *to reach its conclusion\",* that it did not have jurisdiction, because it also considered that EU law was relevant to determine jurisdiction, as a matter of international law, that the Tribunal has already determined that EU law was not part of the law applicable to the dispute.31\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 14.\n\n26.\n\nFurther, Claimants contend that, even though the *Green Power* Award constitutes a \"new fact\", it does not contain anything that is \"new\" that has not already been addressed by the Parties, adding that Respondent itself acknowledged that: \"[a]*ll these arguments have been raised by the Kingdom of Spain before this honorable Tribunal*\".32 They add that these arguments have been addressed already by the Tribunal in the Decision and, *after careful consideration, it decided that it had jurisdiction over the dispute\"*.33\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 17, making reference to the Second Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 18.\n\n27.\n\nFinally, Claimants address the alleged \"inconsistency\" that Respondent alleges would occur if this Tribunal were to disregard \"the conclusions reached by the *Green Power* Tribunal ...\" and argues that this case is not a Stockholm seated arbitration, and therefore the *Green Power* Award is not relevant for that reason alone.34\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, \u00b6 19.\n\n**III. the tribunal\u2019s analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. A****dmissibility of** **R****espondent****\u2019****s** **R****equest**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal needs to first address whether the Second Request for Reconsideration is available to Respondent before it examines the merits of such request. In its First Request for Reconsideration, the Tribunal identified two thresholds to decide whether or not the request was admissible: (i) whether under the ICSID Arbitration Rules there was an impediment, and (ii) assuming the ICSID Arbitration Rules allowed for such reconsideration, whether the conditions thereto were met by Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n29.\n\nRespondent has not submitted an extended analysis nor support for the admissibility of its Second Request for Reconsideration; it simply states that *[a]s the Tribunal will be aware, neither the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules expressly contemplate the possibility that the Tribunal may reconsider a decision. However, while the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules do not expressly contemplate such a possibility, neither do they expressly prohibit it\",*35 and quoted certain paragraphs of the *Standard Chartered Bank v. TANESCO* Award, to support its position that the Tribunal can reconsider the Decisions because they are not *res judicata*.\n\nSecond Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 21.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal shall examine the Second Request for Reconsideration in light of Respondent\u2019s brief arguments.\n\n31.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted in its First Decision on Reconsideration, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules define the meaning of an \"award\". However, it is possible to identify the meaning of \"award\" by reading Rule 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (The Award), which provides that an award shall be in writing and shall contain, *inter alia,* \"*the decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it, together with the reasons upon which the decision is based.*\"36 This Tribunal interprets this to mean that an award must address and decide on a final basis every issue in conflict brought to it by the parties in the relevant case, and therefore discerns that the Decision is not an \"*award*\" insofar as it deals only with jurisdiction, liability and provides certain guidelines on *quantum*. It does not deal finally with each, and all the issues brought to the Tribunal by the Parties.37\n\nRule 47(1)(i) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"). Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention provides: *\"Either party may request revision of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.\"*\n\nFirst Decision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 80.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that Rule 16 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (Decisions of the Tribunal) generically refers to \"*decisions*\", to describe all decisions made throughout an arbitral proceeding, without establishing any difference between decisions of a procedural nature or those of substance. Thus, the Decisions could be well placed within this term.\n\n33.\n\nFor the same reasons stated in its First Decision on Reconsideration, the Tribunal believes that the Decisions are of such substance as to qualify for reconsideration. Indeed, ICSID tribunals have the authority to re-examine a decision when some fact of decisive importance is discovered on a point already decided by a tribunal. Given the exceptional nature of the remedy, the Tribunal confirms that the strict conditions required by Article 51 of the ICSID Convention for the review of awards should equally apply, by analogy, to pre-award decisions;38\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties do not dispute that Article 51 of the ICSID Convention may be a useful guidance by analogy to the present situation.\n\n34.\n\nThe First Decision on Reconsideration set out the legal standard that a request shall meet to warrant reconsideration. It concluded that reconsideration of a decision would only be justified in exceptional circumstances:39\n\n*\"Respondent is required to demonstrate: (a) the discovery of a fact; that such fact was unknown to the Tribunal, and the applicant's lack of knowledge not being the result of negligence; and (b) that the new fact would have decisively affected the Decision\".*\n\nFirst Decision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 88\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine:\n\na) whether the *Green Power* Award constitutes a \"fact\",\n\nb) whether the *Green Power* Award constitutes a \"new fact\", i.e., whether it was known to both the Tribunal and the Respondent before the Decisions were issued; and\n\nc) whether the fact is *\"of such nature as decisively to affect*\" the Decisions.\n\n36.\n\nIn respect to the *first,* the Tribunal equally concludes -as it did in its First Decision on Reconsideration - that discovery of \"facts\" should not be strictly limited to factual situations that do not comport with the record but also involve issues of law. In line with the conclusions in the First Decision on Reconsideration, the *Green Power* Award would qualify as a \"fact\".\n\n37.\n\n*Second,* from the mere fact that the *Green Power* Award was issued on 16 June 2022, it is clear that it did not exist at the time of the Decisions; it was unknown to both the Tribunal and the Respondent, and therefore it amounts in effect to a \"newly discovered fact\".\n\n38.\n\nThe *third* requirement involves a determinative element, i.e., whether the outcome of the Decisions would have been substantially different, had the *Green Power* Award been available and known to the Tribunal. In other words, whether such award qualifies as a legal development which undermines the Tribunal\u2019s legal determination on jurisdiction. The Tribunal believes that the exceptional character of reconsideration means that a subsequent legal authority that arrives at a different interpretation of the law does not necessarily justify reconsideration. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the *Cavalum* tribunal which observed that for a legal development to be exceptional *\"[i]t must be a decisive legal authority which, if it had existed at the time of the decision, would plainly have led to a different conclusion*\"40\n\n**CL-227**, *Cavalum SGPS, S.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/34), Decision on the Kingdom of Spain\u2019s Request for Reconsideration, 10 January 2022, \u00b6 80.\n\n**B. W****hether the** ***G******reen*** ***P******ower*** **A****ward warrants the reconsideration of the** **D****ecisions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nFor the reasons stated below, the Tribunal determines that the *Green Power* Award -had it been known to it before issuing the Decision or the First Decision on Reconsideration- would not have provided elements to the Tribunal to resolve the issue of jurisdiction in a different manner.\n\n40.\n\nThe basis for this determination is two-fold: (a) the seat of arbitration of this case is Washington, D.C., United States of America, and the case is subject to the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, and (b) there are no new arguments available to the Tribunal to find that its determination on jurisdiction in the Decision, and the First Decision on Reconsideration should be modified. Both are examined below.\n\n41.\n\nThe *Green Power* Award was rendered in an arbitration that has substantial differences from this case. It was brought under the SCC Rules and the seat of arbitration was Stockholm, Sweden in terms of Article 26(4)(c) ECT.41 In examining the law applicable to its jurisdiction, the *Green Power* tribunal acknowledged the differences between ICSID proceedings and those of the *Green Power* case. For one, there is the fact that the seat of arbitration was outside the European Union. The *Green Power* tribunal further acknowledged that the claimants in such case \"*could have opted for an ICSID arbitration under Article 26(4)(a)(i) ECT\",* but opted instead to conduct the proceedings under SCC Rules and later agreed to setting the seat of the arbitration in Stockholm.42 According to the *Green Power* tribunal, the application of the local *lex arbitri* was one of the considerations Claimants took into account when it opted for SCC arbitration in Stockholm.43\n\n*Green Power v Spain*, Award, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Green Power v Spain,* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 159-162\n\n*Green Power v Spain,* Award, \u00b6 163.\n\n42.\n\nIt is clear that the selection of the seat in Sweden, an EU Member State, attracted the application of EU law. This fact was also acknowledged by the *Green Power* tribunal when it determined that ... *[the] Tribunal considers that the relevance and application of EU law to certain questions arising in these proceedings is inescapable, regardless of whether such law is characterized as part of international law or as part of domestic law*\" and resolved that it should therefore be applied to determine jurisdiction.44\n\n*Green Power v Spain*, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 170-172\n\n43.\n\nThe *Green Power* tribunal concluded that ... *interpreting Article 26 ECT without resorting to EU law is inconclusive in the circumstances of this case*\",45 and later found that Swedish law recognizes the primacy of EU law.46\n\n*Green Power v Spain*, Award, \u00b6 412.\n\n*Green Power v Spain*, Award, \u00b6 475.\n\n44.\n\nThis Tribunal notes that the *Green Power* Award specifically examined the issues on jurisdiction of this case (made available by the claimants in the *Green Power* case), and also acknowledged that since this particular case was an ICSID arbitration *the reasoning did not take into account the relevance for jurisdictional matters of the applicable law attracted by the selection of the seat in an EU Member State\",* and concluded that the reasoning of the Decision \"*on this issue* [is] *inapposite for present purposes.*\"47\n\n*Green Power v Spain,* Award, \u00b6 439.\n\n45.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the differences in seat of arbitration and arbitration rules between the *Green Power* case and this particular case do not justify a different conclusion on the findings on the applicability of EU law to determine jurisdiction of this Tribunal in the Decision.\n\n46.\n\nIn any event, and with due respect to the *Green Power* tribunal, this Tribunal strongly disagrees that a tribunal is required, under Article 26 ECT, to interpret and apply EU law. As already concluded in the Decision, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was to be determined by applying Article 26 ECT, as interpreted pursuant to the VCLT, and not EU law. The Tribunal concluded that: \"*the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26, 'in their context' and 'in the light of its object and purpose' as required interpretation under the VCLT leads to conclude that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal derives from the ECT itself.*\"48 The Tribunal concluded that EU law was not part of the question of jurisdiction. This was reiterated in the First Decision on Reconsideration, where the Tribunal concluded that \"*EU law is not applicable to jurisdiction. As a result, the Komstroy Judgment is irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction. The applicable law to jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute is international law, and not principles of sub-systems of international law such as EU treaties*\".49 The same conclusion applies to the *Green Power* Award.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 294.\n\nFirst Decision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 107.\n\n47.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that although the *Green Power* Award is a *new fact,* it does not contain anything *new* that has not already been extensively pleaded by the disputing parties.\n\n48.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal finds that the elements provided by Respondent in respect to the *Green Power* Award do not offer any compelling arguments to modify or even consider modifying the Decisions. The Tribunal confirms that it addressed all arguments submitted by Respondent on the subject in its Decision,50 later transcribed in the First Decision on Reconsideration.51 The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to repeat them.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 289-306.\n\nFirst Decision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 117.\n\n**IV.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty which entered into force on 16 April 1998, for Spain, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (the \"**ECT**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimants are Infracapital F1 S.\u00e0 r.l., a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and Infracapital Solar B.V., a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (together, \"**Claimants**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Spain**\" or the \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute relates to the alleged breaches by Spain of its obligations under the ECT. Claimants contend that the Government of Spain implemented measures which modified and altered the regulatory and economic framework for renewable energy projects, which Claimants had relied on when making their investments.\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 September 2021, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on *Quantum* (\"**Decision**\"), Prof. Peter D. Cameron attached a Partial Dissenting Opinion, dated 13 September 2021 (the \"**Partial Dissent**\").\n\n7.\n\nIn the Decision, and for the reasons indicated therein, the Tribunal ruled as follows:1\n\n*\" (1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claims of breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT brought by Claimants, save in respect to the tax measure identified in paragraph (2) below, and therefore the remaining six jurisdictional objections of Respondent are rejected.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim of breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT with respect to the TVPEE.*\n\n*(3) Claimants did not have a legitimate expectation that the remuneration of RD 1578 would continue to be paid for at least 25 years.*\n\n*(4) Respondent breached of Article 10(1) of the ECT by clawing back past remuneration.*\n\n*(5) Respondent breached Article 10(1) to the extent that the remuneration of each of the plants failed to ensure payment to Claimants of a reasonable rate of return on their investment during the lifetime of Claimants' PV Plants, as a consequence of the adoption of the Disputed Measures.*\n\n*(6) All other claims of Claimants and requests of the Parties are dismissed.*\n\n*(7) The Parties are directed to attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimants in respect to its obligations on post-tax rate of return in accordance with the Tribunal's findings.*\n\n*(8) The Parties are directed to attempt to reach an agreement within three months after the date of this Decision.*\n\n*(9) Should the Parties reach an agreement, they are directed to so report to the Tribunal in order to enable the Tribunal to issue an Award incorporating such agreement and deal with any residual issues identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings.*\n\n*(10) Should the Parties fail to reach an agreement in accordance with paragraph (7) supra, either Party may request the Tribunal to decide any outstanding issues in dispute, and the Tribunal will, following consultation with the Parties, fix a calendar for further submissions of the Parties on the outstanding issues relating to damages due to Claimants.*\n\n*(11) the Decision on the final determination of the damages due is thus reserved and will be fixed in the Award, along with the Tribunal's decisions as to interest and costs.\"*\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822.\n\n8.\n\nThe full text of the Decision, including the Partial Dissent, constitutes an integral part of this Award, and it is hereby incorporated as Annex A. The Procedural History of this arbitration leading up to the rendering of the Decision is summarized at Section II of that Decision. A summary of the procedural steps thereafter follows below.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to section III of the Decision for factual background of the case; and to the submissions made by the Parties and the Parties' respective requests for relief up to the Decision, referenced therein. In consequence, none of that is repeated here.\n\n10.\n\nIn this Award, unless the context otherwise requires, the Tribunal adopts the defined terms used in the Decision.\n\n**II. POST-DECISION PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, Respondent submitted a request entitled \"*Respondent's Petition of Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits on the basis of the CJEU Decision in the Case C-741/19, Republic of Moldova, ECLI:EU:C:2021:655*\" to declare the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction for this case (the \"First **Request for Reconsideration**\").2\n\nThe decision involved **RL-0151**, *Republic of Moldova v Komstroy LLC,* (the \"***Komstroy*** **Judgment**\") European Union Court of Justice Judgment of 2 September 2021 in the case C-741/19, *Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy LLC* (\"***Komstroy*** **Judgment**\")*.*\n\n12.\n\nSince the three-month period established in the Decision for the Parties to attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of compensation was due to expire on 13 December 2021, the Parties advised the Tribunal on 10 December 2021 that an extension would be required for them to complete their discussions, and on 13 December 2021, a joint request was made3 to extend the deadline until 18 February 2022. The Tribunal agreed on 14 December 2021 to the extension requested.\n\nClaimants submitted the request advising on the joint agreement, which Respondent confirmed on 14 December 2021.\n\n13.\n\nAfter having received, at the Tribunal's request,4 comments from Claimants on Respondent's First Request for Reconsideration,5, the Tribunal issued on 1 February 2022 its \"*Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits*\", rejecting such request for the reasons therein established.\n\nOn 16 October 2021, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit any comments to the Request for Reconsideration.\n\nOn November 12, 2021, Claimants submitted their response entitled \"*Claimants' Response to Respondent's Petition for Reconsideration Regarding the Intra-EU Objection and the Merits*\".\n\n14.\n\nOn 17 February 2022, the Parties requested an additional extension until 11 March 2022, which the Tribunal confirmed on the same date. Additional requests for extension were made by the Parties on 8 and 25 March 2022, which the Tribunal confirmed on the same dates they were submitted.\n\n15.\n\nOn 29 March 2022, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they had not been able to reach agreement on the amount of compensation due to Claimants, although they had collaborated to prepare a joint report. In that respect, Claimants requested the opportunity to make submissions on the issues upon which the Parties and their Experts had not been able to reach agreement, proposing terms for the submissions. Although Respondent disagreed with Claimants that written submissions were necessary, Respondent proposed short written submissions with limitations on the modality, scope, length and timeliness.\n\n16.\n\nOn 31 March 2022, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties that it had decided to allow for simultaneous written submissions following the Joint Report of their Experts to be delivered on 1 April 2022, establishing the terms thereof.\n\n17.\n\nOn 1 April 2022, the Parties submitted the Joint Report prepared by their respective Experts6 entitled \"*Brattle-BDO Joint Memorandum\"* (the \"**Experts' Joint Memorandum**\").\n\nThe Experts who participated and signed the Joint Memorandum were Messrs. Carlos Lapuerta, Richard Caldwell and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda of The Brattle Group (\"**Brattle**\"), the experts retained by Claimants (\"**Claimants' Experts**\"); and Messrs. Gervase MacGregor, Eduardo P\u00e9rez, Javier Espel and David Mitchell of BDO (\"**BDO**\"), the experts retained by Respondent (\"**Respondent's Experts**\"). Claimants' Experts together with Respondent's Experts will be referred to as (the \"**Experts**\").\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 April 2022, each of Claimants and Respondent submitted their respective submissions:\n\na). Claimants' Quantum Submission (\"**Claimants' Quantum Submission**\");\n\nand\n\nb). Respondent's Submissions on the Issues in Disagreement on Quantum (\"**Respondent's Quantum Submission**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 June 2022, Respondent submitted a request entitled \"*Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decisions of 13 September 2021 and 1 February 2022 on the Basis of the Green Power Award*\" to declare the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction for this case (the \"**Second Request for Reconsideration**\").7\n\nThe Second Request for Reconsideration involved **RL-0186,** *Green Power Partners K/S and SCE Solar Don Benito v. Kingdom of Spain*, case SCC-2016/135, Award, 16 June 2022 (\"***Green Power*** **Award**\")*.*\n\n20.\n\nAfter receipt of Claimants' comments to Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration on 21 July 2022,8 the Tribunal issued on 19 August 2022 its \"*Decision on Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration*\", rejecting such request for the reasons therein established.\n\nOn 21 July 2022, Claimants submitted their response entitled \"*Claimants Comments on Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration*\".\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 December 2022, Respondent submitted a request entitled \"*Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision of 19 August 2022*\" to declare the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction for this case in light of two recent judgments involving intra-EU disputes (the \"**Third Request for Reconsideration**\").9\n\nThe judgments cited are (a) **RL-0188**, Svea Court of Appeal Judgment dated 13 December 2022 on the appeal brought by the Kingdom of Spain to declare null and void the arbitral award dated 15 February 2018 in case SCC No. V (2015/063) between *Novenergia II-Energy & Environment (SCA) (Novenergia) and the Kingdom of Spain**,* and (b) **RL-0189**, the Swedish Supreme Court Judgment, dated 14 December 2022, setting aside the award in *PL Holdings v. Poland.*\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 January 2023, the Parties filed simultaneous updated submissions on costs.\n\n23.\n\nAfter receipt of Claimants' comments to Respondent's Third Request for Reconsideration on 4 January 2023,10 the Tribunal issued on 2 February 2023 its \"*Decision on Respondent's Third Request for Reconsideration*\", rejecting such request for the reasons therein established.\n\nOn 4 January 2023, Claimants submitted their response and comments in the form of a brief letter indicating that, \"*In light of the repetitive nature of Spain's arguments and in the interests of efficiency, the Claimants do not intend to re-state their position on the relevance of EU law yet again. Rather, the Claimants refer the Tribunal to their previous submissions on EU law, including but not limited to their submissions dated 12 November 2021 on Spain's First Request, and 21 July 2022 on Spain's Second Request*\".\n\n24.\n\nOn 2 February 2023, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n25.\n\nExcept as otherwise noted in this Award, and as previously indicated, the defined terms in the Decision shall continue to apply and be used by the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the Experts utilize in the Experts' Joint Memorandum (and the Parties in limited occasions in their respective submissions) the term \"Original Regulatory Regime\" and \"New Regulatory Regime\". When quoting the Experts, the Tribunal maintains their reference, but otherwise keeps the terms \"Original Regime\" and \"New Regime\" as used in the Decision.\n\n**III. THE EXPERTS' JOINT MEMORANDUM**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A. A****reas of** **A****greement and** **D****isagreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine the areas of agreement and disagreement in the Experts' Joint Memorandum, and then examine the positions each of the Parties has addressed in their respective quantum submission.\n\n27.\n\nThe Experts' Joint Memorandum indicates that pursuant to the Tribunal's instructions, the Parties were directed to attempt to reach an agreement on the impact of two elements:\n\n(i) the wrongful \"*retroactive application of the Disputed Measures*\" concerning the PV Plants belonging to the Claimant (which the Experts define as \"**Retroactivity Damages**\") and\n\n(ii) to the extent \"*the measures \u2026 failed to maintain the reasonable rate of return ensured to Claimants under the primary legislation*\" (which the Experts define as \"**Reasonable Return Damages**\"), under the following so-called \"*essential parameters*\" contained in the Decision:11\n\n*\"i.* ***Period of depreciation****. ...this Tribunal believes the period to consider should be 25 years.*\n\n*ii. The* ***target rate of return****. 7% after-tax return.*\n\n*iii.* ***Investment and Operating costs****...the exercise should take into account the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants.*\n\n*iv.* ***[Effective] Tax Rate****. The Tribunal accepts the 19.6% average tax rate across all of Claimants' PV Plants as proposed by Brattle, under the assumption that Claimants' PV Plants have no debt financing that translates into a tax shield benefit that lowers this rate. ...If, however, any of the Fontellas Plants, Lasesa Plants, Tordesillas Plants, Valtierra I & II Pants and Valtierra III Plants owned by Claimants through the various subsidiaries established had debt financing that received a tax shield benefit, this factor shall need to be taken into account individually for each PV Plant, as required, in order to determine the actual tax rate.*\n\n*v.* ***Date of Valuation****. . The Disputed Measures were finally adopted in June of 2014 \u2013date on which Spain enacted the final June 2014 Order that culminated with the Disputed Measures\u2013and therefore the Tribunal deems that this is the date for calculation of the damage. (emphasis added).\"*\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 3, indicating that the Tribunal suggested in paragraphs 744, as well as 811 to 821of the Decision that the Parties take account of such \"essential parameters\" in attempting to reach an agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimants in respect to its obligations on post-tax rate of return in accordance with the Tribunal's findings.\n\n28.\n\nBrattle and BDO agree that computing damages pursuant to the Tribunal's findings involve consideration of a series of incremental cash flows (which they define as \"**Revised Cash Flows**\") related to the Reasonable Return Damages and the Retroactivity Damages,12 which they examine separately.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5.\n\n29.\n\nIn the determination of Reasonable Return Damages, the elements on which the Experts agree can be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants' PV Plants that fail to obtain under the New Regime the Original Regime's target of 7% after-tax lifetime project return are entitled to Reasonable Return Damages.13\n\n(b) that Reasonable Return Damages should reflect the \"*stand-alone impact in case the Disputed Measures failed to ensure a reasonable return to Claimants*\" and, further, that the relevant analysis should not attempt to also eliminate from the New Regime the claw-back of profits earned in the period prior to July 2013 under the Original Regime (i.e., the Retroactivity Damages).14\n\n(c) that to calculate the Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages, it is first necessary to convert the 7% *post*-tax rate of return under the Original Regime into a *pre*-tax rate of return that will be used for the But-for scenario. To do so, they agree that it is necessary to estimate an effective tax rate to use in the conversion.15\n\n(d) Claimants' PV Plants benefitted from the tax deductibility of interest paid under shareholders loans.16\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5, under first bullet point, \"*Reasonable Return Damages*\".\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5, under first bullet point, \"*Reasonable Return Damages*\".\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 9.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 38.\n\n30.\n\nIn connection with Retroactivity Damages, the Experts agree:\n\n(a) that Retroactivity Damages should only attempt to eliminate from the New Regime the claw-back of profits earned in the period prior to July 2013 under the Original Regime.17\n\n(b) to replace the July 2013 Net Asset Value (\"**NAV**\") adopted by Spain with the Revised July 2013 NAV, but otherwise to follow the calculations of the Investment Incentive per MW in the June 2014 Ministerial Order.18\n\n(c) to acknowledge a relationship between the calculation of Retroactivity Damages and the separate calculation of Reasonable Return Damages.19\n\n(d) that any Reasonable Return calculation continues to include a claw-back of profits earned prior to July 2013. The Experts also agree that the Retroactivity Damages calculation should therefore involve the elimination of the remaining \"*Claw-Back Feature*\" not already accounted for in the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages.20\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5, second bullet point, \"*Retroactivity Damages*\".\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 86.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\n31.\n\nOn the other hand, the Experts disagree on three key elements relating to the determination of Retroactivity Damages:21\n\n(i) the impact of the interest tax shield;\n\n(ii) the actual costs of the Claimants' PV Plants; and\n\n(iii) the alleged \"improper attempt\" of BDO to re-instate the claw-back as claimed by Brattle.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\n**B. R****easonable** **R****eturn** **D****amages**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Experts summarize their positions on the Reasonable Return Damages as follows:\n\n*\"****Reasonable Return Damages****: The Experts agree that Reasonable Return Damages should reflect the stand-alone impact in case the Disputed Measures failed to ensure a reasonable return to Claimants and that the relevant analysis should not attempt to also eliminate from the New Regulatory Regime the claw-back of profits earned in the period prior to July 2013 under the Original Regulatory Regime (i.e. Retroactivity Damages). The Experts agree that Claimants' PV plants that fail to obtain under the New Regulatory Regime the Original Regulatory Regime's target of 7% after-tax lifetime project return are entitled to Reasonable Return Damages. Brattle considers that all of the Claimants' PV plants are entitled to Reasonable Return Damages as none of them receive the 7% after-tax return offered under the Original Regulatory Regime. BDO disagrees, and considers that the Tordesillas Plants, Fontellas Plants and Valtierra III Plants will obtain under the New Regulatory Regime (after removing the retroactivity effect of the Disputed Measures) returns in excess of the after-tax target return of 7%. Brattle and BDO further disagree on the annual incremental cash flows that the Lasesa Plants and the Valtierra I & II Plants needed in each year after 2013 for each of the PV projects to achieve the 7% after-tax return.\"22*\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5.\n\n33.\n\nAs stated in the Experts' Joint Memorandum, the Experts disagree on two essential parameters necessary to estimate the Revised Cash Flows related to Reasonable Return:\n\n(a) the effective tax rates that the Tribunal should use to convert into pre-tax numbers the post-tax 7% target return under the New Regime defined by the Tribunal (*essential parameter \"iv\"*); and\n\n(b) the appropriate methodology to consider the \"separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants\" with respect to their investment and operating costs (*essential parameter \"iii\"*) when estimating the revised incremental revenues.\n\n**(1) Effective Tax Rate and Pre-Tax Target Rate**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Experts agree that to calculate both the Reasonable Return and Retroactivity Damages, it is first necessary to convert the 7% post-tax rate of return under the Original Regime into a pre-tax rate of return that will be used in the But-for scenario. The Experts further agree that, to convert the Original Regime's 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax return, it is necessary to estimate an effective tax rate to use in that conversion.\n\n35.\n\nHowever, the Experts disagree on the relevance of the tax shield benefits of the shareholder loans to estimate the effective tax rate for purposes of this conversion,23 and include an Appendix showing the Experts' damages estimation subject to the different positions on the effective tax rate.24\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 9.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, Appendix \"A\".\n\n36.\n\nBoth Experts acknowledge that interest generated by the shareholder loans are deductible expenses that reduce the project effective tax rate, i.e., the effective tax paid by the projects, even in an all-equity basis (as shareholder loans may also be deemed equity funds).25\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 32.\n\n37.\n\nPerhaps the primary area of disagreement among the Experts is that, while Brattle believes that the Spanish regulator took into account any interest tax shield (external debt or shareholder loans) when setting remuneration,26 BDO believes Claimants' PV Plants indeed had tax shield benefits through the various shareholder loans granted, and the exercise should follow the Tribunal's instructions in the determination of the effective tax rate.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 26.\n\n38.\n\nThus, the Tribunal understood Brattle's and BDO's positions and arguments, and decided that if stakeholder financing was used, the relevant company enjoyed tax deductions on the rest paid. The Tribunal however was not certain at the time of issuing the Decision that such financing existed. In this regard, the Experts agree that such shareholder financing exists.27\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 38.\n\n**(2) Investment Costs**\n------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Experts indicate that, pursuant to the Tribunal's instructions in the Decision, the Experts \"*should take into account the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants*\" when estimating damages. In this respect, the Experts agree that the interpretation of the Tribunal's instruction to factor the \"*separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants*\" is ultimately a legal issue. Within that context, the Experts disagree on the interpretation of this instruction.28\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 44.\n\n40.\n\nBrattle proposes four different interpretations of the \"*marginal plant*\" to estimate the \"*Alternative Damages*\" based on an entitlement to a reasonable return.29\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 45-50.\n\n41.\n\nBDO states that, since the Tribunal concluded in the Decision that \"\u2026 *the exercise should take into account the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants*\",30 this should \"*automatically exclude use of the average plant by technology or the marginal plant\" as proposed by Brattle*.\"31\n\nDecision, \u00b6 815.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 60.\n\n42.\n\nBDO's Reasonable Return Damages approach is based on the actual performance of the Claimants' PV Plants to determine whether Claimants' PV Plants \"*obtained a return above or below that which has been established to be a reasonable return*\" but contends that the incurred investment cost of the Plants must be disregarded, as the PV Plants were not arm's length transactions.32\n\nBDO states that there was an \"*unjustified high investment cost declared by the Claimants*\", Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 57.\n\n43.\n\nBDO further argues that \"\u2026 *the best proxy to use is the investment cost of a typical installation, which is reasonably reflected by the own IT-code*\".33 To this end, BDO calculated Claimants' individual PV Plants' IRR under the New Regime to address the question of proportionality raised by the Tribunal. Once BDO calculates the actual pre-tax IRR of each of the PV Plants, BDO removes the claw-back effect of the Disputed Measures (which resulted in higher cash-flows of the Plants), that has the effect of increasing the Plants' IRR. BDO clarifies that in the first step the retroactivity of the New Regime is removed, while in the second BDO only seeks to determine, once the retroactivity is removed, whether the Plants' returns are above or below the target return. By doing this, BDO defines the return of Claimants' PV Plants to the 7% post-tax.34\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 55.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 77-81.\n\n44.\n\nBrattle criticises BDO's approach, as it deems that the IRRs computed by BDO do not reflect actual costs and performance, but a mix and match of the investment costs of standard installations and the actual costs and production of Claimants' PV Plants.35 In contrast, Brattle adopts the calculation framework of the New Regime to estimate Reasonable Return damages, and makes one adjustment: it replaces the 7.398% pre-tax return used by Spain in the relevant Ministerial Orders with an 8.7% pre-tax return, equivalent to a 7% post-tax. This single change generates Revised Investment Incentives per MW and Operating Incentives per MWh, and ultimately the Revised Cash Flows to Claimants' Plants. By design, the Revised Investment and Operating Incentives are sufficient to provide the target reasonable return, measured for a given standard installation or individual facility through an IRR. Then, in a second step, Brattle eliminates the retroactivity still embedded in the formulas of the New Regime, regardless of the level of the allowed rate of return (7.398% pre-tax or 7% post-tax). According to Brattle, the result is post-July 2013 remuneration based on the New Regime framework that reflects both: (i) the 7% post-tax target return identified by the Tribunal and (ii) an elimination of any retroactivity in the formulas of the New Regime through delinking the Revised July 2013 NAV from the pre-July 2013 cash flows assumed by Spain for particular plants or groups of plants.36\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 62.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n**C. R****etroactivity** **D****amages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Experts also summarized their positions on the Retroactivity Damages in the Experts Joint Memorandum, as follows.\n\n*\"****Retroactivity Damages****: The Experts agree that Retroactivity Damages should only attempt to eliminate from the New Regulatory Regime the claw-back of profits earned in the period prior to July 2013 under the Original Regulatory Regime. The Experts disagree about precisely how to eliminate the pre-July 2013 claw-back feature.\"*37\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5.\n\n46.\n\nThe Experts further agree that:\n\n*\"\u2026 the first step in the calculation of Retroactivity Damages due to the Claw-Back Feature is to estimate a Net Asset Value (\"****NAV****\") for each of the Claimants' PV Plants as of July 2013, which represents the extent of unrecovered capital and the effective investment upon which the post-July 2013 target return should be computed. The Experts estimate a July 2013 NAV based on an initial investment cost for each plant less an estimate of notional capital recovery in the pre-July 2013 period. The New Regulatory Regime also computed a July 2013 NAV, but took into account the historical cash flows actually earned by different standard installations and assumed that the plants were entitled only to earn a return of 7.398% pre-tax in the pre-July 2013 period. Retroactivity Damages stem from the New Regulatory Regime's underestimate of the remaining July 2013 NAV.\"*38\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 83.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal reproduces the following statements from the Experts' Joint Memorandum, on this topic,39 which further indicate their areas of agreement and disagreement:\n\n*\"84. The Experts disagree about the assumptions necessary to estimate the notional capital recovery to derive the Revised July 2013 NAV. Brattle calculates the Revised July 2013 NAV using the estimations for standard installations defined by Spain under the New Regulatory Regime for each of the scenarios (using Marginal Plant, Average Plant, Own IT code) and also presents a scenario using the Claimants' Plants actual investment costs. BDO computes a Revised July 2013 NAV only for the Own IT code option.\"*40\n\n*\"85. To avoid retroactivity, the calculation of the Revised July 2013 NAV must ignore the pre-July 2013 cash-flows estimated by Spain for the standard installation selected in the June 2014 Ministerial Order. Instead, the calculation of the Revised July 2013 NAV must include a deduction representing a notional recovery of capital costs in the operating period prior to July 2013. The notional recovery of capital is affected by two main assumptions. First, the applicable target rate of return in the period prior to July 2013 and the applicable indexation of pre-July 2013 payments.\"*41\n\n*\"86. The Experts agree to replace the July 2013 NAV adopted by Spain with the Revised July 2013 NAV, but otherwise to follow the calculations of the Investment Incentive per MW in the June 2014 Ministerial Order. The Revised July 2013 NAV flows directly into the relevant equations and results in a series of \"Revised Investment Incentives\" per MW for the standard installation in each scenario, which compare directly to the series of Investment Incentives per MW actually computed and applied by Spain over time. In theory, the difference between the series of Revised Investment Incentives per MW for each standard installation and the Investment Incentives per MW actually applied by Spain represents the stand-alone impact of the Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed Measures.\"*42\n\n*\"87. The Revised Investment Incentives also affect the estimation of the 7% tax on revenues, the TVPEE. Higher revenues mean higher payments related to the TVPEE. In order to compensate the plants for the increase in the TVPEE, the Experts estimate an uplift to the Operating Incentive.\"*43\n\n*\"88. Finally, the Experts acknowledge a relationship between the calculation of Retroactivity Damages and the separate calculation of Reasonable Return Damages. The magnitude of the Revised Investment Incentives per MW will naturally depend on both the Revised July 2013 NAV and the assumed allowed rate of return. The adoption of a revised target return of 7% post-tax in the Reasonable Return Damages calculation therefore will necessarily interact and impact the magnitude of any Retroactivity Damages. The Experts agree that any Reasonable Return calculation continues to include a claw back of profits earned prior to July 2013. The Experts also agree that the Retroactivity Damages calculation should therefore involve the elimination of the remaining Claw-Back Feature not already accounted for in the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages.\"*44\n\n*\"89. As a result, Retroactivity Damages involves applying the series of Revised Investment Incentives per MW from the selected scenario, and comparing the resulting cash-flows with the cash-flows obtained under the Reasonable Return Damages already computed for the relevant scenario. The difference between these two values represents the remaining stand-alone impact of the Claw-Back Feature of the New Regulatory Regime. The Experts therefore remind the Tribunal of the need to compute Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages based on a consistent set of modelling assumptions. Mixing and matching assumptions for each of the separate calculation would result in distortions.\"*45\n\nSection II.B *Retroactivity Damages* of the Experts' Joint Memorandum.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 84\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 85.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 86.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 87.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 89.\n\n**(1) Elements of the Claw-Back Feature**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Experts agree on two issues: (a) that the Original Regime calculated the incentives to renewable energy producers based on a different set of target return, tariff indexation and regulatory lifetime than Spain now provides for under the New Regime. The Experts also agree that these inputs, among others (production, pool price, operational expenditures, taxes, etc.), affect the profitability of a plant and thus the investment income generated by capital investment, and (b) that in order to eliminate the Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed Measures, a portion of the past profits that Spain used to calculate the July 2013 NAV must be removed from the revised calculation. The Experts disagree on the exact portion of the past profits to be removed.46\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 91.\n\n49.\n\nWhere the Experts disagree relates to deductions made under the June 2014 Ministerial Order. To compute the July 2013 NAV for each standard installation under the New Regime,47 the June 2014 Ministerial Order started with an assumed amount of capital investment. From the assumed amount of capital investment, the June 2014 Ministerial Order then made two deductions. Both of the deductions depended on an assumption that, prior to July 2013, PV Plants under RD 1578/2008 were only entitled to earn 7.398% pre- tax over a 30-year regulatory lifetime. Brattle considers that both of the deductions are part of the violative Claw-Back Feature, while BDO considers only the first deduction to be part thereof.48\n\nBDO claims that the NAV is a \"*financial based concept defined in the New Regulatory Regime, which depends on a regulatory period (30-year period as defined in the New Regulatory Regime) and a given target return that changes in each regulatory period (for the first regulatory period and thus for the July 2013 NAV calculation the target return defined in the New Regulatory Regime was a 7.398% pre-tax return*).\" Brattle does not agree that the NAV \"*depends on\" the regulatory period and target return. The NAV is a measure of the investment base. At the outset of a PV Plant's life, it represents the total capital invested in the project. Over time a PV plant earns remuneration and recovers its upfront costs. The NAV therefore reduces over time to reflect the recovery of investment costs. The extent of capital recovery over time \"depends on\" the remuneration provided*.\" Experts' Joint Memorandum, note 57.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 92.\n\n**(2) The Pre-Tax Equivalent of the 7% Target Return and its Implication in the July 2013 NAV**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Experts debate regarding the pre-tax equivalent of the 7% after-tax rate of return, specifically, in connection with the inclusion of a tax shield.49\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 111.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Brattle, the Experts agree that, when setting the FITs under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, the return actually targeted by Spain prior to July 2013 was 7% post-tax on an all-equity basis. However, Brattle indicates that the New Regime targets a pre-tax return of 7.398%, which is equivalent to only 5.95% after taxes on an \"all equity\" basis. That is why Brattle contends that, if the Tribunal were to decide to incorporate an interest tax shield when setting remuneration after July 2013 (as recommended by BDO), then it should revert to the 8.7% pre-tax figure excluding the interest tax shield for the calculation of Retroactivity Damages in the period prior to July 2013.50\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 117.\n\n52.\n\nBDO, on the other hand, believes that, although changes in the rate of return have an impact on the notional capital recovery prior to July 2013, it believes that changes in the rate of return should be included within the Reasonable Return Damages.51\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 118.\n\n**(3) Tariff Indexation or Constant Annuities**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Experts disagree on this issue. Brattle states that RD 1578/2008 FITs annually adjusted the FIT's according to inflation \u2013more specifically, according to the general Consumer Price Index (\"**CPI**\"), and the New Regime involves a constant annual remuneration without any indexation (i.e., a constant annuity), and that this failure to account for the historical indexation of the FITs under the Original Regime contributes to the Claw-Back Feature.52\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 119.\n\n54.\n\nBDO, on the other hand, contends that Brattle's tariff indexation is not correct, and it has no economic foundation, and therefore does not accurately represent the capital recovery that the standard installations would have had. This, because the Tribunal concluded that the New Regime should not have used past profits to calculate the future remuneration of the Plants, but it did not find that the mechanism to calculate the NAV breached the ECT, and the mechanism calculates the remuneration with constant annuities,53 and the indexation theory ignores that the cash-flows (annuities) depend on many other elements besides tariffs, such as the plant's production, pool prices, changes in the operational expenditures, CPI evolution, other legal and tax measures.54\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 131.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 132.\n\n**D. D****iscount** **R****ate and** **R****egulatory** **R****isk** **H****aircut**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Experts agree that the damages analysis must translate the series of incremental cash flows adopted by each Expert into present value figures. The Experts disagree with the applicable discount rate for Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages, in addition to the disagreement concerning the incremental cash flow.55\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 135.\n\n56.\n\nBrattle's damages analysis in the arbitration assumed that regulatory risk would have been lower in the But-for scenario than in the Actual scenario, based on contemporaneous market commentary indicating that the Disputed Measures had introduced additional regulatory risk, and maintains that the But-for scenario should reflect a stable and ect-compliant regulatory framework and thus less risk than the Actual scenario. On the other hand, Brattle observes that BDO's \"*uniform regulatory risk*\" assumption would imply a tension between the Tribunal's liability finding and the contemporaneous market commentary about regulatory risk cited by Brattle in the arbitration.56\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 137-138.\n\n57.\n\nFor its part, BDO contends that the Tribunal has rejected the Claimants' But-for Scenario because all the Disputed Measures have been \"*deemed to be legal (save for the retroactive effect of the NAV calculation and the target return*)\" which is very similar to the Actual Scenario \u2013the only difference being the approach for calculating the July 2013 NAV and the target return. BDO adds that \"*the relevant question is whether market participants would have perceived different regulatory risk in similar contexts*.\"57\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 139-142.\n\n**E. P****rejudgment** **I****nterest**\n---------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAlthough the Experts agree to compute pre-award interest based on Spanish Sovereign bond yields, Brattle recommends that the Tribunal compute pre-decision interest based on 10-year Spanish Sovereign bond yields because it contends that Spanish Sovereign bond yields represent the Respondent's borrowing costs, and as such satisfy the \"*forced loan*\" theory, which \"\u2026 *analogises a damages decision to a forced loan from the Claimants to the Respondent*\", and the Claimants should therefore be compensated for this forced loan in exactly the same way as willing lenders to Spain.58 BDO, on the other hand, proposes an 8-year Spanish Sovereign bond, since the yields would compensate Claimants for the delay in compensation that has occurred, taking in to account that the starting point should be the valuation date, i.e., June 2014, and 7 years and 6 months have passed since then.59\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 143.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 143-146.\n\n**F.

C****laimants****' P****osition**\n--------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nClaimants have requested the Tribunal61 to:\n\n*(a) order that Spain pays the Claimants compensation for a total amount of EUR 50.7 million;*\n\n*(b) pay the Claimants pre-award interest based on 10-year Spanish Sovereign bond yields, compounded monthly;*\n\n*(c) pay the Claimants post-award interest, at a rate higher than the 10-year Spanish Sovereign bond yield to be determined by the Tribunal, compounded monthly, from the date of the award until full payment thereof;*\n\n*(d) pay the Claimants all costs and expenses of this arbitration on a full-indemnity basis, including all expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will incur in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, legal counsel, experts and consultants; and*\n\n*(e) any other relief that the Tribunal may deem just and proper.*\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 60.\n\n61.\n\nIn their quantum submission, Claimants addressed and commented on the areas of disagreement between the Experts on both the Reasonable Return Damages and the Retroactivity Damages.\n\n**(1) Reasonable Return Damages**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nClaimants contend that, although the Parties' Experts agree that Reasonable Return Damages requires the determination of the Revised Cash Flows necessary for each of the Claimants' PV Plants to obtain the 7% post-tax return offered under the Original Regime \u2013as indicated in the description of the Experts' Joint Memorandum\u2013 Brattle argues that they disagree on three issues:62\n\na) the impact of the interest tax shield. Brattle follows the same methodology as the Original Regime by only taking account of the tax shield when modelling the actual taxes paid by the Claimants' PV Plants;\n\nb) the actual costs of the Claimants' PV plants is the correct cost base. Brattle provides four possible alternatives (each examined below) to determine which investment and operating costs should serve as the basis on which to compute the Revised Cash Flows, specifically including the actual costs of the Claimants' PV Plants; and\n\nc) Brattle's contention of BDO's improper attempt to re-instate the claw-back. Since Brattle contends that BDO adopts an approach which effectively neutralizes the Tribunal's finding on retroactive claw-back by purporting to eliminate its impact, but re-introducing a new form of retroactivity, Brattle performs a straightforward calculation which determines the additional cash flows needed to provide each of the Claimants' PV Plants with a 7% post-tax return over their lifetime.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n***a. Impact of the Interest Tax Shield***\n------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimants recall that the Tribunal instructed the Parties and their Experts in the Decision to compute Reasonable Return Damages using the 7% post-tax return that was offered under the Original Regime (emphasis by Claimants). Claimants contend that, although the Experts agree that the first step is to convert the Original Regime's 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax return, and doing so entails estimating an effective tax rate, they disagree on how to make such conversion.\n\n64.\n\nAccording to Claimants, this calculation should be made in such way as to determine what they would have received in \"*real life*\", and to this end they argue that Brattle adopts the same approach as the Spanish regulator under the Original Regime, by assuming there is no impact from the interest tax shield for purposes of converting the 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax target return. By doing so, Brattle calculates an effective tax rate of 19.6% and therefore converts the 7% post-tax return into an 8.7% pre-tax return.63 Claimants add that \"\u2026*Brattle then uses the 8.7% pre-tax rate of return to derive the amount of revenue needed to ensure the Claimants receive the equivalent of the Original Regime's 7% post-tax return. In a second step, Brattle then reflects the actual taxes paid in 'real life' at each of the PV Plants, including by taking into account the interest tax shield\"*.64\n\nAs described in the Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 10(a).\n\n65.\n\nClaimants also contend that the Tribunal instructed in the Decision that any tax shield benefit obtained by the PV plants be \"*taken into account individually for each PV plant, as required, in order to determine the actual tax rate*\",65 and stressed the importance that the Claimants do not \"*do better in litigation than in real life*\",66 and that Brattle's two-step approach to implementing the interest tax shield does exactly that, adding that this is the rate of return the Claimants' PV Plants would have actually received under the Original Regime and also reflects the actual taxes that each of the Claimants' PV plants would have paid.67\n\nDecision, \u00b6 817.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 754.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n66.\n\nClaimants criticise BDO's calculations by saying that BDO ignores the instruction to use the Original Regime's (single) 7% post-tax benchmark (by assuming that the Original Regime 7% target rate of return did, in fact, take account of the interest tax shield), and applies a *different* effective tax rate for each of the PV Plants that results in a *different* (and much lower) pre-tax target return for each PV Plant.68 According to Claimants, BDO then computes Revised Investment and Operating Incentives (as these terms are defined in the Experts' Joint Memorandum) based on these so-called by Claimants \"*artificial*\" pre-tax target returns for each plant. In this calculation, the average effective tax rate across the plants is 12.8%, which translates to an average pre-tax return of 8%.69\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 10(b).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 10(b).\n\n67.\n\nClaimants contend that the 7% post-tax return was set by Spain in the Original Regime, without considering the benefit of any interest tax shield (regardless of whether any PV plants might actually benefit from an interest tax shield),70 which according to Claimants BDO admitted at the June Hearing.71 Claimants further contend that Spain could not predict what specific financing arrangements might be present at each of the many thousands of individual PV plants in Spain,72 also acknowledged by Respondent's expert at the hearing.73 By not taking account of the interest tax shield in this first step of the calculation, Claimants argue that Brattle's 19.6% effective tax rate does precisely that, and therefore reflects \"*real life*\".74\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 12, making reference to June Hearing, Tr.

Day 4, 167: 10 to 168: 7.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\n68.\n\nClaimants indicate that, in a second step, both Experts take account of the actual interest tax shield at each of Claimants' PV Plants in order to determine what taxes are actually paid at each facilities when computing the Revised Cash Flows in both the Actual and But-for scenarios, i.e., to reflect the level of tax shield \"*individually for each PV plant, as required, in order to determine the actual tax rate\" \u2013* as they recall the Tribunal directed in the Decision*.*75\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 15, quoting the Decision \u00b6 817.\n\n69.\n\nClaimants point to BDO's reliance on paragraphs 748 and 754 of the Decision to suggest that the Tribunal determined that the interest tax shield should be taken into account in the first step, by converting the Original Regime's single 7% post-tax return into multiple different pre-tax returns depending on the unique financing arrangements at each individual PV Plant, which Claimants contend \"*makes no logical sense*\" because *\"in 'real life', Spain did* *not* *offer multiple different reasonable rates of return to investors depending on their tax individual status*\".76 They further claim that BDO's position is inconsistent, insofar as \"*BDO accepts that any tax shield associated with* *external* *debt financing should* *not* *be included in the first step, but BDO nonetheless claims that any tax shield associated with* *internal* *debt (shareholder loans) should be included*\".77\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 17 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 18(emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n***b. The Actual Costs of the Claimants' PV Plants is the Correct Cost Base***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nClaimants indicate that Brattle and BDO disagree on the determination of the appropriate \"*Investment and Operating Costs*\" since the Tribunal instructed the Parties to \"*take into account* *the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants*\" in their damages calculations and have therefore adopted different investment and operating costs to calculate the Revised Cash Flows. To this end, Brattle performed alternative interpretations that the Tribunal may ultimately decide to adopt in its Award:78\n\n(a) *first*, consistent with its previous Reports, Brattle adopts a \"*Marginal Plant*\" option which calculates the Revised Cash Flows on two marginal plants79 representative of each type of PV plants owned by the Claimants: a \"*Single-axis Marginal Plant*\", and a \"*Double-axis Marginal Plant*\". According to Claimants, this interpretation would maintain a marginal system and at the same time take into account differences in PV technology;80\n\n(b) *second*, Brattle adopts an \"*Average Plant by Technology*\" option which calculates the Revised Cash Flows on the average hypothetical standard installation costs of single and double-axis plants;81\n\n(c) *third*, Brattle adopts an \"*Own IT-Code*\" option which calculates the Revised Cash Flows on the basis of the hypothetical standard installation costs assigned by Spain under the New Regime to each of the Claimants' PV Plants;82 and\n\n(d) *fourth*, Brattle adopts an \"*Actual Plant*\" option which calculates the Revised Cash Flows on the basis of the actual investment and operating costs of each of the Claimants' PV Plants.83\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\nFor each of the technologies, i.e., single-axis or double-axis, this is defined as \"*the most expensive single-axis/double axis PV standard installation on the system that Spain continues to deem efficient under the New Regulatory Regime*\" (Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 46).\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 46.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 47.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 48.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 49.\n\n71.\n\nClaimants point out that Brattle's view is that the \"*Actual Plant*\" option is that which is most in line with the wording of the Tribunal's instruction to take into account the \"*separate characteristics*\" of each of the Claimants' PV plants.84\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 23, making reference to the Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 50.\n\n72.\n\nClaimants add that \"*[f]ocusing on actual costs is the best way accurately to capture the harm suffered by the Claimants and make sure that they receive full compensation for their losses*\"85 and reference *NextEra v. Spain*, where the tribunal found that focusing on the standardised costs of cost-effective facilities \"*might be relevant for devising a regulatory regime based on a reasonable return*\", but not for the calculation of damages.86\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\n**CL-0182**, *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Principles of Quantum, 12 March 2019, \u00b6 654.\n\n73.\n\nFurther, Claimants criticise BDO's approach, explaining that Brattle argues that BDO adopts an inconsistent (and, therefore, invalid) approach which consists of \"'*mixing-and-matching': (a) the hypothetical standard investments costs retroactively assigned by Spain under the New Regime to each of the Claimants' PV Plants in their respective IT-Code;* *but* *adopting (b) the actual operating costs and production levels at each of the PV Plants*.\"87 This, they add, not only does not reflect the actual characteristics of the Claimants' PV Plants, but it leads BDO to underestimate Reasonable Return Damages.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 27, making reference to Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.\n\n74.\n\nClaimants add that BDO's position is contradictory. Even though BDO admits that it would be improper to focus exclusively on the performance of hypothetical standard installations in light of the Tribunal's findings, \"\u2026 *BDO nonetheless ignores the actual investment costs and claims they should be 'disregarded' in favour the hypothetical investment costs defined by Spain under the New Regime\"*.88 Further, Claimants challenge BDO's disregard for the actual investment costs also lacks any valid justification because it \"\u2026 *simply states,* *without any supporting evidence**, that the actual investment costs of the PV Plants are higher than they should have been due to alleged the presence of related-parties transactions during the construction period\",* adding that \"\u2026 *at no point did the Tribunal find BDO's claim of 'unjustified high investment cost' to be meritorious*\".89\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n***c. BDO's Improper Attempt to Re-Instate the Claw-Back***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nClaimants contend that Brattle assesses Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages through two separate exercises, such that the Claimants' PV plants both: (a) obtain a 7% post-tax return offered under the Original Regime;and (b) are not penalised by the retroactive features of the New Regime by assessing the amount of cash flows needed for the PV Plants to eliminate the retroactivity embedded in the formulas of the New Regime.90\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\n76.\n\nClaimants state their disagreement with BDO's calculation because they indicate that \u2013 instead of looking at the PV Plants' actual IRRs\u2013 BDO computes the PV Plants' IRR assuming that the retroactivity has been eliminated from the New Regime (which Claimants contend is \"*manifestly not the case*\"), and then considers that Reasonable Return Damages only exist if this second, artificial IRR, remains below its target rate return. Since BDO links the effective remuneration permitted to the plants after July 2013 based on the extent of cash flows received by the plants prior to July 2013, this effectively re-introduces retroactivity.91\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Experts' agreement about an \"*inherent claw-back in any Reasonable Return calculation*\" implies that the calculation sequence must be the other way around \u2013 first calculate Reasonable Return Damages (which will inherently include some claw-back) and then in a second step eliminate any remaining claw-back in the estimate of Retroactivity Damages.92\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 36.\n\n78.\n\nThus, Claimants assert that \"\u2026 *Brattle's Retroactivity Damages includes the Reasonable Return Damages, and eliminate* *only* *the remaining dependence of post-2013 remuneration on the actual cash flows earned by particular installations prior to July 2013 (i.e. the claw-back). Brattle's Retroactivity Damages are therefore reduced to the extent that a portion of the New Regulatory Regime's claw-back has already been captured in its Reasonable Return Damages*.\"93\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 37 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n**(2) Retroactivity Damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n79.\n\nClaimants contend that, \"\u2026 *to eliminate the full extent of retroactivity under the New Regime, both: (a) the arithmetical deduction of remuneration in excess of the newly defined 7.398% pre-tax return; and (b) the overestimation of capital recovery in the period before July 2013 (by assuming that capital is recovered based on a constant remuneration profile based on a 7.398% target pre-tax return), must be eliminated*\".94\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 53.\n\n80.\n\nClaimants assert that the New Regime considers the remuneration received by the Claimants' PV Plants before its entry into force (July 2013) to calculate their future remuneration, and that the Tribunal found this feature to be in breach of the ECT.95 By \"*taking into account*\" past revenues, Claimants contend that \"\u2026 *the New Regime overestimates the extent of capital recovery as of the entry into force of the New Regime. The New Regime 'takes into account' pre-2013 revenues to reduce the NAV in two different ways. Both need to be removed to eliminate the full extent of the claw-back as ordered by the Tribunal*\".96 It takes into account, Claimants add, pre-2013 revenues to reduce the NAV in two different ways: (i) looks at the historical income received in the past in excess of the newly calculated stream of constant annuities, deducting the difference from the NAV;97 and (ii) overestimates capital recovery in the period before its entry into force, thereby further reducing the value of the NAV by tampering with the level and profile of past remuneration and ignoring that under the Original Regime.98\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 696, 697, 698, 793(d), 820 and 822(4).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 48.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 96 (\"[b]*y deducting the historical excess, the June 2014 Ministerial Order reduced the July 2013 NAV*\").\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 50. Claimants state that under the Original Regime the FITs were set with by reference to a target return of 7% post-tax; and were updated annually according to inflation. Instead, the New Regime calculates the extent of capital recovery (the NAV) by reference to: (a) a different rate of return, a 7.398% pre-tax return; and (b) a new remuneration profile, the newly (and arbitrarily) calculated stream of constant annuities.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to Brattle, both elements contribute to overestimating the extent of capital recovery. In particular: (a) assuming an annuity based on a 7.398% pre-tax return instead of an annuity based on the 7% post-tax return targeted under the Original Regime leads to higher capital recovery in the pre-2013 period; and (b) by designing remuneration under the New Regime as a stream of constant annuities without any indexation, contrary to the Original Regime which were indexed according to inflation, Spain further overestimates the extent of capital recovery for the period before the entry into force of the New Regime.99\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 51.\n\n82.\n\nAs in the case of the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages, Claimants argue that, although both Experts agree that the first element of the claw-back needs to be removed, BDO disagrees with the elimination of the second element of the claw-back. Further, according to Claimants, even though BDO agrees that changes in the target return have an impact on the capital recovery in the period before July 2013, BDO supports that the claw-back should be included within the Reasonable Return Damages.100 In addition, Claimants assert that BDO considers that the tariff indexation artificially reduces the capital recovery in the period prior to 2013, resulting in a higher NAV, which is misleading, because the tariff indexation under the Original Regime was not artificial; it was real, as was its effect on capital recovery, adding that the same cannot be said of the New Regime's constant annuities, which never actually applied in the past, and which artificially overestimate the extent of capital recovery.101\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 52(a).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 52(b).\n\n**(3) Discount Rate and Regulatory Risk**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nClaimants assert that the \"*Experts agree that the incremental cash flows they calculated must be discounted to reflect present value*,\" but that \"[t]*hey disagree, however, on the applicable discount rate and, in particular, how to treat regulatory risk. In short, Brattle assumes a higher regulatory risk in the Actual scenario (i.e., after Spain violated the ECT) than in the But-for scenario, while BDO assumes the same regulatory risk exists in both scenarios*.\"102\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 54.\n\n84.\n\nAs explained in the Experts' Joint Memorandum,103 Brattle applies a 4.84% base-line weighted average of cost of capital (WACC) plus a separate adjustment to account for regulatory risk (which it terms as \"**Regulatory Risk Haircut**\"), following the assumptions in their First and Second Brattle Quantum Reports.104 The combined result was the equivalent of an overall 5.44% discount rate (after-tax) in the But-for scenario (i.e., where the Original Regime was maintained without significant change) and a 7.34% (after-tax) discount rate in the Actual scenario (i.e., under the New Regime).\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 136.\n\nBrattle First Quantum Report, Section V.D. \"Business Risks\", and Second Brattle Quantum Report, Section VII.A.\n\n85.\n\nClaimants contend that Brattle's position should be preferred, as a higher regulatory risk in the Actual scenario is supported by the evidence on the record, which confirms that Spain's implementation of the Disputed Measures significantly increased regulatory risk.105\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 55.\n\n**(4) Pre-Award Interest**\n--------------------------\n\n86.\n\nBrattle proposes a 10-year bond yield is a natural proxy for a \"*commercial rate established on a market basis*\", as Claimants contend is required by the ECT, and criticises BDO's suggested 8-year bond yield, which Claimants argue should be rejected because there is no justification for using the length of time between the Valuation Date and the date of the Final Award to determine the interest rate that should be used.106\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.\n\n**B. R****espondent****'****s** **P****osition**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent has requested the Tribunal to quantify damages in the Award in the amount of EUR 9.9 million,107 based on the Joint Expert Memorandum and the allegations contained in its Respondent's Quantum Submission, where Respondent elected to highlight and addressed 6 (six) issues in disagreement among the Experts: (1) proportionality; (2) effective tax rate; (3) investment costs; (4) retroactivity; (5) regulatory risk; and (6) prejudgment interest. Each is examined below.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 54.\n\n**(1) Proportionality**\n-----------------------\n\n88.\n\nRespondent recalls that the Tribunal concluded in the Decision that Spain had breached its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT, since the Disputed Measures were not proportionate insofar as they failed to maintain the reasonable rate of return ensured to Claimants under the primary legislation.108\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n89.\n\nTo address the economic impact of the lack of proportionality, BDO has calculated the actual IRR for each of the Claimants' PV Plants individually and has examined whether the Claimants' PV Plants needed or not a higher remuneration to achieve the 7% after tax target return indicated by the Tribunal in its Decision; they have considered the actual IRR of Claimants' PV Plants under the Disputed Measures and verified whether they achieve such threshold.109\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent points to the Tribunal's analysis in respect to proportionality in the Decision, where it established that \"[t]*o examine the question of proportionality it is necessary to assess the impact to individual plants, which is consistent with the approach taken by the regulator when designing the special regime under Law 54/1997*\u2026\",110 and argues that Brattle's approach ignores the actual individual Plant's return and focuses the exercise on \"*standard installations*\". Hence, it concludes that Brattle's approach does not address the issue of proportionality as directed by the Tribunal in its Decision.111\n\nDecision, \u00b6 735.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n**(2) Effective Tax Rate**\n--------------------------\n\n91.\n\nRespondent refers to the difference acknowledged by the Tribunal of the \"*effective tax rate*\" identified by each of the Parties,112 and recalls that two inputs were in disagreement: (a) depreciation period, and (b) tax deductibility of the shareholder loans.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 13, with reference to the Decision, \u00b6 742.\n\n92.\n\nIn connection with the first, Respondent recalls that the Tribunal decided to maintain the 25-year period as proposed by Brattle.\n\n93.\n\nOn the second, Respondent further recalls that the Tribunal acknowledged that it had no information of the existence of shareholder loans in respect to the PV Plants but cautioned that if shareholder loans existed where the relevant companies benefitted from the so-called tax shield, this factor would need to be taken into account, individually for each PV Plant.113 On this point, Respondent contends that there is evidence in the record that confirms that there are various shareholder loans that were granted to the Claimants' PV Plants, and hence that they benefited from the deductibility of the interest paid for said loans and attracted the corresponding tax shield, and points to the Experts' Joint Memorandum where BDO has included the necessary information to that effect.114 Therefore, BDO included such tax shield benefit to determine the effective tax rate.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 19, referencing the Joint Expert Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31 and Exhibit BQR-06.\n\n94.\n\nIn response to the argument by Claimants that Spain did not consider any tax shield when designing the support scheme to derive the returns under the Original Regime, Respondent contends that this becomes irrelevant because the Tribunal has indicated in its Decision that the effective tax rate should include the shareholder loans tax benefits, if any. Further, Respondent contends that \"\u2026 *if the tax shield is not applied when converting the 7% post tax to an equivalent pre tax rate of return, the result is a higher remuneration to the Claimants on the basis that they will have to pay taxes that will not actually be paid in the real world*\".115\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\n**(3) Investment Costs**\n------------------------\n\n95.\n\nRespondent also recalls that the Decision provides that investment costs of the PV Plants should be taken into account to calculate the IRR and thus the damages in this case, and to this end, \"\u2026 *the exercise should take into account the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants\"*.116\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 28, with reference to the Decision, \u00b6 815.\n\n96.\n\nTo address this element, BDO uses the actual production and operating costs of each of the Claimants' PV Plants and what it terms as revised actual investment cost for each of the Claimants' PV Plants, thereby combining actual performance with actual investment cost. Respondent denies the indication of Claimants that BDO adopted \"*an inconsistent hybrid approach because it combines investment costs of standard installations with operating costs and production levels of the actual individual Plants*\".117 It refers to BDO's Second Expert Report which contains a detailed analysis of the need to compute a revised actual investment cost of Claimants' Plants.118\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.\n\nBDO Second Report, dated 13 February 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 141, 143, 147 and 148-153.\n\n97.\n\nAccording to Respondent, BDO proved that the investment costs of Claimants' PV Plants \"\u2026 *were excessive compared to other similar facilities and explained these exceptionally high costs by the fact that the PV Plants in this case were not constructed by third parties at arms' length prices but rather by group companies of the owners of the Plants at that time, who afterwards sold them to Claimants*\".119\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\n**(4) Retroactivity**\n---------------------\n\n98.\n\nRespondent acknowledges the disagreement of the Parties' Experts on the manner to compute in the damages calculations the Tribunal's decision on the claw-back effect, and claims a \"*conceptual consideration needs to be made*\", since \"\u2026 *in reality, renewable investors in Spain have not suffered any damages due to the claw-back effect of the Disputed Measures adopted by the Kingdom of Spain*\", because what the claw-back effect \"\u2026 *really means is that the amounts received by the renewable plants in order to achieve a reasonable return through their useful life are received sooner rather than later during their useful life*,\"120 adding that renewable plants in Spain have not had to pay back under the Disputed Measures any of the subsidies already received from Spain. What has only occurred is that higher subsidies have been paid sooner in order to ensure a reasonable rate of return to renewable plants during their useful life, arguing that receiving subsidies sooner rather than later in time can in no way be considered detrimental to investors from a financial standpoint.121\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\n**(5) Regulatory Risk**\n-----------------------\n\n99.\n\nOn this point, Respondent states that BDO deems that the regulatory risk should be the same in both \"But-for\" and \"Actual\" scenarios, contrary to Brattle, who considers that risk in the But-for scenario should be lower than in the Actual scenario.122\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 44.\n\n100.\n\nRespondent contends that, during the arbitration, BDO and Brattle made their risk assessment of the But-for scenario assuming that none of the Disputed Measures would have been implemented in such scenario, but that, after the Tribunal's Decision was rendered, this context has completely changed as there is a \"new\" But-for scenario,123 \"\u2026 *where most of the New Regulatory Regime adopted by Spain is deemed legal and hence introduced in the Tribunal's But-for scenario*\". This means, Respondent adds, that the Actual scenario and the Tribunal's But-for scenario represent very similar worlds with very similar risks.124\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 46.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n101.\n\nRespondent criticises Brattle and contends that Brattle ignores this fact and continues to apply a lower risk in the But-for scenario that would correspond to a \"But-for scenario with no Disputed Measures\", which no longer applies.125\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 49.\n\n**(6) Prejudgment Interest**\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent acknowledges that both Experts agree that the Tribunal should compute said prejudgment interest based on Spanish sovereign bond yields, although they disagree on the term of the bond. While Brattle proposes the use of 10-year Spanish sovereign bond yields, BDO proposes applying yields for an 8-year Spanish sovereign bond, considering that less than 8 years have passed since the 2014 valuation date.126\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53, Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 144-146.\n\n**V. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal would like to note that the determination of damages has proven to be a very complex and difficult task. The Tribunal acknowledges that the Parties and their experts have attempted to untangle the complex issues and assist the Tribunal in the determination of damages due to Claimants, but the analysis and elements contained in the Experts' Joint Report and the Parties' submissions \u2013rather than facilitating the Tribunal's work, have made the exercise more arduous because of the substantial disagreements contained therein. It is not that the Parties or their respective Experts have failed to provide elements for the determination of damages; they have. The issue for the Tribunal has been to identify an appropriate methodology that facilitates the determination of the amount.\n\n104.\n\nThe disagreements between the two sides are significant and the variables contained in the Expert's Joint Report are practically infinite. Any change, however minor, triggers different results. Brattle (Claimants' Expert) accepts the difficulty when it shows the various scenarios that arise simply when individual PV Plants take into account different financing terms, such as the amount of financing, ratio of debt/equity, interest rate, loan tenure, etc. \u2013even considering an \"all equity\" after-tax return of 7% that has been accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n105.\n\nEach arbitral tribunal is faced with a task that likely has obstacles before it when seeking to reach an accurate determination of damages. In this case, however, one of the major obstacles faced is the lack of reliable information on the investment costs of the PV Plants.\n\n106.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Experts, the investment costs are estimated based on different assumptions: whether this may be a \"marginal plant\", \"average plant by technology\", \"Own IT-Code\" or \"Actual plant\" as Brattle has identified. Each option has internal elements that are not objective. In the case of a \"marginal plant\", for example, this relates to \"*the most expensive\u2026standard installation on the system that Spain continues to deem efficient*\";127 in the case of the \"*average plant by technology*\", then it is \"*average hypothetical standard installation costs*\"128; the \"*Own IT-Code*\" is the \"*hypothetical standard installation costs assigned by Spain under the New Regime to each of the Claimants' PV Plants\"*;129 and the \"*Actual plant*\" \u2013despite its name, and the fact that it allegedly utilizes \"*the actual investment and operating costs of each of the Claimants' PV Plants*\", as defined by Brattle.130\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 46.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 22(b).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 22(c).\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 46-49; Claimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 22(d).\n\n107.\n\nUltimately, however, the Tribunal must decide the compensation due to the Claimants based on the parameters set out in its Decision,131 albeit with some degree of discretion. Such discretion should be exercised in a reasonable manner guided by the agreements among the Experts and using the information made available by the Parties and their respective Experts who, despite their disagreements on the methodology, do agree on damages calculations based on each other's assumptions,132 and have even incorporated sensitivities to the damages calculation of the other.133\n\nSee \u00b6 27 above (parameters of period of depreciation, target rate of return, investment and operating costs, effective tax rate and date of valuation of damages).\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 147.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 148-149.\n\n108.\n\nIn assessing damages, the Tribunal begins by recalling the determinations on damages made in its Decision. Paragraph 822 of the Decision noted that Spain, \"*breached Article 10(1) to the extent that the remuneration of each of the plants failed to ensure payment to Claimants of a reasonable rate of return on their investment during the lifetime of Claimants' PV Plants*\" (\"***Reasonable Return Damages****\"*), and \"*by clawing back past remuneration*\" (\"***Retroactivity Damages****\"*).134 However, it was unable to quantify the rate of return of Claimants' Plants or the amount of the retroactive reduction on the basis of the quantum reports.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822.\n\n109.\n\nSuch parameters were supposed to aid the Parties in calculating a rate of return that better reflected the *economic reality* (or actual impact) of the New Regime on the Plants. Although the Parties reached an agreement in certain elements necessary to implement such parameters, the areas of disagreement are substantial on both: the assumptions and methodologies. The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to begin the analysis of damages by identifying the areas of agreement and disagreement between the Parties.\n\n\u2022 **Reasonable Return Damages**: The Parties agreed that the relevant analysis should reflect the \"*stand-alone impact in case the Disputed Measures failed to ensure a reasonable return to Claimants*\".135 This means that if any of Claimants' Plants failed to obtain under the New Regime the target of 7% post-tax return then they are entitled to reasonable rate of return damages. The Parties disagreed on how to implement it. In essence they disagree on two essential parameters necessary to estimate the revised cash flows related to Reasonable Return: (i) the effective tax rates that it should be used to convert the post-tax rate of 7% into a pre-tax and (ii) the methodology to consider the investment and operating costs when estimating the revised incremental revenues.\n\n\u2022 **Retroactivity Damages**: The Parties agreed that the claw-back provision of the New Regime should be eliminated only with respect to the profits earned in the period prior to July 2013. The Parties disagree on how to eliminate it.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 3.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses each of the above items in the sections that follow.\n\n**(1) Reasonable Return Damages**\n---------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nThe point of reference in the analysis is a target return of 7% post-tax as targeted under the Original Regime. If Claimants' PV Plants fail to obtain such target under the New Regime, then Claimants would be entitled to Reasonable Return Damages. As the Experts' Joint Report explains, this implies the need to estimate the amount of cash flows required for each plant to obtain the 7% post-tax return.\n\n112.\n\nThe Experts agree that in order to calculate the reasonable return it is necessary to convert the 7% post-tax rate of return under the Original Regime into a pre-tax rate of return.136 To do so, the Experts also agree that it is necessary to estimate an effective tax rate to use in the conversion. The Experts profoundly disagree on the relevance of the tax shield benefits of the shareholder loans to assess the effective tax rate.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 9.\n\n***a. The Effective Tax Rate***\n-------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nIn its Decision, the Tribunal set out a *post*-tax target rate of return of 7% and an average tax rate across all Claimants' PV plants of 19.6 % on the *assumption* that the Claimants' PV Plants had no debt financing that translates into a tax shield benefit that lowers this rate. In the event that any of the PV Plants benefitted from a tax shield arising from debt financing, then the tax rate should be adjusted accordingly. The Tribunal did not, however, state 'how' and 'when' this element is to be factored in. This is where the first divergence of approach emerges in the Experts' Joint Memorandum and the Parties' submissions.\n\n114.\n\nFor Claimants, a 19.6 % average effective tax rate applies based on the assumption that the Spanish regulator did not take into account the interest tax shield when deriving the FITs for RD 1578/2008. According to Brattle, this results in a pre-tax rate of return of 8.7% under a 19.6 % effective tax rate.137 In their view, that reflects 'real life' at the time (i.e., 2008). Claimants add that Spain could not have predicted \"*what specific financing arrangement might be present at each of the many thousands of individual PV plants in Spain*\".138\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 13.\n\n115.\n\nClaimants do not say, however, that the tax shield should not be taken into account. They contend that it should, but only in the second step \u2013 that is, when computing the Revised Cash Flows in both the 'Actual' and 'But-for' scenarios. Claimants argue that it is in this second step that they \"*fully*\" take the interest tax shield into account at each PV Plant.139\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n116.\n\nRespondent claims, on the other hand, that Brattle fails to consider the tax benefit of interest in the 19.6 % effective tax shield.140 It argues that the impact of the tax shield should be applied in a first step while converting the 7% *post*-tax into a *pre*-tax rate, because failure to do so means that Claimants will receive higher compensation based on the tax rate that would not be paid in the 'real world'.141 BDO (Respondent's Expert) finds that 12.8% is the average effective tax rate across the plants, which translates to an average pre-tax return of 8%.142\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 23.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 33, BDO Table 2.\n\n117.\n\nClaimants point to BDO's reliance on paragraphs 748 and 754 of the Decision to suggest that the Tribunal determined that the interest tax shield should be taken into account in the first step, by converting the Original Regime's single 7% *post*-tax return into multiple different pre-tax returns depending on the unique financing arrangements at each individual PV Plant, which Claimants contend \"*makes no logical sense*\" because \"*in 'real life', Spain did* *not* *offer multiple different reasonable rates of return to investors depending on their tax individual status*\".143 They further claim that BDO's position is inconsistent, insofar as \"*BDO accepts that any tax shield associated with* *external* *debt financing should* *not* *be included in the first step, but BDO nonetheless claims that any tax shield associated with* *internal* *debt (shareholder loans) should be included*\".144\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 17 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 18 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n118.\n\nRespondent claims that Brattle's approach is irrelevant in this respect because, even if the Spanish regulator did not calculate the return rate taking the interest tax shield into account at the outset, the Tribunal's instruction to the Parties in the Decision is clear enough: the Parties should factor the interest tax shield into its calculations in its assessment of damages.145\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n119.\n\nAs identified in the Decision, the Tribunal has noted that the Spanish regulator set the remuneration on an \"*all equity basis*\". There is debate among the Parties as to what this concept entails, and whether the Spanish regulator determined the 7% *post-*tax rate of return on the assumption that there would be no financing. The Tribunal believes that when the regulator established the projects to be \"*financed 100% with own resources (all-equity basis)\"*146 the reference to *all equity* meant precisely that: no third-party financing. If any financing was to be secured by the relevant entity, this would fall outside the established premise for the determination of the return.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 16, making reference to **R-0030**, Economic Memorandum of RD 436/2004.\n\n120.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal believes that at the time the Spanish regulator established the premise, the objective was for the relevant entity to have no third-party financing obligations. It meant that the FITs would be based on the investment made, and not on the basis of financing.\n\n121.\n\nThere is discussion among the Experts as to whether or not shareholder loans are to be considered as \"equity\". Categorizing shareholder loans as equity may be an accounting issue but not one which should be treated lightly. The Tribunal is aware that shareholder loans may, under certain circumstances, be treated as equity because the obligation may be subordinated to other obligations, or because the shareholder may covenant not call on the principal while the project requires the funds, or for other reasons. However, had the Spanish regulator intended to allow such financing, it could have established an exception, or identified shareholder loans for the \"all equity\" premise. But it did not. It established the premise of \"all equity\".\n\n122.\n\nAlthough Brattle states that there may be benefits in a tax shield \u2013and therefore higher returns\u2013 made possible by the use of debt financing, because from an economic standpoint this \"\u2026 *provides correct incentives to investors to make 'wise' and efficient financing decisions*\u2026\",147 the Tribunal believes that, even though it might be accurate, such argument misses the point because the issue at this stage deals with whether or not the rate afforded under the New Regime reflected a \"reasonable rate of return\".\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 15.\n\n123.\n\nWhen Brattle queries whether the Spanish regulator took into account the interest tax shield and concludes that it did not because it \"*could not foresee the innumerable choices available to individual plants*\",148 this should not be treated as permissible. It should be the inverse. Failure to contemplate that means that \"equity\" must be understood to exclude financing, whether external or shareholder.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 26.\n\n124.\n\nIt is possible, as Claimants allege, that the Spanish regulator could not *at that time* have proposed different calculations and different rates of return for each PV Plant. There was likely a myriad of financing options open to investors and it would have been impossible for the Spanish regulator to design a regime that took them all into account. Claimants further argue that the Spanish Regulator understood that each investor had access to financing options and that such financing could generate the corresponding tax shield through the deductibility of interest paid; it was clear that the 7% post-tax target return would address all of the PV Plants, irrespective of the financing choice made by individual investors.\n\n125.\n\nBrattle contends that this is supported by the economic memorandum of RD 436/2004 prepared by the Spanish Ministry which in relevant portion on this point states: *\"Project financing:* '[\u2026] *we are assuming that projects are financed 100% with own resources (all-equity basis). Leveraging and the percentage between equity capital and external debt are specific decisions for each project and investor. If made wisely, they should provide better returns than those estimated here*.'\"149\n\nQuote from Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 16, which translates from the Spanish language original: \"[\u2026]*se ha supuesto, en todos los casos, que se realiza 100 por ciento con fondos propios. El apalancamiento y el porcentaje entre fondos propios y ajenos, son decisiones propias de cada proyecto y de cada promotor que, caso de estar bien tomadas, deben proporcionar mejores ratios que los aqu\u00ed estimados*\"; see Memoria Econ\u00f3mica RD 436/2004, p.5. The English version of this document corresponds to **R-0030EN**. Spain recognizes this at its Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 950.\n\n126.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal finds that the Spanish regulator was aware that there would be an interest rate shield benefit if investors had obtained debt financing. While Spain was determining the 7% *post*-tax return, investors were likewise aware that there were financing options available that would lead to interest tax shield benefits or elements in financing that might yield higher returns.\n\n127.\n\nHowever, even assuming that the Spanish Regulator was aware that investors had access to debt financing and so could even improve their returns \"if made wisely\", the Tribunal finds that the returns that were targeted under the Original Regime were 7% *post*-tax. The failure to maintain such reasonable rate of return is precisely what the Tribunal found to be in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT. And it is the difference in reaching this percentage which should be compensated as damages.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal has accepted, on the other hand, the 19.6% average tax rate with the caveat that it is only valid if there is \"*no debt financing that translates into a tax shield benefit that lower this rate*\"150. The evidence suggests, and Brattle does not seem to dispute it, that Claimants' PV Plants benefited from shareholder financing. This results in a tax shield benefit.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 816.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax return.\n\n***b. The Actual Costs of the Claimants' PV Plants.***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe second area of disagreement relates to the actual costs of the PV Plants, given the fact that the Tribunal instructed the Parties to \"*take into account* *the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants\"* in their damages calculations.151\n\nDecision, \u00b6 815 (emphasis added).\n\n131.\n\nThe relevance of this is simple. Since the IRR is calculated based on these costs, differences also lead to divergences in the quantum calculation. Put simply, the higher the costs, the lower the IRR.\n\n132.\n\nAs has been identified above, each of the Experts utilizes different approaches to calculate the costs incurred by the Claimants, taking into account their separate characteristics.152 Brattle has presented four interpretations: \"Revised Marginal Plant\", the \"Average Plant by Technology\"; the \"Own IT-Code\"; and the \"Actual Plant\". BDO criticises the Brattle approach by arguing that the costs are excessive. BDO instead uses what it deems are the actual production and operating costs of each of the Claimants' PV Plants and a revised actual investment cost for each of the Claimants' PV Plants, thereby combining, according to BDO, actual performance with actual investment cost.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 44-61.\n\n133.\n\nWhile Respondent and its Expert, BDO, criticize Brattle's approach by arguing that it ignores the actual costs of each individual PV Plant and instead focusses the exercise on \"standard installations\", a similar criticism is made by Claimants and Brattle of BDO's exercise. According to Claimants, BDO's approach is one of \"*mixing-and-matching*\": (a) the hypothetical *standard* investments costs are retroactively assigned by Spain under the New Regime to each of the Claimants' PV plants in their respective IT-Code; but (b) the *actual* operating costs and production levels are set at each of the PV Plants.\n\n134.\n\nIndeed, the reason BDO fails to give regard to the actual investment costs of the PV Plants is due to the fact that BDO deems that the incurred investment cost of the Claimants PV Plants has \"*unjustified high investment cost declared by the Claimants*\", adding that in its First Report BDO explained that the real investment cost of the Claimants' PV Plants was \"*unjustified higher than the investment cost set by Spain to determine the incentive remuneration of the PV plants*\".153 This is due to the various related party transactions which BDO alleges occurred at the time of constructing the Claimants' PV Plants. BDO identified these in its Second Report, and concluded that the excess of investment cost was due to some unjustified and exceptionally high costs attributed to the Claimants' PV Plants.154\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 57, making reference to BDO's First Report, \u00b6 96.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 58, making reference to BDO's Second Report, \u00b6 153.\n\n135.\n\nRespondent submitted a table prepared by BDO that compared a \"*standard cost of investment according to Order IET/1045/2014 and the costs reflected in the EPC Contracts of Claimants*\".155 However, this table shows that not all of Claimants' PV Plants show the claimed \"excess costs\": indeed, only two (Valtierra III and Tordesillas) are shown by BDO to have a difference of approximately 17% with the \"*standard cost of investment*\". Fontellas is lower, and for another two there is no information (Valtierra I and Valtierra II). Further, there is no information regarding special circumstances surrounding the construction of the two plants that may have (or not) justified such alleged excess.156\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 32, and Table 7 of the BDO Second Report.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the claimed transfer pricing among group companies was not among Claimants' affiliates, but rather among the previous owners from which Claimants purchased the PV Plants in 2010 and 2011.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the allegations of Respondent in connection with the costs of the Claimants PV Plants, which it rejects since the analysis is based on a comparison with similar but different installations.157 However, it does not need to rule or draw inferences from a reading of the EPC Contracts to conclude that certain transfer pricing transactions may have occurred as the plants were constructed by companies in the same group and cannot be deemed to be arm's length transactions. The question is whether the costs were unreasonably excessive at any of the Claimants' Plants, as BDO claims.\n\nBDO Second Report, \u00b6\u00b6 143-153.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it difficult to accept a definition of costs on the basis of \"*Marginal Plants*\" as this would tend to reflect the most expensive type of efficient plant in the system,158 and, in taking such a view, the Tribunal would therefore fail to take into account \"*the separate characteristics of each of the plants*\".\n\nBrattle's Second Quantum Report, \u00b6 206.\n\n138.\n\nEqually, the Tribunal cannot accept the \"*Average Plant by Technology*\" option which calculates the Revised Cash Flows on the average hypothetical standard installation costs of single and double-axis plants, since these do not take into consideration the separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants.\n\n139.\n\nThe fourth interpretation submitted by Brattle, based on the notion of the \"*Actual Plant*\", which purportedly calculates the Revised Cash Flows on the basis of the actual investment and operating costs of each of the Claimants' PV Plants, is equally dismissed for this exercise because of the uncertainty it entails in the reasonableness of the investment costs.\n\n140.\n\nUltimately, the Tribunal is faced with *estimates* in all of the arguments that have been presented to it, whether in the four options offered in the scheme of Brattle, or in the proposal of BDO that combines for each of the Claimants' PV Plants the actual production and operating costs with a \"*revised actual investment cost*\" for each of the Claimants' PV Plants. Such revised actual investment cost is the investment cost of a typical installation, which is reasonably reflected by the own IT-code, as explained by BDO.159 It is not the actual investment of Claimants in the PV Plants.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 55.\n\n141.\n\nWhen the Tribunal seeks to have the investment and operating costs to determine the compensation due to Claimants for the damages caused, its objective is to eliminate the deduction of remuneration in excess of the 7.39% *pre*-tax return.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the appropriate methodology to consider the \"*separate characteristics of each of Claimants' PV Plants*\" with respect to their investment and operating costs is to focus, not on the marginal or average standard installations for a given technology, but on the individual standard installations now assigned by Spain to the Claimants' PV plants under the New Regime, which permit Spain *\"to introduce multiple prices for groups of PV plants, and in so doing permit Spain to provide less remuneration to more efficient plants.*\" It identifies this approach as \"Own IT Code\".160\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 48.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Brattle presents a table in the Experts Joint Memorandum,161 summarizing the four possible interpretations following what it believes are the Tribunal's instructions. Such table compares each of the options presented by Claimants and aligns \"*Own IT-Code*\" with the \"*Actual Plant*\" presented by BDO.\n\n**Brattle Table 2: Efficiency Actual Costs Alternatives**\n\n**Notes and sources:**\n\n**Option Marginal Plant by Technology and Option Average plant by Technology takes into account each of the Claimants's plants technology single axis, or double axis].**\n\nBrattle Table 2: Efficiency Actual Costs Alternatives, Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 50.\n\n144.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal accepts the own \"*IT-Code*\" option for each PV Plant because it considers it to be the most representative of the real investment costs of a typical installation in the market which, as described by Claimants, was applied by Spain under the New Regime to each of the Claimants' PV plants.162\n\nClaimants' Submission on Quantum, \u00b6 22(c).\n\n***c. The Aleged Attempt by BDO to Re-Instate Remuneration of Past Profits***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Experts agree that any Reasonable Return calculation continues to include a claw-back of profits earned prior to July 2013.163 They also agree that in order to eliminate the Claw- Back Feature of the Disputed Measures, a portion of the past profits that Spain used to calculate the July 2013 NAV must be removed from the revised calculation.164\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 105.\n\n146.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties and their Experts lies in the exact portion of the past profits to be removed. Claimants argue that BDO's approach of calculating Reasonable Return Damages is an attempt to \"*implicitly including a form of retroactivity*\" and Claimants deem this not to be \"*appropriate in circumstances where the Tribunal expressly determined that Spain's claw-back of past revenues was a breach of the ECT*\".165\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that BDO's approach is to first compute the actual IRRs for each of the Claimants' PV Plants, which show that all of them (save for one) fall below the pre-tax target rate of return, thus implying they all suffer damages.166 However, in a second step BDO then computes another lifetime IRR but, instead of looking at the PV Plants' actual IRRs, BDO computes the PV Plants' IRR assuming that the retroactivity has been eliminated from the New Regime (which, as Claimants assert, is manifestly not the case167), and then considers that Reasonable Return Damages only exist if this second IRR remains below its target rate return.168\n\nBDO Table 4: Actual IRR for each individual Plant and target return, Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 78.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 35(a).\n\nBDO Table 5: IRR for each individual Plant after removing the claw-back and target return, Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 79.\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that BDO effectively re-introduces retroactivity by linking the effective remuneration permitted to the plants after July 2013 based on the extent of cash flows received by the plants prior to July 2013. The effect is to once again claw-back past earnings, because determining post-July 2013 remuneration based on pre-July 2013 cash flows is precisely the problematic retroactivity identified by the Tribunal. Brattle confirms BDO's calculation that \"*the pre-July 2013 cash flows continue to impact the remuneration\"* for the post-July 2013 period.169\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 67.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Experts about an inherent claw-back in any Reasonable Return calculation which implies that the calculation sequence must be the other way around \u2013 first, to calculate Reasonable Return Damages (which will inherently include some claw-back) and then, in a second step, to eliminate, as Claimants contend,170 any remaining claw-back in the estimate of Retroactivity Damages, thereby eliminating only the remaining dependence of post-2013 remuneration. This eliminates any double counting. Retroactivity Damages are reduced to the extent that a portion of the New Regime's claw-back has already been captured in the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\n**(2) Retroactivity Damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIn the Decision, the Tribunal determined that the Retroactivity Damages were caused because the New Regime considers the remuneration received by the Claimants' PV Plants before its entry into force (July 2013) to calculate their future remuneration.171 It applied to plants that were in operation when the New Regime entered into force, applying the new remuneration scheme as if it had been in place from the outset of their operating life.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 696.\n\n151.\n\nAs described in the Decision,172 the \"\u2026 *retroactive application of the Disputed Measures should not have an adverse effect on future remuneration of Claimants' PV plants, i.e., they cannot claw-back remuneration that was legitimately obtained under the previous regime and, as such, (the claw-back provision) is inconsistent with the principle of requirement of fairness in Article 10(1) of the ECT*\". The New Regime implemented a reduction in revenues for Claimants' PV Plants, lowering their target returns retrospectively by clawing back revenues previously received. The New Regime provides a return of 7.398% pre-tax over standard investment costs, which requires the projection of revenues over the entirety of an installation lifetime, including the period before the New Regime came into effect.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 793(d).\n\n152.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal determined that Claimants should be compensated for the harm suffered by the Claw-Back Feature under the New Regime.\n\n153.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal had not been presented with the requisite information or methodology that would allow it to calculate the *quantum* of compensation for the effect of the unlawful retroactive application of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants' investments. Its analysis of the Claw-Back Feature and its conclusion that a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT occurred are set out in paragraphs 691 to 698 of the Decision. In section VII on Damages, it therefore directed the Parties to try to agree on the amount of compensation due from the retroactive element of the New Regime, without offering any specific guidance on the factors to be taken into account in the calculation of *quantum*. In paragraph 822(7), it simply directed the Parties to try to reach agreement \"*in respect of its obligations on post-tax rate of return in accordance with the Tribunal's findings*\".\n\n154.\n\nIn their response to this direction, the Parties' Experts submitted a Joint Report, in which they established the principles for such calculations and offered the Tribunal proposals for their application. In some instances, they agreed, while in others they failed to do so. The Tribunal notes that they agree that any Reasonable Return calculation continues to include a claw-back of profits earned prior to July 2013, and also agree that the Retroactivity Damages calculation should therefore involve the elimination of the remaining Claw-Back Feature not already accounted for in the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages.173\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\n155.\n\nAlthough the Experts agree that Retroactivity Damages should \"*only attempt to eliminate from the New Regulatory Regime the claw-back of profits earned in the period prior to July 2013 under the Original Regulatory Regime*\",174 they disagree on how to eliminate it. However, they agree that the first step in the calculation of Retroactivity Damages due to the Claw-Back Feature is to estimate a Net Asset Value (or NAV)175 for each of the Claimants' PV Plants as of July 2013, because \"*Retroactivity Damages stem from the New Regulatory Regime's underestimate of the remaining July 2013 NAV*\".176\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 5.\n\nThe NAV represents investment value that has not yet been recovered by the investor, i.e., investment pending to be amortized.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 83.\n\n156.\n\nClaimants assert that, in doing so, Respondent first projected the income that the installation would need to receive from the outset of its lifetime to obtain a 7.398% pre-tax return (30 years in the case of Claimants' PV Plants). The yearly income was calculated as a constant stream of remuneration, on an annual basis over the entire lifetime, as opposed to the remuneration under RD 1578/2008 which was indexed to inflation. Spain then compared this stream of constant annuities with the remuneration *actually* received by each plant *before* the entry into force of the New Regime to estimate the proportion of the investment costs that was still unrecovered as of 1 January 2014, considering a 7.398% pre-tax return as a target for investment recovery. To do so, Spain calculated a Net Asset Value for each standard installation as of the same date. Finally, the New Regime then uses that NAV to calculate the remuneration going forward, based on a return of 7.398% pre-tax. In short, it calculates the remuneration required on a yearly basis, in constant annuities, to provide a 7.398% pre-tax return on the NAV.177\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.\n\n157.\n\nSince the New Regime \"*takes into account*\" pre-2013 revenues to reduce the NAV in two different ways, Claimants contend that both need to be removed to eliminate the full extent of the claw-back, since both elements contribute to overestimating the extent of capital recovery.178\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 48.\n\n158.\n\nBoth Experts agree that a *first* deduction to the NAV should be removed,179 i.e., that occurring where Spain lowers the installations' future remuneration to compensate the higher remuneration received before the New Regime by deducting from the NAV income received in the past in excess of the newly calculated stream of constant annuities. There is an arithmetical deduction of remuneration over the newly defined 7.398% target *pre-tax* return.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 101.\n\n159.\n\nIt is about the *second* deduction that the Experts disagree. Whereas Brattle contends that under the Original Regime: (i) the FITs were set by reference to a target return of 7% *post-tax*; and (ii) FITs were updated annually according to inflation, the New Regime calculates the extent of capital recovery (the NAV) by reference to: (a) a different rate of return, a 7.398% *pre-tax return*; and (b) a new remuneration profile, the newly calculated stream of constant annuities.180 Brattle contends that this second feature should be eliminated, while BDO believes this deduction should be included within the Reasonable Return Damages.181\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, making reference to the Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 110 and 112.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission. \u00b652(a).\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal considers reasonable the approach by Claimants and agrees that both deductions must be eliminated from the Retroactivity Damages to avoid the claw-back. In the case of the first deduction, there is agreement among the Experts about its inclusion. As to the second, it needs to be included since this deduction ignores the actual profile of remuneration \u2013the so-called stream of constant annuities\u2013 and overestimates the capital recovery in the period before July 2013 by assuming that capital is recovered based on a constant remuneration profile under a 7.398% target *pre*-tax return. The Tribunal agrees with Brattle that the New Regime's approach is analogous to removing inflation indexation from a debt, but then going back in time and computing the capital repayments as if the bond was never inflation indexed in the first place.182 This results in an excessive reduction of the NAV that needs to be eliminated to avoid the \"full extent\" of the claw-back.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 51.\n\n161.\n\nThe *second* deduction is an effect of the use by Spain of the NAV calculation considering the 30-year period regulatory period and the target return of 7.398% pre-tax return provided in the New Regime. It deems that subsidies paid prior to the entry into force of the New Regime which exceed the reasonable rate of return can be eliminated. The Tribunal has concluded that it cannot.\n\n162.\n\nAs expressed by Brattle, the *first* deduction concerns one element of the past profitability: the cash flow generation of different plants and vintages of plant under the Original Regime, while the *second* deduction concerns another aspect: the assumed extent of capital recovery and investment return provided for under the Original Regime prior to July 2013.183\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 102.\n\n163.\n\nThe process of eliminating the claw-back requires addressing the impact of the New Regime's assumptions in respect to both elements, by eliminating the first deduction \u2013 with which BDO agrees \u2013 and recalculating the second deduction to eliminate its enlargement of the Claw-Back Feature's negative effect.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that BDO contends that, even though the Tribunal concluded that the New Regime should not have used past profits to calculate the future remuneration of the Plants, \"*it did not find that the mechanism to calculate the NAV breached the ECT, and the mechanism calculates the remuneration with constant annuities that are recalculated on the pre-established regulatory periods*\".184 This is not accurate. The Tribunal did not rule on the legitimacy of the mechanism to calculate the NAV. Rather the Tribunal determined that past profits should not be used to calculate future remuneration of the PV Plants, and this principle applies whether this a direct or indirect process.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 106 (emphasis omitted).\n\n165.\n\nFurther, BDO notes the wording in the Decision that *\"[t]he Tribunal agrees with the Eurus tribunal*\"185 and refers to that tribunal's conclusion that \"*the retro-active claw back by Spain, in and after 2013, of subsidies earlier paid at levels in excess of the amounts that would have been payable under the Disputed Measures, had they been in force in previous years*\". However, BDO omitted quoting in full the text of the conclusion in the *Eurus v. Spain* Decision, which should be complemented with \"\u2026 *in previous years,* *did breach the obligation of stability under Article 10(1), first and second sentences of the ECT*\".186 The assumption is that to eliminate the Claw-Back Feature of the Disputed Measures the only portion of past profits that must be removed is the excess of what an installation would have received under the New Regime in previous years. The Tribunal does not accept this view and notes that in its earlier Decision, and indeed the submissions of the Parties and their Experts during the previous stage of these proceedings, the focus resided on the Disputed Measures *as a whole*, and not on specific elements such as the Claw-Back Feature. It is therefore quite wrong to infer from the absence of a discussion of such elements that the Tribunal had examined and rejected the position that Claimants have argued with respect to the second deduction. At that time there was no need to address such issues, and they were therefore not considered.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 107 (emphasis omitted).\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 107, where BDO cites to **RL-0153**, *Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/4, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2021 (\"***Eurus v. Spain, Decision***\"), \u00b6 467(c).\n\n166.\n\nHaving considered carefully the views of both Parties, the Tribunal is persuaded that it is necessary to remove both elements of the claw-back calculation because the second deduction also contributes to overestimating capital recovery pre-July 2013 (by assuming a constant annual remuneration in the past). It is, therefore, only through the removal of both elements that the full effect of retroactivity that overestimates capital recovery can be eliminated.\n\n167.\n\nIndeed, the Parties' Experts acknowledged that there is a close relationship between the calculation of Retroactivity Damages and a separate calculation of Reasonable Return Damages. They also agreed that \"\u2026*the Retroactivity Damages calculation should therefore involve the elimination of the remaining Claw-Back Feature not already accounted for in the calculation of Reasonable Return Damages*\u2026\".187 This implies that a two-step process is required. The two-step process outlined in this Award reflects both deductions. A failure to adopt such an approach would, in the Tribunal's view, not properly compensate Claimants for the damages caused.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 88.\n\n168.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, the Tribunal therefore decides that both deductions carried out as part of the New Regime should be eliminated as part of the elimination of the claw-back.\n\n**(3) Discount Rate and Regulatory Risk Haircut.**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAs expressed above,188 the Experts agree that the damages analysis must translate the series of incremental cash flows adopted by each Expert into present value figures but disagree with the applicable discount rate for Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages, in addition to the disagreement concerning the incremental cash flow.\n\nSee *supra*, Section III(D).\n\n170.\n\nThe Experts' assessments of the Regulatory Risk in their respective reports were based on the difference in risk between a scenario where all the Disputed Measures have been implemented (\"Actual Scenario\"), and another scenario characterized by the absence of the Disputed Measures (\"Claimants' But-for Scenario\").\n\n171.\n\nIn essence, while Brattle asserts that regulatory risk would have been lower in the \"But-for\" scenario than in the \"Actual\" scenario, BDO contends that there is no difference in both scenarios since \"*most of the New Regulatory Regime adopted by Spain is deemed legal*\".189\n\nRespondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b646; Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 139.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that it is inaccurate to claim \u2013as BDO claims\u2013 that the Tribunal decided that all the Disputed Measures were deemed to be legal, save for the retroactive effect of the NAV calculation and the target return.\n\n173.\n\nThe New Regime resulted in a reduction of return topped with periodical revisions. The Tribunal also believes that it is reasonable for market participants to assign a greater risk in the system after the implementation of the new measures.190 Thus, the regulatory risk should have been lower in the \"But-for\" scenario than in the \"Actual\" scenario.\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138.\n\n174.\n\nIn its First Brattle Quantum Report,191 Brattle states that \"*[a]pplying a haircut directly to revenues ensures that the [discounted cash flow] (DCF) analysis accurately reflects the potential economic impact of a future change in financial support. Reduced financial support would affect plant revenues while leaving costs largely unaffected, squeezing investor returns*\". After subtracting the explicit haircut from revenues, Brattle indicates that the adjusted revenues provide the basis for its forecasts of the \"expected\" free cash flows for the PV plants. Brattle then discounts the expected free cash flows at a discount rate of 3.71%.192\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6 114.\n\nFirst Brattle Quantum Report, \u00b6 115.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Brattle's calculations193 which follow the discounting assumptions explained in the First and Second Brattle Quantum Reports and decides to apply the discount assumptions of a 5.44% discount rate (after tax).\n\nExpert' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 136.\n\n**(4) Conclusions on Reasonable Return Damages and Retroactivity Damages.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nTaking into account that the Tribunal has accepted that: (i) the Effective Tax Rate to apply pre-tax should be 8.7%, (ii) the investment and operating costs to apply to Claimants' PV Plants should be those of an \"Own IT Code\" as one of the options presented by Brattle; (iii) the Interest Tax Shield should be factored in since Claimants did receive a benefit of deduction of the interest paid under shareholder loans, and further that (iv) the regulatory risk identified is different in the \"But-for\" and the \"Actual\" scenarios, the Tribunal determines that the amount of Reasonable Return Damages should be EUR 18.0 million as accepted by the Experts in Joint Table 1 of the Experts' Joint Memorandum.194\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 147.\n\n177.\n\nIn light of the above findings, and those that the Tribunal took into account in the determination of Reasonable Return Damages, the Tribunal determines that the Retroactivity Damages amount to EUR 6.9 million based on the results of the calculations following the Experts assumptions as identified on Joint Table 1 of the Experts' Joint Memorandum.195\n\nExpert' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 147.\n\n178.\n\nThe determination of the Reasonable Return Damages and the Retroactivity Damages include the \"sensitivities\" to the Effective Tax Rate and regulatory risk assumptions in Brattle's calculations, as provided in Brattle Table 7 of the Expert's Joint Memorandum.196\n\nExperts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 149.\n\n179.\n\nFor the reasons indicated above the Tribunal determines that the amount of damages to be awarded to Claimants is: EUR 24.9 million.\n\n**VI. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n180.\n\nClaimants have requested the Tribunal to award both *pre*-award, as well as *post-*award interest, both compounded on a monthly basis.\n\n181.\n\nRespondent has not objected to the concept, for which reason the Tribunal needs not examine the appropriateness and justification for awarding interest on the amounts that Respondent is required to pay Claimants as damages, nor monthly compounding. However, Respondent nonetheless disputes the rates claimed by Claimants, as examined below.\n\n**A. P****re****-A****ward** **I****nterest**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe positions of the Parties on this point are not that far apart. As indicated in Section III. above, both Experts agree to compute pre-award interest based on Spanish Sovereign bond yields. The difference is the duration of the bond. While Brattle proposes a 10-year bond, BDO deems the 8-year bond best reflects the circumstances of the case.\n\n**B. P****ost****-A****ward** **I****nterest**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nPost-award interest was not dealt with by the Experts in their Joint Memorandum, or their respective Quantum Reports, as this was not part of the work entrusted to them.\n\n184.\n\nClaimants have requested that post-award interest be compounded monthly, at a rate that is higher than the pre-award rate, calculated on the basis of the 10-year Spanish bond.197 Claimants contend that post-award interest should be established at a higher rate \"*in order to encourage prompt compliance and to prevent unjust enrichment of the respondent*\".198\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 712.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 708.\n\n185.\n\nRespondent does not object to post-award interest,199 nor submitted objections to a monthly compounding, although it objects to a higher interest above the pre-award interest \u2013 which Respondent characterises as \"*punitive interest*\".200 Spain draws support from *Vestey v. Venezuela*,201 *National Grid v. Argentina*202 and *Micula v. Romania*203 to argue that a post-award interest should not be higher than pre-award interest, as this would imply the existence of a breach of Respondent to its international obligations.204\n\nRespondent's C-Memorial, \u00b6 1403.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1371.\n\n**RL-0063**, *Vestey Group Ltd v.

Indeed, if Spain does not intend to delay or default on an award, a higher post-award interest should have no bearing on its ultimate obligation*\".205\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 711.\n\n**C. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **A****nalysis**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nWhen determining interest, whether this is *pre*-award or *post*-award, the Tribunal must be guided by the principle that full reparation implies that Claimants must be compensated for the loss of their ability to dispose of the amount of damages awarded.206\n\nPayment of interest is an integral component of full reparation, running from the date of the occurrence of damage to the date of full payment of the debtor's obligations, as provided for in Article 38 ILC Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.\n\n188.\n\nConsidering there is agreement among the Parties and their Experts on such principle, the Tribunal is left to decide only which rate should apply amongst those proposed by the Parties, and whether the post-award rate should be higher.\n\n189.\n\nThe current yield of the 10-year bond, *versus* the 8-year bond varies. Naturally, under prevailing market conditions, the longer the term, the greater the yield. Although such difference may not be significant,207 there are two reasons the Tribunal decides to apply the 10-year bond. *First*, and foremost, because the 10-year Spanish government bond-rate is the natural proxy for a \"*commercial rate established on a market basis*\", as required by the ECT,208 and s*econd*, the time that has taken to secure compensation for the breaches and the expected time before Spain makes payment. Other tribunals in similar cases involving RE arbitrations against Spain have decided in the same direction.209\n\nResearch by the Tribunal as of July 2022, indicates the difference in yield is approximately 35 basis points. See http://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/spain/.\n\nClaimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 57, citing Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 705-706. The tribunal in **CL-206**, *Watkins Holdings S.\u00e0.r.l and Others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44, Award, 21 January 2020, \u00b6 746 makes reference to the effect that this rate is used by Spain under the New Regime to determine the allowed return.\n\n**CL-055**, *Novenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v The Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. 2015/063, Award, 15 February 2018, \u00b6 846; **CL-100**, *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/36, Award, 6 September 2019, \u00b6 721.\n\n190.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal determines that pre-award interest should be paid from 30 June 2014 to the date of this Award at the rate of 1.2973%, which is the average rate of the 10-year Spanish bond during such relevant period, to be compounded monthly.210\n\nThe rate corresponds to the monthly average rate in force for the period comprised between June 2014 and January 2023. Source: Bloomberg.\n\n191.\n\nAs to the post-award rate of interest, although BDO argues that there is no reason to make a distinction between the pre-award and post-award interest because the purpose of interest is to compensate the detriment of value of compensation, the Tribunal agrees with other tribunals211 in recent decisions that awarding post-award interest serves the purpose of incentivising compliance with the terms of the Award as expediently as possible.\n\n**CL-029**, *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Award, 4 May 2017, \u00b6 476; **CL-139**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44, Award, 21 January 2020, \u00b6 747.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore awards interest from the date of the Award to the date of payment at the rate of pre-award interest of 1.2973% plus 1.00%, that is 2.2973%, compounded monthly.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. T****he** **P****arties****' P****ositions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nWith respect to the Parties' positions, in their Costs Submissions, Claimants set out the categories of costs they seek to recover that are distributed among: (a) legal costs and related disbursements; (b) expert fees and related disbursements; and (c) institutional, Tribunal and Hearing costs covered by payments that Claimants made directly to ICSID, as follows:212\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Legal Fees and Disbursements | GBP 3,769,196.24 |\n| Expert Fees and Disbursements | EUR 487, 664.10 |\n|  | GBP 18,309.40 |\n| ICSID Costs | USD 855,000.00 |\n| **Totals:** | **GBP 3,787, 505.64** |\n|  | **EUR 487, 664.10** |\n|  | **USD 855, 000.00** |\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n194.\n\nClaimants have described the representation of their counsel and distinguished the amount of legal fees and disbursements incurred involving primarily translations, document processing and printing, transportation costs, hotels, meals and telephone charges.\n\n195.\n\nRegarding Experts, Claimants also separate fees and disbursements incurred by the experts retained from the Brattle Group, as well as advice on the \"clean-hands\" objections presented by Respondent (Professor Ricardo Robles of Pompeu Fabra University, Messrs Ignacio Ayala and Rafael Alcacer of Oliva-Ayala Abogados, Mr. Eduardo S\u00e1nchez-Cervera of S\u00e1nchez-Cervera Abogados and Mr. Esteban Mestre Delgado of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares University).213\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n196.\n\nLastly, Claimants refer to the payments made to ICSID during the proceeding to defray the costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and other expenses.\n\n197.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the total costs \"\u2026 *are reasonable in light of the length of the proceedings, the procedural history, and the complexity of the issues raised*.\"214\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\n198.\n\nClaimants contend that the Tribunal has already found in the Decision of 13 September 2021 that \"\u2026 *Spain breached its international law obligations under the ECT in relation to the Claimants' investment in Spain*\" and that the Tribunal \"\u2026 *also dismissed all but one of Spain's objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the Claimants' claims*.\"215 Considering the Decision, and \"*Spain's numerous procedural tactics and belated frivolous jurisdictional objections* [that] *have unnecessarily protracted the proceedings and significantly increased costs*,\"216 Claimants submit they are entitled to their costs on a \"*full indemnity basis*\".217\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 22- 23.\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\n199.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, claims the total amount of EUR 3,342,045.12 on account of the costs incurred, which includes the fees of experts issuing reports, disbursements and the \"legal cost in lawyers and representatives acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain\",218 as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Expert Fees | EUR 537,567.00 |\n| Disbursements | EUR 191,400.06 |\n| ICSID Costs | EUR 751,578.06219 |\n| Legal Fees | EUR 1,861,500.00 |\n| **Total:** | **EUR 3,342,045.12** |\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8-15.\n\nRespondent presents the equivalent in euros to the sum of USD 855,000 dollars paid to ICSID as costs of the arbitration.\n\n200.\n\nThe disbursements include the costs of translations, courier services, editing services and travel expenses.\n\n201.\n\nRespondent contends that the costs are reasonable \"*in light of the complexity of this case, its duration, and the amount of time and efforts that the Kingdom of Spain has devoted to a dispute* \u2026\", involving \"\u2026 *a number of challenging procedural and legal issues, which the Respondent addressed with professional and effective advocacy*\".220\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 7.\n\n202.\n\nRespondent contends that it is \"\u2026 *beyond any reasonable doubt that the Respondent should have never been charged with the burden and the costs of defending itself through this arbitration proceeding and therefore, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal exercises its broad discretion to make an award of costs in the Respondent's favour\"*,221 but adds that, in the event that this Tribunal were to render an award ordering Spain to pay, in whole or in part, the costs incurred by Claimants in this arbitration, that such order includes \"*only costs that are i) reasonable and ii) incurred in connection with this arbitration* \u2026\", in accordance with Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.222\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\n**B. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **A****nalysis**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nBoth Parties have acknowledged that the ECT is silent on how the costs of any proceeding shall be allocated,223 and have also confirmed the wide discretion of a tribunal in an ICSID arbitration to allocate costs between the parties.224\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 18; Respondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; Respondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 1.\n\n204.\n\nIndeed, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides broad discretion to the Tribunal to allocate costs among the Parties:\n\n\"*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\"\n\n205.\n\nThe accepted principle in arbitration is that the unsuccessful party must pay the successful one all or a portion of the costs. The principle \"costs follow the event\" may be inferred from the rule of customary international law requiring \"full reparation\" to the party injured by a breach of an international obligation. Claimants have cited the *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* award,225 where the tribunal stated that *\"[c]ompensating Claimant for the cost of bringing this proceeding is required to wipe out the consequences of Respondent's breach of the BIT and is particularly appropriate in the current case given the serious and egregious nature of the breach*\".226 The Tribunal agrees that the concept of *restitutio in integrum*, requires that the prevailing party who has suffered damages by reason of illegal actions should be reimbursed the costs of litigation, which could have been avoided if the other party had recognized the pursued rights.\n\n**CL-124**, Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, \u00b6 860.\n\nClaimants' Cost Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\n206.\n\nIn its Decision of 13 September 2021, the Tribunal found on the merits of the dispute that:\n\n\"*Respondent breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by clawing back past remuneration*.\"227\n\n\"*Respondent breached Article 10(1) to the extent that the remuneration of each of the plants failed to ensure payment to Claimants of a reasonable rate of return on their investment during the lifetime of Claimants' PV Plants, as a consequence of the adoption of the Disputed Measures*.\"228\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(4).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(5).\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal has also decided, however, (by majority) that Claimants did not have a legitimate expectation that the remuneration of RD 1578 would continue to be paid for at least 25 years,229 and other claims from Claimants and the Respondent.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(3).\n\n208.\n\nConsidering such findings, and drawing support from the Joint Experts Memorandum, the Tribunal has determined in this Award damages that Respondent must pay Claimants along with interest thereon.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal notes also that of the seven jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent in its Counter-Memorial on Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed all, except for that dealing with the lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* to hear Claimants' claim for breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT deriving from Spain's introduction of the TVPEE in Law 15/2012.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that since the June Hearing,230 Respondent has raised several objections or requests, all of which have been unsuccessful: (a) the \"New Jurisdiction Objection\" dated 20 December 2019 based on the alleged lack of \"clean-hands\" by Claimants, (b) the \"First Request for Reconsideration\" dated 15 October 2021, (c) the \"Second Request for Reconsideration\" dated 24 June 2022, and (d) the \"Third Request for Reconsideration\" dated 27 December 2022.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits held on 24-28 June 2019.\n\n211.\n\nThese have required not only decisions on the part of the Tribunal, but also further rounds of submissions by Claimants.\n\n212.\n\nAside from these instances, the Tribunal recognizes that the Parties have acted properly during the proceedings, while each has fiercely defended its respective position.\n\n213.\n\nAlthough one of the factors that tribunals may utilize in allocating costs is the success \u2013or failure\u2013 of claims submitted before the tribunal, in this case it is difficult to assess an arithmetical distribution, or even an estimate thereof, since the initial valuation reports and the ultimate determination of damages. The fact that an initial expert valuation may be deemed to have been excessive in light of the actual amount of damages awarded to Claimants, this should not, by itself, be a strict determinant for the allocation of costs. It is, nonetheless, an element to consider.\n\n214.\n\nThe main factor considered by the Tribunal is the breach by Respondent to the ECT.

BACKGROUND.**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 September 2021, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum (hereinafter the \"**Decision**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 2 May 2023, the Tribunal issued its Award (hereinafter the \"**Award**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 15 June 2023, the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Respondent**\") submitted its Request for Rectification of the Award (\"**Respondent's Request for Rectification**\"). Respondent's Request for Rectification included a request to stay enforcement of the Award for the reasons stated therein that will be addressed in this Decision.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") registered Respondent's Request for Rectification.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, Infracapital F1 S.\u00e0.r.l. and Infracapital Solar B.V (jointly, \"**Claimants**\") submitted their Request for Rectification of the Award (\"**Claimants' Request for Rectification**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 21 June 2023, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a simultaneous response to the other Party's Request for Rectification, as well as a subsequent reply and rejoinder, if any, under a proposed procedural calendar.\n\n7.\n\nUpon a petition of Respondent to modify the procedural calendar, on 22 June 2023 the Parties reached an agreement to amend such calendar, which was accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nOn 12 July 2023, Claimants submitted their response entitled \"*Claimants' Response to Respondent's Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants' Response**\"), which included their position in respect to Respondent's request to stay the enforcement of the Award.\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 July 2023, Respondent submitted its response entitled \"*Respondent's Response to Claimants' \u0301 Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent's Response**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 21 July 2023, Claimants submitted their reply entitled \"*Reply to Respondent's Response to Claimants' Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants' Reply**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 July 2023, Respondent submitted its reply entitled \"*Reply to Claimants' Response to Respondent's Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent's Reply**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, Claimants submitted a rejoinder entitled \"*Rejoinder to Respondent's Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants' Rejoinder**\")\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, Respondent submitted a rejoinder entitled \"*Respondent's Rejoinder Regarding Claimants \u0301 Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent's Rejoinder**\")\n\n14.\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification and Respondent's Request for Rectification, along with the Parties' respective Response, Reply and Rejoinder, shall be jointly referred to as the \"**Requests for Rectification**\".\n\n**II. REQUEST TO STAY THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD.**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Position.**\n-----------------------------\n\n15.\n\nGiven that both Claimants and Respondent have submitted the Requests for Rectification on the basis that the text of the Award is either not clear and simply omits a word to be properly understood or, alternatively, that the Tribunal improperly decided the amount of damages despite its earlier findings that were the premise for the calculation of such damages, Respondent requests the Tribunal to stay, and hence order and inform \"all parties\" that the enforcement of the Award is stayed until the Requests for Rectification of the Award are decided.1\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 64(b).\n\n16.\n\nAlthough the request to stay the enforcement (\"**Stay Request**\") was made prior to learning of Claimants' Request for Rectification, Respondent reiterates the need to order the stay given the fact that both Parties have now submitted Requests for Rectification.2\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6 32.\n\n17.\n\nRespondent contends that Articles 44 to 47 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\") grant the Tribunal full power to decide any issue which is not decided by the applicable rules to the proceeding and that, specifically, Article 44 establishes that \"*[i]f any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question*\".3 It adds that, in similar terms, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention states that \"*[e]xcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\".4*\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 54.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 55.\n\n18.\n\nTo justify the Stay Request, Respondent asserts that it is based on \"the concurrence of an extraordinary circumstance that justifies it: in compliance with the Decision of the European Union Commission on the S.A. 40348(2015/NN) procedure\",5 and because of this, \"Respondent is compelled to notify the Infracapital Award to the EU Commission. The binding nature of the EU Commission Decision is established in Articles 107, 108 and 288 of the TFEU. In addition, this binding nature derives also from Article 4.2 Directive 2001/77/EC.\"6\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 58.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 58.\n\n19.\n\nMaking reference to the Decision of the EU Commission of November 2017,7 Respondent argues that in said decision the Commission recalls that \"*any compensation which an Arbitration Tribunal were to grant to an investor on the basis that Spain has modified the premium economic scheme by the notified scheme would constitute in and of itself State Aid. However, the Arbitration Tribunals are not competent to authorize the granting of State Aid. That is an exclusive competence of the Commission. If they award compensation, such as in Eiser v. Spain, or were to do so in the future, this compensation would be notifiable State Aid pursuant to Article 108 (3) TFEU and be subject to the standstill obligation.\"8*\n\nEU Commission Decision on State Aid S.A.40348(2015/NN)-Spain, Support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources cogeneration and waste (**RL-0060)**.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 61, citing EU Commission Decision on State Aid S.A.40348(2015/NN)-Spain, Support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources cogeneration and waste (**RL-0060)**.\n\n20.\n\nRespondent argues that, given such background, it \"must notify the Infracapital Award to the EU Commission in compliance with EU Law, and is indeed in the process of making such notification. Until the EU Commission takes a decision pursuant to Article 108 of the TFEU the Respondent cannot comply with the Award. Otherwise, it would breach its obligations under EU Law.\"9\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 62.\n\n21.\n\nIn response to Claimants' contention that the Tribunal lacks the power to stay enforcement pending a request for rectification, Respondent asserts that this does not mean that the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\") prohibit staying enforcement in the event of requests for supplementation and rectification of awards, and \"\u2026 specifically for rectification in certain circumstances, as in cases like the present one where the amount of awarded compensation is affected by the invoked error\", because Article 44 of the ICSID Convention cited above is wide enough to allow the Tribunal to \"decide the question\".10\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 35-38.\n\n22.\n\nCiting *Pey Casado v Chile*,11 Respondent argues that the Tribunal can decide on requests for stay of enforcement also in relation to the remedies of supplementation and rectification under Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.12\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado and Foundation \u00abPresidente Allende\u00bb v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award, 16 May 2013 (\"***Pey Casado*****, Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award**\") **(Annex-003** to Respondent's Request for Rectification).\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n23.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent rejects Claimants' interpretation on the limits of a tribunal, and contends that Rule 54 of ICSID Arbitration Rules refers only to stay of enforcement of an award in the event of requests for interpretation, revision or annulment because said Rule 54 is contained in Chapter VII, precisely on \"*Interpretation, Annulment and Revision of the Award*\". Respondent states that, although Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, on \"Supplementary Decisions and Rectification\" does not include a specific provision on stay of enforcement, this does not mean that the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules prohibit staying enforcement in the event of requests for supplementation and rectification of an award \u2013specifically for rectification in certain circumstances, as in this case, where the amount of awarded compensation is affected by the invoked error. This would be covered, it adds, by its authority under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which provides that \"*[i]f any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question\".*13\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.\n\n**B. Claimants' Position.**\n---------------------------\n\n24.\n\nClaimants challenge that the Tribunal has powers to stay enforcement of the Award as requested by Respondent, because neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant the Tribunal such power. Claimants add that Articles 44 to 47 of the ICSID Convention \u2013which Respondent relies on\u2013 do not address the power to stay enforcement of an award at all.14\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 29.\n\n25.\n\nWhile stay of enforcement of an award is addressed in Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, according to Claimants this provision allows a party to request a stay in an application for interpretation, revision, or annulment of an award pursuant to Article 50, but not in a request for rectification under Article 49, such as the one being examined now.15\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, adding that Spain made the same request based on the same arguments it now uses to seek a stay of the Award in *Watkins Holdings S.\u00e0 r.l. and others v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44, Decision on Spain's Request for Rectification of the Award, 13 July 2020 (\"***Watkins*****, Decision on Spain's Request for Rectification of the Award**\") (**CL-338**), and in supplementary proceedings in *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, 24 August 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 17-23 (\"***Masdar*****, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award**\") (**CL-338**), also relying on these same grounds, and that bit failed in both attempts. In both cases, Claimants add, Spain failed. Also, Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 28.\n\n26.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants add that, should the Contracting Parties to the ICSID Convention \"\u2026 have wanted for rectification proceedings to prompt the stay of the Award, they would have included rectification in ICSID Rule 54. They did not.\"16 Further, that Section 6 of the Convention, titled \"*Recognition and Enforcement of the Award\" states at Article 53(2): \"For the purposes of this Section, 'award' shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52*\" and that \"Rectification (Article 49(2)) is again not included within the relevant provisions governing the enforcement and stay of awards.\"17\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 31\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Analysis.**\n-------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Articles 44 and 46 in the ICSID Convention give powers to an ICSID tribunal to stay the enforcement of the award.\n\n28.\n\nArticle 44 ICSID Convention provides that a tribunal established under the ICSID Rules of Arbitration shall decide \"*\u2026 any question of procedure [that] arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties*, ...\".18 The Tribunal does not find that a request to stay the enforcement of an award can qualify as an issue of \"procedure\". This is especially so, in a situation where the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules specifically address the stay of enforcement in other provisions, as indicated below.\n\nArticle 44 reads as follows: \"*Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question*.\"\n\n29.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention provides that a tribunal shall, if requested by a party to a proceeding, determine \"\u2026 *any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\"*.19 The Tribunal, however, does not believe that Respondent's Request for Rectification contains or can qualify as a \"claim or counterclaim\" that is incidental to the issues decided by this Tribunal in the Award.\n\nArticle 44 reads as follows: \"*Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre*.\"\n\n30.\n\nArticle 50(2) of the ICSID Convention empowers the tribunal that has rendered an award (or a new tribunal, if this is not possible) to stay enforcement of the award, pending its decision on the interpretation of such award.20 Article 51(4) deals with the revision of an award on the ground of discovery of some fact of such nature as decisively to affect the award issued, and also allows the same tribunal that rendered the award (or a new tribunal, if this is not possible) to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. Article 52(5) addresses the annulment of the award issued, but in this case, it shall be the committee to be established who shall rule on the stay of enforcement pending its decision on the request for annulment. These three provisions are set out in Section 5 dealing with Interpretation, Revision and the Annulment of an Award.\n\nArticle 50(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"*The request shall, if possible, be submitted to the Tribunal which rendered the award. If this shall not be possible, a new Tribunal shall be constituted in accordance with Section 2 of this Chapter. The Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision\".*\n\n31.\n\nRule 54(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides for the stay of enforcement of an award, but limits this action to cases of interpretation, revision or annulment of an award:\n\n*The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n32.\n\nAs is clear in these provisions, the only instances where the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules contemplate the stay of enforcement of an award, are in very precise post-award remedies. These do not include a procedure where one of the parties (in this case, both) have submitted a request to rectify an award. Rectification of an award is expressly addressed in Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Had the drafters of the ICSID Arbitration Rules intended to also contemplate the stay of enforcement for requests for rectification, they would have expressly provided for such a measure. But they did not.\n\n33.\n\nRespondent contends that Rule 54 *\"\u2026 has been interpreted in a flexible manner, including for instance requests for supplementary decisions and rectification after conclusion of an annulment, even if not referred to specifically in the ICSID Rules*\"21 and cites *Pey Casado v Chile*22 as support, where the tribunal considered the possibility of staying the enforcement despite the application dealing with a request for supplementation.23 The distinction between the *Pey Casado* case and this case is evident. First, in *Pey Casado v. Chile* the committee acknowledged that the request was being considered within an application for annulment of the award, and second, the committee nonetheless decided to reject the request for stay of enforcement.24\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 58.\n\n*Pey Casado*, Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award **(Annex-003** to Respondent's Request for Rectification).\n\n*Pey Casado*, Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award, \u00b6 32. **(Annex-003** to Respondent's Request for Rectification).\n\nAlthough Respondent contends (Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 39) that the decision issued by the *Pey Casado v Chile* tribunal was issued within a \"request for supplementation\" (i.e, Request for Supplementation of the Annulment Decision of the Award) such tribunal expressly acknowledged that \"\u2026 *the request takes place within the context of an annulment proceeding the party making the application can make the request on the basis of Article 52(5) of* Pey Casado, Decision on the Republic of Chile's Request for a Stay of Enforcement of the Unannulled Portion of the Award, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35. **(Annex-003** to Respondent's Request for Rectification)\n\n34.\n\nA tribunal which dealt with an instance quite similar to the request for stay of enforcement submitted in the present case was that in *Watkins v Spain.*25 In that case, Spain also submitted after the issuance of the award a request for rectification, along with a request for stay of enforcement pending the tribunal's decision on the first request. The *Watkins* tribunal rejected the request for stay of enforcement because it concluded that Articles 44 to 47 of the ICSID Convention \"\u2026 *do not confer jurisdiction on the Tribunal to issue a stay of enforcement of an award especially in view of the wording of Rule 54(1) of the Arbitration Rules*\".26\n\n**CL-339**, *Watkins*, Decision on Spain's Request for Rectification of the Award.\n\n**CL-339**, *Watkins*, Decision on Spain's Request for Rectification of the Award, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\n35.\n\nAnother tribunal that decided on a similar issue was in the *Masdar Solar v Spain* case,27 where Spain submitted a request for a supplementary decision in respect of the award. Although the request for a supplementary decision differs from a request for rectification, as in this case, the provisions governing both are the same. Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules deal with both. The tribunal concluded that it had *\"\u2026no power to order the stay of enforcement in connection with an application to supplement an award pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention*\"28, also observing that post-award remedies which allow an ICSID Tribunal to order a stay of enforcement are regulated by Articles 50 to 52 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules 50 to 55, and that a stay of enforcement is not contemplated for supplementation and rectification of an award.29\n\n**CL-338,** *Masdar*, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award.\n\n**CL-338,** *Masdar,* Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, \u00b6 24.\n\n**CL-338,** *Masdar*, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, \u00b6 23.\n\n36.\n\nIn connection with Respondent's concern that it needs to notify the Award to the EU Commission in compliance with the Decision of the European Union Commission on the S.A. 40348(2015/NN) procedure,30 and Respondent's reliance on such obligation to support its contention that the Tribunal has powers \"\u2026 *to decide all issues that may arise and the exceptional circumstances* \u2026\",31 the Tribunal notes that this same argument was expressed by Spain in *Masdar Solar v Spain,*32 and said tribunal found it unnecessary to address such argument given its conclusion that the tribunal had no powers to stay the enforcement of an award under a situation that is not expressly contemplated under the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules.33\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 58-62.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 63.\n\n**CL-338,** *Masdar*, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, \u00b6 7 , where the tribunal noted that the application was \"\u2026*based on the occurrence of an extraordinary circumstance* \u2026\".\n\n**CL-338,** *Masdar*, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, \u00b6 25.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that Respondent asserts an argument that addresses its concern. Respondent states that in accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the decision rectifying the Award \"*shall become part of the award*\" and \"*the periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered*\". Respondent asserts that \"until said decision is rendered, the Award will not be complete\".34 But then Respondent argues that the Tribunal \"should stay the enforcement of the Award as it can be said that the Award will not be complete until the decision regarding this Request for Rectification is rendered\".35 The second part of its argument appears to be in contradiction or inconsistent with the first part.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 56, Respondent's Response, \u00b6 31.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 56.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the first part of Respondent's argument, under the ICSID Convention any decision on a request for rectification will form part of the award, and the periods in which to seek a revision or annulment shall count as from the date of the decision is issued, which means that the award in itself is final, but subject to any decision on the request for rectification. Likewise, even after such a decision is issued, either party to an ICSID arbitration may seek a revision under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention or annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In the latter instance, the provisions themselves provide for automatic stays of enforcement when such a petition is made with the relevant application for revision or annulment, pending a ruling by the tribunal on the subject. The *ad hoc* committee in *Continental v Argentina* confirmed this interpretation making an analysis of the principles in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.36\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. The Argentine Republic,* Decision on the Claimant's Preliminary Objection to Argentina's Application for Annulment, 23 October 2009, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9 - Annulment Proceeding, as cited in **CL-338,** *Masdar*, Decision on the Respondent's Application to Stay Enforcement of the Award, \u00b6 28.\n\n39.\n\nConsidering the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks the powers to stay the Award pending a decision on the Requests for Rectification.\n\n**III.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 13 September 2021, the Tribunal presided by Mr. Eduardo Siqueiros T., and also comprising Prof. Peter D. Cameron, and Mr. Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda (the \"**Tribunal**\") issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, attached to the Decision was a partial dissenting opinion by Prof. Peter D. Cameron (the \"**Decision**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 2 May 2023, the Tribunal rendered its Award (hereinafter the \"**Award**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 June 2023, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 49 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"), Respondent submitted a Request for Rectification of the Award (\"**Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification**\"), accompanied by the lodging fee in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(1)(d).\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, the Secretary-General registered Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a), and transmitted a copy of Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification, together with the Notice of Registration, to each Member of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 June 2023, Claimants submitted a Request for Rectification of the Award (\"**Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification**\"), accompanied by the lodging fee in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(1)(d).\n\n10.\n\nOn 20 June 2023, the Secretary-General registered Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a), and transmitted a copy of Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification, together with the Notice of Registration, to each Member of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 June 2023, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a simultaneous response to the other Party\u2019s Request for Rectification, as well as a subsequent reply and rejoinder, if any, under a proposed procedural calendar.\n\n12.\n\nUpon a petition of Respondent to modify the procedural calendar, on 22 June 2023, the Parties reached an agreement to amend such calendar, which was confirmed by the Tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nOn 12 July 2023, Claimants filed their response entitled *\"Claimants\u2019 Response to Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants\u2019 Response**\")\n\n14.\n\nOn 12 July 2023, Respondent filed its response entitled *\"Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimants \u2019 Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent\u2019s Response**\")\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 July 2023, Claimants filed their reply entitled *\"Reply to Respondent\u2019s Response to Claimants \u2019 Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants\u2019 Reply**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 21 July 2023, Respondent filed its reply entitled *\"Reply to Claimants\u2019 Response to Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent\u2019s Reply**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, Claimants filed a rejoinder entitled *\"Rejoinder to Respondent\u2019s Reply on the Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder**\")\n\n18.\n\nOn 28 July 2023, Respondent submitted a rejoinder entitled *\"Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder regarding Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification of the Award\"* (\"**Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder**\")\n\n19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request for Rectification included a request to stay the enforcement of the Award until a decision on the Requests for Rectification was issued. On 24 August 2023, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, rejecting such request.\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 August 2023, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n21.\n\nClaimants and Respondent have each submitted a Request for Rectification arguing that (i) the text of the Award simply misses a word to be properly read (Claimants\u2019 Request) or, (ii) that the Tribunal improperly decided the amount of damages despite its earlier findings that were the premise for the calculation of the damages, and requires adjustments to the text (Respondent\u2019s Request).\n\n22.\n\nIn the Decision, the Tribunal found, among others, that (i) *\"Respondent breached of Article 10(1) of the ECT by clawing back past remuneration\";*1 (ii) *\"Respondent breached Article 10(1) to the extent that the remuneration of each of the plants failed to ensure payment to Claimants of a reasonable rate of return on their investment during the lifetime of Claimants \u2019 PV Plants, as a consequence of the adoption of the Disputed Measures\";*2 and (iii) directed the Parties \"*to attempt to reach an agreement on the amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimants in respect to its obligations on post-tax rate of return in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s findings. \"*3\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(4).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(5).\n\nDecision, \u00b6 822(7).\n\n23.\n\nIn line with the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the experts of both Parties4 issued a joint report titled \"Brattle-BDO Joint Memorandum\", dated 1 April 2022 (\"**Experts Joint Memorandum**\"). In the Experts Joint Memorandum, the Experts presented their respective positions, addressing the points of agreements and disagreement.\n\nThe Brattle Group in the case of Claimants, and BDO in the case of Respondent.\n\n24.\n\nThe key elements of disagreement among the Experts were: the Effective Tax Rate; the Actual Costs of the Claimants\u2019 PV Plants, the Approach to calculate the Reasonable Return Damages; Elements of the Retroactivity Damages; and the Regulatory Risk. In their Joint Memorandum, the Experts presented the Tribunal with different findings and tables to support their respective positions, including a joint table (\"**Joint Table 1**\") determining the amount to be awarded by the Tribunal depending on the Tribunal\u2019s findings under each of the points of disagreement, to be complemented with the Sensitivities to Brattle\u2019s Damages (Brattle Table 7) or BDO\u2019s Damages (BDO Table 6).\n\n25.\n\nThe Requests for Rectification have a common premise: the effect of the so-called \"tax shield\" that arises from shareholder loans in the determination of the applicable rate of return. This was relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in the determination of, among others, the \"Reasonable Return Damages\" which were awarded to Claimants in the Award.5\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 176-179.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Position on the Request for Rectification**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimants request the Tribunal:6\n\n(a) To rej ect Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification; and\n\n(b) To rectify paragraph 129 of the Award under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, such that it reads *\"...the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should **not** be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre- tax return.*\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 36, Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 34 (emphasis in the original).\n\n27.\n\nClaimants believe that the rectification of the Award requires a simple correction of a \"clerical error\"7 in paragraph 129 of the Award that states: *\"The Tribunal therefore concludes that the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax return*. They contend that the word \"not\" is missing to properly express the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions. The corrected paragraph should read \"... *the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should **not** be factored into the conversion* .\".\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 9.\n\n28.\n\nAs Claimants note, paragraph 129 is the last paragraph and conclusion of section (V)(1)(a) of the Award, which deals with the effective tax rate that must be applied to convert the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax target return. Claimants contend that the Tribunal set out, in such section, its reasoning and decision as to whether the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should be factored into the tax rate that would be used to convert the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax target return.8\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 11.\n\n29.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the analysis made by the Tribunal in the Award needed to decide whether to include the tax shield resulting from the shareholders loans during a *first step*, i.e., when the 7% post-tax target return is converted into a pre-tax target return, or in a *second step* - as proposed by Brattle, when converting the post-tax target return into a pre-tax target return that assumes a single pre-tax return of 8.7%.9 Claimants remind the Tribunal that Brattle\u2019s proposal was to \"mirror\" what the Spanish regulator did under the Original Regime and did not factor the interest tax shield in the conversion of the 7% post-tax target rate of return into a pre-tax rate of return, and that this was acknowledged by the Tribunal in the Award.10\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 12(a), making reference to the Award, \u00b6 64.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants then examine and support the reasoning process carried out by the Tribunal in the Award to arrive at an amount of \"Reasonable Return Damages\" that it determined based on the tables prepared jointly by the Experts in the Experts' Joint Memorandum.11\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 15, making reference to Joint Table 1 of the Experts' Joint Memorandum and Award, \u00b6 176. See also Claimants' Response, \u00b6 15.\n\n31.\n\nThus, Claimants contend, it is clear that the word \"not\" is missing from paragraph 129, based on: (a) the Tribunal's reasoning in paragraphs 119 to 121 of the Award; (b) the Tribunal's express reference to Brattle's pre-tax figure of 8.7%; and (c) the determination that the damages suffered by the Claimants is EUR 18 million based on Joint Table 1 of the Experts' Joint Memorandum.12\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 18; Claimants' Response, \u00b6 28.\n\n32.\n\nIn response to the arguments included in Respondent's Request for Rectification, Claimants contend that these should be rejected, because the reasoning of the Tribunal in the Award allows for a proper interpretation with the simple addition of the word proposed by Claimants in paragraph 129 of the Award.13\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 18.\n\n33.\n\nFurther, Claimants contend that Respondent's Request for Rectification exceeds the scope of what is permitted by Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, as it would require the Tribunal to re-draft multiple paragraphs of the Award, as well as revise the entire damages determination.14 If granted by the Tribunal, the proposed changes would create inconsistencies in the Award and make it ripe for annulment.15\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 3(b) and 19; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 3(b); Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 3(c).\n\n34.\n\nIn addition, they contend that Respondents' Request for Rectification does not propose the correct damages figure even if its tax shield theory were correct. If the Tribunal were to correct the Award in the manner suggested by Spain, for the tax shield benefit to be factored into the conversion of the post-tax return into a pre-tax return, then the Tribunal could not simply adopt a damages figure of EUR 15.7 million because it is indisputable that that figure does not represent the loss suffered by the Claimants' PV Plants, given that such proposal uses an average effective tax rate of 12.8% across all of the Claimants' PV Plants, and \"*it is undisputed between the parties that the tax shield benefit varies across the Claimant\u2019s PV Plants.\"*16\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 3(c).\n\n35.\n\nClaimants add that Spain failed to provide a damages figure that is consistent with its claim that the Tribunal should take account of the individual tax shield benefit enjoyed by each PV Plant for purposes of converting the 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax return.17 Claimants should not suffer from under-compensation simply because Spain failed to provide a calculation for what it now claims is the correct approach to damages.18\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 26.\n\n36.\n\nAs a result, Claimants propose, there are only two possibilities with respect to the Award: (a) the Claimants are correct that the Tribunal did not intend to take account of the tax shield in converting the 7% post-tax return to a pre-tax return and paragraph 129 contains a typographical error; or (b) if the Tribunal did intend to take account of the tax shield, then the Tribunal used its discretion to award the damages in the amount EUR 24.9 million, given that Spain had failed to provide a calculation of damages that reflected its position on the tax shield.19\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 3(e).\n\n37.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent failed to provide a damages figure corresponding to the loss suffered by each PV Plant and instead proposed to use an average pre-tax rate of return of 8.0% (the pre-tax return used in BDO\u2019s calculations) rather than the single 8.7% pre-tax rate referred to in paragraph 176 of the Award (and used in Brattle\u2019s calculations), but that Respondent then claims that using BDO\u2019s average pre-tax return of 8.0%, the correct damages awarded according to Brattle Table 7 is EUR 15.7 million.20 Hence, Claimants request that the Tribunal reject the \"corrections\" to the Award proposed by Spain, since this would be inconsistent with the reasoning of the Tribunal.21\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 16, making reference to the proposed changes in language to paragraphs 176, 177, 179 and 219(1) of the Award.\n\n38.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s claim that Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification is merely a *\"last-minute reaction\"* to its own request and is a *\"course and desperate attempt\"* to avoid the Award being rectified in the manner proposed by Spain, Claimants not only reject the proposition, but refer to evidence that Claimants made payment of the lodging fee in anticipation of its request the day before Respondent even submitted its Request for Rectification.22\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.\n\n39.\n\nIn their Rejoinder, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2019s position should be rejected because BDO did not use a different effective tax rate for each plant, as was directed by the Tribunal in the Decision, and therefore arrived at an average tax shield benefit for the PV Plants. By factoring the tax shield through the average effective tax rate, Claimants argue that BDO did not consider the individual tax shield of each PV Plant. It overestimates the tax shield benefit enjoyed by the PV Plants, which results in under-compensation to Claimants. Spain\u2019s proposed damages, Claimants add, are flawed because they do not account for the different tax shield benefits that each of the Claimants\u2019 PV Plants enjoyed.23\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 12-17.\n\n**C. Respondent\u2019s Position on the Request for Rectification**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal:24\n\n(a) To rectify the Award under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention in accordance with Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification, reducing the amount of awarded damages to EUR 15.7 million; and\n\n(b) To reject Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification.\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6 34, Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 41.\n\n41.\n\nThe essence of Respondent\u2019s position is that the Tribunal\u2019s order to pay Claimants the amount of EUR 24.9 million is not consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s own finding that the shareholder loans interest tax shield must be taken into consideration for the conversion of post-tax reasonable target return into a pre-tax return, necessary for the calculation of damages. Thus, if the shareholder loans interest tax shield had been taken into consideration, the Effective Tax Rate to be considered in the calculation should have been 12.8% (and not 19.6%), and the pre-tax return to be considered in the calculation should have been 8.0% (and not 8.7%). Thus, Respondent contends, if this \"error\" is corrected, the awarded amount should have been EUR 15.7 million instead of EUR 24.9 million.25\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, Respondent's Response, \u00b6 3.\n\n42.\n\nRespondent notes that the Tribunal concluded in the Award that the reasonable target rate of return in the \"but-for scenario\" should be 7% post-tax, and that, in order to convert such post-tax rate of return into a pre-tax rate, an Effective Tax Rate needed to be applied. Further, Respondent observes that the Tribunal had accepted a 19.6% Effective Tax Rate in the Decision26 under the assumption that the Claimants had no debt financing that translated into a tax shield benefit that lowered this rate. Thus, the Experts\u2019 debate was whether to include or not the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans of the Claimants\u2019 PV Plants in order to determine the Effective Tax Rate.27\n\nDecision, \u00b6 816.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\n43.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent contends that the Tribunal agreed with BDO that the Effective Tax Rate should include the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans,28 which resulted in a lower Effective Tax Rate (12.8%) and in a pre-tax rate of return of 8.0%. However, according to Respondent, the Effective Tax Rate that was mistakenly used by the Tribunal to convert the post-tax target return into a pre-tax return was maintained at 19.6%, which does not take into consideration the shareholder loans interest tax shield.29\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 19, citing Award, \u00b6 129.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n44.\n\nIf the Tribunal had concluded that the pre-tax return should have been 12.8%, then, taking into account the decisions of the Tribunal on the other issues of the Experts disagreements (the Actual Costs of the Claimants\u2019 PV Plants, the Elements of the Retroactivity Damages; and the Regulatory Risk), the Tribunal should have selected within Brattle Table 7 of the Joint Memorandum: (i) BDO\u2019s Effective Tax Rate to determine the pre-tax return, because it includes the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans; (ii) the own IT code; and (iii) a different regulatory risk. In such case, the correct damage determination following the Tribunal\u2019s findings should have been EUR 15.7 million.30\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 22-31, Respondent's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.\n\n45.\n\nAccording to Respondent, paragraph 176 of the Award makes the following statement (which contradicts its finding that the interest tax shield of the shareholder loans should be considered): *\"Taking into account that the Tribunal has accepted that: (i) the Effective Tax Rate to apply pre-tax should be 8.7%,* [...]\". In that regard, Respondent states that the Effective Tax Rate proposed by the Experts was either BDO\u2019s Effective Tax Rate (12.8%), which included the interest tax shield of the shareholder loans, or Brattle\u2019s Effective Tax Rate (19.6%), that excluded the interest tax shield. In no case, Respondent adds, was the Effective Tax Rate 8.7%. This percentage was Brattle\u2019s proposed pre-tax return rate following Brattle\u2019s approach for the Effective Tax Rate, which according to Respondent, was rejected by the Tribunal.31\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\n46.\n\nConsidering the above arguments, Respondent requests that the Tribunal amend the text of paragraphs 176, 177, 179 and 219(1) of the Award. To this end, Respondent proposes specific language to be utilized.32 Such proposed language addresses the position by Respondent expressed in the preceding paragraphs.\n\nRespondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6\u00b6 44-52.\n\n47.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification because it is \"*a last-minute reaction to Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification of the Award by which Claimants unduly attempt to avoid a rectification requested by the Respondent that is evidently necessary*.\"33\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 30.\n\n48.\n\nNonetheless, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification is a *\"clear acknowledgement*\" that the Award has incurred in a calculation error.34 But a grammatical interpretation of paragraph 129 in the context of paragraph 128 should make the Tribunal\u2019s intentions clear.35\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 6-10.\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.\n\n49.\n\nIn that regard, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification is, in fact, not a request to rectify the Award but rather an appeal of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans, and that Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is clear as to the reasons why an award should be rectified.36\n\nRespondent's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants are *\"unduly using the rectification remedy set out in the ICSID Convention to file an appeal\"* on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision, and arbitral doctrine is unanimous that the rectification remedy cannot be used to re-open debates on the merits of issues already decided.37\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\n51.\n\nFurther, Respondent questions the assertion made by the Tribunal in paragraph 176 of the Award, stating that \"*the Effective Tax Rate to apply pre-tax should be 8.7%\",* when neither Brattle nor BDO proposed an Effective Tax Rate of 8.7%. In particular, Respondent states that Brattle calculates an Effective Tax Rate of 19.6% which results in a pre-tax return of 8.7%, while BDO calculates an Effective Tax Rate of 12.8% which results in a pre-tax return of 8%.38\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 25.\n\n52.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 position in respect to the alleged failure by BDO to consider the tax shield benefit from shareholder loans that each one of Claimants\u2019 PV Plants to arrive to the EUR 15.7 million damages figure. It contends that the tax shield benefit from shareholder loans enjoyed by each one of Claimants\u2019 PV Plants, as indicated in their Annual Accounts, was factored in by BDO to calculate the Effective Tax Rates for each plant, and then the single Effective Tax Rate of 12.8% applied across all of Claimants\u2019 PV Plants was calculated by BDO as an average (or aggregate) of the Effective Tax Rate of each plant.39\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 20-31.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe issue is clear. Both Parties support their respective request on the basis of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:\n\n*The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.*\n\n54.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 49 details the procedure to be followed for rectification of an award. Both Claimants and Respondent followed the requirements for submission of their respective requests, and neither has alleged the other failed to meet such requirements.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that both Claimants and Respondent submitted their respective Request for Rectification within the period established in the provisions cited of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n56.\n\nA rectification of an award is limited in scope. It can only be granted where there has been an outright error of a *\"... clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award.\"* The rectification procedure is not an appeal,40 nor intended to address and seek corrections of the award that may deal with the analysis of the merits of the case.41\n\n**CL-339**, *Watkins Holdings S.\u00e0.r.l. and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44 (\"***Watkins v. Spain***\"), Decision on Spain's Request for Rectification of the Award, 13 July 2020, \u00b6 39.\n\n**CL-339**, *Watkins v.

Romania* tribunal.42 Indeed, the Tribunal does not have the power under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention to re-draft the Award nor to make new determinations of fact or law. Thus, Claimants seek that Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification be rejected because, in their view, the proposed corrections go well beyond the intended scope of rectification proceedings.43\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 6, citing **CL-333**, *Marco Gavazzi and Stefano Gavazzi v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/25, Excerpts of Decision on Rectification, 13 July 2017, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n58.\n\nRespondent supports its position by stating that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 assertion, Respondent is not requesting to \"revise the entire damages determination\", but is rather \"... *simply requesting that the correct figure of damages is selected so that the awarded compensation is in accordance with the Tribunals\u2019 findings.\"44* Even if the correction of the error should expand to all paragraphs of the Award affected by the error.45\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 16.\n\n59.\n\nConsidering the above, and the fact that both the Decision and the Award have a logic to their analysis on the subject, there is no dispute that the adjustment to the Award to be carried out by the Tribunal is to correct an error, should any exist. This correction should not be deemed to be outside of the scope of a rectification of the Award under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n60.\n\nAlthough it is appropriate to rectify an error of the type addressed under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is aware that it cannot, however, amend its reasoning, modify the legal analysis, or alter findings with elements that are not already addressed in the Award.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the rectification remedy contemplated in the ICSID Convention generally involves straightforward, clerical or arithmetical errors or correcting obvious omissions, so the real intentions of the tribunal are given effect in the award. The remedy therefore cannot be used to re-consider and/or re-evaluate the positions and evidence submitted in the case.\n\n**B. Applicability of the Tax Shield**\n--------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Requests for Rectification share one common element: whether or not the Tribunal\u2019s logic in its analysis allows it to reach the decision made on damages due to Claimants. The issue in contention is the same: the effect on factoring the \"tax shield benefit\" in the calculation of damages.\n\n63.\n\nBy way of background, in the Decision, the Tribunal concluded that the New Regime resulted in a post-tax reasonable return below the targeted post-tax return of 7% under the Original Regime,46 but acknowledged that it was not clear to the Tribunal whether or not Claimants had received the alleged benefit of a tax shield on the interest paid under shareholder loans.47\n\nDecision, \u00b6 752.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 749.\n\n64.\n\nSince the Tribunal deemed that it lacked sufficient information to determine damages, it directed the Parties to attempt to seek an agreement or submit elements to the Tribunal for such determination. To that end, the Tribunal determined *\"essential parameters\u2019\"* to be taken into account by the Experts appointed by the Parties. Among these, the following were identified:48\n\na) a 7% after-tax target rate of return; and\n\nb) a 19.6% average tax rate across all of Claimants\u2019 PV Plants, under the assumption that Claimants\u2019 PV Plants have no debt financing that translated into a tax shield benefit that lowered this rate, provided, however, that should any of the PV Plants owned directly or indirectly by Claimants had received such a tax-shield benefit, this factor would need to be taken into account individually for each PV Plant, as required, in order to determine the actual tax rate.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 810-821.\n\n65.\n\nAfter having received the Quantum Submissions -accompanied by the Experts Joint Memorandum- the Tribunal proceeded in the Award to calculate the compensation due to Claimants.\n\n66.\n\nIn the description of Claimants\u2019 position on the impact of the interest tax-shield, the Tribunal identified that Brattle\n\n\"... *adopts the same approach as the Spanish regulator under the Original Regime, by assuming there is no impact from the interest tax shield for purposes of converting the 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax target return. By doing so, Brattle calculates an effective tax rate of 19.6% and therefore converts the 7% post-tax return into an 8.7% pre-tax return\",* adding that\n\n\" .*..Brattle then uses the 8.7% pre-tax rate of return to derive the amount of revenue needed to ensure the Claimants receive the equivalent of the Original Regime\u2019s 7% post-tax return. In a second step, Brattle then reflects the actual taxes paid in 'real life \u2019 at each of the PV Plants, including by taking into account the interest tax shield.\"49*\n\nAward, \u00b6 64, with reference to Claimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 10(a).\n\n67.\n\nOn the other hand, in describing Respondent\u2019s position in the Award, the Tribunal indicated that, according to Respondent,\n\n*\"... there is evidence in the record that confirms that there are various shareholder loans that were granted to the Claimants \u2019 PV Plants, and hence that they benefited from the deductibility of the interest paid for said loans and attracted the corresponding tax shield, and points to the Experts \u2019 Joint Memorandum where BDO has included the necessary information to that effect. Therefore, BDO included such tax shield benefit to determine the effective tax rate. \"*50\n\nAward, \u00b6 93, with reference to Respondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 19, the Joint Expert Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31 and Exhibit BQR-06.\n\n68.\n\nIn its analysis, the Tribunal again confirmed that the targeted return under the Original Regime was 7% post-tax and that a 19.6 % average tax rate should be applied. Further, it was clear -without dispute among the Parties and their Experts- that Claimants\u2019 PV Plants had in fact received a tax-shield benefit.51\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 113-129.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal relied on the agreements reached by the Experts. In particular, the Tribunal acknowledged in its analysis that:\n\na) *\"The Experts agree that to calculate both the Reasonable Return and Retroactivity Damages, it is first necessary to convert the 7% post-tax rate of return under the Original Regime into a pre-tax rate of return that will be used in the But-for scenario. The Experts further agree that, to convert the Original Regime\u2019s 7% post-tax return into a pre-tax return, it is necessary to estimate an effective tax rate to use in that conversion\";52 and*\n\nb) *\"[the Experts] ... acknowledge that interest generated by the shareholder loans are deductible expenses that reduce the project effective tax rate, i.e., the effective tax paid by the projects, even in an all-equity basis (as shareholder loans may also be deemed equity funds.\"53*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 34 and 112, making reference to Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 9.\n\nAward, \u00b6 36, making reference to Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 32.\n\n70.\n\nBut there were disagreements. As stated by the Tribunal in the Award,\n\n*\"... [p]erhaps the primary area of disagreement among the Experts is that, while Brattle believes that the Spanish regulator took into account any interest tax shield (external debt or shareholder loans) when setting remuneration, BDO believes Claimants \u2019 PV Plants indeed had tax shield benefits through the various shareholder loans granted, and the exercise should follow the Tribunal\u2019s instructions in the determination of the effective tax rate. \"*54\n\nAward, \u00b6 37, making reference to Experts' Joint Memorandum, \u00b6 26.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledged the debate among the Experts as to when the tax shield should be factored into the calculation, and in reference to the analysis carried out in the Decision, stated the following in the Award:\n\n*\"In the event that any of the PV Plants benefitted from a tax shield arising from debt financing, then the tax rate should be adjusted accordingly. The Tribunal did not, however, state 'how \u2019 and 'when \u2019 this element is to be factored in. This is where the first divergence of approach emerges in the Experts \u2019 Joint Memorandum and the Parties \u2019 submissions.\"55*\n\nThis mention was made to address BDO\u2019s reliance on paragraphs 748 and 754 of the Decision suggesting that the Tribunal determined that the interest tax shield should be factored in the first step.56\n\nAward, \u00b6 113.\n\nExperts Joint Memorandum, \u00b6\u00b6 37-43 and Respondent's Quantum Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\n72.\n\nWhile Respondent argued that\n\n*\"... the impact of the tax shield should be applied in a first step while converting the 7% post-tax into a pre-tax rate, because failure to do so means that Claimants will receive higher compensation based on the tax rate that would not be paid in the 'real world\u2019.\"51*\n\nClaimants\u2019 position was that factoring the tax-shield benefit\n\n*\"... should [be made], but only in the second step - that is, when computing the Revised Cash Flows in both the 'Actual\u2019 and 'But-for\u2019 scenarios. Claimants argue that it is in this second step that they 'fully\u2019 take the interest tax shield into account at each PV Plant.\"58*\n\nAward, \u00b6 115 (emphasis in the original), making reference to Claimants' Quantum Submission, \u00b6 15. 59 Decision, \u00b6 817.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal took both positions into account and concluded that the benefits of the financing secured by each of the PV Plants should affect each plant individually. At the time it issued the Decision, the Tribunal stated that the individual impact of such tax shield was one of the so-called \"*essential parameters*\":\n\n*\"If... any of the [PV Plants] ... had debt financing that received a tax shield benefit, this factor shall need to be taken into account individually for each PV Plant, as required, in order to determine the actual tax rate.\"*59\n\nDecision, \u00b6 817.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal also acknowledged -as Claimants assert- that attempting to factor the tax shield in the first step would require the 7% post-tax return to be converted into an infinite number of different pre-tax returns in order to determine the remuneration due to each individual PV Plant.60\n\nClaimants' Response, \u00b6 15(f), making reference to Award, \u00b6 124.\n\n75.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the benefits of financing and tax-shield benefits can only be achieved in the so-called \"second-step\" when remuneration is subject to taxes in the normal course based on the specific characteristics of the individual PV Plant.\n\n76.\n\nThis is why the Tribunal relied on the Experts\u2019 Joint Table 1 which summarized the results of the calculations following the Experts\u2019 respective assumptions.61 The Experts\u2019 Joint Table 1 shows the amount of damages following the approach of both Brattle (Claimants\u2019 Expert) and BDO (Respondent\u2019s Expert). While BDO only presented one option in considering its approach and assumptions, Brattle presented three. This \"joint table\" has been referred to by both Parties in their respective Request for Rectification.62\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Brattle options | BDO Approach |\n| Marginal Plant | Average Plant | Own It Code | Real Plant |\n| Assumptions |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Setting remuneration |  |  | Exclude Interest Tax Shield | Exclude InterestTax Shield | Exclude Interest Tax Shield | Exclude Interest Tax Shield | Include Interest Tax Shield |\n| Damages estimation |  |  | Include Interest Tax Shield | Include Interest Tax Shield | Include Interest Tax Shield | Include Interest Tax Shield | Include Interest Tax Shield |\n| Investment costs |  |  | Marginal plant same technology | Average plant same technology | Own IT-Code | Actual Plants | Revised Actual Investment costs (Own IT-code) |\n| Production and operating costs |  |  | Marginal plant same technology | Average plant same technology | Own IT-Code | Actual Plants | Actual Plants |\n| Regulatory risk |  |  | Different But-for and Actual | Different But-for and Actual | Different But-for and Actual | Different But-for and Actual | Same But-For and Actual |\n| Retroactivity Damages | \u20ac mln | [1] | -5.4 | -8.3 | -6.9 | 0.8 | -9.2 |\n| Reasonable Return Damages | \u20ac mln | [2] | -21.5 | -17.2 | -18.0 | -50.7 | -0.6 |\n| Total Damages | \u20ac mln | [3] | [l]+[2] -27.0 | -25.6 | -24.9 | -49.9 | -9.9 |\n\nThe Experts' Joint Table 1 is shown in Award, \u00b6 59.\n\nClaimants' Request for Rectification, \u00b6 15; Respondent's Request for Rectification, \u00b6 12.\n\n77.\n\nIn the option within the Experts\u2019 Joint Table 1 selected by the Tribunal for the determination of damages, the assumptions on this point are evident: (i) it excludes the Interest Tax Shield in setting the remuneration, but (ii) it includes the Interest Tax Shield upon the determination of damages. The selection is highlighted.\n\n78.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal noted that the determination of damages reflected *the 'sensitivities\u2019 to the Effective Tax Rate and regulatory risk assumptions in Brattle\u2019s calculations, as provided in Brattle Table 7 of the Expert\u2019s Joint Memorandum.\"63* When one examines Table 7, it is unquestionable that the Tribunal accepted Brattle\u2019s Effective Tax Rate to determine the pre-tax return of 8.7%.\n\nAward, \u00b6 178.\n\n79.\n\nAs is clear from the above, the Tribunal relied in its determination of damages on Brattle\u2019s option under the Owned IT Code in Joint Table 1. Thus, it stated in paragraph 176 of the Award:\n\n*\"Taking into account that the Tribunal has accepted that: (i) the Effective Tax Rate to apply pre-tax should be 8.7%, (ii) the investment and operating costs to apply to Claimants \u2019 PV Plants should be those of an 'Own IT Code \u2019 as one of the options presented by Brattle; (iii) the Interest Tax Shield should be factored in since Claimants did receive a benefit of deduction of the interest paid under shareholder loans, and further that (iv) the regulatory risk identified is different in the 'But-for\u2019 and the 'Actual\u2019 scenarios, the Tribunal determines that the amount of Reasonable Return Damages should be EUR 18.0 million as accepted by the Experts in Joint Table 1 of the Experts' Joint Memorandum.\"*\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the reference to \"... *(i) the Effective Tax Rate to apply pre-tax should be 8.7%, ...\"* in paragraph 176 needs a slight adjustment to properly reflect its analysis and conclusion. The Tribunal accepted Brattle\u2019s Effective Tax Rate in order to determine the pre-tax return of 8.7%. This is evident not only in recalling Claimants\u2019 position,64 but in the analysis made by the Tribunal of the Effective Tax Rate that is required to reach the pre-tax return.65 Since the Effective Tax rate is utilized to convert a post-tax rate of return to a pre-tax rate of return, the language should be adjusted to *(i) the Effective Tax Rate to determine the pre-tax return should be 8.7%, ...\"* [the underlined is text added by the Tribunal.]. The Tribunal believes that a clarification to this paragraph is also appropriate since it is intimately linked to the language in paragraph 129 of the Award. Likewise, the adjustment does not alter the analysis, or the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.\n\nSee Award, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 114.\n\nSee Award, \u00b6\u00b6 112, 114, 116, 117, 129, 141, 147, 151, 156, 158, 159-161.\n\n81.\n\nIn view of the reasoning carried out by the Tribunal in the Award -as has been discussed above- there is no room to question that the statement made in paragraph 129 of the Award is incorrect, and that it is due to an inadvertent and unfortunate error of the Tribunal. The error can be remedied, as suggested by Claimants, by the simple addition of the word \"not\" so that it reads as follows: *\"The Tribunal therefore concludes that the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should **not** be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax return.\"*\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that to dissipate any doubts and provide further clarity, the sentence could be complemented by adding additional text to the conclusion that logic requires, such as for example: *\"The Tribunal therefore concludes that the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should **not** be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax return, but rather when remuneration is subject to taxes, since this will consider the specific characteristics of each the individual PV Plants.\"* Nevertheless, the Tribunal believes this is unnecessary and would simply create a debate on whether or not such additional language has modified the Award in a manner not permitted under a request for rectification as the ones that have been submitted by the Parties.\n\n83.\n\nThe addition of the simple word \"not\" does not alter the considerations or the conclusions of the Tribunal. The same applies for the inclusion of the words \"to determine\" (instead of \"to apply\") and \"return\" in paragraph 176 of the Award. These simply attempt to *rectify an error* in the language of its own conclusions, which conclusions are properly supported in the Award.\n\nC. **Costs**\n------------\n\n84.\n\nIn neither of their respective Requests for Rectification, or subsequent submissions, did the Parties make any specific request to allocate the costs.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal has broad discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention to allocate costs among the Parties.66\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\"\n\n86.\n\nAdditionally, ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 49(4) read as follows:\n\nRule 47(1)(j): The award shall be in writing and shall contain: \"*any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"*\n\nRule 49(4): *\"Rules 46-48 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to any decision of the Tribunal pursuant to this Rule*.\"\n\n87.\n\nConsidering that both Parties have submitted a Request for Rectification, and each has made subsequent submissions to address the other\u2019s position (Response, Reply and Rejoinder) as per the agreed procedural calendar for this stage of the proceedings, and both have acted not only in good faith, but also with diligence to pursue their respective requests, the Tribunal determines that each Party should bear their own costs, and share equally the costs of this stage of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the ICSID\u2019s administrative fees, and direct expenses.\n\n88.\n\nThe fact that Respondent submitted, as part of its Request for Rectification, a separate Request to Stay Enforcement of the Award does not affect this determination, since the latter request did not alter in any significant manner the process, despite the fact that the Tribunal was required to issue its Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n89.\n\nThe costs of the rectification proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses |\n| Mr. Eduardo Siqueiros T. | USD 12,500.00 |\n| Prof. Peter D.

To accept Claimants\u2019 Request for Rectification of the Award dated 16 June 2023, and consequently rectify the Award as follows:\n\n(A) Adjust paragraph 129 of the Award to read:\n\n*\"The Tribunal therefore concludes that the tax shield benefit of the shareholder loans should not be factored into the conversion of the 7% post-tax target return into a pre-tax return.\"*\n\n(B) Adjust paragraph 176 of the Award to read:\n\n*\"Taking into account that the Tribunal has accepted that: (i) the Effective Tax Rate to determine the pre-tax return should be 8.7%, (ii) the investment and operating costs to apply to Claimants \u2019 PV Plants should be those of an 'Own IT Code \u2019 as one of the options presented by Brattle; (iii) the Interest Tax Shield should be factored in since Claimants did receive a benefit of deduction of the interest paid under shareholder loans, and further that (iv) the regulatory risk identified is different in the 'But-for\u2019 and the 'Actual\u2019 scenarios, the Tribunal determines that the amount of Reasonable Return Damages should be EUR 18.0 million as accepted by the Experts in Joint Table 1 of the Experts \u2019 Joint Memorandum. \"*\n\n(2) .
